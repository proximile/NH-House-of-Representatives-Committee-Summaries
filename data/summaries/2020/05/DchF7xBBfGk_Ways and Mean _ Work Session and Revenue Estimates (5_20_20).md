### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Work Session and Revenue Estimates (May 20, 2020)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on May 20, 2020, for a work session focused on key legislative issues, revenue estimates, and procedural matters. The session, conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, addressed topics ranging from drug enforcement funding and agriculture modernization to revenue management and legislative amendments. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Drug Enforcement Funding and Forfeiture Proceedings**
The committee engaged in a detailed debate on the allocation and transparency of funds from drug forfeiture proceedings. Key points included:
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Representatives expressed frustration over the lack of clear accounting for how drug forfeiture funds are spent, particularly in reimbursing law enforcement for investigation costs and supporting drug treatment programs. There was a strong push for a performance audit to ensure funds are used as intended.
- **Treatment vs. Enforcement**: The discussion highlighted the need to balance funding between law enforcement and treatment programs, especially after the closure of New Hampshire’s only youth residential treatment facility. Some argued for redirecting more funds to treatment to address the ongoing opioid crisis.
- **Proposed Legislation (HB 1563)**: The bill aimed to redirect funds from the drug forfeiture fund, currently administered by the Attorney General’s office, to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for drug treatment programs. Proponents argued this would increase transparency and hold drug traffickers financially responsible for recovery efforts.
- **Concerns and Opposition**: Law enforcement, including the Chiefs of Police, opposed the bill, warning that diverting funds from investigations would deplete the fund and shift the financial burden back to taxpayers. Technical flaws in the amendment, such as conflicting language assigning responsibilities to both the AG’s office and DHHS, were also raised.
- **Next Steps**: A straw poll favored an interim study with a performance audit request, while some suggested refining the bill or considering ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) for a cleaner version in the next term.

### **2. Agriculture Modernization (HB 1627)**
The committee reviewed an agriculture-related bill aimed at modernizing the Department of Agriculture. Key aspects included:
- **Online Registration and Database**: The bill proposed enabling online registration for health certificates and other records to reduce staffing burdens and improve efficiency.
- **Funding Transfers and Reimbursements**: The amendment outlined how funds would be transferred from other agricultural funds to support the database’s development, with a five-year reimbursement plan.
- **Technical Corrections**: Detailed technical corrections were included to address concerns raised by the Office of Legislative Services (OLS), ensuring clarity in funding transfers and reimbursements.
- **Commissioner’s Support**: The Commissioner of Agriculture endorsed the amendment, stating it aligned with the department’s goals and addressed past funding issues.

### **3. Revenue Estimates and Funding Management**
The committee addressed revenue estimates and funding challenges, focusing on transparency and adaptability. Key discussions included:
- **Revenue Estimation Process**: The committee outlined the process for revenue estimates, involving agencies and using an Excel worksheet for tracking. Presentations from departments such as Insurance and the Liquor Commission were scheduled.
- **Dedicated Funds**: Concerns were raised about the management of dedicated funds, such as the Integrated Pest Management Fund and the Agricultural Products Scale Testing Fund. Issues included reimbursements, fee structures, and potential shortfalls.
- **Fee Structures and Sunset Provisions**: Debates centered on adjusting fee structures (e.g., increasing fees from $2 to $3) to ensure sufficient funding. Sunset provisions were proposed for a five-year review period to revisit and adjust policies as needed.
- **Remote Meeting Logistics**: The virtual format posed challenges for voting procedures and public participation. Ideas were proposed to streamline discussions, such as assigning primary spokespersons for each caucus.
