**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Work Session on May 19, 2020**

On May 19, 2020, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee held a virtual work session to discuss **House Bill 1642**, which seeks to **prohibit state agencies and law enforcement from using facial recognition technology** to track individuals. The bill is framed as a protection of privacy rights, aligning with a recent constitutional amendment passed by 80% of New Hampshire voters affirming the right to privacy. The session highlighted the tension between safeguarding individual privacy and enabling law enforcement to use advanced technology to solve crimes, with the committee considering potential amendments to refine the bill.

### Key Points from the Discussion:

1. **Purpose of the Bill**:
   - The bill aims to prevent government entities from using facial recognition software to track individuals, arguing that such surveillance infringes on personal liberty and privacy. 
   - Representative Hopper, the bill's sponsor, compared the issue to historical debates over wiretapping, emphasizing the need to balance security and liberty.

2. **Public Access and Meeting Logistics**:
   - The meeting was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with detailed instructions provided for public participation via Zoom or phone. 
   - Public access and transparency were emphasized, with the meeting subject to adjournment if technical issues prevented public participation.
   - Representatives checked in, reporting their locations and whether they were alone, as required by the right-to-know law.

3. **Privacy vs. Security Debate**:
   - The central debate revolved around the trade-off between privacy rights and the potential for facial recognition to aid law enforcement in solving crimes. 
   - Representatives discussed cases where facial recognition had been used to solve serious crimes, such as kidnappings and sexual assaults, raising concerns about the impact of banning the technology.
   - Concerns were also raised about the technology's reliability, particularly its tendency to misidentify individuals, especially those who are not young, white, or male.

4. **Private vs. Government Use**:
   - The bill only restricts government use of facial recognition, leaving private entities (e.g., Walmart) free to use the technology. 
   - Some representatives questioned whether the bill should also address private use or allow law enforcement to use facial recognition with a warrant.

5. **Potential Amendments**:
   - Several representatives suggested amendments to the bill, including:
     - Allowing law enforcement to use facial recognition with a warrant.
     - Clarifying that the bill does not prohibit the use of photographs or video footage but rather the creation of databases for facial recognition.
     - Ensuring that evidence obtained through facial recognition is not automatically deemed inadmissible in court.

6. **Constitutional Context**:
   - The bill is seen as a legislative effort to define the right to privacy established by the recent constitutional amendment, rather than leaving it to the courts to interpret.

7. **Privacy and Database Concerns**:
   - The bill seeks to prevent law enforcement from maintaining a database of facial recognition images, which could contain sensitive personal information like names, addresses, and social security numbers. 
   - The bill does not prohibit the use of photos for identification by individuals or police but restricts the use of automated systems to match photos against large databases.

8. **Accuracy and Reliability**:
   - There was significant debate over the accuracy of facial recognition technology, with concerns about high rates of false positives and false negatives, particularly for people of color, older individuals, and those with altered appearances (e.g., beards, glasses). 
   - Some argued that humans are currently better at facial recognition than machines, though this may change as technology improves.

9. **Law Enforcement Exemptions**:
   - The bill specifically exempts law enforcement cooperation with federal agencies that use facial recognition, allowing for the sharing of photos in cases like robberies or other crimes. 
   - However, it prohibits New Hampshire law enforcement from maintaining their own facial recognition databases.

10. **Prohibition vs. Regulation**:
    - Some committee members argued for starting with a prohibition on facial recognition technology and then creating exceptions on a case-by-case basis, such as for locating missing children. 
    - Others felt that an outright ban was premature and that the technology could be regulated effectively without a blanket prohibition.

11. **Legal and Ethical Concerns**:
    - The discussion touched on the broader implications of facial recognition technology on civil liberties, with comparisons to post-9/11 measures like the Patriot Act. 
    - There were concerns about the potential for abuse and the erosion of privacy rights, especially in a time of crisis.

12. **Subcommittee Input**:
    - Representatives from the subcommittee that initially reviewed the bill provided additional context, highlighting concerns about the technology's accuracy and the potential for misuse by government entities.

13. **Legislative Process and Next Steps**:
    - The committee struggled with the logistics of the discussion due to the challenges of remote meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
    - There was no consensus on how to proceed, with some members advocating for further work on the bill and others suggesting it should be tabled or studied further.
    - The committee decided to adjourn the work session and reconvene on May 28th for an executive session. Members were encouraged to work on potential amendments in the interim, with the goal of finding a narrow, acceptable approach to regulating facial recognition technology.

### Closing Remarks:
The committee chair acknowledged the complexity of the issue and expressed openness to amendments to address the concerns raised during the discussion. The meeting reflected deep divisions on the issue, with some members prioritizing privacy and civil liberties, while others emphasized the potential benefits of facial recognition technology for law enforcement and public safety. The committee ultimately left the door open for further discussion and potential amendments.
