### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (May 27, 2020 - Morning Session)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened electronically on May 27, 2020, to discuss revenue estimates and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting, held under the state of emergency, was accessible to the public via Zoom and telephone. The committee addressed the severe economic challenges posed by the pandemic, focusing on revenue declines, recovery projections, and the implications of federal and state policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed across all segments:

---

#### **1. Economic Context and Revenue Decline**
- **Unprecedented Economic Shock**: The pandemic caused a swift and massive economic shock, disproportionately affecting low-income households. New Hampshire’s unemployment rate surged to 16.3% in April 2020, higher than the national average and most other New England states. Initial unemployment claims peaked at 39,000 in early April, with significant impacts on industries like food service, retail, and healthcare.
- **Revenue Shortfalls**: Tax revenues plummeted, particularly from meals and rentals, with April receipts down 40% compared to the previous year. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of GDP, contracted by 7.5% from February to March, further straining economic recovery.
- **Historical Comparison**: The committee drew parallels to the 2007-2009 Great Recession, noting that wage growth for lower and median earners remained stagnant until 2015. This history suggests that recovery from the current crisis could be prolonged, especially if public health measures continue to restrict economic activity.

#### **2. Recovery Projections and Federal Debt**
- **Recovery Scenarios**: The committee debated the likelihood of a V-shaped versus U-shaped recovery. While federal and state policies aimed at maintaining income supports and employer-employee connections could promote faster recovery, the pace will depend on public health developments, including vaccine availability.
- **Federal Debt Concerns**: Low federal interest rates have made borrowing cheaper, aiding economic recovery. However, long-term debt concerns remain, though the immediate impact is uncertain. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections already account for recent federal stimulus measures, but high unemployment and reduced consumer spending are expected to persist into 2021.

#### **3. Revenue Estimates by Tax Category**
- **Meals and Rentals Tax**: Fast food and chain restaurants performed better than expected, but overall revenue is projected to underperform by $46.9 million in FY2020 and $63.7 million in FY2021 due to reduced economic activity.
- **Tobacco Tax**: Revenue is 2.9% ahead of plan for FY2020, driven by stockpiling in March. Cross-border sales may increase due to Massachusetts’ ban on menthol cigarettes starting June 1, 2020.
- **Interest and Dividends Tax**: FY2020 revenue was reduced by 4% to account for COVID-19 impacts, with deferred payments expected to boost May and June receipts. A 25% reduction in income is assumed through December 2020, with a 10% reduction in early 2021.
- **Communication Services Tax (CST)**: Revenue was 3% ahead of plan in April due to increased video conferencing usage. A 10% reduction is projected for May, with normalization expected by January 2021.
- **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: May revenue was 17% below plan, with a 60% reduction anticipated for June. Low mortgage rates and easing stay-at-home orders may help stabilize the market, but high unemployment could delay recovery.
- **Business Taxes**: Revenue is expected to decrease by 2.5% in FY2020 and 2.3% in FY2021. Deferred payments and the impact of federal programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) were discussed, with the net effect on state revenues still uncertain.
- **Utility Property Taxes**: These taxes have not yet been significantly affected due to the lag in assessments, but the full impact of the pandemic may become apparent later in 2020 or early 2021.

#### **4. Household Financial Health and Economic Stress**
- **Income and Savings**: Many households, particularly low and middle-income families, entered the crisis with limited savings. A significant portion of New Hampshire households earn $35,000 or less annually, with many spending over 30% of their income on rent.
- **Revenue Impact of Unemployment**: A 1% increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 3.7% reduction in state tax revenues per capita. The committee discussed the potential revenue impact for New Hampshire, noting that the state’s unique tax system and industry mix may affect these estimates.

---

#### **5. Second Wave Concerns and Future Adjustments**
- **Second Wave Uncertainty**: The committee considered the potential impact of a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall, acknowledging the uncertainty but suggesting that data from May and June would help model future scenarios.
- **Ongoing Analysis**: The committee emphasized the need for flexibility and ongoing analysis as more data becomes available, particularly after June 2020, when many deferred tax payments are expected to be made.

---

#### **6. Policy and Recovery Measures**
- **Federal Programs**: The committee discussed the role of federal stimulus programs, such as extended unemployment benefits and the PPP, in mitigating the economic impact of COVID-19. While these programs may aid recovery, their direct impact on state tax revenues remains uncertain.
- **State-Level Adjustments**: The committee highlighted the importance of state-level policies to support economic recovery, including leveraging low borrowing costs and addressing cross-border sales impacts.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the severe economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant revenue declines and uncertainty about the pace of recovery. The committee emphasized the need for ongoing fiscal and policy support, flexibility in revenue forecasting, and close monitoring of public health developments. While federal programs provide critical relief, the long-term economic impact will depend on the interplay between public health measures, consumer behavior, and policy responses.
