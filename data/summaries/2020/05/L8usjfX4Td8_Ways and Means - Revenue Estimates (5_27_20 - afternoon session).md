### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (May 27, 2020 - Afternoon Session)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on May 27, 2020, to discuss revenue estimates and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across various sectors. The meeting highlighted the challenges posed by the pandemic, strategies for financial recovery, and the need for adaptive planning. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

#### **1. Revenue Estimates and Economic Impact**
The committee reviewed revenue projections for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, noting significant declines across multiple sectors due to the pandemic. Key areas of concern included:

- **Transportation Revenue**: Road toll revenue dropped by 50% at the peak of the pandemic, with gradual recovery expected. DMV transactions also declined, though online services helped mitigate losses.
- **Judicial System**: Courts faced reduced activity due to limited in-person hearings and postponed cases, leading to anticipated revenue declines from fines and fees.
- **Interest Rates and Treasury**: The Treasury Department reported a sharp decline in interest income due to lowered federal interest rates, impacting surplus funds and restricted cash balances.
- **Lottery Revenue**: Lottery sales were mixed, with draw games like Powerball and Mega Millions declining by 40%, while scratch ticket sales surged by 23%. Sports betting and charitable gambling saw significant drops.
- **Liquor Sales**: Retail liquor sales increased by 5.2%, driven by consumer purchases at outlets, but sales to restaurants remained low. The Liquor Commission revised revenue estimates downward due to delays in property sales.
- **Beer Tax**: Revenue from the beer tax declined due to reduced sales in the restaurant sector.

#### **2. Business Closures and Reopening Challenges**
Local business leaders provided updates on the state of the economy:

- **Restaurants and Lodging**: Restaurants faced challenges with outdoor dining due to weather and limited capacity. The lodging industry struggled with minimal occupancy and layoffs, as tourism remained slow.
- **Retail**: Retailers experienced reduced foot traffic, with consumers shifting to online shopping. Small businesses, particularly boutiques, faced significant challenges.
- **Federal Aid**: While businesses received federal aid like PPP loans, many found the funds insufficient to cover lost revenue, raising concerns about potential closures in the coming months.
- **Consumer Confidence**: The potential end of the extra $600 unemployment benefit in July could further reduce consumer spending, impacting businesses.

#### **3. Strategic Adjustments and Efficiency Measures**
The committee emphasized the need for strategic planning to maintain revenue levels and improve efficiency:

- **Liquor Commission**: Phased reopening of state liquor stores with reduced hours and potential consolidations were discussed to improve efficiency.
- **Competition**: The Liquor Commission addressed competition from Total Wine & Spirits, noting that New Hampshire maintained competitive pricing despite initial price undercutting.
- **Employee Compensation**: The Liquor Commission offered a 10% hourly wage increase to sales employees during the pandemic, which had a positive impact on sales.

#### **4. Tourism and Cultural Venues**
Tourism and cultural venues were highlighted as critical to the state’s economy:

- **Tourism**: The importance of maintaining the travel and tourism budget was emphasized to attract visitors once it is safe. The New Hampshire Travel Council’s role in promoting the state was noted, with a focus on the significant return on investment from advertising dollars.
- **Cultural Venues**: The closure of theaters, opera houses, and other cultural venues had a ripple effect on local businesses, such as restaurants that rely on pre- and post-show traffic. Many venues, often nonprofits, faced financial difficulties due to canceled events and reduced donations.

#### **6. Economic Recovery and Consumer Behavior**
The committee expressed cautious optimism about economic recovery but highlighted concerns:

- **Long-Term Impact**: Comparisons were made to the 2008 recession, with expectations of a slower rebound due to unemployment and reduced consumer activity.
