### Comprehensive Summary of NH House Judiciary Committee Executive Session on House Bill 1642 (5/28/20)

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened an executive session on May 28, 2020, to discuss **House Bill 1642**, which addresses the regulation of **facial recognition technology**. The session was held virtually due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The committee focused on a proposed amendment to the bill, debated its implications, and ultimately voted on its fate. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the discussion:

---

#### **Overview of House Bill 1642**
The original bill proposed a **ban on the use of facial recognition technology** in New Hampshire. However, **Amendment 1255**, introduced by Representative Harper, sought to modify the bill by allowing the technology’s use under strict conditions, including a **search warrant requirement** for law enforcement. The amendment aimed to balance the technology’s potential benefits (e.g., locating missing children, identifying criminals) with concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and misuse.

#### **Key Points of Debate**

1. **Amendment 1255**:
   - The amendment would permit the use of facial recognition technology but require law enforcement to obtain a **warrant based on probable cause**.
   - It also restricted the use of facial recognition on the **Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database**, which contains sensitive personal information.
   - Supporters viewed the amendment as a significant improvement over the original ban, introducing safeguards against potential abuse.
   - Opponents argued that the warrant requirement could hinder law enforcement’s ability to use the technology effectively, particularly in urgent cases such as child exploitation or human trafficking.

2. **Concerns About Facial Recognition**:
   - Members expressed concerns about the **misuse of facial recognition technology**, including the risk of creating a "police state," violating privacy, and eroding civil liberties.
   - Some, like Representative Burch, argued that the warrant requirement could effectively function as a ban, as facial recognition often helps establish probable cause in the first place.
   - Others, like Representative Griffin, raised concerns about the **vagueness of terms** such as "sufficiently attenuated," which could create legal ambiguities and complicate prosecutions.

3. **Law Enforcement and Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - Supporters of the bill emphasized the importance of facial recognition in **identifying victims of crimes**, such as child exploitation and human trafficking.
   - Critics, including Representative Altschiller, highlighted the lack of input from key stakeholders, such as law enforcement, crime victim advocates, and technology experts, in drafting the amendment.
   - Several members, including Representative Horrigan, called for broader stakeholder engagement to ensure the bill balanced public safety with individual rights.

4. **Broader Societal Implications**:
   - Members debated the **ethical use of technology**, the balance between law enforcement powers and civil liberties, and the potential for future legislation to address these issues more comprehensively.
   - Representative Woodbury supported the amendment but noted that the broader issue of surveillance and camera use required more comprehensive regulation.

#### **Committee Vote and Outcome**
- The committee voted on **Amendment 1255**, which failed with **9 in favor and 11 against**.
- Following the amendment’s defeat, the committee voted to recommend the bill as **"Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL)**, effectively killing it for the session. The ITL motion passed **12 to 7**, with one abstention.

---

#### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The committee recognized the amendment as a step forward but concluded that it was not yet ready for final approval due to unresolved concerns about its practical implications, particularly for law enforcement and legal proceedings. Members agreed that further work and stakeholder engagement were needed to refine the legislation. The session ended with procedural discussions about filing committee reports and the possibility of revisiting the topic in future legislative sessions. The chair thanked members for their work and expressed hope for continued collaboration on this complex issue.
