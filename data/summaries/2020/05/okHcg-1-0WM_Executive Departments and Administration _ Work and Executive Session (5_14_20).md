**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee Work and Executive Session (May 14, 2020)**

On May 14, 2020, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee held a virtual work and executive session via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The session focused on several bills aimed at improving food safety, daycare monitoring, and transparency, while addressing procedural and technical challenges. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **1. Wild Mushroom Harvesting and Food Safety (HB 1692)**  
**Purpose**:  
- To establish a licensing program for wild mushroom harvesters, distributors, and identifiers, ensuring compliance with the 2017 FDA Food Code and preventing the sale of misidentified or poisonous mushrooms in restaurants, grocery stores, and farmers' markets.  

**Amendment Details**:  
- Corrected drafting errors, removed the definition of "commodity" in the partner rule, and clarified the licensing process and responsibilities of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  

**Key Concerns**:  
- **Cost and Implementation**: Indeterminable costs and staffing requirements for DHHS raised concerns, especially with the January 1, 2021, implementation deadline. A six-month extension was suggested to allow adequate program development.  
- **Fine Schedule**: Some members questioned DHHS's authority to set a fine schedule, suggesting the bill specify maximum fines.  
- **Definitions and Scope**: Questions arose about the definitions of "wild mushrooms" and the roles of distributors and identifiers.  
- **Necessity**: Some members questioned the bill's necessity, as no cases of wild mushroom poisoning were reported in New Hampshire.  

**Public Safety and Compliance**:  
- The bill aligns with the FDA Food Code, which requires regulatory approval for wild mushrooms served in food establishments. Without the program, New Hampshire restaurants cannot legally serve locally sourced wild mushrooms.  
- A tiered licensing system was proposed:  
  - **Tier 1**: Easily identifiable mushrooms with no toxic look-alikes.  
  - **Tier 2**: Mushrooms requiring expert identification due to potential toxicity.  

**Next Steps**:  
- The committee considered additional amendments, including extending the implementation deadline and specifying fine limits.

#### **2. Supervised Visitation Centers and Food Safety (HB 702)**  
**Purpose**:  
- To address requirements for supervised visitation centers, focusing on safety and compliance with guidelines.  

**Key Concerns**:  
- Concerns were raised about the enforceability of the bill and its potential fiscal impacts on municipalities and agencies.  

**Outcome**:  
- The committee voted 17-3 in favor of passing the bill, with some members expressing reservations about its effectiveness and fiscal implications.

#### **3. Daycare Monitoring and Transparency (HB 1710)**  
**Purpose**:  
- To increase transparency in daycare monitoring by delaying the posting of findings online until after disputes are resolved.  

**Key Points**:  
- The committee emphasized the importance of protecting daycare centers' reputations while ensuring public safety.  

**Outcome**:  
- The bill was passed unanimously (22-0), with members agreeing it was a step toward fairness and transparency.

#### **4. Daycare Grievance Process (HB 1712)**  
**Purpose**:  
- To extend the time daycare centers have to respond to grievances and participate in dispute resolutions.  

**Key Points**:  
- The bill was seen as a temporary measure until a study committee on the grievance process completes its work.  

**Outcome**:  
- Passed unanimously (22-0) and placed on the consent calendar.

### **Procedural and Technical Discussions**

The committee worked collaboratively to address technical challenges and ensure the session was conducted effectively during the pandemic.
