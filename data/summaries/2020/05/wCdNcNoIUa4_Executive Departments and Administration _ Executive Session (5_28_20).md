The transcript details an executive session of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee, held on May 28, 2020, via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The primary focus was on **House Bill 1692**, which aims to legalize the sale of wild mushrooms in New Hampshire, subject to licensing and safety regulations.

Key points discussed include:

1. **Bill Overview**: The bill allows licensed individuals to harvest and sell wild mushrooms to restaurants, grocery stores, and farmers' markets. It requires harvesters to complete a training course and pass a test to ensure the mushrooms are safe for consumption.

2. **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced, changing the effective date to July 1, 2021, to allow the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) time to implement the licensing program within their budget.

3. **Support and Opposition**:
   - Supporters argued the bill creates economic opportunities, ensures public safety, and aligns with federal food safety regulations. HHS and the restaurant industry expressed support.
   - Opponents, including Representatives Bowden and McGuire, criticized the bill as unnecessary overregulation, citing minimal risks of mushroom poisoning and excessive penalties ($1,000 per violation).

4. **Landowner Protections**: The bill includes provisions requiring harvesters to obtain landowner permission before harvesting mushrooms on private property.

5. **Out-of-State Harvesters**: The bill allows New Hampshire restaurants to purchase mushrooms from out-of-state sources if they are approved by that stateâ€™s regulatory authority.

6. **Vote**: The committee voted **15-4** in favor of passing the bill with the amendment.

The session concluded with plans to reconvene on June 11, 2020.
