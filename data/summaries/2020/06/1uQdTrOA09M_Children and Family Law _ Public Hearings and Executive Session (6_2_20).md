**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Children and Family Law Public Hearings and Executive Session (6/2/20)**

On June 2, 2020, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee held a virtual meeting to address key legislative issues related to child welfare, family law, and veterans' rights. The meeting included public hearings and an executive session, focusing on **House Bill 1716**, **House Bill 362**, and **Senate Bill 295**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Veterans' Disability Compensation and Child Support (HB 1716 and HB 362)**

1. **Key Issues**:
   - Disabled veterans testified about the financial and emotional challenges they face due to the inclusion of veterans' disability compensation in child support calculations.
   - Veterans argued that federal law (IM 98-03 and 38 USC 5301a) protects their disability benefits from being treated as income for child support, but New Hampshire courts often disregard these protections.
   - This practice has led to significant financial hardship, homelessness, and even mental health struggles among veterans, who are left with insufficient funds to support themselves or their children during custody periods.

2. **Legislative Proposals**:
   - **HB 1716** and **HB 362** aimed to align state law with federal regulations, excluding veterans' disability compensation from child support calculations.
   - Proponents, including Representative Al Baldasaro and veteran advocates, emphasized the need to prevent homelessness and ensure compliance with federal law.
   - Opponents, such as the NH Bureau of Child Support Services and some custodial parents, argued that excluding these payments could harm children and increase reliance on state assistance programs.

3. **Opposition Concerns**:
   - **Tim Frasier** of the NH Bureau of Child Support Services warned that excluding veterans' disability benefits would violate federal child support guidelines, potentially jeopardizing federal funding.
   - Custodial parents, like Mora Ryan, shared personal struggles with the apportionment process, highlighting delays and unfairness in securing child support.

4. **Committee Discussions**:
   - Committee members acknowledged the complexity of balancing veterans' rights with child support needs.
   - Veterans and advocates called for legislative action to address systemic issues, while opponents stressed the importance of ensuring adequate support for children.

5. **Outcome**:
   - **HB 1716** was moved for interim study, reflecting the committee's need for further review.
   - **HB 362** remained under consideration, with advocates urging its passage to protect veterans.

### **Office of the Child Advocate (SB 295)**

1. **Key Provisions**:
   - **SB 295** sought to expand the jurisdiction and independence of the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA), enabling it to oversee a broader range of state agencies serving children.
   - The bill aimed to establish an oversight commission and clarify the OCA’s authority to investigate and make recommendations across systems like child welfare, mental health, and juvenile justice.

2. **Support for the Bill**:
   - Advocates, including Ken Norton of NAMI New Hampshire and the OCA’s first director, Dr. O’Neal, emphasized the OCA’s role in addressing systemic gaps and improving outcomes for vulnerable children.
   - Supporters highlighted the need for cross-system collaboration and independence to ensure accountability and transparency.

3. **Concerns and Opposition**:
   - The Attorney General’s office, represented by Associate Attorney General James Buffetti, raised concerns about the OCA’s potential lack of accountability, arguing that broad independence could undermine checks and balances.
   - Buffetti suggested revising the bill to preserve independence while maintaining oversight by state officials.

4. **COVID-19 Impact**:
   - The pandemic underscored the need for expanded OCA jurisdiction, as current limitations prevent the office from assisting children in certain residential programs or mental health crises unless they are involved with DCYF.

5. **Outcome**:
   - The bill passed with overwhelming support (18-2), though a minority report was submitted by Representative Camarota, who advocated for an interim study to address unresolved concerns.

2. **Child Welfare Oversight**:
   - **SB 295** reflected a broader effort to strengthen the OCA’s role in improving child welfare systems, with supporters advocating for independence and expanded jurisdiction.
   - Concerns about accountability and oversight were addressed, but the bill ultimately moved forward with strong support.

3. **Legislative Review and Next Steps**:
   - The committee acknowledged the complexity of these issues, particularly in light of shared parenting, veterans' unique circumstances, and the pandemic’s impact on child welfare.
   - Interim studies and further review were proposed to address unresolved concerns and ensure balanced, effective legislation.
