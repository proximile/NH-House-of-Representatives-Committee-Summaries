**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (6/9/20): Public Hearings and Executive Sessions**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on June 9, 2020, to address key legislative proposals and issues related to education policy, focusing on **Senate Joint Resolution 1** and **Senate Bill 514**. The meeting centered on the State Board of Education’s authority to adopt rules for alternative programs granting graduation credits, Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs), and the "Learn Everywhere" initiative. The discussions highlighted tensions between state authority and local control, competency-based learning, and equity in educational resources.

### **Key Issues and Discussions**

#### **Senate Joint Resolution 1**
**Purpose**: The resolution sought to clarify the State Board of Education’s rulemaking authority under RSA 193-E, particularly regarding the "Learn Everywhere" program (EDY 1400). It addressed concerns raised by the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) that the Board’s rules exceeded statutory authority by mandating school districts to accept credits from State Board-approved alternative programs.

**Key Points**:
- **Senator Jay Kahn**, the resolution’s prime sponsor, explained that JLCAR had objected to the Board’s rules, arguing they conflicted with legislative intent by bypassing local district authority.
- **Representative William Hatch**, JLCAR chair, emphasized that JLCAR’s objections were based on statutory interpretation, and joint resolutions like this are rare and reserved for significant disputes.
- **Commissioner Frank Edelblut** defended the Board’s actions, stating the rules were developed in response to a legislative mandate and were consistent with RSA 193-E. He urged the committee to review the extensive documentation supporting the Board’s position.
- The debate centered on whether the Board’s rules aligned with legislative intent, the process for resolving rulemaking disputes, and the impact on local control of education.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 11-8 to recommend the resolution **not pass**. A minority report will be prepared by Representative Ladd and others who supported the resolution.

#### **Senate Bill 514**
**Purpose**: The bill clarified that local school districts retain control over whether to accept credits from programs approved under the "Learn Everywhere" initiative, rather than being mandated to accept them. It aimed to balance state oversight with local autonomy.

**Key Points**:
- Supporters argued the bill expands access to ELOs while preserving local control, allowing districts to decide what credits align with their graduation requirements.
- Critics raised concerns about the lack of clarity in rulemaking, potential confusion, and the erosion of local oversight, particularly regarding program quality and student safety.
- **Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs)**: Stakeholders emphasized the importance of school oversight in ELOs to ensure student success, mentorship, and safety. Concerns were raised about the low adoption rate of ELOs (2% statewide), attributed to insufficient funding and resources.
- **"Learn Everywhere" Program**: Critics argued the program bypasses school oversight, potentially leading to issues with program quality and student safety. Supporters viewed it as a way to expand educational opportunities.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 11-7 to recommend the bill **ought to pass**, sending it to the full House for further consideration.

#### **Additional Discussions**
- **Equity and Funding**: Concerns were raised about disparities in resources among school districts, particularly underfunded schools’ ability to offer alternative programs. Senator Kahn suggested reallocating resources to support these schools.
- **Competency-Based Learning**: Supporters of alternative programs emphasized the importance of competency-based learning and flexibility in student education.
- **Procedural Updates**: The meeting included logistical updates, reminders about future committee activities, and brief discussions on related House bills, such as extending special education services and providing tuition-free access to public higher education for children of permanently disabled veterans.

### **Themes and Takeaways**
- **Local Control vs. State Authority**: A recurring theme was the tension between local school districts’ autonomy and the State Board’s rulemaking authority, particularly in the context of alternative programs like "Learn Everywhere."
- **Competency-Based Learning**: The discussions underscored the importance of competency-based learning and the need for flexible educational pathways.
- **Equity and Resource Allocation**: Concerns about equity and the need to support underfunded schools were central to the debate, highlighting the challenges of expanding access to alternative programs while ensuring quality and oversight.

The meeting reflected ongoing debates in New Hampshire about education policy, the role of the State Board of Education, and the balance between innovation and accountability in alternative learning programs. The committee’s decisions on Senate Joint Resolution 1 and Senate Bill 514 will shape the future of these initiatives and their implementation across the state.
