**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Rules Committee Meeting (6/3/20)**

On June 3, 2020, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Rules Committee convened remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing a range of legislative and procedural matters. The meeting highlighted both bipartisan cooperation and divisions on key issues, particularly those related to economic relief and legislative processes during the pandemic.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Business Tax Rate Debate**:
   - **Proposal to Prevent Tax Increase**: Representative Dick Hinch advocated for immediate action to stop a scheduled 12.5% increase in the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) rate, set to take effect on January 1, 2021. He argued that the increase would disproportionately burden small businesses during the pandemic and economic recovery.
   - **Opposing Views**: Representative Lay and others countered that the tax increase trigger was included in the September 2019 budget for serious economic circumstances. They suggested waiting until December 2020 for more financial data before making changes.
   - **Outcome**: The motion to allow late drafting of a bill to address the tax increase failed 4-6, and a subsequent motion to declare the request "inexpedient to legislate" passed 6-4.

2. **Growler Bill**:
   - **Proposal for Emergency Beer Sales**: Representative Andrew Prout introduced a late-drafting request for a bill to allow restaurants to sell beer in growlers (refillable containers) during state emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure aimed to help restaurants avoid losses from spoiled keg beer during shutdowns.
   - **Labeling Flexibility**: The bill also proposed flexibility for restaurants to fill growlers with beer different from the label on the container.
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously supported the late drafting of the bill (10-0), recognizing its potential to assist struggling restaurants and breweries.

3. **Procedural and Rule Changes**:
   - **Remote Meeting Authorization**: The meeting was conducted under the governor's emergency order, with public access provided via Zoom, phone, and other electronic means.
   - **Approval of Minutes**: The committee approved the minutes from a previous meeting on February 18, 2020, with an 8-0 vote.
   - **Amendment to House Rule 65a**: Representative Shurtleff proposed an amendment to House Rule 65a, setting deadlines for acting on House and Senate bills. The amendment passed with a 5-4 vote after debate, with concerns raised about the expedited process and lack of bipartisan input.
   - **Constitutional Amendment Proposal**: Representative Shurtleff requested late drafting for a constitutional amendment (CACR) to allow the House to meet remotely during emergencies. The motion passed 6-4, though concerns were voiced about rushing such a significant change without thorough public input.

4. **Public Access Concerns**:
   - Representative Baldasaro raised concerns about public participation in remote hearings, highlighting challenges for individuals without access to technology.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the challenges and opportunities of legislative work during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there was bipartisan support for measures like the growler bill to assist businesses, divisions emerged over the urgency of addressing the business tax rate increase and the expedited process for rule changes. The discussions also highlighted the importance of ensuring public access and transparency in remote legislative proceedings.
