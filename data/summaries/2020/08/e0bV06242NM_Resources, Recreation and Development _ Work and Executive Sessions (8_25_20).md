#### **House Bill 1426 (HB 1426): Rail Trails and OHRV Use**
- **Overview**: HB 1426 initially required OHRV clubs to conduct environmental tests (e.g., for toxic substances, dust, and noise) on rail trails to establish guidelines for their use. Concerns were raised about the impact of OHRVs on rail trails, including fugitive dust, vegetation damage, and health risks.
- **Discussion**:
  - The committee agreed the bill was too narrow in scope, as rail trails are used by various groups (e.g., electric bikes, horses), not just OHRVs.
  - Representative Thomas proposed dropping the bill and replacing it with broader legislation to establish **best practices for rail trail management**, similar to Massachusetts' approach.
  - The committee recommended forming a legislative study committee to investigate hazardous materials, remediation costs, and best management practices for rail trails.
- **Outcome**: The motion to recommend HB 1426 for future legislation passed unanimously (17-0), with a focus on further study and comprehensive solutions.

#### **House Bill 1316 (HB 1316): OHRV Trails ("Ride the Wilds")**
- **Overview**: HB 1316 aimed to bypass existing state land evaluation processes for OHRV trails, specifically targeting the Nash Stream Forest. The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources opposed the bill, arguing it would circumvent established procedures for evaluating trail suitability.
- **Discussion**:
  - Concerns were raised about the bill undermining the Nash Stream Forest management plan, which had already rejected OHRV trail proposals.
  - An amendment related to Hoyt Pond (for ice racing) was discussed, though it was not formally adopted. Members expressed frustration that the amendment had been added without proper public input or vetting.
  - The committee debated whether to recommend the bill for future legislation, with most members leaning toward **not recommending** it due to insufficient study and the need for proper processes.
  - Some members suggested addressing the Hoyt Pond issue separately in future legislation.
- **Outcome**: The motion to not recommend HB 1316 for future legislation passed unanimously (17-0), emphasizing the importance of adhering to established procedures and further study.
