The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held a remote work and executive session on September 15, 2020, due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on reviewing several bills referred for interim study and determining whether to recommend them for future legislation. Key points from the session include:

1. **Procedural Opening**: The acting chair confirmed the meeting was authorized under the governor’s emergency order and provided public access via Zoom and phone. Roll call attendance was taken, and quorum was established.

2. **House Bill 306 (Prohibiting Destruction of Sexual Assault Evidence Kits)**: The committee debated the necessity of preserving rape kits indefinitely, especially in light of unresolved issues like statute of limitations for sexual assault. Concerns were raised about storage burdens on police departments. The committee voted to recommend future legislation, pending the results of an ongoing Department of Justice audit.

3. **House Bill 722 (Retail Sale and Taxation of Marijuana)**: The bill was discussed, with concerns about its impact on youth and the lack of stakeholder input during hearings. The committee voted to recommend further study, acknowledging the potential for future legislative action given neighboring states' legalization of marijuana.

4. **House Bill 1159 (Cyberbullying, Cyberstalking, and Doxxing of Public Servants)**: Concerns about First Amendment issues and existing laws covering criminal threatening were raised. The committee voted not to recommend the bill for future legislation.

5. **House Bill 1283 (Prohibiting Online Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information)**: Similar to HB 1159, concerns about First Amendment rights and media freedoms were discussed. The committee voted not to recommend the bill for future legislation.

6. **House Bill 1586 (Statute of Limitations for Sexual Assault)**: The committee discussed the importance of extending or eliminating the statute of limitations for sexual assault, citing victims' difficulties in coming forward. The bill was recommended for future legislation.

7. **House Bill 1663 (Legalization and Regulation of Cannabis)**: The committee debated the fiscal implications of legalizing cannabis, given the state’s budget shortfall. While some members supported it as a revenue source, others opposed it due to federal illegality and potential youth impact. The committee voted to recommend future legislation.

8. **Executive Session**: The committee transitioned into an executive session to finalize recommendations and votes on the bills.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgments and well-wishes, as it was the chair’s final session with the legislature.
