**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Work and Executive Sessions (September 1, 2020)**

On September 1, 2020, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee held a work and executive session to discuss several bills. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the committee debated the merits of each bill, with some expressing concerns about consumer protection and others questioning the need for additional legislation. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Bills Discussed and Outcomes**

1. **HB 405 (Beer and Refillable Growlers)**  
   This bill aimed to allow refillable growlers (beer containers) to be filled by entities other than the original brewer. While the bill had previously passed the House with strong support, it faced opposition in the Senate, primarily from small brewers who feared losing revenue. After extensive discussion, the committee voted **6-9** against recommending the bill for future legislation.

2. **HB 1300 (Specialty Cider Definition)**  
   This bill addressed the definition of specialty cider and alcohol content regulations. The sponsor noted that recent legislation had resolved the primary issue, making the bill unnecessary. The committee unanimously voted **15-0** not to recommend it for future legislation.

3. **HB 613 (Mandatory Automobile Insurance)**  
   The bill sought to mandate auto insurance in New Hampshire, the only state without such a requirement. While some members supported the bill to protect consumers, others argued that mandatory insurance would not solve the issue of uninsured motorists, as many would only purchase the minimum coverage. The committee voted **8-7** not to recommend the bill for future legislation.

4. **HB 1320 (Renter’s Insurance Notification)**  
   This bill proposed requiring landlords to notify tenants that their property is not covered under the landlord's insurance policy. Supporters argued it would protect renters, while opponents felt it was unnecessary and more of an educational issue than a legislative one. The committee later revisited this bill, proposing a general disclosure sheet for landlords and renters. However, concerns were raised about enforceability and the appropriateness of legislation for this issue. The committee ultimately voted **12-3** not to recommend the bill.

5. **HB 1464 (Insurance Coverage for Yoga Therapy)**  
   This bill aimed to provide insurance coverage for yoga therapy as an alternative to opioids. While the committee acknowledged the benefits of yoga and alternative therapies, they felt the bill was not ready for legislation due to a lack of comprehensive understanding and certification standards. The committee voted **14-1** not to recommend the bill.

6. **HB 1697 (Prohibition of Prescription Drug Discount Programs)**  
   This bill sought to prohibit prescription drug discount programs. The committee decided to pause on this issue, noting that recent legislation (House Bill 1280) had already addressed reducing prescription drug costs. They voted **15-0** not to recommend the bill.

7. **HB 1215 (Solar Energy Systems in Condominiums and HOAs)**  
   This bill proposed allowing the installation of solar energy systems in condominiums and homeowners associations with a simple majority vote. Concerns were raised about shared spaces, enforcement, and the potential for conflicts among residents. The committee voted **14-0** not to recommend the bill, citing the need for further study and refinement.

### **Key Themes and Committee Concerns**  
Throughout the session, the committee emphasized the importance of:  
- **Education and Awareness:** Many bills, such as HB 1320 and HB 1464, were seen as issues better addressed through education rather than legislation.  
- **Enforcement Mechanisms:** Questions about enforceability were raised, particularly for bills like HB 1320.  
- **Need for Further Study:** Bills like HB 1215 and HB 1464 were deemed to require more comprehensive understanding and refinement before advancing.  
- **Avoiding Redundancy:** The committee often noted that recent legislation had already addressed the issues raised in bills like HB 1300 and HB 1697.

### **Conclusion**  
The session highlighted the complexities of addressing issues such as consumer protection, alternative therapies, and renewable energy in shared living spaces. The committee demonstrated a cautious approach, prioritizing education, enforcement, and thorough study over immediate legislative action. The discussions underscored the challenges of balancing consumer needs with practical and enforceable solutions. The committee will continue reviewing additional bills in subsequent sessions.
