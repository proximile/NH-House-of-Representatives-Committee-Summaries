The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee held a work and executive session on September 3, 2020, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Public access was provided via Zoom and phone, and procedural rules were strictly followed, including roll call votes and disclosures of members' locations. The session focused on several bills, with key discussions and decisions summarized below:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1610 (Pharmaceutical Drug Take Back Program)**:
   - The bill proposed establishing a manufacturer-funded drug take-back program.
   - Concerns were raised about the financial burden on the state, particularly the need for three new full-time employees within the Department of Health and Human Services, and the existing drug take-back program.
   - The committee voted unanimously (19-0) in both the work and executive sessions to recommend no further legislative action on the bill.

2. **House Bill 1616 (Age for Minors’ Visits to Mental Health Practitioners)**:
   - This bill, which would allow minors aged 12 and older to seek mental health treatment without parental consent, sparked significant debate.
   - Representative Shapiro initially opposed the bill but became open to it after reviewing research from other states. However, concerns were raised about the age of consent, confidentiality, payment issues, and the lack of clarity on temporary treatment.
   - The committee voted 11-8 to recommend further legislation, with the expectation that the bill would return in a revised form.

3. **House Bill 1665 (Investigations of Sudden Infant Deaths)**:
   - The bill aimed to require the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to investigate sudden, unexplained infant deaths (SUID).
   - Sponsor Representative Camerota emphasized the importance of data collection to identify trends and comply with federal law.
   - Concerns were raised about the burden on the medical examiner’s office and the potential for muddying data.
   - The committee voted 15-3 to recommend no further action on the bill.

4. **House Bill 1666 (Investigations of Sudden Infant Deaths)**:
   - Similar to HB 1665, this bill also sought to require investigations of SUID.
   - The committee voted 15-3 to recommend no further action, echoing concerns about the medical examiner's workload and the need for clear, unbiased data collection.

5. **House Bill 1265 (Therapeutic Cannabis Qualifying Conditions)**:
   - The bill aimed to modify the qualifying medical conditions for therapeutic cannabis prescriptions.
   - Representative Knirk, chair of the Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board, discussed the board's unanimous vote (8-0 with 2 abstentions) against the bill, citing concerns about the language and the potential for broad, unqualified use of cannabis.
   - The committee voted 17-0 in the work session and 18-0 in the executive session to recommend that the bill not proceed further.

6. **House Bill 1538 (Environmental Education for Healthcare Professionals)**:
   - The bill proposed creating a commission to develop environmental education programs for healthcare professionals regarding environmental toxins and health.
   - After discussions, the committee decided to recommend that the issue be handled by the existing Commission on Environmentally Triggered Chronic Illness (SB 85).
   - The committee voted 18-0 in both the work and executive sessions to not recommend further legislative action but to refer the matter to the SB 85 commission.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Concerns about the financial burden of new programs, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, were a recurring theme, leading to several bills being voted down.
- **Existing Programs**: The committee frequently referenced existing programs and commissions, often recommending that issues be addressed through these channels rather than creating new legislation.
- **Sensitive Issues**: Bills addressing mental health treatment for minors and infant death investigations were handled with particular care, reflecting the need for thorough consideration and stakeholder collaboration.
- **Procedural Adherence**: The committee strictly followed procedural rules, including roll call votes and disclosures, ensuring transparency and accountability.

The session concluded with expressions of gratitude for the committee's hard work and dedication, as well as farewells from members not running for re-election. The discussions reflected a commitment to careful consideration of fiscal impacts, existing programs, and the appropriateness of new legislation during the pandemic.
