**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting: Work and Executive Sessions (9/1/20)**

On September 1, 2020, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened virtually to discuss **House Bill 1659**, which addresses end-of-life legislation, specifically physician-assisted suicide. The meeting, authorized under the governor’s emergency order due to COVID-19 restrictions, began with procedural updates on remote access via Zoom and phone. Roll call attendance was taken, with members reporting their locations and confirming they were alone.

### **House Bill 1659: Key Discussions**
The bill, referred for interim study, was the primary focus of the work and executive sessions. The committee’s task was to determine whether to recommend further study or legislation on the topic, as the bill itself would not carry over to the next legislative session. The discussions were detailed and often contentious, reflecting the sensitive and complex nature of the issue.

1. **Purpose and Context**:  
   The bill aims to provide terminally ill patients with the option to end their lives with medical assistance. Similar legislation has been in place in states like Oregon for nearly 20 years, with Maine passing a comparable law more recently. Representative Chase shared research from these states, noting that while such laws are rarely used, they provide emotional comfort to those aware of the option.

2. **Concerns and Opposition**:  
   Several committee members expressed significant concerns:  
   - The "slippery slope" argument, fearing the legislation could lead to broader applications, such as euthanasia for children or disabled individuals.  
   - Potential abuses and coercion, particularly for vulnerable populations, including minorities, the poor, and those with disabilities or mental health challenges.  
   - The normalization of assisted suicide and its societal impact.  
   Representative Welper opposed the bill, arguing it could not be crafted in an acceptable way, while others highlighted healthcare disparities and the need for clearer definitions to distinguish between assisted suicide and comfort measures.

3. **Support for Further Study**:  
   Some members, including Representative Woodbury, supported further study, emphasizing the need to understand the experiences of families and individuals facing terminal illnesses. They argued the bill should be viewed as an option for those in extreme suffering, not as a blanket endorsement of assisted suicide. Representative Chase stressed the importance of additional research and public education to address fears and misunderstandings.

4. **Amendments and Ethical Considerations**:  
   The bill had two versions, with the second amendment introduced by the prime sponsor addressing concerns about coercion and ensuring only capable individuals could request end-of-life assistance. Some members argued that medical professionals, not legislators, should make these decisions, while others believed legislative guidelines were necessary to ensure ethical practices.

5. **Voting and Outcome**:  
   The committee voted on two motions:  
   - The first motion, to **not recommend** the bill for future legislation, failed with 8 votes in favor and 10 against.  
   - The second motion, to **recommend** the bill for further consideration, passed with 10 votes in favor and 8 against.  

6. **Process and Transparency**:  
   Some representatives expressed frustration with the virtual meeting process, citing technical difficulties and a lack of transparency, which they felt hindered effective debate.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The session concluded with a commitment to further study the bill, with a statement to be drafted summarizing the arguments both for and against the legislation. The committee acknowledged the contentious nature of the issue and the importance of continued civil and collegial debate. The meeting highlighted the challenges of crafting acceptable policy in this area, balancing ethical considerations, public concerns, and the need for clarity and safeguards.
