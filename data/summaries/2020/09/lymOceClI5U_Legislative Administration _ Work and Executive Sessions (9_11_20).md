The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Legislative Administration Committee held a virtual work and executive session on September 11, 2020, via Zoom, due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on three bills referred to the committee for interim study:

1. **House Bill 441**: This bill concerns the disclosure of sources of legislative bill proposals and certain information by lobbyists. The committee discussed the merits of the bill, with some members suggesting it might be better addressed through House rules rather than legislation. After debate, the committee voted 9-1 not to recommend the bill for future legislation, with the understanding that the issue could be revisited in future rules discussions.

2. **House Bill 1359**: This bill addresses employment restrictions for former legislators becoming lobbyists, proposing a cooling-off period. The committee debated the length and necessity of such a period, with some members expressing discomfort with restricting employment opportunities for volunteer legislators. The committee ultimately voted 8-2 not to recommend the bill for future legislation, though some members acknowledged the issue might resurface in future sessions.

3. **House Bill 1669**: This bill requires electronic filing of lobbyist forms and statements. The committee discussed whether this should be implemented through legislation or administrative rules, with many members favoring the latter. The committee voted unanimously not to recommend the bill for future legislation, trusting the Secretary of State’s office to handle the transition to digital filing.

Throughout the meeting, committee members emphasized the challenges of conducting legislative work during the pandemic and the limitations of interim study sessions. They also discussed the importance of transparency and public trust in the legislative process. The meeting concluded with members expressing gratitude for each other’s efforts and support during the difficult times.
