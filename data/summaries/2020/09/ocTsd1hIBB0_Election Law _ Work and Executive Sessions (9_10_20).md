#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 541 - National Popular Vote Interstate Compact**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to allocate New Hampshire’s electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote, ensuring the presidential candidate with the most votes nationwide wins the election.  
   - **Support**:  
     - **Representative Ellen Reed** and **Pam Wilmot** (Common Cause) argued that the current Electoral College system disenfranchises voters in non-battleground states, while the compact ensures "one person, one vote" and does not affect New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status.  
     - **Former Senator Ray Haynes** noted that the compact preserves the Electoral College while addressing the winner-take-all issue, which he believes disadvantages conservatives in safe states.  
   - **Concerns**:  
     - **Sean Parnell** raised practical issues, such as the lack of an official national popular vote count and potential delays in vote reporting from states.  
     - Opponents argued that the compact could marginalize smaller states like New Hampshire and undermine the Electoral College’s role as a constitutional check on the executive branch.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **11-5** to **not recommend** the bill for future legislation.

2. **House Bill 728 - Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes implementing ranked-choice voting to address issues with the first-past-the-post system, such as negative polarization, voter apathy, and the spoiler effect.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Solves the "spoiler effect" and strategic voting by allowing voters to rank candidates in order of preference.  
     - Reduces negative campaigning, depolarizes politics, and increases voter turnout and engagement.  
     - Ensures winners have broad support and provides a clearer picture of voter preferences.  
   - **Implementation**:  
     - Current voting machines in New Hampshire are RCV-compatible, and the Secretary of State is exploring new RCV-ready machines.  
     - Costs are relatively low, with Maine’s experience showing it can be done efficiently.  
   - **Concerns**:  
     - Opponents expressed concerns about complexity, delays in results, and potential shifts in campaign focus to high-population areas.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee initially voted **7-9** against recommending the bill, with a subsequent motion to **not recommend** passing **9-7**. Members supported the concept but found the current bill flawed.

3. **Other Bills Discussed**  
   - **HB 554 (Election Machine Verification)**: Voted **14-2** to **not recommend**, citing unresolved conflicts and the need to wait for a study from the Secretary of State.  
   - **HB 1191 (Campaign Expenditures)**: Voted **13-3** to **recommend**, aiming to add specificity to campaign expenditure laws and address enforcement issues.  
   - **HB 1390 (Election Machine Hand Counts)**: Voted **15-1** to **not recommend**, citing concerns about delays and the need to wait for the Secretary of State’s report.  
   - **HB 1457 (Nursing Home Voting)**: Voted **15-1** to **not recommend**, finding its provisions too restrictive and costly.  
   - **HB 1668 (Early Voting for Disabled Persons)**: Voted unanimously **16-0** to **not recommend**, citing logistical hurdles and the need for a broader approach to early voting.
