The New Hampshire House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee held a work and executive session on September 10, 2020, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting began with procedural announcements, including instructions for public access and participation via Zoom or telephone. The committee reviewed two bills previously recommended for interim study:

1. **HB 1199**: This bill aims to limit the fees charged to county prisoners for telephone services to the actual cost incurred by the county. The committee discussed the importance of maintaining communication between inmates and their families to reduce recidivism and the potential adoption of a state-level system for county jails. After discussion, the committee unanimously voted to recommend the bill for future legislation.

2. **HB 1305**: This bill seeks to exempt income from home-sharing arrangements from being considered in determining eligibility for certain property tax exemptions and public assistance programs. The committee emphasized the need for affordable housing and the potential benefits of home-sharing. Concerns were raised about the impact on Medicaid eligibility and the necessity of ensuring compliance with federal guidelines. The committee also unanimously voted to recommend this bill for future legislation.

The meeting concluded with administrative details regarding the submission of committee reports and well-wishes for the members.
