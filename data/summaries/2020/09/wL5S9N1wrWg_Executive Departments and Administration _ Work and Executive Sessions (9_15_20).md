**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (September 15, 2020)**

On September 15, 2020, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee held an electronic meeting due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The session began with technical difficulties but proceeded into a work session followed by an executive session. The meeting focused on reviewing several bills referred for interim study, discussing their merits, and determining whether to recommend future legislation. Key points and discussions included:

### **Meeting Structure and Public Access**
- The chair confirmed the meeting’s legality under the governor’s emergency orders and ensured public access via Zoom and telephone.
- Public participation was encouraged, with attendees like Sarah Aiken from Community Bridges providing valuable insights on specific bills.

### **Bills Reviewed and Recommendations**
1. **House Bill 1367**: This bill addressed licensing reciprocity for out-of-state professionals. The committee agreed the bill was too broad and recommended future legislation focused on specific professions rather than a blanket approach. The goal was to address professions requiring licensing in New Hampshire but not in neighboring states.
   
2. **House Bill 1485**: This bill proposed the use of surveillance cameras in home care and developmental disability facilities to address abuse concerns. While the concept was supported, privacy and cost issues were raised. Sarah Aiken informed the committee that an existing rule (HEM 309) already allows for cameras upon request, mitigating some concerns. The bill was recommended for future legislation with modifications to address privacy and practicality.

3. **House Bill 1528**: This bill aimed to study state employee salaries. The committee learned that a similar study was already underway through a contract with Siegel, though delayed due to COVID-19. Representative Walls, the bill’s sponsor, recommended no further legislation unless the study remained incomplete by the end of the biennium. The committee decided not to recommend future legislation but emphasized the importance of monitoring the ongoing study.

4. **House Bill 1536**: This bill addressed issues related to pharmacists in charge, pharmacy inspections, and disciplinary actions by the pharmacy board. Concerns were raised about corporate ownership of pharmacies and the accountability of pharmacists. The committee recommended future legislation with revisions to address these issues.

### **Committee Process and Dynamics**
- The committee clarified that recommending future legislation could address the subject matter rather than the specific bill language.
- Several committee members, including Representative Desjardins and Representative Panda City, announced they would not be returning next year. They expressed appreciation for the collaborative and productive nature of the committee.

### **Additional Discussions**
- **Wage and Benefit Study**: The committee discussed a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a wage and benefit study of classified and unclassified employees. Concerns were raised about the scope and sampling methodology, with assurances that the study would cover a representative sample of positions to avoid excessive costs.
- **Future Plans**: The committee planned to meet with the new executive director of OLPC (Office of Legislative Services) in October to discuss future changes and initiatives.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting emphasized refining legislation to address specific issues while considering cost, privacy, and practicality. The committee aimed to ensure that future legislative efforts effectively addressed unresolved concerns, maintaining a collaborative and transparent process throughout.
