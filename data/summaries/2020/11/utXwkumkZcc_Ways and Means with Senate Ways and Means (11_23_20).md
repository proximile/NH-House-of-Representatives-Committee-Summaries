### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (11/23/20)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, in conjunction with the Senate Ways and Means Committee, convened electronically on November 23, 2020, to discuss the state’s revenue estimates, budgetary outlook, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting also included updates from various state agencies on tax performance, economic trends, and legislative initiatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed across all segments:

---

#### **Revenue Performance and COVID-19 Impact**
1. **Overall Revenue Trends**:
   - New Hampshire’s revenues were $44.1 million (24.5%) ahead of prior-year figures as of November 2020, driven largely by strong business tax performance. However, this included an anomalous $30.8 million receivable due to delayed tax payments following federal and state deadline extensions.
   - The pandemic’s economic impact has been uneven, with sectors like home improvement, medical, and technology thriving, while hospitality and gyms struggled. Federal stimulus programs, including PPP and state relief funds, helped mitigate revenue declines.

2. **Business Taxes**:
   - Business taxes were 20.7% ahead of plan, with $18.3 million in anomalous receivables. Even without these, revenues were $20 million above projections. Large taxpayers were less affected by the pandemic than initially feared, though refunds could impact final numbers.

3. **Revenue Estimates**:
   - Revised estimates for fiscal year 2021 showed business taxes could exceed or fall short of projections, with a low estimate of $56.3 million below plan and a high estimate of $15.9 million above plan. The potential absence of a second federal stimulus package added uncertainty.

4. **Remote Work and Technology**:
   - The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) successfully transitioned two-thirds of its staff to remote work, which may become a long-term model. The second phase of the Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) was implemented, with the final phase set for August 2021.

#### **Tax-Specific Discussions**
1. **Meals and Rentals Tax**:
   - This tax was down 23.3% from the plan and 18.4% from the prior year, heavily impacted by reduced dining and travel. Increased takeout and potential tax rate cuts were discussed as influencing factors.

2. **Tobacco Tax**:
   - Contrary to expectations, tobacco tax revenues surged by 20.4% from the plan and 22.2% from the prior year. Factors included stockpiling, stress-related smoking, and cross-border sales from Massachusetts, where menthol and flavored tobacco products were banned.

3. **Interest and Dividends Tax**:
   - This tax performed well, with an 84.5% increase over the plan, though $9.2 million was attributed to anomalous receivables. Stable stock market and interest income contributed to its resilience.

4. **Real Estate Transfer Tax**:
   - Revenues were 1% above plan and 4.8% ahead of the prior year, driven by housing demand, low mortgage rates, and virtual home sales. A $5 million transfer to the affordable housing fund slightly offset the figures.

5. **Utility Property Tax**:
   - Revenues were 8.9% ahead of plan and 14.6% ahead of the prior year, though a 10% decrease in estimated values for 2021 was anticipated due to economic conditions.

#### **Highway Fund and Transportation**
1. **Highway Fund Revenues**:
   - The Highway Fund saw declines, primarily due to reduced gas tax collections (road toll) caused by decreased traffic during the pandemic. For FY2021, the fund is projected to collect $239 million, $16.4 million less than planned.
   - DMV revenues were less severely impacted, thanks to appointment-based services.

2. **Toll and Infrastructure**:
   - The elimination of the Exit 11 toll resulted in a $600,000 annual net loss. Future challenges include TIFIA loan repayments for infrastructure projects, with principal payments beginning in 2025.

3. **Electric Vehicles**:
   - The rise of electric vehicles and improved fuel efficiency poses long-term challenges for gas tax revenues.

#### **Gaming and Lottery Revenues**
1. **Sports Betting**:
   - Sports betting revenues exceeded expectations, driven by the NFL season.

2. **Lottery Games**:
   - Jackpot games (Powerball, Mega Millions, Megabucks) saw declining sales, while scratch tickets and Keno performed well, with regional variations.

3. **Mobile Internet Gaming**:
   - This area grew significantly, with estimates reaching $10 million for the year.

---

#### **State Agency Updates**
1. **Liquor Commission**:
   - Total liquor sales increased by 8.3% year-over-year, with retail sales up and restaurant sales down due to the pandemic. Grocery sales saw significant growth.

2. **Insurance Department**:
   - The department reported a $2 million favorable variance in fee revenue due to increased licensing. Property and casualty insurance rates are rising, but catastrophic events are not expected to significantly impact New Hampshire.

3. **Treasury and Abandoned Property**:
   - Interest revenue is expected to remain minimal through FY2023 due to the zero-interest-rate environment. Abandoned property revenue remains stable.

---

#### **Legal and Legislative Initiatives**
1. **Chapter 78E and Wayfair Decision**:
   - Assistant Attorney General Sam Garland provided updates on Chapter 78E, which protects New Hampshire businesses from out-of-state tax collection obligations. No formal notices have been received, but some states have probed NH businesses.
   - The state is monitoring compliance with federal and state laws and may pursue legal action if constitutional principles are violated. Congressional intervention is seen as necessary to address multi-jurisdictional taxation complexities.

2. **State Sovereignty**:
   - New Hampshire is challenging Massachusetts’ taxation of NH residents working remotely, emphasizing state sovereignty and constitutional issues.

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted cautious optimism about New Hampshire’s financial outlook, with strong performances in certain tax categories offsetting pandemic-driven declines. However, uncertainties around federal stimulus, the pandemic’s ongoing effects, and long-term challenges like electric vehicles and TIFIA loan repayments remain concerns. State agencies emphasized adaptability, technological advancements, and proactive measures to navigate these challenges. The committee expressed commitment to protecting New Hampshire’s economic interests and addressing budgetary and legal issues moving forward.
