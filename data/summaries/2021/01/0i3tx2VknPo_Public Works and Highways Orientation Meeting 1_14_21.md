**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Orientation Meeting (January 14, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee held an orientation meeting on January 14, 2021, conducted virtually via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on procedural adjustments, committee responsibilities, and key tasks for the biennium, particularly the capital budget and transportation plan. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points discussed:

### **Meeting Logistics and Ground Rules**
1. **Remote Participation**: The meeting was conducted electronically under House Rule 67 and the governor’s emergency order. Public access was provided via Zoom or telephone, with details available in the House calendar. Roll call attendance was taken, and members were reminded to maintain decorum, dress appropriately, and use a single email address for committee communications.
2. **Hybrid Meetings**: Due to COVID-19, meetings will be hybrid, with some members attending in person and others remotely. Public testimony will also be allowed remotely. Challenges with technology, such as document distribution and identifying raised hands, were acknowledged, but the committee is committed to making remote participation work.

### **Committee Overview and Member Introductions**
1. **Committee Charge**: The committee’s responsibilities (under Rule 30) include matters related to public highways, the highway fund, capital construction, state bonding, coastline preservation, state memorials, and other referred issues. The committee has 23 members (12 Republicans, 11 Democrats), making it one of the largest in the House.
2. **Member Introductions**: Committee members introduced themselves, emphasizing the committee’s non-partisan, collegial nature and focus on tangible infrastructure and capital budget work. Many shared their professional backgrounds and reasons for serving on the committee.

### **Capital Budget and Transportation Plan**
1. **Capital Budget Process**: The committee will focus on the capital budget, which involves around $140 million in state bonding for capital improvements. The governor’s proposal is expected by February 15, followed by public hearings. The capital budget is a six-year plan, though appropriations typically last two years. Agencies submit project requests by May 1, and the governor reviews them by June. The committee reviews these requests, decides which projects to fund, and may extend appropriations for delayed projects.
2. **Transportation Plan**: The 10-year transportation plan, covering roads, bridges, rail, aeronautics, and bus transportation, will be addressed in the second year of the biennium.
3. **Debt Affordability**: The Treasurer’s Office outlined the state’s debt affordability study, which calculates metrics like debt-to-revenue ratios, debt-to-personal income, and net debt per capita. The state aims to keep debt-to-revenue ratios below 10%, a warning level for rating agencies. The statutory debt limit caps debt service at 10% of unrestricted general fund revenues, allowing for up to $600 million in authorized debt in 2021.
4. **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has delayed some projects and made revenue projections uncertain, complicating debt affordability assessments. The committee will focus on maintaining fiscal discipline and avoiding unnecessary debt.

### **Committee Procedures and Responsibilities**
1. **Work Sessions vs. Public Hearings**: Work sessions are internal committee meetings to discuss specific items, not public hearings. The public can only participate if invited by the chair. Public hearings, on the other hand, allow for public input.
2. **Executive Sessions**: Executive sessions are private meetings where the committee decides the fate of bills. A quorum of 12 members is required, and members must notify leadership if they cannot attend.
3. **Conflicts of Interest**: Members were reminded to declare any conflicts of interest, especially concerning the capital budget.
4. **Capital Budget Overview Committee**: This committee monitors the status of capital projects, approves fund transfers between projects, and reviews quarterly updates on project progress.
5. **Long-Range Capital Planning**: This committee deals with land disposal and lease agreements over five years and reviews extensions to existing leases.

### **Resources and Tools**
1. **Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) Office**: The LBA office, a nonpartisan entity, assists with the capital and operating budgets, fiscal notes, and revenue estimates. They provide compare reports to track changes between the governor’s proposal, House, and Senate versions, as well as summaries of agency requests.
2. **Treasury Resources**: The Treasurer shared resources like the Treasury Dashboard, official statements, debt affordability studies, and debt limit certifications, all available online for committee members.

### **Future Plans and Next Steps**
1. **Scheduling and Attendance**: The committee aims to schedule hearings efficiently, possibly handling multiple bills in one day. Members were encouraged to communicate scheduling conflicts.
2. **In-Person Meetings**: In-person meetings will resume when safe, allowing for informal relationship-building during breaks.
3. **Next Steps**: The committee will continue discussions on the capital budget, with presentations from the Legislative Budget Assistant and the Treasurer on the debt affordability and budget process.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with an emphasis on the committee’s collaborative approach and commitment to addressing New Hampshire’s infrastructure needs. Despite the challenges of remote work and the pandemic, the committee is focused on maintaining fiscal discipline, ensuring document accessibility, and efficiently managing the capital budget and transportation plan.
