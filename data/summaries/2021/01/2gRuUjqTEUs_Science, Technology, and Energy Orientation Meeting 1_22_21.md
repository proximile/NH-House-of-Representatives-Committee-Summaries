**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Orientation Meeting on January 22, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy (STE) Committee held an orientation meeting on January 22, 2021, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on the committee's role in addressing energy, technology, and utility-related issues in the state. Key discussions included the Public Utilities Commission’s (PUC) regulatory functions, renewable energy initiatives, utility operations, and committee logistics. Here’s a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **1. Committee Logistics and Procedures**
- **Meeting Format**: The meeting was held virtually via Zoom, with public access provided to comply with the Right-to-Know law. Members participated remotely, with technical issues, such as unmuting and connectivity, addressed during the session.
- **New Online System**: The committee introduced a new online system for public hearing registration, replacing the traditional pink card and blue sheet system. Written testimony was emphasized as critical, especially when time constraints limit verbal testimony.
- **Hearing Schedule**: Weekly public hearings were scheduled to begin on January 29, 2021, with presentations from the PUC and regulated utilities.
- **Hybrid Meetings**: Future meetings will be hybrid (in-person and virtual) due to COVID-19 restrictions. Members were reminded to arrange for video participation if voting remotely during executive sessions.

### **2. Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Overview**
- **Mission and Role**: The PUC ensures safe, reliable, and reasonably priced utility services (electricity, gas, water, sewer) while balancing public interests and utility provider needs. In FY2020, the PUC handled 181 dockets and addressed nearly 5,000 customer inquiries.
- **COVID-19 Adaptations**: The PUC transitioned to remote hearings, electronic filings, and investigated pandemic impacts on utilities and customers.
- **Docket and Order Process**: A docket refers to a formal proceeding or investigation, while an order is the final decision issued. The duration varies based on the complexity of the issue.
- **Electricity Regulation**: The PUC oversees electricity distribution, rate cases, and renewable energy programs. New Hampshire has four major electric utilities, with Eversource being the largest.
- **Electric Assistance Program (EAP)**: The EAP, funded through a system benefits charge, provides bill assistance to low-income households, helping over 400,000 households since 2002.
- **Competitive Energy Supply**: The PUC facilitates a competitive energy market, though residential customers remain cautious due to mistrust and lack of understanding.
- **Transmission Costs**: The discussion highlighted rising transmission infrastructure costs, particularly as the region shifts to cleaner energy sources like offshore wind.

### **3. Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency**
- **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**: The RPS sets renewable energy generation targets for electricity suppliers. Suppliers must purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) or make alternative compliance payments (ACPs), which fund the Renewable Energy Fund for renewable energy development and rebate programs.
- **Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)**: RECs are generated by renewable energy facilities and tracked through the New England Power Pool Generation Information System (NEPOOL GIS).
- **Energy Efficiency Programs**: The statewide "New Hampshire Saves" program, funded through the System Benefits Charge (SBC), promotes energy efficiency through audits, rebates, and demand reduction initiatives.

### **4. Utility Operations and Emergency Preparedness**
- **Utilities Overview**:
  - **Eversource**: The largest energy company in NH, serving over 500,000 electric customers with extensive transmission and distribution infrastructure.
  - **NH Electric Co-op**: A member-owned, not-for-profit cooperative serving 85,000 members in 118 communities, focusing on energy efficiency and broadband expansion.
  - **Liberty Utilities**: The largest natural gas utility in NH, now rebranded as "Liberty," serving the I-93 corridor and specific electric service regions.
  - **Unitil**: Provides electric and natural gas services, emphasizing automation and reliability in storm response.
- **Grid Transformation**: Utilities are investing in infrastructure to integrate renewable energy, distributed energy resources, and automation to improve reliability and meet customer expectations.
- **Vegetation Management**: Comprehensive programs, including cycle pruning and hazard tree mitigation, prevent tree interference with power lines and reduce storm-related costs.
- **Incident Command Structure (ICS)**: Utilities use ICS to respond to storm and emergency events, conducting annual drills and coordinating public safety, damage assessment, and restoration phases.

### **5. Energy Policy and Future Directions**
- **Natural Gas**: Recognized as a cleaner, affordable alternative to fuel oil and propane, natural gas plays a key role in NH’s energy system. Renewable natural gas (RNG) and hydrogen were discussed as potential decarbonization solutions.
- **Air Source Heat Pumps**: While effective for decarbonization, heat pumps are most suitable in areas without access to utility natural gas. Natural gas remains more affordable and lower in emissions.
- **Electric Bill Structure**: Bills are broken down into components, including energy service, transmission costs, and other charges. The default service provider is Eversource, with rates expected to change in February 2021.

### **6. Committee Introductions and Next Steps**
- **Member Introductions**: Committee members introduced themselves, sharing their professional backgrounds, districts, and interests. The diverse group includes expertise in engineering, environmental science, technology, emergency management, and law.
- **Focus Areas**: Members expressed enthusiasm for advancing energy efficiency, sustainability, and technology initiatives while keeping costs affordable for customers.
- **Future Meetings**: The committee outlined plans for public hearings, executive sessions, and continued collaboration with stakeholders to address energy and technology-related issues in New Hampshire.

### **Conclusion**
The orientation meeting provided a comprehensive overview of the STE Committee’s scope, focusing on energy regulation, renewable energy, utility operations, and emergency preparedness. The committee is committed to advancing clean energy initiatives, ensuring utility reliability, and addressing the evolving needs of New Hampshire’s energy landscape. Future meetings will build on these discussions to develop policies that promote sustainability, efficiency, and affordability.
