The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee held a series of meetings to discuss the state’s revenue streams, tax administration, and financial projections. The discussions covered a wide range of topics, including tax policies, revenue trends, the impact of COVID-19, and the operations of various state agencies. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key points across all segments:

### **1. Tax Revenues and Administration**
   - **Medicaid Enhancement Tax (MET):** The MET is a significant revenue source, collected from hospitals to fund uncompensated care and Medicaid. Hospitals file non-binding estimates by January 15th, with payments due by April 15th. The pandemic impacted hospital utilization and MET revenues.
   - **Nursing Facility Quality Assessment (NFQA):** A 5.5% tax on nursing facilities’ net patient services revenue, used to bridge the gap between Medicaid costs and state funding. The pandemic also affected NFQA revenues.
   - **Other Taxes:** The committee reviewed taxes such as the Utility Property Tax, Railroad Tax, Local Property Tax, Excavation/Gravel Tax, and Timber Tax, each with specific filing and payment requirements.
   - **Revenue Estimates:** The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) provided preliminary revenue estimates for fiscal years 2021–2023, adjusting for anomalies caused by federal tax deadline changes during the pandemic.
   - **RIMS System:** The DRA is implementing a new Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) to replace the outdated TIMS system, improving functionality and transparency.

### **2. Business Taxes and Revenue Trends**
   - **Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET):** The BPT is 7.7% of taxable business profits, with a small percentage of filers contributing the majority of revenue. The BET is a 0.6% tax on enterprise value, with credits offsetting BPT liabilities.
   - **Market-Based Sourcing and Single Sales Factor Apportionment:** New policies allocate revenue based on the customer’s location and apportion tangible items using only sales, effective from December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022, respectively.
   - **Revenue Trends:** Historical data shows fluctuations in BPT and BET revenues, influenced by economic conditions, federal tax reforms, and statutory changes.

### **3. Other Key Taxes**
   - **Meals and Rooms Tax (M&R):** A 9% tax on meals, rooms, and motor vehicle rentals, with 80% of revenue from meals. The pandemic significantly impacted travel and tourism sectors.
   - **Tobacco Tax:** Cigarettes are taxed at $1.78 per pack, with e-cigarettes taxed at $0.30 per milliliter. Cross-border sales and smuggling are influenced by New Hampshire’s lower tax rates compared to neighboring states.
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax (RETT):** A $1.50 per $100 property value tax, split between buyer and seller. Revenue has increased due to rising property values and low mortgage rates.
   - **Interest and Dividends Tax (I&D):** A 5% tax on interest and dividend income, with exemptions for seniors, blind, or disabled individuals. Revenue has grown steadily, driven by stock market performance.
   - **Communications Services Tax (CST):** A 7% tax on two-way communication services, with declining revenue due to reduced landline usage and technological changes.

### **4. Revenue Trends and COVID-19 Impact**
   - **Court Revenues:** Fines decreased by 20% year-over-year since FY2016, partly due to marijuana decriminalization. Bail forfeitures and penalty assessments also declined.
   - **Motor Vehicle Fines:** Expected to be impacted by reduced traffic during the pandemic, with fewer vehicles on the road and more people working from home.
   - **Miscellaneous Revenues:** Changes in handling unclaimed funds and escrow accounts have affected revenue streams, with projections for future increases as funds reach the three-year mark.

### **5. State Agencies and Revenue Sources**
   - **Lottery Commission:** Revenue comes from scratch tickets, Kino, Powerball, Mega Millions, and sports betting. The pandemic caused a dip in sports betting revenue, but digital platforms are driving growth. Massachusetts residents significantly contribute to sports betting revenue in Seabrook.
   - **Liquor Commission:** Revenue has grown significantly, with net profits increasing from $48.7 million in FY2014 to $154.5 million in FY2020. Cross-border shoppers, particularly from Massachusetts, contribute substantially to sales.
   - **Judicial Branch:** Revenue comes from fines, entry fees, and records research fees. Challenges include unpaid fines and fee waivers for individuals who cannot afford them. E-filing and online records research are increasing efficiency.

### **6. Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA)**
   - **Overview:** Established in 1998 to reduce smoking, especially among youth, the MSA has brought over $952 million to New Hampshire since 1999.
   - **Revenue Trends:** MSA payments are declining due to reduced cigarette sales and the rise of non-participating manufacturers (NPMs). Projections for 2021–2023 show further declines, influenced by COVID-19 and the rise of vaping.
   - **Allocation:** The first $40 million of MSA revenue goes to the Education Trust Fund.

### **7. Enforcement and Problem Gambling**
   - **Enforcement Actions:** The Bureau of Securities Regulation focuses on unsuitable investments, churning, and fraud. A notable case involved former Governor Craig Benson, with $22 million returned to the victim.
   - **Problem Gambling:** The state is addressing problem gambling through a council and an RFP for prevention and treatment services. New Hampshire is behind some states in addressing this issue.

### **8. Future Projections and Challenges**
   - **Revenue Growth:** Agencies anticipate continued growth in digital platforms, sports betting, and liquor sales, though external factors like fuel prices and legislative changes may impact revenues.
   - **Technology and Innovation:** Agencies are leveraging technology to improve efficiency, from online sports betting and curbside liquor pickup to e-filing in the courts.

### **Conclusion**
The Ways and Means Committee focused on understanding revenue trends, the impact of COVID-19, and the effectiveness of various tax policies and programs. Discussions emphasized the importance of accurate revenue estimates for budget planning, transparency in tax administration, and addressing emerging issues such as cross-border sales, digital communication services, and problem gambling. The committee also highlighted the need for continued innovation and adaptation to ensure sustainable revenue growth and effective state operations.
