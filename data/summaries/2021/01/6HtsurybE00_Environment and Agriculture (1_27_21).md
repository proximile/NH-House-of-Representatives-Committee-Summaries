### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Environment and Agriculture (January 27, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 27, 2021, focused on a range of environmental and agricultural issues, with discussions centered on several key bills. The meeting highlighted efforts to support small farms, regulate CBD products, promote soil health, and modernize public notice requirements. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **CBD Regulation (HB 272)**
- **Overview**: Sponsored by Representative Jerry Knirk, HB 272 aims to regulate the sale of hemp products containing CBD (cannabidiol) in New Hampshire. The bill seeks to address the unregulated and rapidly expanding CBD market by ensuring consumer protection through accurate labeling, testing for contaminants, and appropriate warnings for vulnerable populations.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Requires testing and labeling of CBD products, including a certificate of analysis accessible via QR codes or website links.
  - Imposes restrictions on the sale of CBD-infused food products formulated outside New Hampshire, though this provision would be voided if federal laws change.
  - Includes a $100 annual registration fee per product to fund the program, which is intended to be self-sustaining.
- **Concerns**:
  - Potential conflicts with federal interstate commerce laws.
  - Costs of testing for smaller producers, though many already test for other states.
  - Need for startup funding from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the program.
- **Safety and Dosage**: The bill emphasizes the importance of accurate labeling to prevent unintentional overdoses, particularly for individuals with liver disease. While CBD has a lower toxicity risk compared to opioids, the therapeutic dose is typically in the hundreds of milligrams.
- **Next Steps**: The committee will consider stakeholder feedback, particularly regarding interstate commerce and labeling requirements, and await a fiscal note from HHS.

### **State Spider Designation (HB 318)**
- **Proposal**: Third-grade students from Hollis Primary School, led by their teacher Mrs. Happy, proposed designating the daring jumping spider as New Hampshireâ€™s state spider. The students conducted research and held a school-wide vote to select the spider, emphasizing its resilience, ecological importance, and unique characteristics.
- **Educational Impact**: The project highlighted the educational and community-building benefits of involving students in legislative processes.

### **Milk Pasteurization (HB 95)**
- **Objective**: Sponsored by Representative Jim Allard, HB 95 aims to allow the production of ice cream from raw milk, providing additional revenue opportunities for small family farms. The bill had previously passed unanimously but was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Amendments**: Plans were discussed to remove a problematic clause regarding other products containing raw milk.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Jill Fudala**, a small farmer, shared the financial struggles of small farms and the importance of allowing raw goat milk ice cream sales.
  - **Rob Johnson** from the NH Farm Bureau supported the bill, emphasizing the need to protect commercial dairy farmers while allowing small farms to innovate.

### **Soil Health and Soil Conservation (HB 199)**
- **Overview**: Sponsored by Representative Peter Bixby, HB 199 updates the state soil conservation plan to include soil health concepts, helping farmers adapt to climate change and access grants for soil health practices.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Defines soil health, emphasizing organic matter, biological activity, and nutrient-holding capacity.
  - Focuses on improving soil resilience to extreme weather events, such as droughts and heavy rains.
  - Provides statutory language to strengthen grant applications for soil health initiatives.
  - Supports equipment-sharing programs (e.g., seed drills, cover crop crimpers) for small farmers.
- **Climate Adaptation**: The bill includes terms like "climate and environmental change" to align with grant opportunities and address broader environmental challenges, such as invasive species.
- **Testimony**: **Roger Noonan** from the New England Farmers Union and others emphasized the importance of soil health for agricultural sustainability.

### **Public Notice Requirements for DES Permits (HB 73)**
- **Objective**: Sponsored by Representative Judy Aron, HB 73 aims to modernize public notice requirements for permits issued by the Department of Environmental Services (DES) by including electronic notifications.
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to improve public participation in permitting decisions, particularly for significant projects like solid waste management permits. It had previously passed the House and Senate but was tabled in an omnibus bill last session.

2. **Consumer Protection**: HB 272 focuses on regulating the CBD market to ensure product safety and accurate labeling, particularly for vulnerable populations.
3. **Soil Health and Climate Adaptation**: HB 199 emphasizes the importance of soil health in helping farmers adapt to climate change and access funding for conservation practices.
