### **House Bill 99: Regulation of Personal Watercraft and Seasonal Platforms**
#### **Part 1: Personal Watercraft (Jet Skis) in Sensitive Areas**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to regulate personal watercraft in environmentally sensitive areas like Newcastle and Rye, addressing concerns about damage to marshlands and waterways.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Kathleen Murray** highlighted environmental damage caused by jet skis in shallow waters.

#### **Part 2: Seasonal Anchored Platforms**
- **Purpose**: The bill regulates seasonal platforms (e.g., inflatable trampolines) on public waters to ensure safety and prevent navigation obstructions.
- **Testimony**:
  - **John McDonald** (Prime Sponsor) reintroduced the bill, which aligns with prior legislation (HB 1609).

- **Support for the Bill**:
  - **Leah Cushman** (Prime Sponsor) and **Stuart Cooper** (Fluoride Action Network) argued fluoride is a neurotoxin linked to health issues like dental fluorosis, lower IQ, and thyroid problems. They emphasized that New Hampshire has low fluoridation rates but ranks third-lowest in dental decay.
  - Supporters also raised concerns about overexposure for vulnerable populations and the lack of dosage control.
- **Opposition to the Bill**:
  - **Karen Kraver** (NH DHHS) and **Dr. Christine Snow** (American Academy of Pediatrics) cited decades of scientific evidence supporting fluoridation’s safety and effectiveness in reducing tooth decay, especially for low-income populations.
  - Opponents warned that defluoridation could increase Medicaid costs by $1.5 million annually and worsen oral health outcomes.
- **Outcome**: No vote was taken; further discussion and potential amendments are expected.

3. **Technical and Procedural Issues**: The meeting was frequently interrupted by technical difficulties, including Zoom malfunctions and system shutdowns, which delayed proceedings.
4. **Committee Consensus**: Bills like HB 344 and HB 99 received strong support, while HB 611 remained contentious, with further discussion needed.
