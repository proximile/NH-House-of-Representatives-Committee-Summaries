**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Orientation Meeting – January 13, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee held an orientation meeting on January 13, 2021, featuring presentations from key state agencies and introductions from lobbyists representing various industries. The meeting focused on the roles, responsibilities, and challenges of the committee and its stakeholders, with an emphasis on consumer protection, regulatory oversight, and community support. Below is a cohesive summary of the key segments:

---

### **1. Bureau of Securities Regulation and Charitable Trusts Unit**
The meeting began with an overview of the **Bureau of Securities Regulation**, overseen by the Secretary of State's Office. The bureau is tasked with protecting New Hampshire investors by enforcing RSA 421-B, promoting capital formation, and ensuring compliance with securities laws. Its responsibilities include licensing broker-dealers and investment advisors, registering securities products, conducting field examinations, and providing investor education. The bureau is self-funded, generating revenue through fines, penalties, and securities registrations, with a projected $43 million for the fiscal year. COVID-19 has shifted some operations to remote audits, though in-person exams remain ideal.

The **Charitable Trusts Unit**, part of the Attorney General's Office, oversees charitable organizations and trusts, ensuring compliance with donor intentions and charitable purposes. It requires registration and annual reporting from charities, including financial statements and conflict of interest disclosures. The unit handles healthcare acquisitions, conservation easements, and professional fundraiser registrations. It emphasizes education over regulation, focusing on volunteer board governance and addressing online giving trends like GoFundMe campaigns. Key discussions included challenges in regulating professional fundraisers and potential legislative action to ensure transparency in online fundraising.

### **2. Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau**
Brandon Grodd, Bureau Chief of the Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau at the Department of Justice, presented the bureau’s responsibilities, which include enforcing the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act (RSA 358-A) and the Antitrust Act (RSA 356). The bureau ensures businesses act fairly, do not deceive consumers, and avoid monopolistic practices. It operates a consumer protection hotline, mediates disputes, and recovers significant sums for consumers. Enforcement actions include civil and criminal penalties, fines up to $10,000 per violation, and even business shutdowns in severe cases.

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges, such as fraudulent vaccine-related advertisements. The bureau also focuses on antitrust enforcement, particularly in healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and investigates elder abuse and financial exploitation. Grodd highlighted resource constraints, with only three attorneys handling consumer protection work, and noted that additional resources could enhance their effectiveness. Committee members raised questions about generic drug pricing, contractor licensing, and rental property oversight, with Grodd clarifying the bureau’s jurisdiction and limitations.
