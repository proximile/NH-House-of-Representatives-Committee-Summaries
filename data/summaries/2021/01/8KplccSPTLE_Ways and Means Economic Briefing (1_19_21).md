### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Economic Briefing (1/19/21)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee held an economic briefing on January 19, 2021, via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting provided a detailed overview of the state’s economic and fiscal outlook, focusing on the pandemic's impact, revenue trends, and strategies for recovery. Key discussions centered on budget management, tax performance, workforce challenges, demographic shifts, and economic development. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all segments:

### **Economic and Revenue Overview**
1. **Budget and Revenue Challenges**:
   - The pandemic created significant economic uncertainty, impacting revenue streams and complicating budget planning. The delayed budget passage in 2020 and the fiscal year 2020 deficit highlighted the need for accurate revenue projections.
   - The **Rainy Day Fund** ($115.5 million) played a critical role in balancing the budget, though it remains below the state’s 10% funding policy. Maintaining reserves is essential for future economic downturns.

2. **Key Revenue Sources**:
   - **Meals and Rentals Tax (M&R)**: A sharp decline in 2020 due to restaurant and hotel restrictions, though behavioral shifts (e.g., increased takeout, Airbnb rentals) partially offset losses. Pent-up demand for dining and travel could drive recovery.
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Revenue surged in fiscal year 2021 due to low interest rates, COVID-19-driven migration to rural areas, and high property values. However, inventory constraints may slow future growth.
   - **Tobacco Tax**: New Hampshire’s low tobacco tax attracted cross-border sales, especially after Massachusetts banned flavored tobacco products. E-cigarette taxes contributed $2.2 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2021.
   - **Business Taxes**: Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET) revenue fluctuated, with fiscal year 2021 revenue 14.3% above plan. The state transitioned to **single sales factor apportionment** and **market-based sourcing** to modernize tax calculations.
   - **Interest and Dividends Tax**: Backloaded revenue, with most collections in April, May, and June. Fiscal year 2021 revenue was 31.9% ahead of plan due to COVID-19-related tax filing extensions.

3. **Federal Stimulus and Economic Recovery**:
   - Federal programs like PPP loans and EIDL grants helped businesses survive, though some sectors (e.g., hospitality, retail) struggled. Pent-up demand and vaccine distribution are expected to drive recovery, but uncertainties remain.

### **Economic Development and Workforce Challenges**
1. **Economic Recovery**:
   - The pandemic had a disparate impact, with sectors like technology and manufacturing thriving while small businesses and hospitality struggled. Recovery is expected to be slow, with full recovery likely by late 2022 or early 2023.
   - The Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA) supported businesses through CARES Act funding, technical assistance, and collaboration with chambers of commerce.

2. **Workforce Trends**:
   - The pandemic exacerbated pre-existing labor force challenges, with older workers and women leaving due to health concerns and childcare issues. Workforce development efforts included virtual job fairs, apprenticeship programs, and collaboration with community colleges.
   - Remote work is expected to continue, with increased migration to New Hampshire driven by its natural environment and quality of life. Broadband access in rural areas is critical to support this shift.

3. **Unemployment**:
   - Unemployment claims peaked in May 2020 but remained elevated in January 2021. Federal programs like PUA and FPUC provided crucial support to self-employed and gig workers.
   - New Hampshire’s unemployment trust fund remained solvent, with $50 million from CARES Act funds helping to minimize future tax increases for employers.

### **Demographic and Population Trends**
1. **Migration and Population Growth**:
   - New Hampshire’s population growth is driven by migration, particularly from Massachusetts, with many relocating to southern areas near Boston. Northern regions are experiencing population decline.
   - The state is gaining young families (30s and 40s) and their children, while Massachusetts is losing young adults and children.

2. **Aging Population and Diversity**:
   - The state’s population is aging, with a low birth rate and deaths now exceeding births. Minority populations are growing faster than the white population, particularly among children.
   - Pockets of poverty exist, especially in areas like Manchester, though New Hampshire has one of the lowest poverty rates in the U.S.

3. **Future Projections**:
   - Population growth has slowed but picked up in recent years. The pandemic is expected to further impact birth rates and migration patterns. Detailed 2020 census data will provide more insights.

### **Infrastructure and Housing**
1. **Housing Challenges**:
   - Increased demand and low interest rates have driven housing prices up, with supply constrained by development restrictions. Addressing housing shortages is critical for economic growth.
   
2. **Broadband Access**:
   - Expanding broadband access in rural areas is essential to support remote work, education, and economic development.

### **Conclusion**
The briefing highlighted New Hampshire’s strong fiscal management, proactive response to the pandemic, and potential for recovery. Key challenges include addressing workforce shortages, housing supply, and infrastructure needs while leveraging migration and federal stimulus funds. The state’s ability to adapt to demographic shifts and economic trends will be crucial for long-term stability and growth.
