The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee meetings focused on a broad range of financial, budgetary, and operational issues affecting the state, with particular attention to revenue sources, COVID-19 impacts, transportation infrastructure, insurance regulation, and the unclaimed property program. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Transportation Programs and Revenue Challenges**
The committee extensively reviewed New Hampshire’s transportation programs, including the **Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) program**, the **highway fund**, and the **turnpike system**. The UCR program collects fees from carriers, with New Hampshire capped at $2.29 million; excess funds are redistributed among states. The **highway fund**, primarily supported by gas taxes and registration fees, faces financial strain due to the 2014 gas tax increase being redirected to debt service for a TIFIA loan starting in 2025, reducing funding for pavement and bridge improvements. The **turnpike system**, transitioning to all-electronic tolling, saw revenue declines during COVID-19 but is slowly recovering. Despite progress in road conditions (82% in good or fair condition in 2019), future funding challenges threaten infrastructure maintenance.

### **2. COVID-19 Impacts on State Revenue**
The pandemic significantly affected state revenues, particularly in **road tolls**, **premium taxes**, and **traffic violation revenues**. Road tolls declined by 13.5% in FY21, with recovery projected to remain 7-8% below pre-pandemic levels due to reduced commuting. Premium taxes, a major revenue source for the Insurance Department, were lower than expected, with FY21 projections adjusted to $128.2 million. Traffic violation revenues also dropped due to reduced enforcement. Other areas, like motor vehicle registration and licensing, remained stable, reflecting New Hampshire’s reliance on personal vehicles.

### **3. Insurance Regulation and Revenue**
The **New Hampshire Insurance Department** oversees a competitive insurance marketplace, regulating over 1,200 licensed insurers and thousands of producers. Its revenue primarily comes from premium taxes (87%) and fees/penalties (13%). The department handles consumer complaints, recovers funds, and investigates insurance fraud. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced uncertainties, with personal lines insurers maintaining sufficient capital but commercial carriers tightening policy language around communicable diseases. Revenue projections for FY21 were adjusted downward due to pandemic-related refunds and reduced policy renewals.

### **4. Unclaimed Property Program**
The **unclaimed property program**, managed by the state treasurer, recovers and returns intangible property (e.g., cash, stocks) to rightful owners. Over the past decade, the program has collected approximately $177 million, contributing an average of $14 million annually to the general fund. In FY20, $20 million was collected, with $7.5 million returned to citizens. The program has upgraded its system to allow online claims and participates in the multi-state database MissingMoney.com. Emerging issues include cryptocurrency, unclaimed retirement checks, and U.S. savings bonds, with states working on centralized solutions.

### **5. Miscellaneous Revenue and Budgeting**
The committee reviewed the **“Other” category** of unrestricted revenues, which includes about 140 varied sources such as interest, abandoned property, and departmental fees. The Department of Administrative Services (DAS) calculates reimbursements for indirect costs and post-retirement benefits, which vary annually. The committee emphasized the importance of tracking and planning for these diverse revenue streams, particularly in light of COVID-19 impacts and legislative changes.

### **6. Financial Reporting and Future Challenges**
The state received a clean audit opinion for FY20, a significant achievement given the challenges of remote work during the pandemic. Discussions highlighted the complexity of budgeting and revenue forecasting, particularly with pending legislation that could impact revenue streams. The committee stressed the need for cautious projections, considering economic recovery, vaccination rates, and potential COVID-19 variants.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Revenue Shortfalls**: COVID-19 has created significant revenue challenges, particularly in transportation and insurance-related funds. Recovery is expected to be slow, with uncertainties around future economic conditions.
- **Infrastructure Funding**: The highway fund and turnpike system face long-term financial pressures, with reduced funding for pavement and bridge improvements starting in 2025.
- **Consumer Protection**: The Insurance Department and unclaimed property program play critical roles in protecting consumers and recovering funds.
- **Budgeting Complexity**: Managing diverse revenue streams and forecasting future revenues remain challenging, particularly with legislative changes and emerging issues like cryptocurrency.

Overall, the meetings underscored the importance of careful financial planning, robust consumer protection mechanisms, and proactive measures to address revenue shortfalls and infrastructure needs in a post-pandemic environment.
