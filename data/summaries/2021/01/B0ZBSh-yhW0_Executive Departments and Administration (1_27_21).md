### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Financial Relief for Municipalities and Pension Systems**
- **House Bill 274 (HB 274)**: This bill seeks to restore the state’s contribution to municipal pension systems for police, firefighters, and teachers, which was eliminated in 2011. Supporters argued that restoring a 5% state contribution would alleviate financial burdens on municipalities, which have faced increased property taxes and reduced services. Opponents expressed concerns about future demands for higher state contributions. Testimony highlighted the significant impact on cities like Nashua, which faces a $4.4 million increase in pension costs.
  
- **House Bill 390 (HB 390)**: This bill proposes extending the amortization period for the state’s $6 billion unfunded pension liability from 2039 to 2044, providing short-term relief to municipalities. While municipal officials supported the bill for easing immediate fiscal pressures, the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) Board of Trustees unanimously opposed it, citing fiduciary concerns and an estimated $1.4 billion increase in long-term costs. The committee voted **14-4** against recommending the bill.

#### **2. Support for First Responders and Public Employees**
- **House Bill 91 (HB 91)**: This bill addresses death benefits for First Responders who die by suicide, recognizing the high rates of PTSD and suicide among these workers. Supporters emphasized the emotional and financial toll on families, with advocates urging the committee to pass the bill to support surviving families and reduce stigma around mental health.

- **House Bill 591 (HB 591)**: Similar to HB 91, this bill creates a presumption that a First Responder’s death by suicide is related to their job, allowing families to receive line-of-duty death benefits. The sponsor highlighted the mental health challenges faced by First Responders and aligned the bill with policies adopted by the U.S. military.

- **House Bill 536 (HB 536)**: This bill provides a one-time death benefit to the families of public works employees who die in the line of duty, recognizing them as First Responders. Testimony emphasized the high-risk nature of public works jobs, particularly highway workers, and the need to honor their sacrifices. The bill received strong bipartisan support.

#### **3. Administrative and Technical Corrections**
- **House Bill 130 (HB 130)**: This bill clarifies the order of deductions for retiree health care premiums between the retirement system and the Department of Administrative Services (DAS). The retirement system seeks administrative clarity, while DAS argues the retiree premium should remain an additional revenue source.

- **House Bill 150 (HB 150)**: This bill corrects technical errors in a 2019 law related to rescue squad activities, removing a restrictive condition that required rescue squad members to recover a lost person to qualify for certain benefits. The change aligns the law with its original intent and passed with unanimous consent.

- **House Bill 173 (HB 173)**: This bill requires the Independent Investment Committee of the retirement system to report investment fees for greater transparency. Testimony highlighted the need for accountability, especially given low returns in 2020. The bill passed with strong support and no expected fiscal impact.

#### **4. Retirement System Reclassification**
- **House Bill 619 (HB 619)**: This bill proposes reclassifying police and fire dispatchers as Group Two members of the retirement system, allowing them to retire earlier due to the high stress of their jobs. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, raised concerns about increased employer costs, while supporters emphasized the critical and stressful nature of dispatchers’ work. The sponsor requested the bill be retained for further research and amendments.
