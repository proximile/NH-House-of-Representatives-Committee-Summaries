**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting on January 26, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 26, 2021, to discuss several education-related bills. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including special education funding, innovative school models, career technical education (CTE), student assessment data, and school safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Special Education Funding (HB 613)**
The committee focused on **HB 613**, a bill aimed at reducing the financial burden on school districts for special education costs. Key points included:
- **Financial Strain on Districts**: School districts, especially smaller ones, face significant financial challenges due to high special education costs, particularly for students requiring intensive services.
- **Proposed Changes**: The bill seeks to lower the threshold for state aid from 3.5 times the average per-pupil cost to 2.5 times, reducing local districts' financial responsibility.
- **Insurance Pool Amendment**: An amendment proposed creating a statewide insurance pool to manage unexpected special education costs, akin to a sick leave bank.
- **Support and Concerns**: The New Hampshire School Boards Association and other stakeholders testified in favor of the bill, citing financial struggles and the need for state support. However, some representatives raised concerns about potential overspending and the need for oversight mechanisms like audits.
- **Equity Issues**: Disparities in special education funding were highlighted, with some districts receiving more state aid than others, raising questions about fairness and resource distribution.
- **Next Steps**: The bill is considered a placeholder for further discussion and potential amendments to address financial and oversight concerns.

### **Innovative Schools (HB 609)**
**HB 609** proposes establishing **Innovative Schools** within the public school system, allowing traditional public schools to request waivers from certain administrative rules to encourage innovation. Key discussions included:
- **Innovation Plans**: Schools can submit Innovation Plans to their local school boards, detailing proposed innovations, waivers sought, and expected benefits. The plans are reviewed by the Department of Education and the State Board of Education.
- **Accountability**: The bill includes provisions for biennial performance reviews, with the State Board able to revoke Innovation Plans if performance is unsatisfactory.
- **Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the potential impact on collective bargaining agreements, teacher certifications, and local property taxes. Opponents argued the bill could divert funds from public schools and lacked transparency.
- **Support**: Proponents emphasized the need for flexibility to experiment with new teaching methods, curricula, and school operations.

### **Career Technical Education (CTE) Funding Study (HB 304)**
**HB 304** proposes establishing a study committee to examine funding for tuition and transportation for CTE programs. Key points included:
- **Barriers to Access**: Transportation and tuition costs are significant barriers to student participation in CTE programs, with New Hampshire's participation rate (15%) lagging behind states like Delaware (65%).
- **Bipartisan Support**: The bill received strong bipartisan support, with representatives emphasizing the importance of CTE in preparing students for skilled careers and addressing workforce needs.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (19-0) and was placed on the consent agenda.

### **School Safety and Employment (HB 432)**
**HB 432** adds **human trafficking** to the list of criminal offenses that disqualify individuals from employment in New Hampshire schools. Key points included:
- **Sponsor and Support**: Representative Su Mullen sponsored the bill, which was supported by the Department of Education and law enforcement stakeholders.
- **Amendment and Outcome**: An amendment removed language about out-of-state offenses to simplify enforcement. The bill, as amended, passed unanimously (18-0) and was placed on the consent agenda.

### **Student Assessment Data (HB 194 and HB 323)**
**HB 194** and **HB 323** address issues related to student assessment data. Key discussions included:
- **SAT Data Retention (HB 194)**: Concerns were raised about the destruction of SAT data after students graduate, which could hinder their future opportunities. The bill aims to ensure students retain access to their SAT scores.
- **Timely Distribution of Assessment Reports (HB 323)**: The bill mandates that schools provide annual assessment reports to parents, teachers, and principals by June 30 each year. Proponents argued this would allow parents to address learning gaps over the summer, while opponents questioned whether schools could meet the deadline.
- **Merging Bills**: Representatives discussed merging the two bills to address shared concerns about data retention and timely communication.
