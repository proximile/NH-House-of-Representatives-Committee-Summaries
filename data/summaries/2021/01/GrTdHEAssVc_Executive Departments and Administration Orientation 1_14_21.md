**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Orientation Meeting – January 14, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Executive Departments and Administration (ED&A) Committee held an orientation meeting on January 14, 2021, conducted electronically via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on two primary topics: emergency powers and the rulemaking process, emphasizing legislative oversight and public transparency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Emergency Powers Overview and Legislative Oversight**
Jill Perlow, a senior assistant attorney general, provided an in-depth overview of New Hampshire’s emergency power statutes, including RSA 4:45-47, RSA 21-P (Homeland Security and Emergency Management), and RSA 141-C (Public Health). Key points included:

1. **Purpose and Scope**: Emergency powers are designed to protect lives and property during natural or human-caused disasters. These powers include assuming control of emergency management forces, evacuating populations, suspending regulations, and accepting federal funds.

2. **Declaration of Emergency**: Both the governor and the legislature can declare a state of emergency. The governor issues executive orders, while the legislature uses concurrent resolutions. Declarations last up to 21 days and can be renewed if conditions persist. The legislature retains the authority to terminate a state of emergency.

3. **Public Health Emergencies**: Specific powers under RSA 141-C allow for measures such as isolation, quarantine, and other actions to control communicable diseases.

4. **Limitations and Oversight**: Emergency powers are limited to actions necessary for public safety and property protection. The legislature has the constitutional authority to suspend laws, though emergency statutes grant the governor broad authority to respond to crises. Questions were raised about the legislature’s role in terminating emergencies and the governor’s authority to modify statutes.

### **Rulemaking Process and Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR)**
The meeting also covered the role and processes of JLCAR and the ED&A Committee in overseeing administrative rulemaking. Key highlights included:

1. **JLCAR’s Role**: JLCAR reviews and approves administrative rules created by state agencies to ensure compliance with statutory authority, legislative intent, and proper formatting. The committee cannot object to rules based on principle but can raise objections if rules exceed authority or have excessive fiscal impact.

2. **Rulemaking Process**: Agencies draft rules, which are meticulously reviewed by legislative staff and attorneys. JLCAR can request changes, and agencies typically comply. If disagreements persist, JLCAR can file a final objection or propose a joint resolution to block a rule, requiring approval from both the House and Senate.

3. **Fiscal Impact and Fees**: Rules undergo fiscal impact analysis, similar to bills, before approval. Agencies cannot impose fines or fees without explicit legislative authority, and revenue from fees typically funds regulatory processes for specific professions or programs.

4. **Broad Rulemaking Authority**: The committee has worked to eliminate broad rulemaking authority in statutes, replacing it with specific directives. For example, the Medicaid program was restructured to operate under specific rulemaking authority rather than broad authority.

5. **Expired Rules and Efficiency**: The committee has addressed expired rules, ensuring agencies do not operate under outdated regulations. The process has become more efficient, with most expired rules updated.

6. **Public Participation and Transparency**: JLCAR meetings are public, and stakeholders can testify during rule hearings. Legislators are encouraged to attend to better understand the rulemaking process.

### **Remote Meetings and Technical Considerations**
The meeting acknowledged the use of Zoom for remote participation, with some members appreciating the flexibility it offers. Technical issues were addressed to ensure compliance with transparency requirements, and attendance roll calls were conducted to maintain accountability.

### **Conclusion**
The orientation meeting underscored the importance of legislative oversight in both emergency powers and administrative rulemaking. Key takeaways included the balance of power between the governor and the legislature during emergencies, the meticulous review process for administrative rules, and the role of public participation in ensuring transparency and accountability. The discussions highlighted the committee’s commitment to aligning agency actions with legislative intent and statutory authority while adapting to the challenges of remote governance during the pandemic.
