**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Orientation Meeting (1/13/21)**

The Judiciary Committee of the New Hampshire House of Representatives held its orientation meeting for the 2021 legislative session on January 13, 2021, conducted remotely via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on introductions, logistical preparations, and procedural adjustments to ensure a productive and safe session. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points discussed:

### **Committee Introductions and Structure**
1. **Opening Remarks**: Chair Ned Gordon welcomed members, explained the remote meeting setup, and confirmed compliance with emergency orders and public access rules. He introduced Jennifer Four, the committee researcher.
2. **Roll Call**: The 19-member committee (10 Republicans and 9 Democrats) introduced themselves, sharing their locations and noting whether anyone was with them. Chair Gordon, Vice Chair Mark McLean, and Clerk Kurt Wolper were identified as the leadership team.
3. **Member Backgrounds**: Members highlighted their professional careers, legislative experience, and areas of expertise, including housing, family law, public policy, and law enforcement.
4. **Committee Goals**: Gordon emphasized a nonpartisan approach to addressing important issues and expressed optimism for productive collaboration. He acknowledged the contributions of former Chair Marjorie Smith.

### **Workload and Upcoming Plans**
1. **Assigned Bills**: The committee has 47 bills to address, with expectations of lengthy hearings. Members were advised to prepare for potential five-day workweeks and extended hearing days.
2. **Bill Organization**: Bills will be grouped by common themes (e.g., right-to-know, court administration, landlord-tenant issues) for efficiency. Some bills may be retained for later consideration if they do not require immediate action.
3. **Hearing Logistics**: Plans include outfitting the legislative office building for hybrid (in-person and remote) hearings, with socially distanced setups and air treatment systems installed in hearing rooms.

### **Health and Safety Measures**
1. **Mask-Wearing**: Gordon encouraged mask-wearing during hearings to minimize health risks.
2. **Hybrid Meetings**: Meetings may be held in double-wide rooms, with committee members participating in person or remotely, while testimony will be conducted via Zoom.

### **Procedural Adjustments for Remote Work**
1. **Remote Testimony**: All testimony will be conducted remotely, with no in-person appearances. The House is considering adopting the Senate’s online system for submitting testimony, which is more efficient than traditional methods.
2. **Technical Support**: The committee is addressing technical challenges related to remote participation, such as Zoom management. Members may be assigned to assist with technical aspects to support the chair.
3. **Executive Sessions**: The policy of not holding executive sessions on the same day as hearings may continue, though this could change. Hearings will require four days' notice.

### **Committee Procedures and Professionalism**
1. **Sponsor Participation**: Traditional practices, such as sponsors not participating in questioning during hearings, may continue. There is uncertainty about whether co-sponsors will be subject to the same rules.
2. **Dress Code**: While there is no formal dress code, the chair suggested dressing professionally, as one would for in-person hearings, to maintain decorum since the public will be watching.
3. **Fairness and Efficiency**: The chair emphasized fairness, efficiency, and respect in committee operations.

### **Overall Tone and Optimism**
Chair Gordon expressed confidence in the committee’s ability to adapt to the challenges of the pandemic. He praised the members for their qualifications and willingness to contribute, setting a positive tone for the session.

In summary, the orientation meeting focused on preparing the Judiciary Committee for a session marked by remote and hybrid operations, ensuring health and safety, and maintaining efficiency and fairness in addressing a substantial legislative workload.
