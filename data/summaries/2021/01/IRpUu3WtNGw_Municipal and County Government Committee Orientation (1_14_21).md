The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ **Municipal and County Government Committee** held an orientation meeting on **January 14, 2021**, conducted virtually via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on educating committee members about their roles, responsibilities, and the structure of municipal and county governments in New Hampshire. Key topics included committee procedures, advocacy efforts by lobbyist groups, and the challenges of governing during the pandemic. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **1. Committee Structure and Responsibilities**  
The **Municipal and County Government Committee** oversees a wide range of county and municipal functions, including nursing homes, corrections, finance, and disputes over state law interpretations. The committee works closely with state departments to manage funding programs, such as the 5% bed tax paid by nursing homes to the state.

### **2. Meeting Procedures and Expectations**  
Chair **Tom Dolan** outlined the rules and expectations for committee meetings:  
- **Decorum and Formality**: Members were reminded to address each other formally and avoid making speeches during questioning.  
- **Voting and Executive Sessions**: Bills will be grouped by subject matter for efficiency. Executive sessions may be held immediately after hearings if consensus is clear, but this will be used judiciously.  
- **Technology and Zoom Meetings**: Due to the pandemic, most meetings will be held virtually. Members were encouraged to assist with managing Zoom meetings if technically capable.  
- **Dress Code**: Members were reminded to dress appropriately for virtual meetings, as they are public-facing.  
- **Weapons Policy**: Members are allowed to carry weapons in the state house but cannot brandish them. Violations will result in immediate action.

### **3. Health and Safety Concerns**  
Several members expressed health-related concerns about attending in-person meetings. The chair emphasized flexibility in meeting formats, including the use of substitutes for those unable to attend. The committee will meet more frequently (Monday through Friday) to accommodate social distancing and evolving pandemic policies.

### **4. Presentations by Lobbyist Groups**  
The committee heard presentations from two organizations advocating for local governments:  

#### **New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA)**  
- Presented by **Margaret Burns** (Executive Director), **Cordell Johnston**, and **Nate Grays**.  
- NHMA provides legal services, training, and advocacy for New Hampshire’s 234 cities and towns. It is non-partisan and funded by municipal dues.  
- Key focuses include resisting unfunded mandates, opposing state preemption of local authority, and supporting efficient local governance.  
- NHMA highlighted that New Hampshire is not a home rule state, meaning municipalities only have authority granted by the state through enabling statutes.  
- Topics discussed included mandates (e.g., elections, solid waste disposal), preemption (e.g., zoning laws), and the differences between cities and towns. SB2 towns (deliberative session and ballot voting) were contrasted with traditional towns (town meetings).  
- The challenges of COVID-19 on town meetings were also addressed.  

#### **New Hampshire Association of Counties (NHAC)**  
- Presented by **Kate Horgan** (Executive Director), **Commissioner Wendy Piper** (Grafton County), and **Commissioner Tom Tombarello** (Rockingham County).  
- NHAC represents New Hampshire’s 10 counties, advocating for county employees and fostering intergovernmental relationships.  
- Counties are responsible for Medicaid-funded long-term care, nursing homes, and county jails. They employ over 5,000 individuals and manage budgets exceeding $630 million.  
- NHAC works with state agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services to advocate for county interests.

### **5. Key Themes and Takeaways**  
- **Collaboration**: The meeting emphasized the importance of collaboration between state, municipal, and county governments to address challenges and support local governance.  
- **Advocacy**: Both NHMA and NHAC play critical roles in advocating for local governments, resisting burdensome state mandates, and providing training and legal support.  
- **Pandemic Challenges**: The pandemic has significantly impacted local governance, particularly town meetings and county services. The committee will need to address these challenges while maintaining flexibility in meeting formats.

### **6. Next Steps**  
Chair Dolan outlined the agenda for future meetings, including hearings, executive sessions, and expectations for committee members. The meeting concluded with members reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and expressing their commitment to effective governance.  

This orientation set the stage for the committee’s work during the legislative session, particularly on issues affecting municipalities and counties. Members were encouraged to stay updated via email and prepare for a busy schedule of meetings and hearings.
