### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting on January 28, 2021

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on January 28, 2021, to discuss a range of bills and issues related to public infrastructure, transportation, and historical preservation. The meeting included testimony from various stakeholders, including representatives from the Department of Transportation (DOT), the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, local residents, and railroad officials. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

#### **Key Bills Discussed**

1. **House Bill 595: Digitization and Preservation of NH Supreme Court Records**
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes a $2 million capital appropriation to digitize and preserve New Hampshire Supreme Court records dating back to the mid-1800s.
   - **Discussion**: The committee heard testimony from Justice Marone and retired judge John Lewis, who emphasized the fragile state of the records and the need for preservation to ensure historical and legal access. Commissioner Charlie Arlinghouse supported the project but noted that court facilities typically enter the capital budget through a different process.
   - **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on the bill during the meeting but retained it for further review, aligning with the practice of bundling large capital appropriations into the capital budget.

2. **House Bill 305: Motorist Service Signs on Limited-Access Highways**
   - **Purpose**: The bill allows for more motorist service signs north of Concord.
   - **Discussion**: The committee unanimously supported the bill, citing fairness and the potential to offset DOT costs. The bill had previously passed the House but stalled in the Senate due to the pandemic.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously to pass the bill.

3. **House Bill 74: Prevention of New Toll Plazas in Merrimack, NH**
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prevent the installation of new toll plazas in Merrimack.
   - **Discussion**: The committee discussed the disproportionate financial burden tolls place on Merrimack residents and the need for equitable toll distribution based on road usage.
   - **Outcome**: A motion to find the bill inexpedient to legislate was made and seconded, with further discussion pending.

4. **House Bill 114: Sound Barriers along Tberry Lane in Bedford**
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes the erection of sound barriers to mitigate noise from the nearby turnpike.
   - **Discussion**: Representative John Graham introduced the bill on behalf of constituents. The DOT testified that Tberry Lane does not meet the criteria for sound barriers due to cost-effectiveness concerns. Committee members expressed reluctance to support the bill due to its lack of funding and the potential for similar requests from other towns.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 20-1 in favor of an "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) motion, recommending that the full House reject the bill.

5. **House Bill 122a: Public-Private Partnership for Railroad Infrastructure**
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes a public-private partnership to maintain rail infrastructure, reducing heavy truck traffic on highways.
   - **Discussion**: Representative John Graham and other stakeholders highlighted the economic and environmental benefits of rail, including reduced road wear and lower maintenance costs. The committee heard detailed testimony on the state’s $6.8 million investment in rail rehabilitation, matched dollar-for-dollar by the railroad.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 21-0 to retain the bill for further review.

#### **Work Session with the Department of Transportation**

The committee also held a work session with the DOT to discuss the department’s structure, priorities, and funding mechanisms. Key points included:

- **DOT Leadership and Structure**: The DOT is led by three commissioners and is responsible for highways, airports, rail, and transit systems.
- **Priorities**: The DOT focuses on safety, maintaining a reliable transportation system, and maximizing the value of every dollar. It prioritizes preserving existing infrastructure over expansion.
- **10-Year Plan**: The DOT develops a financially constrained 10-year transportation plan every two years, prioritizing projects within available funding.
- **Highway and Bridge Maintenance**: The DOT oversees approximately 4,600 center lane miles of highway and 2,161 state bridges, aiming to resurface 550 lane miles annually and reduce the number of structurally deficient "Red List" bridges.
- **Funding Sources**: The DOT’s budget is primarily funded by federal sources and the Turnpike system. The Highway Fund, which includes gas tax revenues, supports the operating budget but is also used by other state agencies.
- **Challenges**: The DOT faces funding challenges, including inflationary pressures and maintaining infrastructure conditions with limited resources.

#### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the importance of sustained investment in transportation infrastructure to maintain safety and economic vitality in New Hampshire. The committee engaged in detailed discussions on various bills and issues, emphasizing the need for equitable solutions, public-private partnerships, and historical preservation. The work session with the DOT provided valuable insights into the department’s priorities and challenges, encouraging the committee to consider funding strategies for long-term needs.
