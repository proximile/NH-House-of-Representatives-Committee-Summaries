### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting on January 29, 2021

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 29, 2021, to discuss several key bills related to energy policy, technology, and regulatory processes. The meeting, held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed a range of issues, including energy efficiency, microgrids, renewable energy funding, and the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 80: Energy Efficiency Fund Reallocation**
- **Overview**: HB 80 proposed reallocating funds from the Energy Efficiency Fund to prioritize energy efficiency programs over direct bill assistance for ratepayers.
- **Debate**: Proponents, including **Representative Mann**, argued that energy efficiency programs provide long-term economic and environmental benefits, such as job creation, reduced energy costs, and lower carbon emissions. Critics expressed concerns about the impact on low-income households and the rushed nature of the process.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **11-10** in favor of an **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** motion, effectively halting the bill’s progress.

#### **HB 169: Double Utility Poles**
- **Overview**: HB 169 addressed the issue of double utility poles in New Hampshire, focusing on safety concerns, property value impacts, and inefficiencies in removing unused poles.
- **Debate**: The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Chair, **Diane Martin**, supported a study commission, while the New England Cable and Telecommunications Association argued the PUC already has the authority to resolve the issue.
- **Outcome**: The committee held a public hearing, with no immediate vote taken.

#### **HB 376: Microgrid Study Committee**
- **Overview**: HB 376 proposed establishing a study committee to explore the applications of microgrids in New Hampshire, including necessary legal and regulatory changes.
- **Support**: Representatives and stakeholders, including **Representative David Muse**, highlighted microgrids’ potential for disaster resilience, cybersecurity, and renewable energy integration.
- **Concerns**: High costs and existing regulatory barriers were discussed, but the long-term benefits of energy independence and cost savings were emphasized.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **17-4** to retain the bill for further study.

#### **HB 382: Demand Charges Study**
- **Overview**: HB 382 aimed to create a commission to study the impact of demand charges on businesses, particularly seasonal and industrial users.
- **Support**: Stakeholders, including **Madeline Monroe** from Clean Energy NH, argued that demand charges disproportionately affect seasonal businesses and hinder energy efficiency investments.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives, including **Representative Thomas**, raised concerns about potential cost shifts to residential ratepayers.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **20-1** to retain the bill for further consideration.

#### **HB 614: Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) Exemptions**
- **Overview**: HB 614 proposed exempting state agencies and political subdivisions from RPS fees to provide property tax relief.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill would prevent "double taxation" and allow municipalities to allocate savings to local priorities.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including **Heidi Kroll** (Granite State Hydropower Association), warned that the bill would undermine renewable energy funding and harm local producers.
- **Debate**: The committee discussed an amendment to address cost-shifting concerns but remained divided on the bill’s overall impact.
- **Outcome**: No immediate vote was taken, with plans for further review.

#### **HB 624: Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) Fee Reduction**
- **Overview**: HB 624 proposed reducing the fee for declaratory rulings from $10,500 to $250 to increase public access to the SEC process.
- **Support**: Advocates argued the current high fees discourage public participation and limit accountability.
- **Concerns**: SEC Chair **Diane Martin** expressed concerns about the financial sustainability of the committee if fees were reduced.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **10-10**, resulting in no recommendation. Plans for a floor amendment to clarify the fee reduction for individuals and small entities were discussed.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Energy Efficiency**: Several bills, including HB 80 and HB 382, emphasized the importance of energy efficiency in reducing costs, creating jobs, and lowering carbon emissions.
2. **Renewable Energy**: HB 614 and HB 624 highlighted tensions between renewable energy goals, public access, and financial sustainability.
3. **Resilience and Innovation**: Microgrids (HB 376) were discussed as a solution for disaster resilience, cybersecurity, and renewable energy integration.
4. **Public Access and Fairness**: The committee grappled with balancing public access to regulatory processes (e.g., SEC fees in HB 624) with the need for sustainable funding and accountability.
5. **Economic Impact**: Many discussions centered on the economic implications of policy changes, including potential cost shifts, property tax relief, and funding for renewable energy projects.

### **Procedural Challenges**
The hybrid meeting format (in-person and virtual) presented technical difficulties, particularly during voting. The committee acknowledged the need to streamline processes for future meetings.

### **Conclusion**
The January 29, 2021, meeting of the Science, Technology, and Energy Committee reflected the complexity of balancing legislative priorities, stakeholder input, and procedural efficiency. Key decisions included retaining HB 376 (microgrids) and HB 382 (demand charges) for further study, while HB 80 (energy efficiency) was halted. The committee remains divided on issues like RPS exemptions (HB 614) and SEC fee reductions (HB 624), with plans for further amendments and discussions. The session underscored the challenges of addressing energy policy in a way that balances economic, environmental, and public interests.
