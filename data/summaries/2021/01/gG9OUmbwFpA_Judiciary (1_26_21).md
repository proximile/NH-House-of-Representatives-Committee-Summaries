The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on January 26, 2021, to discuss several key bills and constitutional amendments.

Below is a detailed summary of the discussions:

### **Key Bills and Proposals Discussed:**

1. **HB 420: Drug Policy Reform and Forfeiture Funds**
   - **Purpose**: Redirect funds from the state drug forfeiture fund to support substance misuse treatment and prevention programs, rather than primarily funding law enforcement.
   - **Support**: Advocates, including Representative Rice and Americans for Prosperity, argued that this approach would ensure drug traffickers fund the recovery of their victims and provide a common-sense solution to substance abuse. They emphasized that law enforcement would still be reimbursed for costs, with excess funds allocated to treatment.
   - **Opposition**: Law enforcement representatives, such as Detective Lieutenant Josh Albert, opposed the bill, warning that diverting funds would hinder drug investigations and reduce accountability for traffickers. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) noted potential administrative challenges in managing increased funds.
   - **Outcome**: The committee heard extensive testimony but made no immediate decision, highlighting the tension between supporting treatment programs and maintaining law enforcement resources.

2. **HB 331: Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform**
   - **Purpose**: Restrict the transfer of seized property to federal agencies unless the property contains at least $100,000 in currency.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued this would protect citizens' due process rights and close a loophole in state forfeiture laws.
   - **Opposition**: Law enforcement representatives warned it could cripple drug enforcement programs and community initiatives funded by forfeiture proceeds.
   - **Outcome**: The committee recognized the complexity of balancing property rights with law enforcement needs.

3. **CACR 6: Raising the Mandatory Retirement Age for Judges**
   - **Purpose**: Amend the state constitution to raise the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.
   - **Support**: Supporters, including Representative Lynn and former Speaker Donna Sytek, argued that judges at 70 are often at their peak and that extending the age would retain experienced judges. They suggested a review process to ensure judges remain fit for service.
   - **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about delaying opportunities for younger, more diverse judges and the need for judicial turnover.
   - **Outcome**: The committee heard testimony from retired judges and stakeholders but deferred a decision pending further analysis.

4. **HB 481: Establishment of a Right-to-Know Ombudsman**
   - **Purpose**: Create an Ombudsman to mediate disputes over access to public records under the Right-to-Know Law, providing a faster and cheaper alternative to court.
   - **Support**: Organizations like Right to Know New Hampshire and the New Hampshire Municipal Association supported the bill, citing the need for transparency and accountability. A sunset clause was included to allow reevaluation after a few years.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the Ombudsman’s enforcement authority, potential costs, and the handling of confidential documents.
   - **Outcome**: The committee acknowledged the need for further refinement but generally supported the bill’s intent to improve access to public records.

5. **HB 248: Judicial Retirement Plan Reform**
   - **Purpose**: Modify the judicial retirement plan for judges appointed after the bill’s enactment to address financial sustainability.
   - **Key Changes**: Raise the minimum retirement age, adjust the pension formula, and introduce actuarial reductions for joint annuities and disability benefits.
   - **Support**: Retired Chief Justice Bob Lynn and Richard Head of the judicial branch testified in favor of the bill, emphasizing the need to reduce the state’s financial burden while maintaining reasonable benefits.
   - **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the impact on judicial recruitment and gender equity.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously to retain the bill for further study.

6. **HB 566: Sealing and Unsealing of Non-Public Session Records**
   - **Purpose**: Address the issue of non-public session minutes remaining sealed after the circumstances justifying their secrecy no longer apply, particularly in property transactions.
   - **Support**: Advocates like David Sad of Right to Know New Hampshire emphasized the need for transparency and accountability.
   - **Concerns**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed automatic unsealing after a year, suggesting technical changes to align with existing law.
   - **Outcome**: The committee debated the bill’s scope and intent, focusing on balancing transparency with the protection of sensitive information.
