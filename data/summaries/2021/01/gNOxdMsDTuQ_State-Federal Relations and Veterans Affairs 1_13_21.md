### **Veterans Healthcare and Services**
1. **VA Medical Center Updates**: Kevin Forrest, Director of the Manchester VA Medical Center, provided an overview of VA services, including primary care, mental health, women’s health, specialty care, surgical services, pain management, rehabilitation, and long-term care. Telehealth services are expanding to reduce travel for veterans. The Manchester VA serves 25,000 veterans, while the White River Junction VA serves 10,000, primarily from the Hanover-Lebanon area.

2. **Facility Expansions**: New construction projects at the Manchester VA include a building for urgent care, mental health, and women’s health services, expected to be completed in summer 2021. Compliance with COVID-19 safety measures is a priority, especially for women veterans who may have experienced military sexual trauma.

3. **Urgent Care and Community Partnerships**: Veterans have access to urgent care seven days a week at the Manchester VA and can also use community providers under the Mission Act. Emergency care is covered in New Hampshire.

4. **Special Programs**: The Manchester VA offers specialized clinics for women veterans and LGBT veterans, ensuring a safe and inclusive environment. The VA collaborates with community providers and other VA facilities to ensure comprehensive care.

5. **Challenges and Initiatives**: Dental services are currently unavailable due to COVID-19, with plans to reopen after facility upgrades. Strict eligibility criteria for dental care require veterans to have a 100% service-connected disability. COVID-19 vaccination clinics are operational, with a focus on vaccinating all veterans who want it.

### **Legislative Priorities**
1. **State Veterans Advisory Committee (SVAC)**: Paul Lloyd, Chairman of the SVAC, provided an overview of the committee’s role, history, and legislative priorities. The SVAC focuses on veterans’ issues, collaborates with legislators, and tracks bills related to veterans’ affairs.

2. **Bills and Resolutions**: The committee is currently tracking five legislative service requests (LSRs) related to veterans’ issues, including the use of force at National Guard facilities, Gold Star family decals, and extended imprisonment for assaulting military personnel.

3. **Veterans Bill of Rights**: Legislative efforts include improving recruitment for the NH National Guard through tuition waivers and financial incentives, addressing veteran homelessness, and expanding veterans’ benefits. The Veterans Bill of Rights mandates additional services, requiring more staff and resources.

### **Staffing and Operational Challenges**
1. **Nursing Home Certification and Staffing**: Questions were raised about the certification of the veterans’ nursing home. It was clarified that the facility is certified annually through the VA but not through Medicare or Medicaid, as the VA process mirrors CMS standards. Staffing shortages, particularly for licensed nursing assistants (LNAs), were addressed, with efforts to improve wages and shift differentials to attract and retain staff.

2. **Collaboration with Nursing Programs**: Partnerships with state nursing programs (e.g., UNH, Plymouth State) aim to bring nursing students into clinical settings to help address staffing shortages.

3. **New Hampshire Veterans Home**: The NH Veterans Home provides nursing home care to 250 veterans, including those with dementia. COVID-19 has significantly impacted operations, limiting visitation and requiring creative solutions like virtual visits. Eligibility for the Veterans Home includes New Hampshire residency and honorable discharge, with special consideration for National Guard and Reserve members. Initiatives include upgrading nurse call systems, sprinkler systems, and security cameras, as well as developing an in-house LNA training program.

### **Closing Remarks and Future Focus**
1. **Veteran Suicide Prevention**: Veteran suicide remains a top priority, with emphasis on promoting the Veterans Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255, press 1).

2. **Chairman’s Encouragement**: The chair encouraged members to stay informed, collaborate, and reach out to him for assistance with veterans’ issues. He shared his contact information and expressed optimism about the committee’s ability to work together effectively.

3. **Commitment to Veterans**: The meeting concluded with members expressing gratitude for the opportunity to serve and support veterans’ needs. The committee reaffirmed its commitment to addressing healthcare, housing, legislative priorities, and challenges posed by COVID-19 and an aging veteran population.
