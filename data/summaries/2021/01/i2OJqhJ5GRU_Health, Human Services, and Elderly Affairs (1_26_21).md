The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee meeting on January 26, 2021, addressed a wide range of bills and issues related to public health, human services, and elder care. The discussions were conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the meeting focused on streamlining regulations, reducing administrative burdens, and addressing public health and safety concerns. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key topics and debates from the meeting:

---

### **Homemade Food Businesses and Food Safety**
Several bills aimed at supporting home-based food businesses were discussed, reflecting the economic challenges of the pandemic. **House Bill 314 (HB 314)** sought to amend regulations on homestead food operations, allowing individuals to produce and sell non-potentially hazardous, shelf-stable foods from their homes without a license. The bill also proposed removing the $20,000 annual sales cap and expanding sales channels, including online platforms and farmers' markets.

While advocates, such as Americans for Prosperity and the Institute for Justice, argued that the bill would reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and support entrepreneurship, public health officials raised concerns about food safety, particularly regarding the sale of potentially hazardous foods without inspection. The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further refinement to address these concerns.

### **Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) and Reporting Requirements**
**House Bill 31 (HB 31)** focused on updating reporting requirements for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in healthcare facilities. The bill aimed to reduce administrative burdens by eliminating outdated measures like CLIP and SKIP, aligning with federal practices that emphasize outcome measures rather than process measures. Supporters, including the New Hampshire Hospital Association, highlighted the importance of maintaining high infection control standards while reducing unnecessary reporting.

---

### **Direct Primary Care and Healthcare Access**
**House Bill 290 (HB 290)** proposed extending the direct primary care model to healthcare facilities, allowing them to accept only direct payments and bypass insurance billing. Advocates argued that this model would reduce bureaucratic costs, increase transparency, and benefit rural areas and gig economy workers. However, opponents, including the New Hampshire Hospital Association, expressed concerns about its impact on charity care policies and critical access hospitals, particularly in rural areas.

### **Opioid Crisis and Alternative Pain Treatments**
**House Bill 247 (HB 247)** sought to address the opioid crisis by promoting alternative pain treatments, such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, and massage therapy, before prescribing opioids. Supporters emphasized the effectiveness of these non-addictive treatments and the need for insurance coverage to reduce opioid dependence. However, medical professionals and insurers raised concerns about legislative overreach, the financial impact of insurance mandates, and the impracticality of mandating specific treatments in acute or emergency situations. The committee recommended retaining the bill for further refinement.

### **Repealing the Therapeutic Use of Cannabis Advisory Council**
The committee unanimously supported repealing the Therapeutic Use of Cannabis Advisory Council, as it had fulfilled its mission of assisting in the creation of the state’s medical marijuana program, now overseen by the Medical Oversight Board.

---

### **State Health Assessment and Improvement Plan Council (SHA/SHIP)**
**House Bill 157 (HB 157)** proposed repealing the SHA/SHIP Council, which conducts statewide health assessments and develops improvement plans to address healthcare gaps and inefficiencies. Opponents, including healthcare professionals and public health advocates, argued that the council is essential for coordinating care, addressing disparities, and improving health outcomes. They emphasized its cost-effectiveness and role in strategic planning, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics of the bill suggested modifying the council’s charge rather than repealing it entirely.

### **Protective Orders for Vulnerable Adults**
**House Bill 246 (HB 246)** aimed to protect vulnerable adults (e.g., elderly or disabled individuals) from abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation by allowing courts to issue temporary protective orders. While supporters, including elder law attorneys, highlighted the urgent need for such protections, opponents raised concerns about due process and potential firearm confiscation. The bill was amended to remove explicit references to firearms, but critics argued that judges could still interpret the law broadly. The committee scheduled further testimony and discussion for February 8th.

---

### **Healthcare Reform Oversight**
**House Bill 244 (HB 244)** proposed expanding the Joint Healthcare Reform Oversight Committee to discuss healthcare reform ideas more broadly and streamline legislative processes. The bill aimed to reduce redundancy in committee hearings and focus on issues like the Affordable Care Act and market forces in healthcare. Questions were raised about its potential impact on insured residents and the scope of its focus.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Regulatory Streamlining**: Many bills aimed to reduce administrative burdens and unnecessary regulations, particularly in healthcare reporting and home-based businesses.
2. **Public Health and Safety**: Discussions highlighted the tension between deregulation and the need to maintain public health standards, especially in food safety and infection control.
3. **Healthcare Access and Costs**: Debates centered on improving access to care, reducing costs, and addressing the opioid crisis through alternative treatments and innovative payment models.
4. **Protecting Vulnerable Populations**: Bills like HB 246 emphasized the need to protect vulnerable adults from abuse and exploitation, though concerns about due process and property rights were raised.
5. **Strategic Planning**: The SHA/SHIP Council debate underscored the importance of statewide health planning and coordination, particularly in addressing disparities and improving outcomes.

Overall, the meeting reflected a balance between reducing regulatory burdens, addressing public health challenges, and ensuring protections for vulnerable populations. Many bills were referred to subcommittees for further refinement to address concerns raised during the discussions.
