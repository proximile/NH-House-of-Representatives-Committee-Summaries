**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (1/29/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 29, 2021, centered on proposed changes to election laws, with discussions spanning primary dates, absentee ballot access, vote counting, and ballot design. The meeting highlighted a mix of technical, logistical, and philosophical considerations aimed at improving the fairness, accessibility, and efficiency of the electoral process. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

### **Primary Date Adjustments**
Several bills addressed the timing of New Hampshire’s state primary, with the goal of ensuring compliance with federal requirements and improving voter engagement:
- **HB 97**: Proposed moving the primary from September to August to provide more time for absentee ballots, particularly for military and overseas voters. Supporters argued it would align New Hampshire with 16 other states holding August primaries and address postal delays. Opponents, including the Secretary of State’s office, cited historical precedent and concerns about lower voter turnout due to summer vacations.
- **HB 98**: Sought to move the primary to June to extend the general election campaign period and increase voter engagement. Supporters, including a college student, highlighted the potential for greater youth involvement. Critics raised concerns about the impact on third-party candidates, who would have less time to gather signatures, and the challenges of campaigning in inclement weather.
- **HB 537**: Proposed a more modest adjustment, moving the primary one week earlier in September to ensure compliance with the 45-day federal requirement for mailing absentee ballots. This bill was supported as a practical housekeeping measure.

### **Absentee Ballot Access**
- **HB 223**: Aimed to simplify the process for political parties to access lists of absentee ballot requests. Currently, only statewide candidates can request these lists and designate their party as their agent. The bill would allow parties to directly subscribe to these lists, streamlining the process and ensuring access even in election cycles without statewide candidates.

### **Vote Counting and Overvoting**
- **HB 505**: Addressed the issue of overvoting, where a voter selects more candidates than there are positions available. The bill proposed counting votes where a voter selects fewer candidates than the total number of positions, even if they select more than one. This change would better reflect voters’ intentions, particularly in races with multiple candidates or seats.

### **Approval Voting and Ballot Column Rotation**
- **HB 505 (Approval Voting)**: Proposed implementing "approval voting," allowing voters to vote for as many candidates as they approve of in multi-candidate races. Supporters argued it would reduce strategic voting, empower voters, and address the "spoiler effect." Critics noted its lack of an ordinal component and compared it unfavorably to ranked-choice voting.
- **HB 514 (Ballot Column Rotation)**: Aimed to simplify the process of rotating party columns on ballots to ensure fairness, particularly after redistricting. The bill proposed removing the 1% deviation requirement in the current formula, which the Secretary of State’s office described as overly complex and time-consuming. The change would maintain fairness while reducing administrative burdens.

### **Key Themes and Considerations**
Throughout the meeting, several recurring themes emerged:
1. **Federal Compliance**: Ensuring New Hampshire’s election laws meet federal requirements, particularly regarding the 45-day window for mailing absentee ballots.
2. **Voter Engagement**: Balancing the need for accessible and fair elections with concerns about voter turnout, especially during summer months or for third-party candidates.
3. **Military and Overseas Voters**: Addressing the unique challenges faced by service members in receiving and returning ballots.
4. **Administrative Efficiency**: Simplifying processes like ballot column rotation and absentee ballot access to reduce administrative burdens while maintaining fairness.
5. **Voter Intent**: Improving vote-counting methods to better reflect voters’ intentions, particularly in multi-candidate races.

The meeting underscored the complexity of election law reform, with lawmakers grappling with competing priorities and the need to balance tradition, fairness, and practicality in shaping New Hampshire’s electoral processes.
