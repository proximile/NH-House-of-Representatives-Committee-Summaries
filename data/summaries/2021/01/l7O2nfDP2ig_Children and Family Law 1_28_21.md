**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Children and Family Law – January 28, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Children and Family Law Committee convened on January 28, 2021, to discuss several bills aimed at improving the juvenile justice system and child welfare. The meeting, conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on three key pieces of legislation: **House Bill 188 (HB 188)**, **House Bill 427 (HB 427)**, and **House Bill 254 (HB 254)**. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and key points.

### **House Bill 188: Juvenile Justice Reform and Legal Representation**

HB 188 seeks to improve the juvenile justice system by ensuring timely and effective legal representation for juveniles. Key provisions and discussions include:

1. **Early Appointment of Counsel**: The bill mandates that legal counsel be appointed when a delinquency petition is filed, ensuring juveniles have representation before their first court appearance. This addresses delays that currently leave many juveniles without counsel early in the process.
   
2. **Waiver of Counsel**: Juveniles and their parents are prohibited from waiving the right to counsel without first consulting an attorney, protecting juveniles from uninformed decisions.

3. **Police Interrogation**: Juveniles must have access to counsel before police interrogation, and statements made without counsel cannot be used in court, safeguarding against coerced or uninformed statements.

4. **Elimination of Parental Fees**: The bill removes the requirement for parents to pay for their child’s legal representation, ensuring access to counsel regardless of financial ability.

5. **Flat Fee Contracts**: The current flat fee system for indigent defense lawyers is criticized for discouraging thorough case preparation. HB 188 proposes moving to an hourly rate system to incentivize better representation.

6. **Disability and Juvenile Justice**: Children with disabilities are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system and face greater challenges. The bill emphasizes the need for early and skilled legal representation to protect their rights.

7. **Fiscal Impact**: While the bill is widely supported, concerns about increased costs for indigent defense were raised. The committee unanimously voted to send the bill to the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) for a fiscal note.

8. **Support from Stakeholders**: Testimonies from the National Juvenile Defender Center (NJDC), the Disability Rights Center, and other advocates highlighted systemic issues in New Hampshire’s juvenile defense system, including delays in appointing counsel and the need for specialized juvenile defense attorneys.

### **House Bill 427: Prohibiting Corporal Punishment in State Care**

HB 427 aims to prohibit corporal punishment against children in state custody or under state agency programs. Key points include:

1. **Negative Effects of Corporal Punishment**: Testimonies from Representative Alissa, Dr. Skip Baran, and others cited research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), linking corporal punishment to mental health issues, aggression, and antisocial behavior.

2. **State-Sponsored Care**: Moira O’Neal from the Office of the Child Advocate emphasized the importance of prohibiting corporal punishment in state care to model best practices and protect vulnerable children.

3. **Amendment**: A proposed amendment would expand the definition of "agency" to include entities with agreements with the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Education.

4. **Support**: The bill received strong support from legislators and advocates, with no opposition noted. Rebecca Ross from the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) clarified that DCYF already prohibits corporal punishment in foster care and residential care licensing rules.

### **House Bill 254: Secure Placement of Minors**

HB 254 addresses the placement of minors in secure facilities, specifically the Sununu Youth Services Center. Key discussions include:

1. **Current Status**: The number of children at the Sununu Center has significantly decreased, from over 100 in 2017 to just 8 in early 2021.

2. **Bill Provisions**: HB 254 proposes limiting incarceration to serious violent offenses, allowing more children to receive community-based services. An amendment delays implementation by six months to allow courts and DHHS time to adjust.

3. **Support for Community-Based Treatment**: Advocates from Waypoint, the Juvenile Reform Project, and the Disability Rights Center emphasized the negative effects of incarceration on children, such as increased trauma and future engagement with the adult correction system. Community-based treatment was highlighted as more effective and humane.

4. **Concerns**: Rebecca Ross from DHHS expressed concerns about unintended consequences, including the potential for increased certification of juveniles as adults and challenges in placing children with aggressive behaviors in alternative programs.

5. **Behavioral Health Resources**: Erica Angelli from DHHS discussed ongoing efforts to expand community-based behavioral health services, including mobile crisis teams and intensive programs.

6. **Public Support**: Twenty individuals signed in to support the bill, with no opposition registered.

### **Outcome and Next Steps**

- **HB 188**: The committee unanimously voted to send the bill to the LBA for a fiscal note to assess financial implications.
- **HB 427**: The bill received strong support, with a proposed amendment to broaden its scope.
- **HB 254**: The committee concluded the hearing without a vote, planning to discuss the bill further in a future work session.

The committee plans to reconvene to continue discussions and finalize recommendations.
