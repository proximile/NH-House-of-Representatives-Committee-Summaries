The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee held its orientation meeting on January 12, 2021, to prepare for the upcoming legislative session. The meeting focused on introductions, committee responsibilities, procedural matters, and adapting to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns. Key highlights from the meeting include:

### **Introductions and Committee Purpose**
Committee members introduced themselves, sharing their professional backgrounds, legislative experience, and personal connections to New Hampshire. Many members highlighted expertise in fields such as real estate, education, law, engineering, and public service, emphasizing their readiness to contribute to the committee’s work. The Ways and Means Committee is tasked with examining the state’s treasury, reviewing bills related to state taxes, fees, and revenue-raising methods, and preparing revenue estimates for the state budget. It also plays a critical role in analyzing and reporting on financial legislation.

### **Challenges and Processes**
The committee faces a tight timeline, with revenue estimates due by mid-February and bills requiring swift processing. The chair stressed the importance of collaboration, factual analysis, and bipartisan cooperation in addressing the state’s financial matters. Subcommittees will be formed to handle specific bills, and work sessions will be conducted to debate and finalize revenue estimates. Members were encouraged to actively engage in these processes.

### **Hybrid/Virtual Meetings and Security Concerns**
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee is operating under emergency protocols, conducting hybrid or fully virtual meetings. The chair discussed logistical challenges, including scheduling, public hearings, and ensuring participation from all members. Security threats to state capitols were also mentioned, with plans in place to transition to fully virtual meetings if necessary.

### **Committee Procedures and Rules**
The committee operates under Mason’s Manual (not Robert’s Rules) for procedural matters. The chair outlined rules for punctuality, decorum during public hearings, and the importance of listening to testimony without debating or making judgments during hearings. Members were reminded to read bills in advance, prepare questions, and take notes to ensure efficient hearings.

### **Revenue and Budget Discussions**
The committee reviewed the state’s revenue streams, taxes, and fees, focusing on the roles of the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA). Key revenue sources, such as business taxes, interest, dividends, and lottery funds, were discussed, along with the importance of understanding monthly revenue percentages. The governor’s budget presentation and the February 18th deadline for second committee bills were highlighted, with discussions about potential deadline extensions due to remote work challenges.

### **Remote Meeting Logistics**
The transition to remote meetings posed several logistical challenges, including monitoring public participation, ensuring access to materials, and managing Zoom licenses. Concerns were raised about the cost and logistics of printing bills and handouts at home, with suggestions to have materials mailed or bundled for pickup. The use of color-coded documents for better readability was also discussed.

### **Public Testimony and Sign-Up Process**
The committee explored how to handle public testimony remotely, including the use of virtual “pink cards” (for testifiers) and “blue sheets” (for supporters). The process for these was still being developed, with a focus on ensuring public access and participation in virtual hearings.

### **Technical and Logistical Support**
Members emphasized the need for technical assistance to manage Zoom meetings effectively, including monitoring public participation and ensuring smooth operations during remote hearings. The committee also discussed the importance of preparing for upcoming deadlines and refining bills through subcommittee work.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting set the stage for the committee’s work in the upcoming legislative session, emphasizing collaboration, efficiency, and adaptability in the face of logistical, technical, and security challenges. Members were encouraged to actively participate in subcommittees, work sessions, and public hearings to address the state’s financial matters effectively.
