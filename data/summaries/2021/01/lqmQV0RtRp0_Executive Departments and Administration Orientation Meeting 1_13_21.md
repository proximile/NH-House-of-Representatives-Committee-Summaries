### **Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Orientation Meeting – January 13, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held an orientation meeting on January 13, 2021, focused on the Executive Departments and Administration (EDNA) Committee’s responsibilities, including the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** and the **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**. The meeting was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 state of emergency and provided an overview of key agencies, their functions, challenges, and ongoing reforms. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key points:

---

### **1. Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**

#### **Overview and Functions**
- **Establishment**: Created in 2015 under Governor Hassan to consolidate licensing boards previously managed by various state agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services.
- **Purpose**: To promote efficiency in administering professional licensing boards while maintaining their regulatory authority.
- **Scope**: Oversees **54 licensing boards** and the **Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)**, with over **300 volunteer board members**.
- **Functions**:
  - Licensing individuals to practice professions in New Hampshire.
  - Enforcing compliance through investigations and inspections.
- **Statistics**:
  - In FY 2020, there were **223,000 active occupational licenses**, a 29% increase from the previous year.
  - Approximately **1,100 complaints** were cataloged, though underreporting is likely due to inconsistent tracking.
  - OPLC has **67 permanent classified positions**, with 17 dedicated to enforcement and 39 to licensing.

#### **Challenges**
- **Part-Time Workforce**: Heavy reliance on part-time staff leads to high turnover and inefficiency.
- **Funding**: Self-funded through licensing fees, but the dedicated fund lapses at the end of each fiscal year, creating financial constraints.
- **Rulemaking**: Accounted for **20% of the state’s rulemaking proposals** in 2018, a significant workload for a small agency.
- **Mission Clarity**: Struggles to define its mission distinct from the boards it administers, leading to operational inefficiencies.

#### **Reorganization Efforts**
- **FY 2021 Reorganization**: Major changes include:
  - Consolidating licensing and enforcement processes across boards.
  - Improving efficiency by integrating staff functions rather than having separate teams for each board.
  - Addressing inconsistencies in complaint tracking and investigations.
- **Future Goals**:
  - Streamline processes to reduce barriers to workforce entry while maintaining public safety.
  - Develop a clear agency mission and vision distinct from the boards’ regulatory functions.

#### **Legislative Context**
- **Legislation**: In 2020, **13 bills** related to OPLC were introduced, though none were enacted. In 2021, **9 Legislative Service Requests (LSRs)** were filed, most assigned to the EDNA committee.
- **Historical Changes**: Over **100 legislative changes** since 2007, impacting contribution rates, state subsidies, and administrative processes.

#### **Key Takeaways**
- OPLC is working to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary barriers to workforce entry.
- The agency faces challenges with funding, staffing, and mission clarity but is making progress through reorganization and legislative engagement.

### **2. New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**

#### **Overview and Structure**
- **Establishment**: Created in 1967 as a contributory, multi-employer defined benefit plan.
- **Coverage**: Includes state employees, teachers, police, firefighters, and some local employees.
- **Governance**: Overseen by a Board of Trustees and operates under RSA 100-A and the New Hampshire Constitution.

#### **Membership and Benefits**
- **Participants**: 461 participating employers, with membership divided into four classes: employees (over 50%), teachers (declining), police (less than 5%), and fire (about 2%).
- **Retirees**: Nearly 40,000 retirees, with an annual benefit payout of **$816 million**, 80% of which stays in New Hampshire.
- **Medical Subsidy**: A closed group of about 10,000 retirees and beneficiaries receive a medical subsidy, which is being phased out.

#### **Investment and Funding**
- **Investment Program**: Managed by a 13-member Board of Trustees and an independent investment committee. Returns for FY 2020 were 1.1%, but performance rebounded significantly afterward.
- **Unfunded Liability**: The unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) is approximately **$6.04 billion**, with a funded ratio of 61%.
- **Assumed Rate of Return**: Reduced to **6.75%** in 2020, increasing the UAAL by approximately $900 million but deemed necessary for long-term sustainability.

#### **Challenges and Reforms**
- **Legislative and Legal Context**: The NH Supreme Court upheld legislative changes to the retirement system, introducing the “unmistakability doctrine,” which allows future legislatures to modify plan provisions.
- **Recent Initiatives**: Enhancing cybersecurity, upgrading the pension application system, and launching a contact center for member inquiries.

### **4. Key Themes and Next Steps**
- **Efficiency and Transparency**: Both OPLC and NHRS are focused on improving efficiency, transparency, and public trust through reorganization, technology integration, and legislative engagement.
- **Workforce and Funding**: Challenges related to part-time staffing, funding constraints, and unfunded liabilities are being addressed through reforms and strategic planning.
- **Legislative Engagement**: Both agencies are actively engaging with the legislature to clarify their missions, streamline processes, and ensure sustainable operations.

The meeting concluded with a commitment from representatives to support these efforts, ensuring that both OPLC and NHRS continue to serve the public effectively while addressing ongoing challenges.
