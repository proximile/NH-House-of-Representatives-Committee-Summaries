While animal welfare bills dominated recent sessions, fewer are expected this year.

Members were asked to indicate their preferences for subcommittee assignments, with each subcommittee limited to about six members.  
4. **Consent Calendar**: Bills with unanimous committee support and no fiscal notes can be placed on the consent calendar, allowing them to pass with a single vote on the House floor unless a member objects.  
5. **Committee Amendments**: Most bills require amendments, often due to typos or issues identified during testimony. Members typically volunteer to draft these amendments.
