### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee Meeting – January 29, 2021

The New Hampshire House of Representatives State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee convened on January 29, 2021, to discuss a wide range of issues, including state-federal relations, veterans affairs, immigration, constitutional amendments, and controversial media content. Conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting featured testimonies, debates, and votes on several bills and resolutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. National Guard and State-Federal Relations**
- **HB 580**: This bill proposed requiring the governor’s consent for the federalization of the New Hampshire National Guard unless there is a declaration of war, an invasion, or enforcement of U.S. laws. Supporters, including Representative Jess Edwards, argued it would prevent executive overreach and align with constitutional principles. However, opponents, including members of the State Veterans Advisory Committee and Deputy Adjutant General Warren Perry, warned that the bill could hinder the National Guard’s ability to respond to emergencies and risk losing up to $100 million in federal funding annually. The debate highlighted the tension between state sovereignty and federal control over military resources.
- **National Guard Operations**: Discussions also covered the operational tempo of the National Guard under Title 10 (federal) and Title 32 (state/federal) statuses, including deployments for disaster relief, pandemic response, and support for state agencies like the Department of Corrections.

### **2. Immigration and Deportation (HB 112)**
- **HB 112** proposed a study on the economic and social impacts of deportations on New Hampshire families, particularly mixed-status families (those with U.S. citizens and undocumented members). Testimonies from advocates, including Maggie Fogerty (American Friends Service Committee) and Bruno Soria (Catholic Charities), emphasized the devastating effects of deportations, such as economic instability, psychological trauma, and increased reliance on public assistance. Supporters argued the study would provide critical data to inform policy, while opponents questioned the necessity, citing immigration as a federal responsibility. The debate underscored the human and financial costs of deportation policies on local communities.

### **3. Convention of States (HCR1)**
- **HCR1** called for a **Convention of States** under **Article V of the U.S. Constitution** to propose amendments addressing fiscal restraint, limiting federal power, and setting term limits for federal officials. Supporters, including Don Bolduc and Mark Meckler, argued the convention was necessary to rein in federal overreach and restore states’ rights. Opponents, including the John Birch Society and the ACLU, expressed concerns about a “runaway convention” that could lead to unintended constitutional changes. Supporters countered that the ratification process (requiring 38 states) would ensure broad consensus and prevent excessive amendments.

### **4. Veterans’ Issues**
- **House Resolution 8** focused on veteran suicide prevention and the overprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines. The committee discussed the high suicide rates among veterans and the need to investigate contributing factors, including PTSD and inadequate counseling services. An amendment expanded the resolution to include alternative care methods and other psychoactive substances. The resolution passed unanimously, reflecting the committee’s commitment to addressing veterans’ mental health and well-being.

### **5. Controversial Media Content (HR 7)**
- **HR 7** condemned the Netflix film *Cuties* for its alleged sexualization of minors and called for its removal and a Department of Justice investigation. Representative Max Abramson argued the film violated federal laws (18 USC 2251 and 2252) related to child pornography. While some committee members raised concerns about First Amendment implications and unintended consequences (e.g., increased viewership), the resolution passed with a vote of 19 to 2. The debate highlighted the tension between protecting children from exploitation and upholding free speech.

---

### **6. Abortion Rights (HCR 4)**
- **HCR 4** proposed a constitutional amendment declaring that abortion is not a constitutional right, aiming to nullify decisions like *Roe v. Wade* and *Casey v. Planned Parenthood*. Representative Max Abramson argued abortion should be a states’ rights issue, while opponents, including the ACLU and a Dartmouth-Hitchcock physician, emphasized the importance of women’s reproductive rights and the potential dangers of a constitutional convention.

---

### **7. Human Rights and Democracy (HCR 5)**
- **HCR 5** expressed support for democracy and human rights in Hungary, Poland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. While largely symbolic, the resolution aimed to influence U.S. foreign policy and demonstrate New Hampshire’s stance on global human rights issues.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **State-Federal Balance**: The meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between state and federal authority, particularly in areas like National Guard deployments, immigration enforcement, and constitutional amendments.
- **Human and Financial Costs**: Testimonies on deportation and veteran suicide prevention underscored the profound human and economic impacts of policy decisions.
- **Constitutional Reform**: The debate over a Convention of States reflected deep divisions on how to address federal overreach, with concerns about unintended consequences.
- **Controversial Media**: The condemnation of *Cuties* raised questions about the role of government in regulating content and protecting children from exploitation.
- **Procedural Challenges**: Technical difficulties and procedural matters occasionally disrupted the meeting, but the committee successfully advanced several resolutions and bills for further consideration.

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene on February 12, 2021, to continue discussions on pending legislation.
