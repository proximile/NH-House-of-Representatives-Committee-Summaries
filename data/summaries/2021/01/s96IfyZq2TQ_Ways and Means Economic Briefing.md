**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Economic Briefing**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Economic Briefing provided a detailed analysis of the state’s economic recovery, challenges, and future outlook, with a particular focus on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion covered a wide range of topics, including economic trends, labor market dynamics, housing affordability, business environment, federal support, and the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **Economic Recovery and Trends**
1. **Post-Pandemic Recovery**: New Hampshire’s economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, with real GDP growth projected at around 6% and nominal GDP potentially reaching 8%. However, the recovery has been uneven, with low-wage sectors like retail and hospitality lagging behind.
2. **Federal Stimulus Impact**: Federal aid, including stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits, played a crucial role in supporting households and businesses during the pandemic. These measures significantly boosted personal income and savings, but their long-term sustainability remains uncertain.
3. **Business Formation and Taxes**: Accelerated business formation and increased revenue are expected, with business taxes projected to rise. However, potential federal tax increases on corporations, capital gains, and top income brackets could impact businesses, though they are expected to remain strong overall.
4. **Energy and Manufacturing**: Lower energy costs and New Hampshire’s robust manufacturing sector, particularly in smart manufacturing, position the state well for future growth. However, supply chain disruptions and workforce challenges remain concerns.

### **Labor Market and Wage Trends**
1. **Unemployment and Wages**: The unemployment rate stands at 6.7%, indicating slack in the economy. Wage growth has been stable but uneven, with higher earners seeing more significant gains than middle and lower-income workers. Low-wage workers, disproportionately affected by job losses, face slow recovery.
2. **Labor Shortages**: Employers struggle to attract and retain workers, partly due to enhanced unemployment benefits and competition from higher-paying industries. Workforce challenges are particularly acute in manufacturing and low-wage sectors.
3. **Minimum Wage Debate**: Raising the minimum wage could increase costs for businesses, especially small ones operating on thin margins, and lead to potential layoffs. Employers argue that wages should reflect market forces rather than arbitrary increases.

### **Housing Market and Affordability**
1. **Rental and Housing Trends**: New Hampshire’s housing market is “red hot,” with low inventory and high demand driving up prices. The rental market is similarly strained, with vacancy rates below 3% for seven years and affordability issues for lower-income families.
2. **Geographical Disparities**: Rental price increases are most pronounced in southeastern counties (Rockingham, Strafford, Merrimack, and Hillsborough), while Coos County, despite lower median rental costs, is the least affordable relative to local incomes.
3. **Development Challenges**: High land prices, complex regulatory processes, and local zoning barriers hinder housing development. Legislative efforts, such as the Housing Appeals Board, aim to streamline development and address shortages.

### **Business Environment and Challenges**
1. **Manufacturing Sector**: The pandemic had an uneven impact on manufacturing, with some businesses (e.g., medical equipment producers) seeing increased demand while others faced sharp declines. Supply chain disruptions and workforce issues remain significant challenges.
2. **R&D Tax Credits**: Businesses, particularly manufacturers, emphasized the importance of research and development (R&D) tax credits for innovation and growth. Potential reductions or eliminations of these credits could harm their competitiveness.
3. **Economic Uncertainty**: Businesses face volatility in orders, rising costs, and the need to invest in technology to remain competitive. Federal policies, such as minimum wage increases, add to the uncertainty.

### **COVID-19 Vaccination Rollout**
1. **Prioritization and Distribution**: The state is prioritizing high-risk groups, including those aged 65 and older and residents of long-term care facilities. Vaccines are distributed through hospitals, pharmacies, and state-run sites, with over 70,000 residents vaccinated so far.
2. **Challenges**: Limited vaccine supply and high demand create competition between age groups for appointments. The state is working to ensure equitable access and streamline the registration process.
3. **Future Plans**: The state aims to vaccinate 70% of the population to achieve herd immunity. Vaccine supply is expected to increase as new manufacturers come online, including a potential single-dose vaccine.
4. **Public Health Measures**: Despite vaccinations, masking, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings remain critical to controlling the virus’s spread.

### **Long-Term Economic Outlook**
1. **Economic Resilience**: New Hampshire’s economy is expected to remain strong in 2021 and 2022, supported by moderate increases in long-term interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy.
2. **Demographic Trends**: Millennials entering their peak spending years are expected to provide a demographic tailwind for economic growth over the next decade.
3. **Federal Policy Impact**: The future of federal support and potential tax changes will play a crucial role in shaping the state’s economic recovery and long-term growth.

### **Conclusion**
The briefing highlighted the resilience of New Hampshire’s economy but also underscored significant challenges, including wage disparities, housing affordability, labor shortages, and the uneven impact of the pandemic on businesses and workers. Federal support, effective vaccination distribution, and targeted policy interventions will be critical to sustaining economic recovery and ensuring long-term growth. The state’s ability to address these challenges will shape its economic trajectory in the coming years.
