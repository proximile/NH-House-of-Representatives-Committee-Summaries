### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 532 (Animal Records Database)**  
   - This bill addresses the management of animal health certificates, which certify the health of animals being sold or transferred. Testimony focused on concerns about data security, access, and transmission methods, particularly the need for secure systems like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  
   - The proposed database would allow veterinarians to directly enter health certificate information, streamlining the process and reducing errors. The database would also manage rabies certificates and vaccination data, with strict confidentiality requirements and penalties for unauthorized access.  
   - Concerns were raised about the enforcement of health certificates, the burden on veterinarians and pet vendors, and the long-term funding mechanism for maintaining the database. An appropriation of $250,000 was included in the bill for maintenance costs in the second year of the biennium.  

2. **HB 438 (Animal Records Database Accessibility)**  
   - This bill aims to protect the confidentiality of animal records in the Department of Agriculture. Testimony opposed the bill, arguing that limiting public access would undermine transparency and efforts to prevent animal cruelty and disease spread.  
   - An amendment was proposed to ensure that future expansions of the database would continue to protect individuals' privacy.  

3. **HB 226 (Produce Safety Law Repeal)**  
   - The bill seeks to extend the sunset date of the produce safety law from 2021 to 2026 and clarify the commissionerâ€™s authority to issue stop-sale orders for non-compliant produce.  
   - The Department of Agriculture supported the bill, emphasizing its importance for maintaining food safety standards and securing federal funding for the program.  

4. **HB 627 (Value-Added Producer Grant Program)**  
   - Introduced by Representative Peter Bixby, this bill aims to create a matching fund for the USDA Value-Added Producer Grant Program. It would help New Hampshire farmers compete for these grants by assisting with the required 50% match.  
   - Testimonies highlighted the challenges farmers face in accessing grants and the potential benefits of the bill for the agricultural sector.

### **Technical Challenges and Recess**
The meeting encountered technical difficulties with the sound system, prompting a short recess to address the issues before continuing with the agenda.

---

### **Historical Context and Future Considerations**
- Health certificates have historically been stored in printer paper boxes due to a lack of a proper filing system. Legislative changes in 2017 made the submission of health certificates optional, and in 2019, the definition of a commercial kennel was removed, with the pet vendor license threshold set at selling 25 or more dogs.  
- The proposed database would modernize the system, making it easier to track animal transfers and ensure compliance with licensing requirements. Future expansions of the database could include other animal health information, such as tuberculosis and brucellosis.

### **Testimonies and Stakeholder Input**
Various representatives and stakeholders, including the American Kennel Club and the state veterinarian, provided testimony. Concerns were raised about the potential expansion of the database, the need to ensure privacy, and the importance of funding for its maintenance.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for modernized systems to manage animal health certificates and agricultural data, while balancing transparency, privacy, and compliance with state laws. The committee emphasized the importance of securing long-term funding for these initiatives and addressing the challenges faced by New Hampshire's agricultural sector. The meeting adjourned with plans to reconvene for further discussions on HB 272 and other pending legislation.
