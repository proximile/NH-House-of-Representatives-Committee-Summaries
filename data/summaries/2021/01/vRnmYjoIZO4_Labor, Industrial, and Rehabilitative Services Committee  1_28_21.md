**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee Meeting – January 28, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened electronically on January 28, 2021, to discuss and review several bills aimed at modernizing labor laws, improving workplace protections, and addressing economic disparities. The meeting, held under COVID-19 emergency orders, featured detailed discussions on key legislative proposals, with input from lawmakers, stakeholders, and state agencies. Below is a cohesive summary of the major bills and discussions:

---

### **1. House Bill 259 (Employee Uniforms)**
**Purpose**: To address conflicts between employees and employers regarding uniforms by allowing employers to sell additional or optional uniforms to employees, rather than providing them for free.  
**Discussion**:  
- **Representative Josh Yela** introduced the bill, emphasizing flexibility for employees who may want more uniforms than employers are willing to provide without cost.  
- Concerns were raised about potential abuses, such as employers offering substandard free uniforms while selling premium options.  
- **Deputy Commissioner Rudy Ogden** from the Department of Labor provided context, noting similar issues were addressed in 2018 and clarifying the department’s interpretation of the law.  
- The committee discussed potential amendments to prevent exploitation and ensure fairness.

### **2. House Bill 303 (Employee Compensation)**
**Purpose**: To clarify ambiguities in labor laws regarding employee compensation for being called into work, ensuring employees are paid for at least two hours if they report to work, even if they are sent home.  
**Discussion**:  
- **Representative Brian Seaworth** introduced the bill, which also addresses exceptions for municipal, county, and ski/snowboard instructors, allowing compensation in forms other than cash (e.g., lift tickets).  
- **Commissioner Rudy Ogden** testified, explaining concerns since 2016 about how compensation applies to employees under collectively bargained agreements.  
- The bill is intended as a housekeeping measure to correct ambiguities, not to change the law’s effects.  
- Amendments were proposed to ensure clarity, particularly regarding ski and snowboard instructors.

### **3. House Bill 348 (Public Sector Collective Bargaining Transparency)**
**Purpose**: To require public employers to provide notice of new or amended collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) and post tentative agreements online for at least 30 days before ratification.  
**Discussion**:  
- **Representative Glenn Turcotte** argued the bill would increase transparency for union members and taxpayers.  
- Concerns were raised about the 30-day posting requirement potentially delaying negotiations, especially in public sectors like school districts.  
- Opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) and union representatives, noted that tentative agreements are often incomplete and that ratified CBAs are already public records.  
- The committee discussed refining the bill to address concerns about clarity and practicality.

### **4. House Bill 258 (Electronic Signatures for Wage Records)**
**Purpose**: To allow electronic signatures and records for alterations to employee time cards and wage records, addressing challenges posed by remote work.  
**Discussion**:  
- **Representative Josh Yokela** explained that the bill stems from labor regulations requiring physical signatures for altered time records, which is impractical for remote work.  
- Committee members raised questions about whether the bill should use "may" instead of "shall" to avoid mandating electronic systems for all employers.  
- Amendments were suggested to clarify the bill’s scope and alignment with existing labor laws.

### **5. House Bill 348 (Public Sector OSHA Standards)**
**Purpose**: To establish a study committee to evaluate the adoption of OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) standards for public sector workers in New Hampshire.  
**Discussion**:  
- Currently, public sector workers are not covered by OSHA, unlike private sector workers.  
- The study would compare OSHA standards with New Hampshire’s Department of Labor standards, assess potential costs, and explore federal funding opportunities.  
- Testimonies from **Susie Nord** (National Council for Occupational Safety and Health) and **Samantha Wooten** highlighted the lack of robust safety protections for public sector workers.  
- **Deputy Commissioner Rudy Ogden** remained neutral, stating the study would provide valuable insights.

### **6. House Bill 563 (Study on Living Wage and Public Assistance)**
**Purpose**: To establish a committee to study the concept of a living wage, the utilization of public assistance among low-wage workers, and economic challenges faced by working families.  
**Discussion**:  
- **Representative Tony Kaplan** emphasized the need for data-driven policies to address economic inequality, particularly during the pandemic.  
- The study would examine wages needed to meet basic needs across different regions of New Hampshire and analyze the cost to taxpayers when wages fall short.  
- Supporters highlighted the moral imperative to understand the dynamics of low wages and corporate subsidies.  
- Concerns were raised about the feasibility of completing the study by the proposed November 1 deadline.

### **7. House Bill 231 (Workplace Lactation Rights)**
**Purpose**: To require employers to provide reasonable accommodations for lactating employees, extending protections already in place for state employees to private sector workers.  
**Discussion**:  
- The bill was compared to **Senate Bill 69 (SB 69)**, which focuses on pumping rights and has broader consensus among stakeholders.  
- **Kate Frederick**, founder of the New Hampshire Breastfeeding Rights Coalition, shared her personal experience with workplace lactation discrimination and advocated for merging the two bills to create stronger legislation.  
- **Representative Richard Abel** urged retaining HB 231 as a contingency in case SB 69 encounters issues.  
- The committee discussed balancing clarity, inclusivity, and practicality in the final legislation.
