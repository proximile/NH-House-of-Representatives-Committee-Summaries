**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee Meeting (January 12, 2021)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened virtually on January 12, 2021, to address critical issues related to labor, unemployment, and workers' compensation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting, conducted via Zoom under the governor's emergency order, included presentations, discussions, and Q&A sessions with key stakeholders. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points covered in the meeting:  

### **1. Unemployment Trends and Programs**  
- **Unemployment Claims**: Unemployment claims in New Hampshire peaked at nearly 117,000 weekly claims in May 2020, compared to just under 4,000 claims in March 2020. By early January 2021, claims had dropped to around 45,000, though a gradual weekly increase of 3-5% was observed.  
- **Federal Programs**: Over $1.557 billion in unemployment benefits were distributed in 2020, primarily through federal programs such as the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), and Lost Wages Assistance (LWA). These programs extended benefits to self-employed, gig workers, and others impacted by COVID-19.  
- **Trust Fund Solvency**: The New Hampshire Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund paid out $278 million in regular unemployment benefits. The state avoided borrowing from the federal government, unlike during the Great Recession, due to CARES Act funding and solvency controls.  

### **2. Impact of COVID-19 on Labor**  
- **Sectoral Effects**: Hospitality, retail, and restaurants were the hardest-hit industries, while healthcare and grocery stores remained stable. Remote work significantly impacted administrative and support services.  
- **Workers' Compensation**: Approximately 2,000 COVID-19-related workers' compensation claims were reported, with fewer than 10 disputes reaching hearings. Employers were reminded to follow proper notification procedures when changing employment terms.  

### **3. Department of Employment Security (DES) Initiatives**  
- **Virtual Job Fairs**: DES transitioned to virtual job fairs, hosting 11 events with over 300 employers and 1,077 job seekers participating. The next job fair was scheduled for January 28.  
- **Microsite Launch**: DES launched unemploymentbenefits.nh.gov, a streamlined resource for job seekers and employers.  
- **Special Programs**: DES highlighted its work with veterans, re-entry programs for incarcerated individuals, and the Job Training Fund.  

### **4. Committee Procedures and Logistics**  
- **Virtual Meeting Challenges**: The committee acknowledged technical difficulties and the inability to see testifiers during virtual meetings. Chairman William Infantine emphasized fairness in conducting hearings, ensuring equal treatment for in-person and remote participants.  
- **Legislative Review**: The committee planned to review 16 pieces of legislation in three full-day sessions, with hearings scheduled for January 28 and February 4.  
- **Technical Training**: Committee members discussed the need for training to manage Zoom controls during public hearings. Chairman Infantine expressed his intent to be present in the Legislative Office Building (LOB) to assist with logistics.  

### **5. Future Considerations and Q&A**  
- **Legislative Changes**: Discussions included potential changes to trust fund solvency, fraud prevention, and confidentiality laws related to unemployment benefits.  
- **Vaccine Mandates and Safety**: The committee addressed concerns about vaccine mandates and workers' compensation for injuries related to mask-wearing in high-risk environments.  
- **Resources and Support**: Commissioner George Copadis and Deputy Commissioner Richard Lavers offered to provide additional resources, such as updated law and rule books, to committee members.  

### **6. Closing Remarks**  
The meeting concluded with a focus on ensuring effective communication and fairness in conducting committee business during the ongoing pandemic. Committee members expressed flexibility for future meetings, with a preference for mid-week sessions (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday).  

Overall, the meeting highlighted the significant impact of COVID-19 on New Hampshire's labor market and the state's efforts to support workers and employers through federal programs, virtual initiatives, and legislative considerations. The committee emphasized the importance of addressing emerging challenges, such as vaccine mandates and workplace safety, in upcoming sessions.
