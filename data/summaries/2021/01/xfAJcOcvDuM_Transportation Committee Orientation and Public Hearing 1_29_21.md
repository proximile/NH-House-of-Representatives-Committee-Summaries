The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee held an orientation and public hearing on January 29, 2021, addressing a range of transportation-related issues, including license plate decals, traffic signal automation, and DMV operations. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Committee Orientation and Logistics**
- The meeting was conducted virtually via Zoom due to COVID-19, with public access provided through the platform or telephone.
- Committee Chair Thomas Walsh emphasized professionalism, procedural guidelines, and the committee’s role in public hearings, which is to gather citizen feedback rather than debate.
- The committee’s process for handling bills, including public hearings, executive sessions, and voting, was outlined. Votes in committee serve as recommendations to the full House.

### **DMV Operations and Pandemic Response**
- Elizabeth Balaicki, Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), provided an overview of the DMV’s mission, organizational structure, and key functions, including licensing, vehicle registration, and financial responsibility.
- Deputy Director Michael Todd discussed the DMV’s adaptation to the pandemic, including transitioning to appointment-only services, increasing call center capacity, and introducing online services like real ID document checking, motorcycle rider training sign-ups, and appointment scheduling.
- Despite staffing challenges (15% vacancies reduced to 13%), the DMV maintained operations with minimal closures (only two days) and received positive customer feedback on the new appointment system.

### **License Plate Decals**
- **Veterans Decals (HB 549)**: Kevin Grady, representing the State Veterans Advisory Committee, supported a bill allowing veterans to use cost-effective decals on standard license plates instead of specialized plates. The decals, managed by the Division of Veteran Services, cost about $2 each and were unanimously supported.
- **Municipal Officials Decals (HB 222)**: Representative Belanger proposed decals for municipally elected officials, such as selectmen and school board members. Questions were raised about issuance, revocation, and the process for leaving office.
- **Knights of Columbus and Masons Decals (HB 159 & HB 451)**: These bills allowed the Knights of Columbus and the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons to issue decals, with proceeds supporting charitable causes. Both bills passed unanimously in the previous session but were stalled in the Senate due to COVID-19.
- **Gold Star Family Decals (HB 361)**: Representative John Graham proposed waiving the $10 fee for Gold Star Family decals to honor families of fallen service members. The DMV indicated the financial impact would be minimal.

### **Traffic Signal Automation and Efficiency (HB 423)**
- Representative Peter Torosian introduced a bill establishing a commission to study enhanced automation for traffic lights, aiming to improve efficiency, reduce delays, and lower emissions.
- Bill Lambert, State Traffic Engineer, highlighted challenges in traffic signal maintenance and technology adoption, emphasizing the need for proactive management.
- Alex Contreras of the American Council of Engineering Companies of NH requested an amendment to include a private-sector engineer on the commission.

### **Texting While Driving Study Commission (HB 424)**
- Representative Torosian advocated for a commission to study ways to reduce texting while driving, citing safety and traffic efficiency concerns. Dan Goodman from AAA Northern New England supported the bill, emphasizing the dangers of distracted driving.

### **Elimination of Front License Plate Requirement (HB 260)**
- Representative Andrew Prout proposed eliminating the front license plate requirement for passenger vehicles, citing aesthetic, aerodynamic, and cost-saving benefits.
- Law enforcement officials opposed the bill, arguing that front plates are crucial for identifying vehicles in hit-and-run cases, Amber Alerts, and other law enforcement scenarios.
- The Department of Transportation and Easy Pass system representatives opposed the bill, citing potential revenue losses and logistical challenges, as the Easy Pass system relies on capturing both front and rear plates.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on improving transportation systems through cost-effective solutions like decals and advanced traffic light technology, while addressing logistical and technical challenges. The committee planned to revisit several bills in executive sessions and continue discussions on the fiscal and practical impacts of proposed legislation.
