The January 15, 2021, orientation meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee provided a comprehensive overview of procedural updates, utility regulation, and key energy-related legislative topics for the upcoming session. Conducted virtually via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting featured presentations from committee leadership, the state’s Consumer Advocate, and representatives from ISO New England, focusing on the evolving energy landscape in New Hampshire and New England.

### **Procedural Updates and Meeting Logistics**
Committee Chair Michael Vose opened the meeting by addressing logistical details, emphasizing compliance with House Rule 67 and pandemic-related emergency orders. The committee adopted a hybrid meeting format, allowing members to attend in person or virtually, with public hearings conducted electronically. Written testimony was encouraged, especially for graphs or tables, while screen sharing during public hearings was discouraged. Prime sponsors were allotted five minutes to introduce bills, and other speakers were given three minutes, with committee members limited to two questions per presenter to ensure efficiency. Safety concerns about air quality in the Legislative Office Building were raised, prompting Chair Vose to seek detailed documentation from House leadership.

### **Utility Regulation and Historical Context**
Donald Kreis, the state’s Consumer Advocate, provided an in-depth overview of utility regulation in New Hampshire. He explained that public utilities are regulated monopolies overseen by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), which ensures rates are just and reasonable. Kreis discussed the role of the Office of the Consumer Advocate in representing residential customers and the process of setting rates, including cost-of-service rate setting and the weighted average cost of capital. He also offered a historical perspective on electricity regulation, from Samuel Insull’s influence to key federal legislation like the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978. Kreis highlighted recent developments, such as the failure of the Northern Pass transmission line and natural gas pipeline projects, as well as a controversial 2018 New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling related to the restructuring act.

### **Key Energy-Related Legislative Topics**
Kreis identified several critical issues for the 2021 legislative session:
1. **Energy Efficiency Resource Standard**: Emphasizing energy efficiency as the cheapest way to meet demand, Kreis noted bills addressing utility implementation of efficiency measures.
2. **Community Power Aggregation**: Kreis argued that electricity market restructuring has not benefited residential customers and advocated for allowing municipalities to aggregate demand for better rates.
3. **Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals**: While environmental policy is outside his mandate, Kreis mentioned the state’s need to decide on adopting official policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
4. **Net Metering and Rate Cases**: Kreis supported House Bill 371, which ensures rate cases follow the Administrative Procedure Act for formal hearings and evidence-based decisions.
5. **Grid Modernization**: He stressed the importance of advanced metering and time-of-use rates, noting utilities’ resistance to recent pro-consumer grid modernization orders.
6. **Least Cost Integrated Resource Planning**: Kreis criticized the PUC for not enforcing this statute, which requires utilities to plan investments cost-effectively.
7. **ISO New England Reforms**: He supported making ISO New England more transparent and accountable, particularly its stakeholder advisory board, KNEEPOL.
8. **Pending Rate Cases**: Kreis mentioned ongoing rate cases for Liberty Utilities, Unitil, and water utilities, as well as the development of a statewide energy customer data platform.

### **Evolving Energy Landscape in New England**
Kate Epson of ISO New England provided an overview of the regional electric grid, highlighting the transition from traditional energy sources to renewables. She discussed the Forward Capacity Market, which ensures resource adequacy, and the challenges of integrating new technologies like behind-the-meter solar and battery storage. Epson noted the significant interest in new energy projects, with over 24,000 megawatts in the interconnection queue, including offshore wind and solar. She also emphasized the importance of energy efficiency programs in reducing peak demand and overall consumption.

### **Decarbonization and Renewable Energy Goals**
The meeting underscored the regional shift toward decarbonization, with all New England states except New Hampshire having mandates to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050. Aggressive renewable portfolio standards in neighboring states were contrasted with New Hampshire’s more modest goals. The committee discussed the implications of these policies on utility costs and the potential for a national renewable energy grid.

### **Committee Work and Public Hearings**
The committee outlined its upcoming schedule, with public hearings starting no earlier than January 25th. Members emphasized the need for a centralized web page to organize committee materials and improve public access to information. The committee also awaited the assignment of a committee assistant to help process bills and coordinate with the clerk.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a focus on collaboration and efficiency in addressing the high volume of bills (32 bills in six weeks) and the unique challenges of the session. Chair Vose encouraged members to be mindful of time constraints and work together to navigate the evolving energy landscape, ensuring a reliable and affordable energy future for New Hampshire. The meeting ended with a pledge of allegiance led by Vice Chair Douglas Thomas.
