**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (February 16, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 16, 2021, to discuss several key education-related bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 608 (HB 608)**, **House Bill 613 (HB 613)**, and **House Bill 607 (HB 607)**. The meeting centered on addressing critical issues in education funding, special education costs, and education savings accounts, highlighting the challenges of achieving equitable and sustainable solutions for New Hampshire’s schools.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **1. House Bill 608 (School Funding and Stabilization Grants)**
HB 608 seeks to reform school funding by addressing the phased elimination of stabilization grants, which have caused significant financial strain on smaller, property-poor towns since 2013. The bill proposes a new funding formula to support these towns without relying on outdated stabilization grants based on 2011 student populations.

- **Amendment Proposal**: Representative Rick Ladd introduced an amendment to replace stabilization grants with **fiscal capacity disparity aid**, which allocates funds based on property valuation and student proficiency. The amendment also maintains the **base cost of education**, adjusted for inflation (CPI), and includes accountability measures for fund usage.
- **Funding Models Debate**: The committee debated the merits of **input-based funding** (focusing on costs like teacher salaries) versus **outcome-based funding** (allocating resources based on student performance and graduation rates). Concerns were raised about potential perverse incentives in rewarding districts with low test scores and the need for detailed fiscal analyses to ensure fair allocation.
- **Next Steps**: The committee plans to review fiscal analyses and further discuss the bill, with a scheduled briefing on the outcome-based funding model.

#### **2. House Bill 613 (Catastrophic Special Education Aid and Risk Pool Amendment)**
HB 613 aims to address the financial volatility of catastrophic special education costs by enabling school districts to form **risk pool associations**. These pools would allow districts to collectively manage high-cost special education expenses, reducing the burden on individual districts.

- **Amendment Discussion**: The committee debated an amendment allowing districts to form risk pools of at least five members, with flexibility in self-insurance or purchasing third-party insurance. Concerns were raised about the rushed introduction of the amendment, lack of stakeholder input, and potential inequities for smaller, less affluent districts.
- **Support and Concerns**: While some representatives emphasized the urgency of addressing special education funding, others called for more public hearings and stakeholder engagement. The bill was advanced to the Commerce Committee for further review, with a majority report supporting the amendment and a minority report opposing it.

#### **3. House Bill 607 (Education Savings Accounts)**
HB 607 proposes the creation of **education savings accounts**, allowing families to use public funds for alternative education options. The committee debated whether to retain the bill for further development or reject it due to unresolved concerns.

- **Retain Motion**: Representative Cordelli moved to retain the bill, citing unresolved issues such as the lack of a fiscal note and concerns about unqualified family members serving as tutors. The motion passed, allowing the bill to be revisited for further refinement.
- **Opposition and Support**: Critics argued the bill was poorly drafted and could divert resources from public schools, while supporters highlighted its potential benefits for small districts and families seeking alternative education options.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**
- **Equity in Education Funding**: The discussions underscored the need to address funding disparities between wealthy and property-poor districts, with a focus on ensuring equal educational opportunities for all students.
- **Special Education Costs**: The committee grappled with the financial challenges of catastrophic special education costs, exploring innovative solutions like risk pools while emphasizing the need for thorough review and stakeholder input.
- **Policy Innovation vs. Scrutiny**: The meeting highlighted the tension between advancing innovative policies (e.g., risk pools, education savings accounts) and ensuring thorough legislative scrutiny and stakeholder engagement.
- **Workforce Development**: Representatives emphasized the importance of adequately funding **Career and Technical Education (CTE)** programs to prepare students for the workforce, suggesting differential aid for CTE students in the adequacy funding formula.

### **Next Steps and Commitment**
The committee concluded with a commitment to continue working on these issues, focusing on achieving fair and adequate funding for all New Hampshire students. The discussions highlighted the complexity of education funding reform and the need for collaborative efforts to address systemic inequities. Future sessions will include further analysis, stakeholder engagement, and consideration of additional bills, such as **Senate Bill 135** and **Senate Bill 158**, as part of the broader effort to reform education funding in the state.

Overall, the meeting reflected the ongoing challenges and opportunities in New Hampshire’s education policy landscape, with a shared goal of ensuring equitable access to quality education for all students.
