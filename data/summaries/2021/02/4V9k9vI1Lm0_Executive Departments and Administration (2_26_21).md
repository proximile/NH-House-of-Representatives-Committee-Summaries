**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Meeting (February 26, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on February 26, 2021, in an electronic format due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The session focused on executive discussions, voting on amendments, and addressing several bills, with an emphasis on balancing technological advancements, constitutional rights, public safety, and bureaucratic efficiency. Key highlights from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Opening and Procedures**
The session began with a formal opening, including roll call attendance. Members were reminded of the electronic format and instructed to disclose if anyone else was present during the meeting. The committee acknowledged the challenges of conducting business virtually, particularly with technical issues such as Zoom malfunctions that temporarily prevented one representative from voting. The chair clarified that video functionality was required for voting.

### **Key Bills and Amendments**
1. **House Bill 211**: Representative Goalie moved to retain HB 211, which involves establishing a new retirement board. The motion was seconded, and the committee unanimously voted (18-0) to retain the bill, allowing the new board time to provide input.

2. **House Bill 499**: Representative Roy moved to amend HB 499 with Amendment 0247, which restricts the use of facial recognition technology by the Department of Motor Vehicles and limits its admissibility as evidence in court. The amendment, addressing concerns about privacy and potential misuse of the technology, was adopted (17-1). The bill was recommended to pass with the amendment.

3. **House Bill 218**: Representative Blackish proposed Amendment 0256 to HB 218, which sought to combine itinerant vendor licensing with hawkers and peddlers licensing, effectively eliminating state licensing for both. The amendment sparked debate, with some members arguing that state licensing provides necessary oversight, especially for transient vendors moving between towns. Others contended that the current system is outdated and ineffective. The committee ultimately voted against the amendment (10-8), and the bill was retained for further discussion. A subsequent motion to pass HB 218 as amended was seconded, with further discussion deemed unnecessary.

4. **House Bill 217**: A motion to deem HB 217 inexpedient to legislate passed, with arguments about combining it with HB 218.

5. **House Bill 606**: The committee discussed HB 606, with support for addressing current legal shortcomings and reducing government interference in neighborly activities, such as haircuts. A motion to pass the bill was considered.

6. **House Bill 230**: A motion to retain HB 230 passed, with members agreeing that more time was needed to address its complexities.

### **Discussion on Door-to-Door Sales and Licensing**
Members debated the need for centralized state licensing for door-to-door salespeople, arguing it would be more efficient than individual town licensing. Concerns were raised about assuming dishonesty in small businesses compared to larger entities, highlighting the tension between regulation and fostering small business growth.

### **Committee Dynamics and Future Plans**
The committee emphasized the need for further work sessions and hearings, particularly on emergency order bills. Plans were made to reconvene on Monday, March 1, for public hearings and additional work sessions. Members underscored the importance of collaboration and thorough deliberation to address the complexities of the proposed legislation.

### **Key Themes**
Throughout the meeting, several themes emerged:
- **Technological Privacy**: Discussions on facial recognition technology underscored the need to balance technological advancements with constitutional rights and privacy concerns.
- **Regulatory Efficiency**: Debates on licensing and vendor regulations highlighted efforts to streamline bureaucratic processes while maintaining oversight.
- **Public Safety and Oversight**: Members grappled with ensuring public safety and effective oversight, particularly in areas like transient vendor licensing.
- **Technical Challenges**: The virtual format posed logistical challenges, including voting difficulties, which the committee worked to address.

In conclusion, the February 26, 2021, meeting of the NH House of Representatives’ Executive Departments and Administration Committee was marked by robust debate, thoughtful amendments, and a commitment to addressing complex legislative issues while navigating the challenges of a virtual format.
