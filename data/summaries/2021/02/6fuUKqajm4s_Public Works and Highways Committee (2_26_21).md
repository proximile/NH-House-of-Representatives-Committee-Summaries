**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting on February 26, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on February 26, 2021, to discuss and review capital budget requests and infrastructure projects from various state departments. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on funding needs, project priorities, and the efficient use of state resources. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and presentations from the meeting:

---

### **General Meeting Setup and Roll Call**
The meeting was conducted via Zoom in compliance with House Rule 67 and the governor’s emergency order. A roll call confirmed the attendance of committee members and staff, with public access provided through Zoom and phone.

### **Capital Budget Requests and Discussions**

#### **1. Social Security Administration Building Generator Backup System**
- **Proposal**: Install a federally funded generator backup system for the Social Security Administration building on Pleasant Street. While the federal government will fund the system for their operations, state funding would be required to extend it to the entire building if deemed necessary.

#### **2. Pre-Engineering Technology Funding**
- **Request**: $300,000 to support the "Project Lead the Way" program, a sequential engineering curriculum in schools. The funding has remained unchanged for decades and is considered sufficient for the program’s needs.

#### **3. Career and Technical Education (CTE) Centers**
- **Focus**: Prioritization and funding for CTE center renovations, particularly in Whitefield and Claremont. Claremont may combine with Newport for a joint center. The committee stressed the importance of timely state funding to match local project readiness.

#### **4. Department of Education Restroom Renovations**
- **Request**: Refurbish restroom facilities at the Department of Education building, which serves 7,000 unique visitors annually. The current facilities were described as potentially unsafe and embarrassing.

#### **5. Fish and Game Department Wastewater Treatment Facility**
- **Request**: $4.6 million (potentially rising to $5.1 million) for a wastewater treatment facility at the Powder Mill Hatchery in New Durham to comply with new EPA permit requirements for nutrient discharge. The project is funded through Fish and Game funds, not general funds.

#### **6. Liquor Commission NextGen Project**
- **Request**: $1 million to enhance Wi-Fi access points, wireless scanners, and office printers in Liquor Commission stores as part of the NextGen project. All associated debt is liquor-funded.

### **Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food**
- **Request**: State funds to maintain the New Hampshire building at the Eastern States Exposition in Massachusetts, which showcases NH products. The 90-year-old building requires repairs, including fire escape upgrades to meet current codes.

---

### **Judicial Branch eCourt Project**
- **Request**: $1.4 million to support the New Hampshire eCourt Project, which modernizes court operations through electronic filing, case management, and remote hearings. The project, essential during the pandemic, has improved access to justice and reduced case processing times. Funds would support software solutions, system upgrades, and maintenance.

### **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**
- **Key Requests**:
  - **Dam Maintenance and Safety**: $8.1 million for repairs, engineering, and hydrological work on state-owned dams, including high-hazard dams. DES emphasized the need for a comprehensive asset management plan for the 274 state-owned dams, many over 100 years old.
  - **OneStop System**: $5 million to modernize the outdated OneStop system, which integrates regulatory and environmental databases. The system faced cybersecurity issues, necessitating upgrades.
  - **State Revolving Loan Funds**: Matching state funds for clean water and drinking water programs to secure federal funding for municipal projects.
  - **Water Quality and Coastal Flooding**: $844,000 for projects including a new limnology lab database, statewide testing for toxicants in fish and shellfish, and coastal flood modeling.
- **PFAS Loan Program**: $50 million bonding authority for a loan program to address water system impacts from PFAS contamination. Bonding will occur as needed, with potential reimbursement from lawsuits against PFAS manufacturers.

### **Department of Corrections (DOC)**
- **Key Requests**:
  - **HVAC and Boiler Systems**: Replace outdated systems at the Concord prison, some installed in 1983, critical for heating, ventilation, and kitchen operations.
  - **Security Systems**: Upgrade the 21-year-old perimeter security system at the Northern Correctional Facility in Berlin.
  - **Roof Repairs**: Address leaking roofs at DOC facilities, including the Concord men’s prison and the Northern Correctional Facility.
  - **Kitchen Repairs**: Continue the $4.3 million project to design a kitchen capable of serving 5,500–6,000 meals daily at the Concord prison.
  - **Sewer and Drainage Systems**: Relocate a sewer grinder and repair floor drains in the auto repair shop at the men’s prison.
  - **Unfunded Projects**: High-priority unfunded projects include door replacements, ceiling repairs, and vocational training facilities for women inmates.
- **Capacity and Population**: The women’s prison operates below capacity (136 inmates in a 224-bed facility), while the men’s prison houses 1,244 inmates, down from previous years.
- **Special Psychiatric Unit**: A proposed $8 million bill to build a facility for civilly committed individuals near New Hampshire Hospital was briefly discussed.

### **Committee Tours and Next Steps**
The DOC commissioner invited committee members to tour facilities to better understand infrastructure needs. The committee noted a lapsed amount of $52,800.55 from previous projects, which could be reallocated. The next meeting was scheduled for March 5, 2021, to continue reviewing capital budget requests from other agencies.
