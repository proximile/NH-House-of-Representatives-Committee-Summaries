The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on February 2, 2021, focused on the complexities of revenue estimation and fiscal planning in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting, conducted virtually via Zoom due to the pandemic, addressed a wide range of revenue-related issues, including tax projections, the economic impact of the pandemic, and the challenges of forecasting in an uncertain environment. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

### **Revenue Estimation and Economic Uncertainty**
The committee extensively discussed the process of estimating revenues for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023, emphasizing the difficulties posed by the pandemic. Chris Shay, the legislative budget assistant, presented worksheets outlining the methodology for revenue estimation, which included adjustments for anomalies such as delayed tax payments due to federal tax filing extensions. The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) provided high and low estimates for various revenue sources, including business taxes, meals and rooms taxes, and tobacco taxes, with adjustments based on economic conditions and historical trends. The committee acknowledged the unpredictability of the pandemic, including the potential impact of COVID-19 variants on economic recovery and tax revenues.

### **Business Taxes and PPP Loan Forgiveness**
Business taxes were a major focus, with large corporations driving most of the tax revenue while smaller businesses struggled. The committee reviewed growth projections for business taxes, with estimated growth ranges of 1-3% for FY2022 and 4-6% for FY2023. The tax implications of forgiven Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans were also discussed. Since New Hampshire does not conform to federal tax changes, forgiven PPP loans remain taxable for state purposes, which could affect business tax revenues. Additionally, the transition to market-based sourcing and single sales factor for business taxes was noted, though its fiscal impact remains unclear.

### **Impact on Specific Revenue Streams**
1. **Meals and Rentals Tax**: The meals and rentals tax was identified as the hardest hit by the pandemic, with significant revenue losses in December and January. The committee considered reaching out to the Restaurant Association and lodging industry to better understand the ongoing challenges.
2. **Tobacco Tax**: Trends such as stock-up months and the impact of Massachusetts' flavor ban were reviewed. The committee discussed potential future losses due to declining smoking rates and the possibility of further declines if Massachusetts reintroduces menthol cigarettes.
3. **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: This tax performed strongly due to low inventory and high demand, though future declines were possible if mortgage rates increase or if people who moved to rural areas during the pandemic return to cities.
4. **Highway Fund Revenues**: Conservative estimates were presented for highway fund revenues, with discussions on the impact of the pandemic, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and changes in commuting patterns. While EV adoption and fuel efficiency improvements are increasing, significant changes were not expected in the near term.

### **Medicaid Recoveries and Judicial Revenues**
Karen Rounds and Meredith Tus from the Department of Health and Human Services presented on Medicaid recoveries, noting that recoveries have decreased over the years due to managed care organizations handling most fraud, waste, and abuse recoveries. The committee also discussed discrepancies in revenue estimates for motor vehicle fines between the Department of Safety and the Judicial Branch, with the latter providing more conservative estimates due to a downward trend in fines since 2016.

### **Restaurant and Hospitality Industry**
The committee expressed concerns about the long-term recovery of the restaurant and hospitality industry, which has been severely impacted by the pandemic. They discussed how long it might take for consumer confidence to return, even after vaccinations, and considered the recovery timeline from the Great Recession as a potential benchmark. The potential impact of new COVID variants on economic recovery was also a key concern.

### **Logistics and Operational Challenges**
The committee addressed operational challenges, including delays in DMV title processing due to staffing issues exacerbated by COVID-19 protocols. They also discussed logistical improvements for hybrid public hearings, such as using laptops with microphones turned off to reduce feedback and improve sound quality.

### **Upcoming Plans and Bills**
The committee outlined its schedule for upcoming work sessions and public hearings, emphasizing the need to finalize revenue estimates before meeting with the governor's budget director. They also planned to address specific bills, including one related to liquor sales, and voted to request a fiscal note for House Bill 346, which initially lacked one due to a system glitch.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the significant challenges of predicting and managing state revenues during the pandemic. The committee emphasized the need for ongoing monitoring, conservative estimates, and flexibility in fiscal planning to account for the evolving economic landscape. Discussions highlighted the interconnected impacts of COVID-19 on various revenue streams, industries, and state operations, as well as the importance of adapting to these challenges to ensure fiscal stability.
