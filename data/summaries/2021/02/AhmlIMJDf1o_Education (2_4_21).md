### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Meeting (February 4, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 4, 2021, to discuss several education-related bills, focusing primarily on **school building aid**, **education funding**, **civics education**, and **COVID-19 liability protections**. The meeting, held electronically due to the pandemic, included presentations, testimonies, and debates on key issues affecting New Hampshire’s education system. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. School Building Aid (HB 214 and HB 594)**
The meeting centered on two bills addressing the chronic underfunding of school building aid, which has left many districts with outdated and inadequate facilities.

- **HB 214**, sponsored by Representative Cordelli, proposed a minimum appropriation of $50 million for school building aid to address the poor conditions of many school buildings, which negatively impact student performance and health.
  
- **HB 594 FN**, sponsored by Representative Luno, sought to reform the school building aid program by:
  - Adjusting grant percentages (20% to 80%) based on a district’s fiscal capacity.
  - Providing retroactive aid (20%) for projects completed during the moratorium on building aid.
  - Changing the payment structure to 20% upfront and the remainder over 20 years.

**Key Issues and Testimonies:**
- **Facility Conditions**: Amy Clark from the Department of Education highlighted the age and poor condition of many school buildings, with approximately 450 public schools in New Hampshire, many of which lack adequate HVAC systems, insulation, and space for special education and Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs.
- **Financial Burden**: School board members from districts like Hampstead and Manchester emphasized the financial strain on local taxpayers due to the lack of state aid. For example, Manchester’s aging buildings, some dating back to the late 19th century, require significant upgrades.
- **Concerns About Long-Term Investments**: Representative Greg Hill questioned the long-term viability of brick-and-mortar schools in light of the shift toward virtual learning, while Representative Kathleen Hill stressed the need for retroactive funding to support projects undertaken during the moratorium.

### **2. Adequate Education Funding (HB 242)**
Representative Lad introduced **HB 242**, which aimed to define and cost an "adequate education." The bill included provisions for:
- **Academic Rigor**: Emphasizing rigorous academic study, applied learning, and essential knowledge across subjects like science, social studies, and personal finance.
- **Differentiated Aid**: Providing additional funding for special education, English language learners, and economically disadvantaged students.
- **Alternative Programs**: Including programs like "Learn Everywhere," which allows students to earn credits through state-approved programs outside traditional schools.
- **Accountability Measures**: Requiring schools to demonstrate they provide an adequate education and mandating transparency with parents and the public.

**Key Concerns:**
- **Fiscal Impact**: Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA), raised concerns about the lack of a fiscal note, making it unclear how much the proposed changes would cost.
- **Implementation Challenges**: Questions were raised about the Department of Education’s capacity to oversee the bill’s requirements, given its current resource constraints.
- **Immediate Effective Date**: The bill’s immediate effective date (60 days after passage) was criticized as impractical, as school budgets and schedules are set months in advance.

### **3. Civics Education (HB 320)**
Representative Mike Moffett introduced **HB 320**, which proposed requiring students to pass a civics exam, similar to the naturalization test, as a graduation requirement.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to address the lack of civics knowledge among students and establish a baseline understanding of government and history.
- **Bipartisan Support**: The bill had bipartisan support and is already a requirement in several states.
- **Concerns**: Critics questioned the rigor of the exam, as the answers are readily available online, and raised concerns about it being a high-stakes requirement for graduation. Others argued that existing civics curricula already cover the necessary material.

### **4. Degree-Granting Authority (HB 513)**
The committee discussed **HB 513**, which sought to authorize Signum University to grant degrees after meeting 13 requirements set by the Higher Education Commission.

**Key Points:**
- **Support**: Proponents argued that Signum University had met the necessary criteria and that the bill would expand access to higher education in New Hampshire.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about the university’s integrity, citing past issues with unaccredited degree programs and allegations of threatening behavior toward legislators.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with 11 votes in favor and 8 against, with a minority report requested by opposing members.

### **5. COVID-19 Liability Protections**
The meeting also addressed a bill providing liability protections for businesses and higher education institutions related to COVID-19.

**Key Provisions:**
- **Protection from Lawsuits**: The bill would shield entities from personal injury lawsuits stemming from alleged COVID-19 exposure unless gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intentional harm could be proven by clear and convincing evidence.
- **Shortened Statute of Limitations**: The bill reduced the statute of limitations for such claims from three years to one year.

**Debate:**
- **Proponents**: Supporters, including the University System of New Hampshire, argued that the bill was necessary to protect institutions and businesses navigating uncertain pandemic conditions.
- **Opponents**: Critics, including legal professionals, argued that the bill was unnecessary, as there had been no COVID-19-related personal injury claims in New Hampshire. They also raised concerns about the bill’s high evidentiary standard and its potential to undermine accountability and access to justice.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways:**
- **School Infrastructure**: The discussions highlighted the urgent need for state support to address the deteriorating condition of school buildings, with a focus on increasing funding and reforming the school building aid program.
- **Education Funding**: Disparities in school funding and the inclusion of alternative programs were central to the discussion on HB 242, with concerns about fiscal impact and implementation challenges.
- **Civics Education**: HB 320 sparked debate on the importance of civic knowledge and the effectiveness of standardized assessments in improving civic engagement.
- **COVID-19 Liability Protections**: The bill raised questions about balancing public health, legal liability, and economic concerns during the pandemic.
