**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (February 11, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on February 11, 2021, focused on a range of bills and issues, primarily centered on **gaming expansion, taxation, and charitable funding**. The meeting was held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, and discussions emphasized balancing regulatory oversight, economic benefits, and public welfare. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics addressed:

---

### **1. Charitable Gaming and Oversight**
The committee extensively discussed **charitable gaming**, emphasizing the need for **strong regulatory oversight** to ensure funds reach charities rather than private interests. Concerns were raised about **unaccounted proceeds** and **questionable expenses** in existing operations, with calls for state-funded positions to enforce integrity. Testimony from stakeholders like Churchill Downs highlighted the importance of public trust in gaming operations.

- **House Bill 355**: Addressed **age-controlled products** (e.g., cigarettes, beer) and store responsibility for compliance. The bill saw broad support, with discussions on language amendments for clarity.
- **House Bill 364**: Proposed expanding the definition of **charitable organizations** to include fraternal organizations (e.g., Knights of Columbus, Masons) for holding raffles. Questions arose about why only certain IRS 501(c) subsets were included, and concerns were raised about **raffle enforcement**.
- **House Bill 565**: Proposed a **study committee** to review charitable gaming oversight, enforcement, and revenue distribution. The bill’s sponsor, Representative Ames, stressed the importance of bipartisanship and addressing the **lack of enforcement staff** (only three inspectors statewide).

### **2. Historic Horse Racing (HHR) Machines (House Bill 626)**
**House Bill 626**, introduced by Representative Romney, sought to allow **historic horse racing (HHR) machines** in charitable gaming venues. These machines enable betting on past horse races using anonymized data, connecting to existing pari-mutuel wagering systems.

- **Support**: Proponents argued that HHR machines would benefit over 500 charities, with significant revenue allocated to the **Education Trust Fund** ($12 million for the state and $5.7-$5.8 million for charities). They emphasized the NH Lottery Commission’s experience with regulatory systems and the inclusion of responsible gaming plans to address addiction.
- **Opposition**: Critics contended that HHR machines functioned similarly to **slot machines**, particularly with features like **quick pick** and **autoplay**. Concerns were raised about **gambling addiction**, lack of local control (no opt-in/opt-out for towns), and a **three-year monopoly** granted to existing operators. Critics also highlighted the **uneven revenue distribution** (75% to operators, 16% to the state, and only 9% to charities).

### **3. Keno Expansion (House Bill 355)**
**House Bill 355**, sponsored by Representative Lang, proposed expanding **keno sales** to retail locations (e.g., convenience stores) in towns that had already voted to permit keno. Currently, keno is limited to establishments with liquor licenses.

- **Support**: The bill was seen as a way to boost state revenue and support retailers, with an 8% commission for keno sales (higher than other lottery products).
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the **aesthetics** of keno in retail settings, **enforcement of age restrictions**, and whether towns that approved keno understood it could expand to retail locations. Testimony from the NH Grocers Association highlighted retailers’ interest in selling keno to increase revenue.

### **4. Sports Betting (House Bill 330)**
The committee debated an amendment to **House Bill 330**, which would cap the number of sportsbook retail locations at 10. While some argued the cap could stifle competition and innovation, others supported it, citing the complexity of the licensing process. The amendment passed with a 21-3 vote, and the bill as amended passed unanimously.

---

### **5. Revenue Estimates and Budgeting (House Bill 306)**
An amendment to **House Bill 306** was discussed, allowing the Ways and Means Committee to update revenue estimates based on changing economic conditions rather than being limited to specific fiscal years. This was seen as a way to improve financial forecasting. The amendment and bill passed unanimously.

---

### **6. Constitutional Amendments (CACR1/CACR2)**
**CACR1** and **CACR2**, sponsored by Representative Harrington, proposed constitutional amendments to **prohibit broad-based income and sales taxes** in New Hampshire. Supporters argued that the state has thrived without these taxes, while opponents raised concerns about limiting future flexibility, particularly for education funding and equitable resource distribution.

---

### **7. Governor’s Budget Proposal**
The committee briefly discussed the governor’s budget proposal, which included reductions in **business enterprise taxes**, **interest and dividend taxes**, and **meals and rooms taxes**.

---

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
1. **Gaming Expansion**: The meeting focused on balancing the expansion of gaming (e.g., HHR machines, keno, sports betting) with **regulatory oversight** and **public welfare**. Proponents highlighted revenue benefits for charities and education, while opponents raised concerns about addiction, lack of local control, and economic harm.
2. **Charitable Funding**: Nonprofits emphasized the critical role of charitable gaming funds, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when traditional fundraising events were canceled.
3. **Taxation**: Discussions on constitutional amendments reflected New Hampshire’s commitment to avoiding broad-based income and sales taxes, with debates on future financial flexibility.
4. **Economic and Social Impact**: The committee weighed the economic benefits of gaming expansion against potential social costs, including gambling addiction and diversion of local funds.

The meeting concluded with plans for **work sessions** to further refine the bills and address outstanding concerns.
