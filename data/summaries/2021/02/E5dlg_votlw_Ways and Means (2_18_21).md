### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (February 18, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 18, 2021, to discuss revenue projections, proposed tax changes, and the governor’s budget proposal. The meeting, held remotely due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on the fiscal impacts of the pandemic, economic recovery, and the state’s financial outlook for fiscal years 2021–2023. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

---

#### **Revenue Projections and Economic Recovery**
1. **Pandemic Impact on Revenues**:  
   The committee reviewed revenue projections for various streams, including the meals and rooms tax, tobacco tax, highway fund, and road tolls. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced revenues, with recovery to pre-pandemic levels expected to be slow, potentially extending beyond 2023.  
   - **Highway Fund and Road Tolls**: Reduced travel during the pandemic led to a sharp decline in road toll revenues. Recovery is projected to be gradual, with revenues unlikely to return to FY2019 levels by FY2023. The committee also discussed the long-term impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on gasoline tax revenues, noting that EV adoption is expected to grow but will take years to significantly affect revenue.  
   - **Methodological Differences**: The governor’s budget office and the Department of Safety used different approaches to estimate revenues, particularly for the highway fund. Both methodologies were considered reasonable, with the governor’s office adjusting pre-pandemic trends for COVID-19 impacts and the Department of Safety relying on historical data and current trends.  

2. **Economic Recovery and Uncertainty**:  
   The committee acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic’s long-term effects on travel patterns, commuting, and economic recovery. Ongoing analysis and flexibility in revenue projections were emphasized to account for these uncertainties.

#### **Proposed Tax Changes and Fiscal Impacts**
1. **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**:  
   - **Threshold Increase**: The governor’s budget proposed increasing the BET threshold to $250,000 for gross receipts and enterprise value, reducing revenue by $2.3 million annually. This change aims to benefit small businesses by reducing administrative burdens.  
   - **Rate Reduction**: The BET rate would be reduced from 0.6% to 0.55% for periods ending on or after December 31, 2022. This reduction is expected to increase Business Profits Tax (BPT) revenue, as BET payments are credited against BPT obligations.  

2. **Interest and Dividends Tax**:  
   The committee discussed phasing out the Interest and Dividends Tax over five years, starting in FY2024, with full elimination by the end of 2026. This move is intended to reinforce New Hampshire’s status as an income tax-free state and benefit seniors on fixed incomes.

3. **Meals and Rooms Tax**:  
   The governor’s budget proposed reducing the meals and rooms tax from 9% to 8.5% starting October 1, 2021, to stimulate economic activity in the hospitality sector. However, concerns were raised about the uncertainty of post-pandemic recovery in tourism and business travel, which could impact revenue.

4. **Other Tax Considerations**:  
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Revenue from this tax has been robust due to a strong housing market, but concerns were raised about its sustainability.  
   - **Tobacco Tax**: Revenues are expected to decline due to policy changes in other states.

#### **Education Funding and Fiscal Responsibility**
1. **Education Trust Fund**:  
   The committee discussed the strength of the Education Trust Fund, which is projected to remain robust despite proposed tax cuts. The budget includes $30 million in one-time aid for public school infrastructure, ensuring that education funding is not jeopardized.  

2. **Fiscal Responsibility**:  
   Members expressed concerns about the long-term fiscal impacts of tax cuts, particularly given the uncertainty of post-pandemic economic recovery. The committee emphasized the need for clear legislative language to ensure the intent of tax changes is accurately reflected and to avoid confusion.

#### **Legislative Process and Next Steps**
1. **House Bill 2**:  
   The committee reviewed the draft of House Bill 2, which includes the governor’s budget proposals. The bill was not yet finalized, and the committee was cautioned that the final version might differ from the draft.  

2. **Constitutional Concerns**:  
   A committee member raised concerns about the constitutionality of the BET threshold increase, questioning whether it narrows the tax base too much. The budget director agreed to follow up with the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) on this issue.  

3. **Caucus Discussions**:  
   The committee planned separate caucus meetings to further discuss revenue estimates, with the goal of finalizing numbers by the following Tuesday. This process involved reconciling differing projections to present a unified revenue estimate for the budget.

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the challenges of predicting state revenues in a post-pandemic environment and the need for ongoing analysis and flexibility. The committee focused on balancing tax relief for businesses and individuals with maintaining fiscal responsibility and funding critical state services like education. The discussions underscored the importance of clear legislative language, economic recovery considerations, and the long-term fiscal impacts of proposed tax changes. The committee committed to providing more detailed analyses and updated documents as the budget process progresses.
