### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (February 9, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on February 9, 2021, to discuss three key bills related to reproductive health care and abortion: **House Bill 430**, **House Bill 622**, and **House Bill 625**. The meeting featured extensive testimonies from legislators, medical professionals, legal experts, advocates, and members of the public, reflecting deeply polarized views on the issues at hand.

### **House Bill 430: Repeal of the Buffer Zone Law**
**Purpose**: HB 430 seeks to repeal New Hampshire’s buffer zone law, which allows for a non-mandatory buffer zone of up to 25 feet around reproductive health care facilities to protect patients and providers from harassment and intimidation by protesters.

#### **Key Arguments**:
1. **For Repeal**:
   - **Free Speech Concerns**: Opponents of the buffer zone law argued that it violates First Amendment rights by restricting peaceful assembly and speech on public sidewalks. They emphasized that the law unfairly targets pro-life advocates while allowing other types of protests in public spaces.
   - **Unconstitutionality**: Legal experts testified that the law is unconstitutional, citing precedents like *McCullen v. Coakley* (a Massachusetts case) that struck down similar laws for burdening free speech disproportionately.
   - **Lack of Implementation**: Proponents of repeal noted that reproductive health facilities have not actively used the buffer zone law since its enactment, suggesting it is unnecessary or unenforceable.

2. **Against Repeal**:
   - **Patient Safety and Privacy**: Advocates for keeping the law argued that it is essential to protect patients and staff from harassment, intimidation, and obstruction when accessing or providing legal health care services. Testimonies included stories of patients being screamed at, photographed without consent, and emotionally distressed by protesters.
   - **Public Safety Concerns**: Testimonies highlighted instances where protesters violated COVID-19 mask mandates, harassed escorts, and created disturbances requiring police intervention.
   - **Legal Defense**: Some argued that the law has been defended in court and could be upheld if challenged again, especially given its flexibility and the Supreme Court's recent allowance of buffer zones in other cases.

#### **Key Testimonies**:
- **Legal Experts**: Attorneys like Ian Huyett argued that the law fails constitutional scrutiny, particularly because it discriminates against specific viewpoints and burdens more speech than necessary.
- **Pro-Life Advocates**: Individuals like Francis Hines and Jason Hennessy testified that they engage in peaceful prayer and advocacy on sidewalks and that the law unjustly restricts their rights.
- **Clinic Staff and Advocates**: Dalia Vidunas, executive director of a reproductive health center, shared harrowing stories of patients being traumatized by protesters and emphasized the need for the buffer zone to ensure safety and access to care.

### **House Bill 622: Informed Consent for Abortion**
**Purpose**: HB 622 requires pregnant individuals to be "adequately informed" and open to counseling from their spouse, family, or advisors before obtaining an abortion.

#### **Key Arguments**:
1. **For the Bill**:
   - **Informed Decision-Making**: Supporters argued that the bill ensures women make informed decisions about their pregnancies.

2. **Against the Bill**:
   - **Reproductive Autonomy**: Opponents called the bill patronizing and an infringement on a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions with her doctor. They argued it could delay care and impose undue stress on patients.

### **House Bill 625: Fetal Life Protection Act**
**Purpose**: HB 625 seeks to restrict abortions after 24 weeks of gestation, except in cases of medical emergencies, and criminalizes procedures that harm a viable fetus.

#### **Key Arguments**:
1. **For the Bill**:
   - **Fetal Rights and Viability**: Supporters argued that the bill protects the lives of viable fetuses, prevents fetal pain (claimed to occur as early as 20 weeks), and aligns with state interests in protecting maternal health.
   - **Constitutional Alignment**: Proponents cited legal precedents like *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, arguing that the bill is constitutional and moderate compared to other states’ restrictions.

2. **Against the Bill**:
   - **Reproductive Freedom**: Critics argued that the bill violates women’s reproductive autonomy, disproportionately affects low-income women and women of color, and imposes unnecessary restrictions on healthcare providers.
   - **Medical Necessity**: Opponents highlighted that late-term abortions are rare and often necessary due to medical complications, fetal abnormalities, or other personal circumstances.

#### **Key Testimonies**:
- **Medical Professionals**: Doctors like Dr. Dera Vula and Dr. Maris Tolen opposed the bill, emphasizing that late-term abortions are often due to severe fetal anomalies or threats to the mother’s life.
- **Personal Stories**: Dana Pierce shared her experience of having a late-term abortion due to a fatal fetal condition, emphasizing the emotional and financial toll of restrictive laws.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**:
- **Free Speech vs. Public Safety**: The debate over HB 430 highlighted the tension between protecting First Amendment rights and ensuring patient safety and access to health care.
- **Fetal Rights vs. Reproductive Autonomy**: Discussions on HB 622 and HB 625 reflected the broader national debate over balancing fetal rights with women’s reproductive freedoms.
- **Medical and Legal Complexities**: Testimonies from medical professionals and legal experts underscored the complexities of implementing and enforcing such legislation.

The committee did not reach any conclusions during this session but planned to continue deliberations and hold executive sessions to further consider the bills. The meeting showcased the deeply polarized nature of the abortion debate in New Hampshire, with passionate arguments on both sides.
