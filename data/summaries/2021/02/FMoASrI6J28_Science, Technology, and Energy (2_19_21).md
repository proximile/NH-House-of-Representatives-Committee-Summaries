The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 19, 2021, to discuss a range of energy-related bills, focusing on renewable energy expansion, net metering, energy storage, and regulatory updates. The meeting, held electronically due to COVID-19, highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance economic, environmental, and technical considerations in shaping the state’s energy policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 106: Municipal Host Generators and Net Metering**
   - **Purpose**: HB 106 seeks to remove the 1-megawatt cap for municipal host generators, allowing municipalities and political subdivisions to generate and share clean energy (e.g., solar) to offset electricity costs for public facilities.
   - **Support**: Proponents, including **Representative Tim Lang**, emphasized the bill’s potential to reduce municipal operating expenses and property taxes. Successful net metering programs in towns like Peterborough and Derry were cited as examples.
   - **Concerns**: Stakeholders, including **Clifton Below** (Assistant Mayor of Lebanon) and **Donna Gamache** (Eversource), raised concerns about the lack of a cap, potential private entity involvement, and unintended consequences such as municipalities generating revenue rather than just cost savings. Below suggested a 5-megawatt cap to align with federal regulations.
   - **Next Steps**: The committee planned to amend the bill to address these concerns, with an executive session scheduled for March 8th.

2. **HB 294: Direct Producer-to-Consumer Retail Sales**
   - **Purpose**: HB 294 aims to update the **Limited Electrical Energy Producers Act** to allow direct producer-to-consumer retail sales within the state, bypassing federal oversight (FERC and ISO New England).
   - **Concerns**: Stakeholders questioned the bill’s feasibility, as it cannot override federal jurisdiction. Suggestions were made to modernize the statute while ensuring compliance with federal regulations.
   - **Outcome**: The bill’s fate remains under discussion, with unresolved issues from previous sessions.

3. **HB 407: Purchase of Output from Limited Electrical Energy Producers**
   - **Purpose**: HB 407 clarifies regulations around energy production and storage, including qualified storage systems, and prevents "double dipping" by producers benefiting from both retail sales and net metering programs.
   - **Key Points**: The bill addresses jurisdictional boundaries, transmission cost savings, and the role of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in overseeing implementation. It is seen as a market-based alternative to subsidies, encouraging innovation and competition.
   - **Outcome**: The committee closed the public hearing with 137 supporters and one opponent, planning to prepare majority and minority reports.

4. **HB 148: Net Metering for Hydroelectric Facilities**
   - **Purpose**: HB 148 proposes increasing the net metering capacity for municipally owned hydroelectric facilities in Nashua from 1 megawatt (MW) to 5 MW.
   - **Support**: Nashua officials, including **Mayor James Dess**, testified in favor, highlighting the bill’s potential to reduce energy costs and maximize the city’s investment in its hydroelectric dams.
   - **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the bill’s specificity to Nashua and its broader impact on electric rates.
   - **Outcome**: The committee considered amendments to clarify the cap and align the bill with broader energy legislation like HB 106.

5. **HB 373: Low-Carbon Fuel Standards and DES Involvement**
   - **Purpose**: HB 373 addresses the Department of Environmental Services’ (DES) involvement in low-carbon fuel standards programs like the Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI).
   - **Amendment**: An amendment was adopted, allowing the governor or their designee to decide on a case-by-case basis whether DES staff can participate in or listen to discussions on such programs.
   - **Debate**: Supporters emphasized fiscal responsibility, while opponents criticized the bill as micromanaging DES and restricting valuable collaboration.
   - **Outcome**: The bill passed as amended with an 11-10 vote, and a minority report was requested.

6. **Other Bills**
   - **HB 225 (Net Metering Payments)**: The committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill as "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), citing concerns about undervaluing net metering and disrupting existing investments.
   - **HB 289 (Battery Storage Facilities)**: The bill, allowing battery storage facilities of 30 MW or more to be evaluated by the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC), passed unanimously.
   - **HB 308 (Broadband Access)**: The committee voted to retain HB 308, emphasizing the importance of broadband in rural areas.
   - **HB 309 (Renewable Energy Credits)**: The committee moved to pass HB 309, which corrects the computation of renewable energy credits using actual data from ISO New England.
   - **HB 168 (Vehicle Emission Standards)**: The bill, requiring the adoption of innovative vehicle emission standards, was voted ITL with a 12-9 vote, with a minority report to be written.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

1. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: The committee focused on expanding access to renewable energy through net metering, municipal host generators, and hydroelectric facilities, while addressing concerns about caps, federal jurisdiction, and cost implications.
2. **Energy Storage and Market-Based Solutions**: Bills like HB 407 and HB 289 highlighted the importance of energy storage, market-based approaches, and regulatory clarity in fostering innovation and reducing costs.
3. **Environmental and Economic Benefits**: Stakeholders emphasized the environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy, including reduced emissions, lower energy costs, and job creation.
4. **Regulatory and Jurisdictional Challenges**: Discussions underscored the complexities of balancing state initiatives with federal oversight, particularly in areas like net metering and low-carbon fuel standards.
5. **Next Steps**: The committee planned to continue deliberations on several bills, including HB 106, HB 148, and HB 407, with a focus on amendments to address stakeholder concerns.
