The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on February 17, 2021, focused on the state's budget and key fiscal priorities, addressing immediate challenges and long-term goals. The meeting was conducted virtually, with the use of charts and graphs to enhance clarity. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Budget Overview and Fiscal Responsibility**
The proposed budget is balanced without relying on speculative federal funds, emphasizing fiscal responsibility. It includes tax cuts, increased municipal revenue sharing, and one-time aid to schools for capital projects. Despite the economic impact of COVID-19, which initially predicted a $350–400 million shortfall, measures such as hiring freezes and delayed capital projects reduced the deficit to $50 million.

### **Tax Reductions**
The budget proposes significant tax reductions, including cuts to the meals and rooms tax, business enterprise tax, and interest and dividends tax. These reductions aim to provide relief to businesses, individuals, seniors, and retirees, stimulating economic growth, particularly in the tourism sector. The total tax reductions are estimated at $50–55 million over the biennium.

### **Education Funding and Reform**
The education trust fund is projected to end the biennium with a positive balance. The budget increases per-student spending and addresses issues with free and reduced lunch funding formulas. Additionally, there is a focus on modernizing and streamlining the education system, particularly in higher education. The budget supports efforts to merge the community college and university systems to improve workforce readiness and simplify credit transfer agreements between institutions.

### **Economic Stability and Rainy Day Fund**
To bolster long-term financial stability, the budget proposes increasing the cap on the state’s rainy day fund to 10% of biennial revenue. The speaker emphasized the importance of saving during strong economic times without imposing a cap on contributions, ensuring the state is prepared for future economic downturns.

### **Housing and Workforce Development**
The budget includes initiatives to address housing shortages and student debt, aiming to retain the workforce and encourage economic growth. A voluntary paid leave program is also proposed, backed by businesses, to provide low-cost options for employees and employers.

### **Health and Human Services**
Investments in IT infrastructure modernization, increased funding for the developmental disabilities (DD) community, and support for the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) are key components of the budget. Improvements in case management efficiency and reduced caseloads per worker were noted.

### **Law Enforcement Accountability**
Funding is allocated for body cameras, training, and other measures to enhance law enforcement accountability, ensuring transparency and trust in public safety efforts.

### **Department of Energy Reorganization**
The budget includes a proposal to separate the adjudicative functions of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) from policy management to eliminate conflicts of interest. This reorganization aims to improve efficiency and transparency in energy policy and rate-setting.

### **Parole Board Reforms**
The speaker proposed making the chair of the parole board a full-time position and suggested separating its administrative functions from its adjudicative responsibilities, potentially placing them under the Department of Corrections or Safety.

### **Revenue Sharing and Local Support**
The budget addresses the balance between tax reductions and revenue sharing for cities and towns, particularly regarding the rooms and meals tax. The speaker highlighted the importance of supporting local communities while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

### **House Bill 2 (HB2)**
Questions about the availability of HB2, a crucial component of the budget process, were addressed. It was confirmed that the bill had been delivered to the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) and would be available soon.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored a commitment to transparency, fiscal responsibility, and strategic investments. The budget aims to address immediate challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic while positioning New Hampshire for long-term economic stability and growth. Key areas of focus include education reform, tax relief, workforce development, and efficient governance across various state departments.
