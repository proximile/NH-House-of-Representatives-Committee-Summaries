The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 12, 2021, to discuss several critical bills and issues related to cybersecurity, renewable energy, climate action, and community power aggregation. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, featured robust debates and testimony from legislators, stakeholders, and the public. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Cybersecurity and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)**  
1. **Cybersecurity Concerns**:  
   - Representative Samsich introduced a bill addressing cybersecurity threats to state agencies and government software.  
   - The IT department, led by Director Goulet, acknowledged ongoing efforts but recommended retaining the bill for further refinement due to evolving threats.  

2. **REC Sweeping (HB 396)**:  
   - Representative Oxenham introduced HB 396 to abolish REC sweeping, a practice where utilities claim renewable energy attributes from unregistered systems without compensation.  
   - Critics argued that REC sweeping violates constitutional property rights, undermines the renewable energy market, and depletes the renewable energy fund.  
   - Karen Crampton from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) explained the process, emphasizing that no money is exchanged in REC sweeping.  
   - The committee debated the fairness and legality of the practice, with some calling for clearer notification requirements and potential legal action.

### **Climate Action and Greenhouse Gas Emissions (HB 172)**  
1. **Overview of HB 172**:  
   - Representative Oxenham introduced HB 172, which establishes greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and a climate action plan for New Hampshire.  
   - The bill aims to mitigate climate change impacts, promote renewable energy, and create economic opportunities.  

2. **Support and Concerns**:  
   - Supporters, including Senator Sherman, highlighted the public health benefits of reducing emissions and the economic advantages of green jobs.  
   - Opponents, such as Karen Luther of the Northeast Hearth, Patio, and Barbecue Association, raised concerns about rising electric rates and the impact on small businesses and vulnerable populations.  
   - Testimonies from stakeholders like Justin Kates (Nashua Emergency Management) and Alenka Grondo (High School Democrat) emphasized the urgency of addressing climate change and its threats to ecosystems and economies.  

3. **Global Context**:  
   - Discussions touched on global emissions trends and the importance of technological innovation and international cooperation in addressing climate change.

### **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and Biomass (HB 213)**  
1. **Reduction in RPS Goals**:  
   - HB 213 proposed reducing the RPS goal from 15.8% to 8.8%, primarily by eliminating the Class III biomass requirement.  
   - Critics argued this would undermine New Hampshire’s renewable energy progress and harm the timber industry.  

2. **Economic and Environmental Concerns**:  
   - Testimonies from Michael O'Leary (Bridgewater Power Company) and Karen Burrell (Accurate Tree Service) highlighted the economic benefits of biomass plants and their role in forest management.  
   - Opponents warned that reducing the RPS could increase fire risks and harm public health and climate change efforts.  

3. **Support for HB 213**:  
   - Supporters argued that the bill would reduce compliance costs for utilities and streamline the RPS by removing less efficient energy sources.

### **Community Power Aggregation (HB 315)**  
1. **Purpose of HB 315**:  
   - The bill aims to enhance electric aggregation and provide more options for customers in the retail electric market.  

2. **Concerns and Criticisms**:  
   - Representatives and stakeholders raised concerns about the bill’s potential to hinder community aggregation programs and limit innovation in the energy market.  
   - Clifton Below, Assistant Mayor of Lebanon, criticized the bill for undoing progress in community power aggregation and limiting municipalities’ ability to offer value-added services.  

3. **Support for HB 315**:  
   - Supporters, including Eversource, argued that the bill provides necessary clarity and safeguards for implementing community aggregation.  

---

### **Energy Efficiency and Consumption Reduction Goals (HB 399 and HB 351)**  
1. **HB 399**:  
   - The bill aimed to establish energy consumption reduction goals but was deemed unnecessary as the state is already on track to meet its greenhouse gas emission goals.  
   - The committee voted unanimously to ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) the bill.  

2. **HB 351**:  
   - The bill related to energy efficiency funding raised concerns about its impact on low-income programs.  
   - Representative Harrington clarified that the bill does not affect low-income programs and focuses on maximizing energy savings. The committee voted OTP (Ought to Pass).

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
1. **Cybersecurity**: The committee recognized the need for ongoing improvements to address evolving cybersecurity threats.  
2. **Renewable Energy**: Debates centered on the ethical and legal implications of REC sweeping and the economic and environmental impacts of reducing the RPS.  
3. **Climate Action**: There was broad support for HB 172, but concerns were raised about the economic feasibility of rapid electrification and the elimination of fossil fuels.  
4. **Community Power Aggregation**: Stakeholders called for amendments to HB 315 to ensure it supports innovation and consumer choice in the energy market.  
5. **Energy Efficiency**: The committee emphasized the importance of balancing funding priorities to support low-income households and maximize energy savings.
