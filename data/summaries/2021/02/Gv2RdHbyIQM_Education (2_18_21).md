**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (2/18/21)**

On February 18, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened via Zoom to discuss and deliberate on several education-related bills. The meeting, held during the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on balancing local control with state oversight, enhancing civics education, and addressing funding and compliance issues. Here are the key points and outcomes from the session:

### **Key Discussion Topics and Points**

1. **Local Control of Education**  
   - The committee emphasized that local school districts, not the Department of Education (DOE), are primarily responsible for assessments and curriculum.  
   - Concerns were raised about whether the DOE should have greater oversight to ensure schools meet state standards, particularly in civics education.  

2. **Civics Education and Assessments**  
   - A proposed civics assessment for high school students, based on the U.S. naturalization exam, was a major point of debate.  
   - An amendment to **HB 320** reduced the number of required correct answers from 100 to 128, reflecting the updated exam format.  
   - Supporters argued that the assessment would enhance civics knowledge and ensure students understand fundamental aspects of government. Opponents raised concerns about it being an unfunded mandate, its impact on students with learning disabilities, and the potential for "teaching to the test" rather than fostering deeper understanding.  
   - The bill ultimately passed with amendments, though several committee members expressed reservations.  
   - It was clarified that the assessment would not affect current seniors but would likely take effect in the 2022 school year. Some representatives suggested that even students who have already passed civics courses should take the assessment before graduating.  

3. **Funding and Distribution of Adequacy Grants**  
   - **HB 110** proposes sending funding directly to municipalities rather than school districts. Supporters argued this would improve transparency and clarity for municipalities, while opponents raised concerns about increased bureaucracy and potential delays in funding for regional school districts.  

4. **Reporting Requirements and Compliance**  
   - **HB 442** aims to give the DOE more authority to enforce reporting requirements, particularly for charter and non-public schools. An amendment clarified that the bill applies only to public and charter schools, not private schools.  
   - The DOE emphasized the need for this bill to ensure compliance with state and federal reporting requirements, such as emergency management plans and audits.  

5. **Other Bills and Future Work**  
   - The committee discussed upcoming bills, including those related to school food waste, menstrual products, criminal history checks, and emergency meetings.  
   - **HB 608**, which addresses school funding, was unanimously retained due to unresolved issues with the current funding formula and delays caused by the pandemic.  
   - **HB 20**, focusing on education choice and opportunity, was also retained for further work, as committee members sought additional clarification and discussion.  

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**  
- The committee passed **HB 320** with amendments, highlighting the importance of civics education but acknowledging the need for further refinement.  
- **HB 110** and **HB 442** were discussed in detail, with concerns and potential impacts weighed by committee members.  
- **HB 608** and **HB 20** were retained for further work, reflecting the committeeâ€™s commitment to addressing complex issues with careful deliberation.  
- The committee planned to continue its work in the following week, focusing on the high volume of pending legislation and ensuring thorough consideration of all proposals.  

### **Overall Themes**  
The meeting underscored the tension between local control and state oversight in education, with a particular focus on civics education, funding transparency, and compliance with reporting requirements. Committee members emphasized the importance of thoughtful, well-crafted legislation to address these issues while balancing the diverse needs of students, schools, and municipalities.
