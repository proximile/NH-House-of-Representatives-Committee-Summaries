   - Critics argued that the long-term environmental and tourism costs outweigh short-term economic gains, noting the potential damage to New Hampshire’s tourism industry.

3. **Regulatory and Legal Issues**:
   - Opponents claimed that HB 177 unfairly changes the rules mid-process, discouraging private investment in waste management infrastructure. They also raised constitutional concerns, arguing the bill discriminates based on land ownership.

4. **Community and Stakeholder Perspectives**:
