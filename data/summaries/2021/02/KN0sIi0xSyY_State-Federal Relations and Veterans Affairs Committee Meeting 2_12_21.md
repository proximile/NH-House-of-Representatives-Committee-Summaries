The New Hampshire House of Representatives State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee meeting on February 12, 2021, focused on several legislative items, primarily conducted via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Opening Remarks and Roll Call**: The chair acknowledged the state of emergency due to COVID-19 and confirmed that the meeting complied with House rules and RSA 91. Roll call attendance was taken.

2. **Pledge and Moment of Silence**: The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence for military personnel in harm's way and those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

3. **HB 112 Discussion**: The committee discussed HB 112, a bill related to immigration and deportation. Representative Lawrence motioned to recommend the bill as "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), arguing that immigration is a federal issue and the data in question is already publicly available. Other representatives, including Representative Walker and Representative Espitia, opposed the ITL, emphasizing the economic and psychological impacts of deporting primary breadwinners on New Hampshire families. The ITL motion passed with a vote of 11-6.

4. **HB 117 Discussion**: HB 117, which seeks to align state statutes with Department of Defense rules regarding the use of force on National Guard facilities, was discussed. The committee unanimously recommended the bill as "Ought to Pass" (OTP).

5. **HB 580 Discussion**: HB 580, related to the mobilization of National Guard units, was also discussed. Representative Lawrence motioned to recommend the bill as ITL, citing potential risks of losing federal funding and federal precedent on the issue. The ITL motion passed with a vote of 17-3.

6. **HCR 1 and HCR 4 Discussions**: The committee discussed HCR 1 and HCR 4, both related to Article V constitutional conventions. Concerns were raised about the ambiguity and potential risks of such conventions. Both resolutions were recommended as ITL, with HCR 1 passing unanimously and HCR 4 passing with a vote of 16-0.

7. **HR 9 Discussion**: HR 9, a resolution supporting state and federal authority, was discussed. Representative Massimilla initially seconded a motion to recommend the resolution as OTP but withdrew her second after realizing it was for HR 9, not HR 8. The motion passed with a vote of 12-4.

8. **Closing Remarks**: The chair thanked the committee members and indicated the next meeting would be during the crossover session.

The meeting highlighted the committee's focus on state-federal relations, veterans' affairs, and the impact of federal policies on New Hampshire residents.
