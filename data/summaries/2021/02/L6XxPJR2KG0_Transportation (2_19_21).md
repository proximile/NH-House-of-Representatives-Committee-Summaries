**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (2/19/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on February 19, 2021, to discuss and debate several transportation-related bills. The meeting focused on balancing safety, accessibility, environmental protection, and regulatory efficiency. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **Power Boat Restrictions and Public Waters**
- **Meter Pond Motor Use (HB 386)**: Representative Spike Sykes proposed allowing small electric trolling motors (55 lbs. or less) on Meter Pond for individuals with disabilities who have handicap plates. The pond, located in the White Mountain National Forest, currently prohibits motorized use. While proponents argued for increased accessibility, the Department of Safety and Marine Patrol opposed the bill, citing environmental sensitivity and existing statutes (RSA 270:29) that restrict mechanical power in the national forest.

#### **House Bill 100: Crossing Unbroken Center Lines**
- This bill would permit drivers to cross unbroken painted center lines to avoid parked vehicles or emergency equipment. The bill, reintroduced from the previous session, aims to address practical driving scenarios.

#### **House Bill 461: Motorcycle Safety and Representation**
- The bill proposes adding the New Hampshire Motorcyclist Rights Organization (NHMRO) to the Traffic Safety Commission and allowing motorcycles to have more than three front lights for safety. Supporters argued that additional lighting improves visibility for riders and oncoming traffic, aligning with federal safety standards. The bill received broad support.

#### **House Bill 628: Increased Speed Limits**
- The bill seeks to raise speed limits on certain roads: 55 mph to 60 mph, 65 mph to 70 mph, and 70 mph to 75 mph. Proponents argued that current limits are below the natural flow of traffic, creating unsafe speed differentials. However, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation opposed the bill, citing increased crash severity at higher speeds. Concerns were also raised about the impact on work zone safety.

#### **House Bill 522: Vehicle Inspection Frequency**
- The bill proposes extending the inspection interval for new vehicles under warranty from one year to two years. Proponents argued that new vehicles are safer and equipped with advanced sensors, reducing the need for frequent inspections. However, opponents, including auto technicians and safety advocates, highlighted the risks of undetected safety issues (e.g., worn tires, brake problems) and potential non-compliance with EPA emissions regulations. Motorcyclists also opposed the bill, noting the rapid wear of motorcycle tires.

#### **House Bill 515: Confidentiality for Reporting Medically Unfit Drivers**
- This bill aims to protect the confidentiality of individuals reporting potentially medically unfit drivers to the DMV. Prime sponsor Representative O'Hara shared a personal story to emphasize the need for anonymity. The DMV opposed the bill, citing existing safeguards and processes, and noted that most reports come from law enforcement or medical professionals.

#### **House Bill 224: Window Tinting Standards**
- The committee debated a bill regarding window tinting standards, adopting an amendment to align New Hampshire with national standards. Some members raised concerns about public safety and enforcement.

#### **House Bill 279: Increased Weight Limits for Forestry Trucks**
- The bill proposes increasing the weight limit for trucks carrying raw forestry products, with an amendment to align New Hampshire’s standards with neighboring states. Supporters argued it would benefit the forestry industry without significantly increasing road wear.

#### **House Bill 329: Storage of Rail Cars with Hazardous Materials**
- The bill, which restricts the storage of rail cars with hazardous materials, faced opposition due to concerns about increased public safety risks and potential heating issues in colder regions.

### **Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Safety vs. Efficiency**: Discussions often centered on balancing safety concerns (e.g., vehicle inspections, speed limits, work zone safety) with efforts to improve efficiency and reduce regulatory burdens.
2. **Accessibility and Environmental Protection**: Bills like HB 386 (Meter Pond) and HB 461 (motorcycle lighting) highlighted the tension between increasing accessibility for specific groups and protecting environmental and public safety interests.
3. **Industry and Regulatory Alignment**: Bills such as HB 279 (forestry trucks) and HB 224 (window tinting) focused on aligning New Hampshire’s regulations with industry needs and national standards.
4. **Opposition from State Agencies**: Several bills faced opposition from state agencies (e.g., DMV, DOT, Marine Patrol), which cited existing laws, safety risks, and enforcement challenges.

### **Next Steps**
The committee retained several bills (e.g., HB 104, HB 678) for further study and potential amendments. The March 11th deadline for passing bills was noted, with plans to reconvene after receiving Senate bills.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of transportation legislation, requiring careful consideration of safety, accessibility, environmental concerns, and regulatory alignment.
