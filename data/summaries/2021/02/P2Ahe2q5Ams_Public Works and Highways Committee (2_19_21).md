**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (2/19/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on February 19, 2021, to discuss a wide range of topics related to the state’s capital budget, infrastructure projects, disaster recovery, and technology initiatives. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on prioritizing and funding essential projects to maintain and improve state facilities and systems. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and presentations:

---

### **1. Capital Budget Process and Infrastructure Projects**
The committee reviewed the state’s capital budget process, which involves the submission of agency requests, hearings, and prioritization of projects based on health, safety, and urgency. Projects were categorized into A, B, and C priorities, with a focus on critical needs such as leaking roofs, outdated mechanical systems, and failing infrastructure. Key infrastructure projects discussed included:
- **Court Facilities**: Cooling system upgrades, boiler replacements, and roof repairs, with an emphasis on addressing urgent issues like failed underground storage tanks.
- **State Buildings**: Life safety improvements, fire suppression systems, electrical upgrades, and sewer line repairs for facilities like the New Hampshire Hospital campus and state office buildings.
- **Steam Boiler Replacement**: A $27 million project to replace steam boilers across multiple state buildings, which is nearing completion and expected to come in under budget.
- **Rochester Circuit Courthouse**: Concerns were raised about the proposed $15 million project, particularly the lack of a secured site, though the city of Rochester expressed interest in the project.

### **2. Statewide Emergency Fund**
The committee discussed the Statewide Emergency Fund, which is used to address unexpected emergencies such as sewer line breaks, bird infestations, and fire alarm repairs. The fund ensures that urgent issues can be addressed promptly without waiting for the next capital budget cycle. Examples of past usage included a multi-million dollar issue at a warehouse and smaller, more frequent maintenance needs.

### **3. IT Projects and Cybersecurity**
The growing role of IT projects in the capital budget was a significant focus. Key initiatives included:
- **New Hampshire First**: Upgrades to the state’s primary financial and HR system, with a transition to cloud-based services highlighted as a critical modernization effort.
- **Cybersecurity Enhancements**: Expanding monitoring, improving user validation, and leveraging new intrusion protection systems.
- **Disaster Recovery and Continuity of Operations**: The state lacks a robust disaster recovery plan for its IT systems. Funding was allocated for an analysis of current capabilities and recommendations for improvement, ensuring critical state services can be quickly restored after physical disasters like severe weather events.

### **4. Energy Efficiency and Conservation**
The State Energy Manager’s Office, established in 2005, was reviewed for its role in energy conservation projects. The committee considered a $1 million investment in energy-saving projects, such as energy-efficient lighting, boilers, and weatherization, which have a payback period of six to seven years. These initiatives save the state money over time and align with broader energy efficiency goals.

### **5. Department of Military Affairs and Veteran Services**
The Department of Military Affairs and Veteran Services presented its capital budget requests, including projects for anti-terrorism force protection, energy resiliency, maintenance shops, and barracks. The department emphasized the need for funding to sustain aging armories and other facilities. The New Hampshire Veterans Home also highlighted vital needs, such as parking lot repairs, infrastructure improvements, and a master plan update to address long-term care facility needs and safety guidelines, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### **6. Debt Affordability and Budget Priorities**
State Treasurer **Monica Mapelli** presented an updated debt affordability study, noting that the debt-to-revenue ratio decreased to 6.7% in FY20 and is expected to drop to 6.2% in FY21 due to stronger-than-expected revenues and lower debt issuance. She recommended maintaining the $120 million bond authorization, consistent with previous years, to preserve the state’s financial health and credit rating. The governor’s budget director, **Matt**, discussed the capital budget priorities, including $40 million for IT projects, the largest allocation in the budget. The budget includes $125 million in general fund appropriations, with $17 million in new capital appropriations, and emphasizes flexibility in allocating potential federal infrastructure funds.

### **7. Security and Maintenance Concerns**
The committee addressed security concerns in older courthouses, which were not originally designed to meet current security standards. While the Rochester courthouse is not at immediate risk, it may require security upgrades in the future. The committee also reviewed the challenges of estimating roofing project costs, which can vary significantly based on market conditions, and emphasized the importance of accurate cost estimation and prioritization.

### **8. Public Engagement and Next Steps**
The committee planned to hold public hearings and work sessions to finalize the capital budget. They discussed the process of developing amendments to House Bill 25 and the importance of public input. Committee members were also guided on accessing relevant documents via the legislative budget assistant’s website to review capital improvement requests and other budget-related materials.
