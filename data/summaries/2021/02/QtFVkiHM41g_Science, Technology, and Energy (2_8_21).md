The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee met on February 8, 2021, to discuss several key bills and issues, focusing on environmental policy, energy efficiency, broadband deployment, and legislative oversight. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 168: Low-Emission and Zero-Emission Vehicle (LEV/ZEV) Standards**
The committee debated **HB 168**, which proposes adopting California’s stringent LEV/ZEV standards under **Section 177 of the Clean Air Act** to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Key points included:
- **Support**: Proponents highlighted environmental and health benefits, noting that 14 states, including neighboring New England states, have adopted these standards. They argued that New Hampshire risks falling behind in clean energy leadership and tourism appeal.
- **Opposition**: Critics expressed concerns about overregulation, potential economic impacts, and the lack of charging infrastructure. They advocated for a New Hampshire-specific solution, with the New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association proposing a legislative study commission instead of mandates.
- **Economic and Practical Concerns**: Questions were raised about the impact on the electric grid, road toll revenues, and vehicle costs. Some representatives called for detailed analysis before moving forward.

### **House Bill 289: Energy Storage Facilities**
The committee discussed **HB 289**, which aims to include electrical storage facilities with a peak capacity of 30 megawatt hours or more in the definition of energy facilities. Key points included:
- **Housekeeping Measure**: The bill was seen as a technical update to address utility-scale storage facilities, with no significant opposition.
- **Clarifications Needed**: Concerns were raised about distinguishing between **megawatts** (capacity) and **megawatt hours** (storage), and whether such facilities should fall under the jurisdiction of the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC).

### **House Bill 308: Broadband Access and Utility Pole Replacements**
The committee focused on **HB 308**, which addresses the cost-sharing for replacing utility poles to accommodate broadband attachments, particularly in rural areas. Key points included:
- **Cost-Sharing Debate**: The bill proposed that cable companies pay the **depreciated cost** of poles, with utilities covering the remainder. Supporters argued this would facilitate broadband expansion in rural areas, while opponents, including the NH Electric Co-op, advocated for the **cost causation rule**, where the requesting party bears the full cost.
- **Regulatory Framework**: Discussions emphasized the role of the FCC and NH Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in regulating pole attachments and costs, with concerns about unintended consequences of shifting costs.
- **Broadband Expansion Challenges**: Stakeholders highlighted the complexities of deploying broadband in rural areas, including economic feasibility and infrastructure challenges, and called for collaborative solutions.

### **House Bill 371: Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Procedures**
The committee discussed **HB 371**, which seeks to clarify that PUC rate-related proceedings must be conducted as **adjudicative proceedings** rather than legislative ones. Key points included:
- **Transparency vs. Candid Discussions**: Some members advocated for public deliberations to ensure transparency and accountability, while others argued that private deliberations allow for more candid discussions among commissioners.

### **House Bill 614: Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and Municipal Opt-Out**
The committee debated **HB 614**, which allows municipalities to opt out of paying into the RPS, which funds renewable energy projects. Key points included:
- **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to address the "free rider" issue, preventing towns that opt out from applying for grants from the Renewable Energy Fund.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill gives towns flexibility to manage budgets and energy costs, particularly smaller municipalities with limited resources.
- **Opposition**: Critics expressed concerns that the bill undermines the RPS, reduces funding for renewable energy, and creates inequities between towns. The bill passed as amended with significant opposition.

### **House Bill 373: Restricting DES Participation in Low-Carbon Fuel Programs**
The committee discussed **HB 373**, which aims to prevent the Department of Environmental Services (DES) from participating in or planning for low-carbon fuel standard programs, including the Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI). Key points included:
- **Support**: Supporters argued that TCI would raise gas prices, disproportionately affecting low-income residents, and that New Hampshire should not waste resources on programs it won’t join.
- **Opposition**: Critics warned that prohibiting DES from participating in regional discussions would leave New Hampshire uninformed and unable to influence policies that could still affect the state.
- **Outcome**: The committee heard extensive testimony but did not reach a final decision, with plans to continue discussions in subsequent sessions.

### **Other Bills and Discussions**
- **House Bill 309**: The committee opened a public hearing on **HB 309**, which proposes using ISO New England data for renewable energy credit calculations instead of a fixed 20% capacity factor. Supporters emphasized the need for accurate energy forecasting.
- **House Bill 119**: The committee voted to **kill the bill (ITL)**, which concerned the legislature’s authority over setting the System Benefits Charge (SBC) for energy efficiency programs, with some arguing that the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is better suited to manage these programs.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Environmental Policy**: Discussions on HB 168 and HB 614 highlighted the tension between environmental goals and economic considerations, with debates over mandates vs. market-driven solutions and local vs. state-level control.
2. **Broadband Expansion**: HB 308 underscored the challenges of deploying broadband in rural areas, with calls for collaborative solutions and clear regulatory frameworks.
3. **Legislative Oversight**: Bills like HB 371 and HB 119 raised questions about the role of the legislature vs. regulatory bodies in managing energy policy and efficiency programs.
4. **Regional Participation**: HB 373 reflected broader tensions between fiscal conservatism, environmental policy, and New Hampshire’s role in regional initiatives like TCI.

The meeting concluded with plans for further discussions and executive sessions to address unresolved issues and refine legislative proposals.
