Differences between Republican and Democrat estimates were discussed, with members often opting to split the difference to reach bipartisan consensus.  
3. **Business Taxes**: Significant attention was given to business tax estimates, with concerns about COVID-19's impact on revenues. The committee considered potential losses and the uncertainty of future revenue streams, particularly in light of new federal stimulus packages.

### **COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts and Challenges**
1. **Vaccination Progress**: Officials discussed the state's centralized vaccination approach, highlighting collaborations with pharmacies like Walgreens and the National Guard to expedite vaccinations.  
2. **Distribution Challenges**: Issues with the VAMS scheduling system were addressed, including difficulties in rescheduling appointments. A new state system is being developed to improve scheduling flexibility, particularly for Phase 2 vaccinations.  
3. **Johnson & Johnson Vaccine**: Plans were made for the potential arrival of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which requires only one dose. Discussions included distribution strategies and whether residents would have a choice in vaccine type.  
4. **Public Health Messaging**: Concerns were raised about the need for clearer messaging on mask-wearing and respiratory droplet spread, with officials emphasizing education and community cooperation.  
5. **Herd Immunity and Summer Outlook**: The timeline for achieving herd immunity (estimated at 70-75% vaccination rates) remains uncertain. Officials expressed cautious optimism for summer 2021, expecting more flexibility than in 2020 but stressing the continued need for masks and social distancing.  
6. **Community Compliance**: The impact of individuals refusing to follow safety guidelines or get vaccinated was acknowledged as a challenge, with officials underscoring the importance of community cooperation.

### **COVID-19 Trends and Public Health Updates**
1. **Case Trends**: The Deputy Director of Public Health reported declining COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations since the post-holiday spike, with active cases below 3,000 and hospitalizations just above 100. However, the U.S. has surpassed 500,000 COVID-19 deaths, significantly impacting life expectancy.  
2. **Variants of Concern**: Three major variants (B117, B1351, and P1) were discussed, with the B117 (UK) variant being the most prevalent in New Hampshire. Vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) remain effective in reducing severe illness and hospitalization from these variants.  
3. **Vaccination Efforts**: New Hampshire is administering 4,000 to 5,000 vaccines daily, with 74% of received doses administered. Approximately 12% of the population has received one dose, and 5% are fully vaccinated. The state is in Phase 1b, focusing on those 65+ and individuals with comorbidities, with Phase 2 (teachers, childcare workers, and those aged 50-64) approaching.  
4. **Logistical Challenges**: Efforts to address vaccine supply, appointment scheduling, and throughput at vaccination sites include redeploying state workers, using empty retail spaces (e.g., an old JC Penney in Lebanon), and collaborating with the National Guard and community partners.  
5. **Public Access and Support**: Constituents are encouraged to call 2-1-1 for vaccination questions, though wait times can be long. The state is working to improve the registration system and ensure equitable access for vulnerable populations.  
6. **Future Plans**: The state is preparing for increased vaccine supply, including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and is focused on achieving herd immunity. Guidance for summer camps and other activities is expected soon, with continued emphasis on testing, isolation, and quarantine to prevent spread.
