The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on February 19, 2021, addressed several key bills and issues, focusing on transparency, privacy, remote meetings, and the balance of power between the legislature and judiciary. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Transparency and Public Access**
1. **House Bill 108**:  
   - **Purpose**: Enhances transparency by requiring public bodies to maintain and publish a list of non-public session actions.  
   - **Support**: Advocates, including Right-to-Know New Hampshire, argued it would promote accountability and help unseal outdated non-public minutes.  
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) claimed it would create administrative burdens without significant benefits, as details are already accessible via Right-to-Know requests.  

2. **House Bill 206**:  
   - **Purpose**: Requires collective bargaining negotiations to be conducted in public, with strategy sessions remaining private.  
   - **Support**: Sponsors emphasized transparency, arguing taxpayers and union members deserve insight into negotiations impacting public funds and employee conditions.  
   - **Opposition**: Unions and labor representatives argued that public negotiations could lead to delays, increased costs, and less candid discussions, undermining the bargaining process.  

3. **House Bill 216**:  
   - **Purpose**: Allows public bodies to continue using remote meeting technologies post-pandemic to increase public access and participation.  
   - **Support**: Proponents highlighted benefits such as increased civic participation, convenience for board members, and accessibility for individuals with disabilities or scheduling conflicts.  
   - **Concerns**: Critics, including Right to Know NH, stressed the need for safeguards to ensure transparency, accessibility, and technical reliability.  

### **Privacy and Surveillance**
4. **House Bill 474**:  
   - **Purpose**: Prohibits state surveillance on public ways or sidewalks, updating laws to prevent warrantless tracking of motor vehicle occupants and pedestrians.  
   - **Support**: Advocates, including the ACLU of NH, emphasized the need to protect privacy rights and prevent New Hampshire from becoming a "surveillance state."  
   - **Concerns**: Stakeholders raised questions about the bill’s impact on toll booth cameras, parking enforcement, and law enforcement tools. Amendments were proposed to address these issues.  
   - **Exceptions**: The bill includes exceptions for specific uses, such as security at state properties, with a 24-day storage limit unless needed for judicial proceedings.  

5. **House Bill 384**:  
   - **Purpose**: Protects individuals' location data by prohibiting companies from sharing it without explicit consent, except for emergency services or legal processes.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued it safeguards privacy rights in an era of pervasive data collection.  
   - **Concerns**: Critics highlighted potential impacts on law enforcement, public health (e.g., contact tracing), and businesses relying on aggregated location data.  

### **Remote Meetings and Efficiency**
6. **House Bill 630**:  
   - **Purpose**: Codifies the governor’s emergency order allowing remote meetings and streamlines rulemaking procedures, particularly for licensing boards.  
   - **Support**: Testimony highlighted the benefits of remote meetings, including increased participation, convenience, and easier recruitment of board members.  
   - **Efficiency**: The bill also proposes accepting photocopied or scanned signatures for rulemaking to improve administrative efficiency.  

### **Education Funding and Judicial Authority**
7. **House Concurrent Resolution 3 (HCR 3)**:  
   - **Purpose**: Declares that the Claremont court decisions on school funding are not binding on the legislature.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued the judiciary overstepped its authority and that the legislature should retain control over education funding decisions.  
   - **Opposition**: Critics, including the School Funding Fairness Project, defended the Claremont decisions as necessary to ensure equitable education funding and called the resolution a rhetorical revisitation of past debates.  

### **Key Themes**
- **Transparency vs. Efficiency**: Discussions highlighted the tension between increasing transparency in government processes and maintaining efficiency in administrative and collective bargaining procedures.  
- **Privacy vs. Public Safety**: Bills addressing privacy and surveillance sparked debates about balancing individual privacy rights with the needs of law enforcement and public health.  
- **Remote Meetings**: The pandemic’s impact on public meetings was a recurring theme, with broad support for making remote participation a permanent option while addressing technical and accessibility challenges.  
- **Judicial Authority**: The debate over HCR 3 underscored ongoing tensions between the legislature and judiciary regarding education funding and the separation of powers.  

The committee concluded its hearings with plans to further discuss and amend the bills, reflecting the complexity of balancing transparency, privacy, efficiency, and constitutional principles in New Hampshire’s governance.
