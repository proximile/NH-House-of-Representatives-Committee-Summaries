**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (2/4/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 4, 2021, to discuss and vote on a series of bills addressing sports betting, taxation, administrative efficiency, and fiscal responsibility. The meeting included detailed discussions, public hearings, and votes on key legislation, as well as procedural and technical considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes:

---

### **Sports Betting and Lottery Commission Bills**

1. **HB 281**: This bill delays the implementation of single sales factor apportionment for business taxes (BET and BP taxes) until 2026 and establishes a committee to monitor tax changes. Concerns were raised about the lack of hearings and public input, but the bill was passed unanimously (22-0) and placed on the consent calendar.

2. **HB 353**: The committee voted unanimously (22-0) to retain this bill for further study, as it raises questions about tax credits for taxes paid to other states on interest and dividends.

3. **HB 533**: This bill formalizes the establishment of a Division of Investigation and Compliance within the Lottery Commission, codifying existing practices without adding new staff. It was passed unanimously (22-0) and placed on the consent calendar.

4. **HB 181**: This bill allows municipalities flexibility to vote on sports betting retail locations at different elections. Concerns were raised about voter turnout and the process, prompting the committee to revisit the bill after further clarification from the sponsor.

5. **HB 330**: This bill permits in-game (Tier 2) betting at retail sportsbook locations and removes the cap on the number of retail locations. Supporters argued it would enhance revenue and consumer choice, while opponents raised concerns about problem gambling and market saturation. The committee closed the hearing without a vote.

6. **HB 354**: This bill clarifies the language on ballots for local sports betting referendums to avoid implying municipal liability. The committee closed the hearing without a vote.

### **Revenue Administration and Tax Modernization Bills**

1. **HB 306**: This bill formalizes the process of updating revenue estimates during emergency orders, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rep. Norman Major explained that it codifies the current practice of monthly revenue updates. Some representatives questioned whether the bill should be broader to apply to future emergencies, but Rep. Major preferred to keep it specific to the current pandemic. The committee discussed whether the bill was necessary, given existing statutory authority.

2. **HB 324**: This bill proposes technical changes to streamline tax administration, including modifying how interest is assessed on tax bills and eliminating outdated filing methods. Carolyn Lear, Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA), emphasized that the changes are taxpayer-friendly and improve efficiency. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on taxpayers and costs.

3. **HB 528**: This bill mandates electronic filing for tax preparers who file more than 25 returns annually, aiming to modernize tax filing processes. Supporters, including Rep. Michael Gunski and CPA Jeff Chickering, highlighted inefficiencies in the current paper-based system and the benefits of e-filing. Concerns were raised about potential cost increases for taxpayers, the complexity of New Hampshire’s tax system, and the need for an opt-out provision for preparers who cannot e-file. The DRA supported e-filing but took no position on mandating it.

### **Fiscal Responsibility and Dedicated Funds**

1. **HB 134**: This bill repeals several inactive or unnecessary dedicated funds as part of a broader effort to clean up the state’s financial records. Rep. Norman Major and Rep. Edith Tucker explained that the bill resulted from a joint committee’s review of dedicated funds, with some funds being lapsed to the general fund or other agencies. The bill also includes technical corrections to related statutes.
