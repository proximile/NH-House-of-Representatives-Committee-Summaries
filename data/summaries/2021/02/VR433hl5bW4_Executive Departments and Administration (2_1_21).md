The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on February 1, 2021, to discuss several bills addressing a wide range of issues, from cybersecurity and professional licensing to retirement systems and public health. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

#### **Cybersecurity and Tobacco Licensing**
1. **HB 425 - Cybersecurity**:
   - The bill seeks to formalize two cybersecurity entities—the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and the NH Cybersecurity Integration Center—into state law, transitioning them from operating under executive orders.
   - Commissioner Dennis Goulet of the Department of Information Technology testified, highlighting the critical role of cybersecurity in protecting state systems, especially during elections and the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - The bill is cost-neutral and focuses on enhancing cybersecurity policy and incident response without additional financial burden.

2. **HB 591 - Tobacco Licensing**:
   - This bill addresses inconsistencies in tobacco licensing fees, proposing higher fees for tobacco-only licenses to align them with alcohol licensing fees and fund enforcement efforts.
   - Representative Abrami, the bill's sponsor, introduced amendments to reduce costs by changing proposed sworn investigator positions to civilian examiners (auditors).
   - Testimony from the Liquor Commission and advocacy groups like New Futures supported the bill, emphasizing the need for resources to enforce age 21 compliance for tobacco and vaping products.

#### **Professional Licensing and Regulation**
1. **HB 94 - Professional Licensing Renewals**:
   - The bill aims to standardize license renewals across professional boards by shifting to a system based on the licensee’s birthday and transferring fee-setting authority to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).
   - The OPLC supported the bill, noting it would improve administrative efficiency and ensure fees cover operational costs without exceeding 125%.

2. **HB 70 - Microblading Certification**:
   - The bill proposes a certification for cosmetologists and estheticians to perform microblading, a semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing technique.
   - Concerns were raised by licensed tattoo artists and the Body Art Advisory Board, who argued that microblading requires specialized training and should remain regulated as a form of tattooing.
   - Testimonies highlighted public health risks, such as infection and scarring, if the procedure is performed by inadequately trained individuals.
   - The committee discussed the need for clear certification standards and potential amendments to address safety concerns.

#### **Music Therapy Licensure**
1. **HB 209 - Music Therapy Licensure**:
   - The bill seeks to establish licensure for music therapists in New Hampshire, ensuring practitioners meet state and national standards and enabling insurance reimbursement for services.
   - Testimonies from board-certified music therapists highlighted the rigorous education and training required, as well as the therapeutic benefits for vulnerable populations.
   - Concerns were raised by the New Hampshire Speech-Language and Hearing Association regarding the bill’s language on communication disorders, emphasizing the need for clear boundaries between professions.
   - The committee discussed potential amendments to clarify the scope of practice and ensure collaboration between professions while protecting public safety.

#### **Retirement Systems**
1. **HB 211 - Manchester Employees Contributory Retirement System (MECRS)**:
   - The bill proposes changes to the Manchester retirement system, including increased contribution rates for new employees and adjustments to retirement age and benefits.
   - Opponents, including union representatives, argued that the bill unfairly shifts the burden of unfunded liabilities onto future employees and could deter recruitment.
   - Supporters, including former MECRS executive director Gerard Flurry, emphasized the need for sustainability and alignment with the state’s retirement system.
   - The committee delayed action on the bill pending input from the Manchester Board of Aldermen and the Retirement Board.

2. **HB 356 - Administrative Adjustments to MECRS**:
   - This bill addresses administrative issues, such as filling trustee vacancies and ensuring compliance with federal tax regulations.
   - The committee supported the bill, recognizing its importance for maintaining the system’s integrity.

3. **HB 390 - Extending Unfunded Liability Timeline**:
   - The bill proposes extending the timeline for paying off unfunded liabilities in the state retirement system, which would increase long-term costs for taxpayers.
   - The committee voted against the bill, deeming it fiscally irresponsible.

4. **HB 536 - Death Benefits for Public Works Employees**:
   - The bill provides one-time death benefits for public works employees killed in the line of duty.
   - The committee voted in favor of the bill, recognizing the importance of supporting public works employees and their families.

Further discussions and amendments are expected as the bills progress through the legislative process.
