The bill received strong support from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and local health officers, who highlighted its potential to improve public health readiness and communication.

#### **Municipal and County Governance**
- **House Bill 183 (Lemonade Stands)**: Representative Chris True introduced this bill to prohibit municipalities from requiring licenses for lemonade stands operated by individuals under 18. The bill sparked discussions about its scope, with an amendment proposed to include "soft drinks" instead of just lemonade.
- **House Bill 332 (Developments of Regional Impact)**: Representative Brian Seaworth presented this bill to streamline the review process for developments with regional impacts. The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) opposed the bill as written but expressed willingness to work with the sponsor to refine it.
- **House Bill 380 and 560 (County Commissioner Terms)**: These bills propose shifting county commissioners' terms from two to four years to ensure continuity and institutional knowledge. Concerns were raised about the piecemeal approach to county governance and potential inconsistencies across counties.
- **House Bill 101 (County Financial Records)**: The committee discussed extending the deadline for closing county financial books from 30 to 45 days. The amendment passed unanimously, and the bill was moved to the consent calendar.

#### **Perambulation and Boundary Marking**
- **House Bill 404 (Perambulation)**: This bill proposes allowing towns to use satellite imagery or GPS instead of physically walking and marking boundaries every seven years.

Supporters, represented by the NHMA, emphasized the need for flexibility and the potential benefits of modern technology.
