**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (February 3, 2021)**

On February 3, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened virtually to discuss several bills related to condominium associations, healthcare transparency, and vaccine injury compensation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Condominium Association Legislation**

#### **House Bill 462: Lien Assessments and Foreclosure by Condominium Associations**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows condominium associations to place a **priority lien** on units for unpaid fees and to **foreclose** on the unit if necessary, addressing situations where unit owners fail to pay fees, leaving associations financially strained. It builds on a 2010 law that allowed a six-month priority lien but did not permit foreclosure.
- **Support**: Sponsors and stakeholders argued that foreclosure is a last resort, rarely used, and primarily intended to resolve delinquencies on abandoned properties. Supporters noted that 17 other states allow foreclosure on priority liens, and New Hampshire is the only one that does not.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Bankers Association and Mortgage Bankers Brokers Association expressed concerns about increased lender risk, higher borrowing costs, and potential harm to the housing market, especially during the pandemic.
- **Outcome**: The committee heard detailed arguments from both sides, with further deliberation and potential amendments needed to address concerns.

#### **House Bill 358: Solar Energy Projects in Condominiums**
- **Purpose**: The bill lowers the voting threshold for solar energy projects in condominium associations from a supermajority (two-thirds or three-quarters) to a simple majority (50% +1), aiming to reduce barriers to renewable energy adoption.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the current high threshold makes it difficult to implement solar projects, even when most unit owners support them. The bill applies to new condos built after December 1, 2021, or existing condos that revise their bylaws after that date.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about potential damage to shared property, financial burdens on unit owners, and fairness in multi-building associations. Amendments were proposed to clarify that the vote should involve the entire association and apply to shared solar systems.
- **Outcome**: The committee discussed refining the bill to address practical and legal concerns.

#### **House Bill 336: Condominium Dispute Resolution Board**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes creating a **Condominium Dispute Resolution Board** to provide an alternative to costly court proceedings for resolving disputes between unit owners and condominium associations.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the board would offer a more accessible, economical, and less formal process for resolving disputes, modeled after the successful **Manufactured Housing Dispute Resolution Board**.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about unnecessary bureaucracy, costs, and the board’s ability to handle disputes fairly. Amendments were proposed to tighten the language and expand the board’s scope to include disputes between unit owners.
- **Outcome**: The committee discussed refining the bill to balance accessibility and fairness.

### **Healthcare Transparency Legislation**

#### **House Bill 264: Price Quotes for Non-Emergency Healthcare Services**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires healthcare providers to provide price quotes for non-emergency services upon patient request, aiming to improve cost transparency.
- **Support**: Proponents emphasized the need for transparency to help patients make informed decisions and avoid unexpected costs.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Hospital Association, argued that the bill could impose administrative burdens and is redundant given existing federal transparency regulations. Concerns were raised about the practicality of providing accurate quotes within a three-day window.
- **Outcome**: The committee acknowledged the bill’s complexity and suggested retaining it for further study and refinement.

#### **House Bill 488: Out-of-State Health Insurance Study**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes a study committee to explore the benefits of allowing New Hampshire residents to purchase health insurance from out-of-state companies.
- **Outcome**: The committee moved forward with discussions on the bill.

### **Vaccine Injury Compensation Legislation**

#### **House Bill 592: Compensation for Vaccine Injuries**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to establish a mechanism for compensating individuals injured by vaccines, requiring manufacturers to post a bond to cover potential claims.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill would provide quicker compensation and accountability for vaccine injuries, addressing inadequacies in the federal compensation system.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including pharmaceutical industry representatives, argued that the bill is preempted by federal laws like the **National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act** and the **PREP Act**. Concerns were raised about due process, fraud, and the state’s ability to administer claims.
- **Outcome**: The public hearing concluded with mixed support and opposition, highlighting the complexities of vaccine injury compensation and the tension between state and federal jurisdiction.
