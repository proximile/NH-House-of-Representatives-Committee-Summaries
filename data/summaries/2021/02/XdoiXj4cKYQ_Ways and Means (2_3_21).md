The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 3, 2021, in a virtual meeting due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The session focused on detailed revenue projections, the economic impact of the pandemic, and the management of state funds across various sectors. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **Revenue Estimates and Sector-Specific Updates**
1. **Insurance Department**:
   - The committee reviewed tax liabilities, credits, and prepayments for insurance companies, with a focus on retaliatory taxes, where New Hampshire charges out-of-state companies based on fees imposed on New Hampshire companies in those states.
   - Revenue estimates for premium taxes, fees, and transfers to the Granite Advantage Health Care Trust were adjusted slightly downward for fiscal year (FY) 2021 due to updated data.
   - Projections for FY 2022 and FY 2023 were also discussed, with a slight decrease expected in 2022 ($127 million) due to slow economic recovery, followed by an increase in 2023 ($133.3 million) as the economy rebounds.

2. **Securities Bureau**:
   - The bureau reported significant increases in broker-dealer and investment advisor fees, with FY 2021 projections set at $41.25 million.
   - Continued growth in mutual fund fees, due in May, was anticipated.

3. **Lottery Commission**:
   - Revenue estimates were provided for FY 2021 ($120 million), FY 2022 ($125 million), and FY 2023 ($127 million).
   - Growth was expected in sports betting and internet betting, but scratch ticket sales were projected to slow after a historic surge.
   - Concerns were raised about potential revenue losses if Massachusetts legalizes sports betting.

4. **Fish and Game Department**:
   - Revenue sources, including licenses, agent fees, and transfers from the Department of Safety for Off-Highway Recreational Vehicle (OHRV) and marine road tolls, were outlined.
   - The committee discussed how gasoline sold for OHRV and marine use is tracked and reported.

5. **Liquor Commission**:
   - Liquor and beer tax revenues were strong in January, with total revenues up 4.7% and liquor revenue up 5.3%.
   - The commission expressed confidence in meeting revenue targets despite challenges related to transfers to the Alcohol Fund.

### **Dedicated Funds and Revenue Transfers**

- Revenue transfers from various sources, including labor and aircraft operations fees, were discussed. The Treasurer’s office highlighted the challenges of estimating revenue from securities sales due to market volatility.
- The methodology for estimating abandoned property revenue, based on a 10-year average, was explained. The pandemic’s potential impact on abandoned property was noted but not factored into current estimates.

### **Impact of COVID-19 and Economic Recovery**
- The committee discussed the varying impacts of COVID-19 on state revenues, with sectors like meals and rooms taxes significantly affected, while dedicated funds remained relatively stable.
- The economic impact of vaccinations was a key topic, with the committee emphasizing the need for expert input from medical and economic professionals to refine revenue projections.
- The pandemic’s influence on revenue streams, such as potential declines in lottery sales due to reduced discretionary spending, was also addressed.

### **Logistical and Procedural Matters**
- The meeting was conducted virtually, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone. Roll call attendance was taken, and the chair expressed a preference for fully virtual meetings to ensure effective participation.
- The committee outlined a busy schedule of public hearings, work sessions, and meetings with the governor’s budget director to finalize revenue estimates and prepare for upcoming legislative sessions.
- Upcoming public hearings and revenue work sessions were planned for February 4, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, and 23, with a focus on understanding the economic impact of COVID-19 and vaccinations.

- **Transparency and Oversight**: There was a strong emphasis on ensuring transparency in revenue management and the appropriate use of dedicated funds.
- **Pandemic Impact**: COVID-19’s influence on state finances was a recurring theme, with discussions on both immediate challenges and long-term recovery strategies.
