**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Legislative Administration (2/22/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 22, 2021, addressed a range of legislative bills, procedural matters, and constitutional amendments, with a strong emphasis on **modernizing legislative processes**, **increasing accessibility and transparency**, and **addressing systemic barriers** to public participation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **1. Focus on Accessibility and Technology**
- **House Bill 558 (HB 558)**:  
  Introduced by Representative Matt Wilhelm, this bill proposes the establishment of a committee to study the use of **Information Technology (IT)** in the legislative process. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of technologies like **video conferencing**, which has significantly **increased accessibility** for individuals who face barriers to in-person participation, such as caregivers, rural residents, people with disabilities, and those with limited transportation or childcare options.  
  - **Support**: Advocates, including recovery organizations and healthcare providers, testified that remote participation has **empowered marginalized groups** and reduced logistical and financial burdens.  
  - **Study Committee Goals**: The committee would assess **training needs**, evaluate **technical and logistical requirements**, review **House and Senate rules**, and explore how other states use IT in lawmaking.  
  - **Opposition**: Representative Howard opposed the bill, though specific reasons were not detailed.  

### **2. Transparency and Legislative Procedures**
- **House Bill 156 (HB 156)**:  
  Introduced by Representative Rebecca McWilliams, this bill aims to increase transparency by requiring amendments to bills to be published on the House website once adopted by a committee. While the House Clerk, Paul Smith, noted that the Clerk’s office is already working on a new website that will include amendments, supporters emphasized the importance of ensuring public access to legislative information.  
- **House Bill 190 (HB 190)**:  
  Presented by Representative Ned Gordon, this bill would reduce administrative burdens by requiring legislators to file financial disclosure forms only in the first year of their term unless their financial circumstances change. While Representative Frost supported the bill for its efficiency, Representative Smith raised concerns about transparency.  

### **3. Ethical and Historical Considerations**
- **House Bill 509 (HB 509)**:  
  Introduced by Representative Janet Wall, this bill clarifies responsibilities for placing portraits, flags, statues, and other memorial objects in the State House and Legislative Office Building. It ensures the joint historic committee has authority over these decisions, addressing long-standing issues regarding space limitations and historical preservation.  

### **4. Constitutional Amendments**
- **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 5 (CACR 5)**:  
  This proposal seeks to decouple legislator pay from the New Hampshire Constitution, allowing adjustments through statute rather than constitutional amendment. Sponsors argued that the current $100 annual salary is outdated and creates financial barriers for younger individuals, working professionals, and those with families to serve in the legislature.  
- **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 11 (CACR 11)**:  
  This proposal would allow the legislature to overturn court decisions on constitutional matters through a legislative vote and referendum. Sponsor Representative Lii argued it would restore the people’s sovereignty and address judicial overreach, while opponents like retired lawyer John Tobin criticized it for undermining the separation of powers.  

### **5. Procedural and Technical Issues**
- **Remote Meetings**: Due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the committee conducted meetings electronically via Zoom, with public hearings and executive sessions held remotely. Technical issues, such as muted microphones and camera problems, were addressed during the session.  
- **Voting Procedures**: The committee voted on several bills, including HB 156 and HB 190, with discussions on whether to accept votes from representatives with technical difficulties.  

### **6. Themes and Broader Implications**
The meeting underscored the **transformative impact** of IT on legislative accessibility and the need for structured approaches to sustain these benefits post-pandemic. Discussions also highlighted the tension between **tradition and innovation**, with calls for updating legislative practices to better serve the public in the 21st century. Key themes included:
- **Inclusivity**: Ensuring diverse voices can participate in governance through remote testimony and reduced financial barriers.  
- **Transparency**: Improving public access to legislative information and processes.  
- **Modernization**: Addressing systemic barriers and updating outdated practices to reflect contemporary needs.  

### **Next Steps**
The committee concluded its hearing on HB 558 and scheduled further discussions on other bills. Upcoming deadlines, such as the March 11th deadline for reporting out certain bills, were also noted. The session emphasized the importance of continued efforts to enhance legislative accessibility, transparency, and efficiency.  

Overall, the meeting reflected a commitment to **modernizing the legislative process** while addressing ethical, historical, and procedural challenges to better serve the public.
