**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (February 26, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on February 26, 2021, covered a wide range of bills and topics, with a strong focus on **individual autonomy**, **civil liberties**, **press freedom**, and **judicial modernization**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **House Bill 540: Supported Decision-Making for Individuals with Disabilities**
HB 540 was a central focus of the meeting, aiming to establish **supported decision-making** as a legal alternative to guardianship for adults with disabilities. The bill seeks to empower individuals with disabilities to retain their autonomy while receiving support from trusted advisors, rather than having their decision-making rights entirely transferred to a guardian.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Purpose**: The bill formalizes supported decision-making agreements, allowing individuals to designate supporters to assist them in making decisions about healthcare, finances, education, and other aspects of their lives.
2. **Guardianship Issues**: New Hampshire has a higher-than-average guardianship rate (76% vs. the national average of 56%). Guardianship often removes an individual’s rights entirely, which can be unnecessarily restrictive and limit independence.
3. **Testimony**:
   - **Representative Wendy Chase** shared her personal experience as a guardian, advocating for supported decision-making as a less restrictive alternative.
   - **Michael Skibby** (Disability Rights Center of New Hampshire) explained how guardianship strips individuals of rights and highlighted that 10 states have already adopted supported decision-making laws.
   - **Attorney Sheila Zachary** raised concerns about the bill’s language, arguing it perpetuated stereotypes about individuals with disabilities.
4. **Special Education Transition**: The bill directs special education staff to inform families about supported decision-making as an alternative to guardianship when students with disabilities turn 18.
5. **Amendments**: Clarifications were made to ensure discussions about guardianship include information about supported decision-making only if guardianship is actively being considered.

The bill was widely supported as a step toward reducing unnecessary guardianships and promoting autonomy for individuals with disabilities.

### **House Bill 453: Shield Laws for Journalists**
HB 453 seeks to protect journalists’ ability to maintain confidentiality with sources, ensuring the public’s access to important information.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Purpose**: The bill would create a "reporter shield law," protecting journalists from being compelled to disclose their sources. New Hampshire is one of only 10 states without such a law.
2. **Testimony**:
   - **Meghan Fidler** (Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press) emphasized the importance of shield laws in enabling journalists to gather and report news without fear of legal repercussions.
   - **Representative Ellen Reed**, the bill’s sponsor, highlighted the need for a free press in a democracy and suggested amendments to address concerns about defining who qualifies as a journalist.

### **House Bill 440: Protection of Religious Liberty**
HB 440 focuses on protecting religious liberty, particularly during states of emergency, by preventing the suspension of constitutional rights.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to ensure that constitutional rights, including religious liberty, cannot be suspended during emergencies.
2. **Testimony**:
   - **Representative Jim Kofalt** introduced the bill, citing concerns about the governor’s emergency powers and the suspension of rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - **Susan Price** highlighted the essential services provided by religious organizations, such as food banks, which were disrupted during the pandemic.
3. **Amendment**: A proposed amendment would replace the original bill’s text, focusing on ensuring constitutional analysis is applied during emergencies rather than allowing rights to be suspended.

### **House Bill 584: Defamation by Media Outlets**
HB 584 would require media outlets to publish updates on criminal cases and controversies they report on.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Opposition**: **Brendan McQuade** (New Hampshire Press Association) and **Gregory Sullivan** (attorney for the New Hampshire Union Leader) strongly opposed the bill, arguing it was unconstitutional, impractical, and would chill free speech.

---

### **House Bill 133: Censorship by Social Media Platforms**
HB 133 seeks to create a cause of action for censorship by social media websites, allowing users to sue platforms if their content is blocked based on political or religious speech.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to protect First Amendment rights in the context of social media censorship.
2. **Testimony**:
   - Supporters, including **Representative PL** and **Christine Wheelie**, argued that the bill is necessary to counter censorship by big tech companies.
   - Opponents, such as **Elizabeth Ellis** (Motion Picture Association), argued the bill was overly broad, unconstitutional, and could impose significant liability on companies.

---

### **House Bill 418: Modernizing Supreme Court Reporting**
HB 418 focuses on modernizing how the New Hampshire Supreme Court publishes its decisions by transitioning from printed volumes to online publication.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to make court opinions more accessible and searchable for the public.
2. **Key Features**:
   - The bill updates the statute to use gender-neutral language when referring to the court reporter.
   - While printed volumes will continue for the foreseeable future, the bill allows for a transition to digital publication to reduce costs and improve accessibility.
