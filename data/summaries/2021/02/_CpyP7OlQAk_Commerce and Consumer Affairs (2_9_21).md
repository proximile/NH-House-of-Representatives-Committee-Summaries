### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (February 9, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 9, 2021, to discuss a series of bills related to liquor, cigars, consumer affairs, and public health. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the governor’s emergency order, with participants joining via Zoom or telephone. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Cigar Bars and Food Service (House Bills 171 & 337)**
- **Current Restrictions**: Cigar bars are prohibited from selling or serving food but allow patrons to bring their own.
- **Proposed Changes**: 
  - **HB 171** and **HB 337** aim to allow cigar bars to sell food, such as snacks, without becoming full-service restaurants.
  - Cigar bars must still derive 60% of their sales from cigar-related products (e.g., cigars, humidors, lighters).
- **Support**: Proponents, including the New Hampshire Cigar Association, argued that snacks complement beverages and enhance the customer experience.
- **Health Concerns**: Opponents raised concerns about combining food with smoking, though proponents emphasized the bill does not turn cigar bars into restaurants.
- **Enforcement**: The Liquor Commission would likely enforce the 60% sales requirement through audits.

### **2. Alcohol Delivery with Food (House Bills 176 & 66)**
- **Background**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants were allowed to deliver alcohol with food under emergency orders.
- **Proposed Changes**: 
  - **HB 176** seeks to make this policy permanent, allowing restaurants with beer and wine licenses to deliver sealed alcoholic beverages alongside food.
  - Deliveries are restricted to private addresses and must be made by W-2 employees aged 21 or older.
- **Support**: Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, argued the policy supports struggling restaurants and wineries.
- **Concerns**: 
  - Opponents, such as New Futures, warned of increased alcohol accessibility and public health risks.
  - Questions were raised about liability for delivery drivers and the exclusion of mixed drinks.
- **Effective Date**: Stakeholders urged moving the effective date from July 1, 2022, to an earlier date to avoid a policy gap.

---

### **3. Liquor Tastings at Farmers' Markets (House Bill 162)**
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 162** would allow liquor manufacturers to conduct tastings at farmers' markets, offering half-ounce samples per label per person.
- **Related Legislation**: **Senate Bill 18**, which passed the Senate, includes additional safeguards, such as limiting participation to small, in-state distilleries.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the bill’s wording, particularly regarding retail sales versus sampling.

---

### **4. Growler Labeling (House Bill 403)**
- **Current Law**: Growlers (refillable beer containers) typically display the brewery’s name but not the specific product.
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 403** would allow growlers to be refilled with a different product than what is labeled, encouraging customers to visit new breweries.
- **Concerns**: Breweries raised issues about product tracing, quality control, and brand representation.
- **Clarification**: The Liquor Commission confirmed that current law does not prohibit refilling growlers with different labels, but breweries may refuse based on quality standards.

---

### **5. Convenience Store Inventory Requirements (House Bill 245)**
- **Current Law**: Convenience stores selling beer, wine, and tobacco must stock $3,000 worth of grocery items.
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 245** would eliminate this requirement, allowing stores to focus on more profitable or specialized items.
- **Arguments in Favor**: 
  - The mandate forces stores to stock unpopular items, leading to waste and inefficiency.
  - Removing the requirement could support local breweries and niche products.
- **Arguments Against**: 
  - The requirement promotes responsible alcohol consumption by associating it with food purchases.
  - Eliminating it could create food deserts in rural areas and increase social harms like disorderly conduct.
- **Enforcement**: The $3,000 requirement is enforced through Liquor Commission inspections.

---

### **6. Hobby Distillation (House Bill 416)**
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 416** would allow hobby distillation of liquor, similar to home brewing of beer and wine.
- **Support**: Proponents argued it’s a craft activity with minimal risk, as hobbyists discard harmful byproducts like methanol.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised safety concerns, particularly for first-time hobbyists, and noted federal prohibitions on home distillation.
- **Context**: Several states already permit hobby distillation without significant enforcement issues.

---

### **7. Pool Safety on Foreclosed Properties (House Bill 166)**
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 166** would establish safety requirements for pools on foreclosed residential properties.
- **Support**: Proponents emphasized the importance of protecting children from unfenced pools.
- **Opposition**: Some representatives argued existing regulations already address these safety measures.
- **Outcome**: The motion to declare the bill "inexpedient to legislate" failed with a 9-9 vote, and the bill was retained for further discussion.

---

### **8. Renters Insurance Notification (House Bill 473)**
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 473** would require landlords to notify renters that their belongings are not covered by the landlord’s insurance and recommend renters insurance.
- **Support**: Proponents argued it would educate renters, particularly after incidents like fires.
- **Opposition**: Opponents felt it was unnecessary government intervention and could lead to unintended consequences.
- **Outcome**: The motion to declare the bill "inexpedient to legislate" failed with a 9-9 vote, and the bill was retained for potential amendment.

---

### **9. Debt Collection Notice (House Bill 109)**
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 109** would have required creditors to notify consumers two weeks before sending a bill to collections.
- **Opposition**: Opponents argued it was unnecessary and burdensome for businesses.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 16-1 to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate."

---

### **10. Amateur Radio Antennas (House Bill 313)**
- **Proposed Change**: **HB 313** aimed to restrict property limitations on amateur radio antennas, particularly in condominiums.
- **Support**: Proponents highlighted the public safety benefits of amateur radio.
- **Opposition**: Opponents argued it overrode condo association rules.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 16-1 to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate," with one member planning to file a minority report.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Support for Businesses**: Many bills aimed to support local businesses, particularly those in the hospitality and beverage industries, by reducing regulatory burdens and formalizing pandemic-era policies.
- **Public Health Concerns**: Opponents of several bills, including those related to alcohol delivery and convenience store inventory, emphasized potential public health risks and the importance of responsible alcohol consumption.
- **Enforcement and Liability**: Questions about enforcement mechanisms and liability for businesses were central to discussions on alcohol delivery, cigar bars, and hobby distillation.
- **Retained Bills**: Several bills, including those related to pool safety and renters insurance, were retained for further discussion and potential amendment due to divided committee opinions.

The meeting concluded with a reminder of the next session, and public hearings on the bills were closed. The committee’s discussions highlighted the balance between supporting businesses, addressing public health concerns, and ensuring effective enforcement of regulations.
