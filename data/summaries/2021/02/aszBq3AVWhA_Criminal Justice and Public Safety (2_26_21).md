The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on February 26, 2021, to discuss several key bills addressing various aspects of criminal justice, public safety, and victim protection. The meeting, held remotely due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, included public hearings, executive sessions, and extensive debates on proposed legislation. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **House Bill 525: Seizure of Electronic Devices in Child Sexual Assault Cases**
The committee focused on **House Bill 525**, which aims to allow law enforcement to seize electronic devices in child sexual assault cases if there is probable cause, even without an initial search warrant. However, an amendment proposed requiring a warrant before seizure to address Fourth Amendment concerns. The bill was inspired by a case where a child sexual abuse perpetrator’s computer was not seized, leaving the victim’s family uncertain about whether the abuse was recorded. Law enforcement, including Manchester Police Chief Alan Aldenberg, emphasized that current procedures already require probable cause and a warrant, raising questions about the bill’s necessity. The committee ultimately concluded the hearing with no further public testimony, highlighting the tension between protecting victims and upholding constitutional rights.

### **House Bill 436: Eyewitness Identification Procedures**
**House Bill 436** seeks to standardize eyewitness identification procedures across law enforcement agencies to prevent wrongful convictions. Advocates, including representatives from the Innocence Project and the New England Innocence Project, stressed the importance of uniform practices, citing cases of misidentification leading to wrongful convictions. Law enforcement representatives, such as Nashua Police Deputy Chief James Testaverdi, argued that the bill’s remedies (e.g., jury instructions or evidence suppression) were redundant, as courts already handle improperly obtained evidence. The committee debated the necessity of the bill, with some members advocating for stricter standards and others questioning its redundancy. The bill passed with a 13-7 vote.

### **House Bill 270: Post-Conviction DNA Testing**
**House Bill 270** aims to modernize New Hampshire’s post-conviction DNA testing program, making it easier for individuals who believe they were wrongfully convicted to access testing. The bill lowers the standard of proof from “clear and convincing evidence” to a “preponderance of the evidence” and removes a three-year filing limit. Supporters, including the Innocence Project, highlighted the bill’s potential to exonerate wrongfully convicted individuals and identify actual perpetrators. The bill received unanimous support, with the committee emphasizing its importance for justice, even if it applies to a small number of cases.

### **House Bill 408: Employment Restrictions for Registered Sex Offenders**
**House Bill 408** addresses employment restrictions for registered sex offenders, prohibiting them from jobs involving repeated interaction with minors. The bill was introduced in response to cases where offenders were employed in roles with close contact with children, such as landscaping or fair ride operation. While some representatives expressed concerns about the bill’s potential impact on offenders’ employment in roles with incidental contact with minors, others emphasized the need to protect children from grooming opportunities. The committee debated the bill’s language and clarity, ultimately moving forward with amendments to address these concerns.

### **House Bill 545: Seizure of Electronic Devices in Child Sexual Abuse Cases**
Similar to HB 525, **House Bill 545** focuses on allowing law enforcement to seize electronic devices in child sexual abuse cases. However, significant constitutional concerns were raised, particularly regarding Fourth Amendment protections. While the bill’s intent to protect children was widely supported, its language was deemed flawed. The committee voted 15-6 to retain the bill for further refinement, appointing a subcommittee to address its issues.

### **House Bill 200: Increased Penalties for Invasions of Privacy**
**House Bill 200** increases penalties for invasions of privacy, such as non-consensual recording and distribution of intimate images. The bill classifies first offenses as misdemeanors and subsequent offenses as felonies. The committee amended the bill to clarify penalties, and it passed with a 15-5 vote.

### **House Bill 296: Unsolicited Disclosure of Intimate Images**
**House Bill 296** establishes the crime of unsolicited disclosure of intimate images (cyber flashing). The bill aims to make sending unsolicited explicit images a violation, with multiple offenses classified as misdemeanors. The committee debated issues of consent and enforcement, ultimately passing the bill with broad support.

### **Other Bills and Procedural Matters**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 316**, which requires individuals issued a summons to remain on good behavior until arraignment, and **House Bill 307**, addressing liability for municipal officials and school boards. An amendment to **House Bill 471**, related to police disciplinary hearings, was deferred for further review. The meeting concluded with procedural reminders and plans to revisit certain bills after additional review.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
- **Balancing Rights and Safety**: Many bills, such as those involving the seizure of electronic devices and employment restrictions for sex offenders, highlighted the tension between protecting victims and upholding constitutional rights.
- **Standardizing Procedures**: Bills like HB 436 and HB 270 emphasized the need for standardized practices in eyewitness identification and post-conviction DNA testing to prevent wrongful convictions.
- **Protecting Vulnerable Populations**: Legislation targeting child sexual abuse, cyber flashing, and invasions of privacy reflected a strong focus on protecting children and victims of exploitation.
- **Refinement and Retention**: Several bills, including HB 545 and HB 408, were retained or amended to address constitutional concerns, clarity issues, and potential unintended consequences.

The committee demonstrated a commitment to refining legislation to ensure both justice and public safety, while addressing procedural and constitutional challenges.
