The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 3, 2021, focused on several bills related to child support, family law, and child welfare, with discussions spanning issues such as veterans' disability benefits, shared parenting, child marriage, and gender-affirming care for minors. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

### **Child Support and Shared Parenting**
1. **House Bill 161**:
   - This bill updates child support guidelines, raising the self-support reserve to 120% of the federal poverty line and introducing a 1.5x multiplier for shared parenting cases (where each parent has the child for 30% or more of overnights). Supporters argued it provides clarity and reduces conflict, while opponents raised concerns about the 30% threshold incentivizing disputes over parenting time.

2. **House Bill 228**:
   - Focused on calculating child support in shared parenting cases, this bill proposes an offset method to address income disparities. Supporters emphasized fairness and predictability, while critics worried it might disadvantage lower-income parents and create financial incentives to manipulate parenting time.

3. **House Bill 317**:
   - This bill seeks to exclude veterans' disability compensation from child support calculations, aligning with federal law to protect veterans' benefits. Proponents, including veterans and advocates, argued that reducing these benefits could lead to financial instability for veterans. Opponents, including family law attorneys, contended that veterans' benefits are a financial resource and should be considered in child support.

4. **House Bill 541**:
   - This bill prioritizes child support payments over other court costs in family law cases. While supporters emphasized ensuring financial support for children, opponents raised concerns about potential impacts on due process and access to legal representation, particularly for victims of domestic violence.

### **Child Marriage and Minimum Age of Marriage**
5. **House Bill 60 (HB 60)**:
   - HB 60 aims to raise the minimum marriage age in New Hampshire to 18 without exceptions, effectively ending child marriage. Survivors of child marriage shared harrowing testimonies about abuse, poverty, and long-term trauma, emphasizing the lack of legal protections for minors. Advocates highlighted the disproportionate impact on girls, the link to domestic violence, and the negative health and economic outcomes associated with child marriage. Supporters argued that ending child marriage is a human rights imperative and aligns with efforts to protect children’s futures.

### **Gender-Affirming Care and Child Welfare**
6. **House Bill 68 (HB 68)**:
   - HB 68 seeks to classify certain medical interventions, such as puberty blockers or surgeries for transgender minors, as child abuse. Sponsor Representative Dave Testerman argued these interventions have long-term negative effects, while opponents, including transgender youth and medical professionals, emphasized the life-saving importance of gender-affirming care. Medical experts testified that such care is evidence-based and supported by major medical organizations, and denying it could increase suicide risks among transgender youth.

### **Other Child Welfare Legislation**
7. **House Bill 427 (HB 427)**:
   - This bill, amended and passed unanimously, focuses on care management entities to reduce the number of children sent to the Sununu Youth Services Center by expanding community-based services.

8. **House Bill 254 (HB 254)**:
   - Addressing placement options for youth in the justice system, this bill raised concerns about ensuring adequate services for those with more severe offenses. The committee committed to further review before making a final recommendation.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Balancing Rights and Needs**: The discussions highlighted the need to balance veterans' rights, children’s financial needs, and parental responsibilities in child support cases.
- **Shared Parenting**: Debates centered on how shared parenting should be defined and its impact on child support calculations, with concerns about financial incentives and child welfare.
- **Child Marriage**: Survivors and advocates made a compelling case for ending child marriage, emphasizing its lifelong harms and the need to protect minors from coercion and abuse.
- **Gender-Affirming Care**: Testimonies underscored the importance of evidence-based medical care for transgender youth and the potential harms of criminalizing such interventions.
- **Access to Justice**: Concerns were raised about how certain bills might impact vulnerable populations, including victims of domestic violence and lower-income parents.
- **Legislative Clarity**: Many discussions called for clearer language in bills to avoid confusion and unintended consequences.

The meeting concluded with plans for further review, amendments, and interim studies to address the complex issues raised. The testimonies and debates underscored the importance of prioritizing children’s rights and well-being in family law and child welfare legislation.
