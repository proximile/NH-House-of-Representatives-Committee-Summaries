### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. HB 497: Superintendent Retirement Options**
- **Purpose**: Allows superintendents to choose between contributing to the New Hampshire State Retirement System or a private retirement account (or a combination of both), with the option to transfer up to three years of past contributions to a private account.
- **Arguments**:
  - **Support**: Rep. Pat Long argued that the bill would attract out-of-state superintendents by offering flexible retirement options, addressing the challenge of the 10-year vesting requirement in the state retirement system.
  - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the impact on the state retirement system, IRS compliance issues, and the retroactive application of the bill.
- **NH Retirement System’s Position**: Neutral but highlighted potential legal and tax code challenges.

#### **2. HB 349: Repeal of School Nurse Certification Requirements**
- **Purpose**: Repeals the 2016 law requiring school nurses to hold a bachelor’s degree and three years of pediatric experience.
- **Arguments**:
  - **Support**: Rep. Greg Hill argued that the certification requirements create unnecessary barriers, exacerbating the nursing shortage and forcing schools to hire “health coordinators” instead of nurses.
  - **Opposition**: Rep. Linda Tanner and nursing associations emphasized the critical role of school nurses in managing complex health issues, including chronic conditions and public health crises like COVID-19, and argued that specialized training is essential.
- **Key Debate**: The tension between reducing barriers to hiring and maintaining high standards of care for students.

#### **3. HB 96: Establishment of a School Counselor Coordinator Position**
- **Purpose**: Creates a school counselor coordinator position within the Department of Education to support school counselors, psychologists, and social workers.
- **Arguments**:
  - **Support**: Advocates highlighted the critical role of school counselors in addressing students' academic, social-emotional, and career development needs, especially during the pandemic.
  - **Concerns**: Opponents argued that funds should be directed toward immediate mental health needs rather than creating a new bureaucratic position.

#### **4. HB 278: Charter School Facility Access**
- **Purpose**: Requires local school districts to list unused or underutilized school properties and make them available to charter schools.
- **Arguments**:
  - **Support**: Proponents argued that this would help charter schools secure facilities more easily and repurpose empty buildings for financial efficiency.
  - **Opposition**: Critics, including school administrators and boards, expressed concerns about eroding local control, imposing additional burdens on taxpayers, and vague language in the bill.

#### **5. HB 110: Transparency in Education Funding**
- **Purpose**: Sends adequacy education grants directly to municipalities instead of school districts to increase transparency in funding allocation.
- **Arguments**:
  - **Support**: Rep. Steven Smith argued that this would improve trust between municipalities and school districts by making funding changes more visible to taxpayers.
  - **Opposition**: Opponents raised concerns about potential cash flow issues for school districts and the added bureaucratic layer, especially in multi-town cooperative districts.

### **Primary Focus: HB 20 (Education Freedom Accounts)**

#### **Purpose and Structure of HB 20**
- **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**: The bill proposes a voucher program allowing families to use state funds for private schools, homeschooling, tutoring, therapies, and other educational expenses.
- **Eligibility**: Any New Hampshire resident eligible to enroll in public school can apply, excluding students in correctional facilities.
- **Funding**: Funds are drawn from the state’s adequate education grant and distributed quarterly via a scholarship organization.
- **Accountability**: The scholarship organization oversees the program, conducts annual audits, and reports to the legislature. However, there is no requirement for students in the program to take state assessments.

#### **Arguments in Favor of HB 20**
1. **Parental Choice**: Supporters emphasized the importance of empowering parents to choose the best educational options for their children, particularly for students with special needs or those struggling in public schools.
2. **Equity and Inclusion**: Proponents argued that EFAs would level the playing field by providing access to educational resources for marginalized communities, including low-income families and students of color.
3. **Cost Savings**: Some supporters estimated that EFAs would cost approximately $5,000 per student compared to the $20,000 per student cost in public schools, potentially saving taxpayers money over time.

#### **Arguments Against HB 20**
1. **Financial Burden on Public Schools**: Opponents argued that the bill would divert funds from public schools, exacerbating financial strain, particularly in rural and low-income districts.
2. **Lack of Accountability**: Critics raised concerns about the lack of oversight and potential for misuse of funds, citing examples from Arizona where voucher programs have been plagued by fraud.
3. **Impact on Taxpayers**: The bill would impose additional costs on New Hampshire taxpayers, as it funds private and homeschool students who are not eligible for federal funding.
4. **Equity Concerns**: Opponents argued that voucher programs primarily benefit wealthier families and exacerbate inequalities, leaving disadvantaged students behind.
5. **Constitutionality**: Questions were raised about whether the bill violates Article 83 of the New Hampshire Constitution, which prohibits public funds from going to religious schools.

#### **Testimonies and Examples**
- **Supporters**: Parents and advocates shared personal stories of students struggling in public schools who thrived in private or alternative settings. They emphasized the need for flexibility, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Opponents**: Representatives and advocacy groups, including the NEA, expressed concerns about the bill's financial impact, lack of transparency, and potential to harm public education.

3. **Public Safety and Expertise**: Opponents of HB 349 argued that specialized training and expertise are essential for school nurses to handle the diverse health needs of students effectively.
4. **Parental Choice vs. Public Education**: HB 20 sparked a contentious debate between supporters advocating for parental choice and opponents concerned about the potential erosion of public education and equity.
