The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on **February 3, 2021**, focused on a series of bills related to **resources, recreation, and development**, with discussions spanning environmental protection, water resource management, recreational boating, and rail trail safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

### **1. Fishing, Habitable Islands, and Timber Trespass**
- **Fishing and Nesting Seasons**: A biologist highlighted the importance of accurate information for setting fishing seasons, particularly around early spring nesting times.
- **Habitable Islands**: Representative Kelly inquired about the number of residents on Lake Winnipesaukee’s habitable islands. While exact figures were unavailable, estimates suggest a few thousand residents spread across islands with varying populations.
- **House Bill 193 (Timber Trespass)**: Representative Smith proposed an amendment to clarify language regarding negligent timber cutting or destruction, which was passed.

### **2. Seasonal Platforms and PFAS Standards**
- **House Bill 99 (Seasonal Platforms)**: The bill, amended to address concerns about obstructed views, clarified that platforms must be placed in front of the property owner’s land and cannot be objected to by neighbors. It passed with amendments.
- **House Bill 271 (PFAS Standards)**: Representative Rung introduced the bill to update New Hampshire statutes to align with national and international terminology for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The bill replaced outdated terms and removed references to obsolete analytical methods, receiving broad support from environmental groups and industry representatives.

### **3. Wake Surfing and Wake Boats**
- **House Bill 115 (Wake Surfing)**: Representative Smith presented the bill, which defines wake surfing and applies the same safety standards as water skiing and wakeboarding. It specifies that wake surfing can only be done behind wake boats or ballast boats designed to minimize propeller-related injuries. The bill was supported by the Marine Trades Association and a commission studying wake boats.
- **House Bill 229 (Wake Boats)**: The bill aimed to define wake boats as vessels equipped with ballast systems to enhance wakes, addressing safety, environmental, and property concerns. Proponents, including the Lake Winnipesaukee Association and New Hampshire Lakes, emphasized the environmental and safety impacts of wake boats, such as shoreline erosion, sediment disruption, and the spread of aquatic invasive species. Opponents, including the Marine Trades Association and individual boaters, argued that defining wake boats could lead to restrictions, negatively impacting the state’s $1.6 billion recreational boating economy. The committee voted to pass the bill with a 19-1 majority, moving it forward for further consideration.

### **4. Water Resource Management**
- **House Bill 235 (Community Small Groundwater Withdrawals)**: The bill addressed small groundwater withdrawals for community water systems, requiring mitigation plans and community notification for new wells. It was inspired by issues in Hampstead, NH, where over-pumping caused private wells to go dry. The bill received support from hydrogeologists and the Department of Environmental Services (DES), with the committee voting to recommend it.
- **House Bill 269 (Abandoned Underwater Cables)**: Representative Silber introduced the bill to address abandoned underwater cables in lakes like Winnipesaukee, which pose environmental hazards and interfere with boating. While proponents emphasized the need for removal, opponents, including the New England Cable and Telecommunications Association, raised concerns about the bill’s broad language and potential unintended consequences. Enforcement challenges were also discussed.

### **5. Rail Trail Best Management Practices**
- **House Bill 311 (Rail Trail BMPs)**: The bill proposed establishing a committee to study and develop best management practices for rail trails, addressing contamination from abandoned railroad beds (e.g., oil, creosote) and ensuring safe recreational use. The committee would consult with state agencies and experts, producing recommendations by November 2022. The bill received unanimous support (20-0) from the committee.

### **6. Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Environmental Protection**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance environmental concerns (e.g., water quality, shoreline erosion, invasive species) with recreational and economic interests.
- **Safety and Regulation**: Bills addressing wake surfing, wake boats, and rail trails emphasized the importance of safety standards and responsible management practices.
- **Economic Impact**: Opponents of wake boat regulation and small groundwater withdrawal restrictions raised concerns about the potential economic impact on tourism, boating, and housing costs.
- **Education and Enforcement**: Many stakeholders, including the Marine Trades Association and State Police Marine Patrol, emphasized the importance of education and enforcement of existing laws over new regulations.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of balancing environmental protection, property rights, and economic interests in legislative efforts. Key bills related to wake boats, groundwater withdrawals, and rail trail safety advanced, with further discussions and amendments expected in future sessions. The committee’s decisions reflected a commitment to addressing pressing issues while considering the diverse perspectives of stakeholders.
