The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee met on February 22, 2021, in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on several key bills addressing energy policy, renewable energy, community power aggregation, and Public Utilities Commission (PUC) procedures. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Overview of Key Bills Discussed**

1. **House Bill 549 (HB 549): Energy Efficiency and System Benefits Charge (SBC)**  
   - **Proposal**: HB 549 seeks to reform energy efficiency funding by creating a revolving trust fund, eventually eliminating the SBC and Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) charges to save ratepayers money.  
   - **Support**: Proponents, including Representative Michael Vose, argued for greater transparency and accountability in energy efficiency programs, claiming the current system is overly complex and misunderstood.  
   - **Concerns**: Critics, including New Hampshire Legal Assistance and local energy committees, warned that the bill could harm low-income energy efficiency programs, reduce renewable energy progress, and politicize the approval process currently handled by the PUC.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously voted to retain HB 549 for further discussion and potential amendments.

2. **House Bill 213 (HB 213): Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and Biomass**  
   - **Proposal**: HB 213 proposes changes to the RPS, particularly affecting biomass and renewable energy credits (RECs), including eliminating Class III biomass RECs.  
   - **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including forestry industry representatives and renewable energy advocates, overwhelmingly opposed the bill, arguing it would harm the biomass industry, reduce economic activity, and undermine forest management. Testimony highlighted the economic benefits of biomass ($250 million annually and 950 jobs) and its environmental advantages, such as wildfire prevention and carbon neutrality.  
   - **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to grandfather in existing projects using thermal RECs until January 1, 2022, but concerns remained about the bill’s broader negative impacts.  
   - **Concerns**: Critics emphasized that reducing RPS thresholds would disincentivize renewable energy investments, harm low-income ratepayers, and undermine New Hampshire’s renewable energy and climate goals.  
   - **Outcome**: Testimony overwhelmingly opposed HB 213, with calls to retain or kill the bill to protect the state’s renewable energy progress and forest industry.

3. **House Bill 315 (HB 315): Community Power Aggregation**  
   - **Proposal**: HB 315 seeks to limit local control over community power programs, which allow municipalities to aggregate energy needs and negotiate better rates.  
   - **Opposition**: Municipal officials, energy experts, and organizations like Clean Energy New Hampshire and the Conservation Law Foundation strongly opposed the bill, arguing it would stifle innovation, create unnecessary restrictions, and re-establish utility monopolies. Critics emphasized that HB 315 undermines RSA 53-e, a 2019 law enabling community power aggregation, which has bipartisan support and promotes renewable energy and local control.  
   - **Key Concerns**: The bill would restrict municipalities from implementing effective community power plans, limit access to renewable energy, and delay progress on grid modernization and energy efficiency.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee leaned toward indefinitely postponing (ITL) HB 315, with calls to preserve RSA 53-e and allow communities to innovate in energy markets.

4. **House Bill 371 (HB 371): PUC Adjudicative Procedures**  
   - **Proposal**: HB 371 aims to codify adjudicative procedures for PUC rate-setting, addressing concerns about transparency and due process.  
   - **Support**: The Office of the Consumer Advocate supported the bill, arguing the PUC sometimes acts as a quasi-legislative body, bypassing proper procedures.  
   - **Opposition**: The PUC opposed the bill, claiming it would hinder their ability to efficiently handle minor tariff changes and other routine matters.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted to ITL HB 371, with suggestions for the PUC and Consumer Advocate to resolve their differences.

5. **Other Bills**  
   - **HB 294**: Voted ITL (21-0) after being retained the previous year without requested changes.  
   - **HB 407**: Voted ITL (11-10) over concerns about potential fraud and lack of consumer protection in allowing municipalities to utilize in-state hydro power.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

1. **Energy Efficiency and Transparency**: HB 549 highlighted a divide between those seeking greater transparency in energy efficiency funding and those concerned about the potential harm to low-income programs and renewable energy goals. The bill was retained for further work.  

2. **Renewable Energy Goals**: HB 213 faced widespread opposition for its potential to harm the biomass industry, reduce renewable energy investments, and undermine New Hampshire’s climate and economic goals. Stakeholders urged the committee to protect renewable energy incentives and forest management practices.  

3. **Community Power and Local Control**: HB 315 was strongly criticized for limiting local control and innovation in community power programs. Advocates emphasized the importance of RSA 53-e in empowering municipalities to aggregate energy needs, reduce costs, and promote renewable energy. The committee leaned toward ITL-ing the bill.  

4. **PUC Procedures and Transparency**: HB 371 sparked debate over the PUC’s role and transparency in rate-setting. While the Consumer Advocate sought to codify adjudicative procedures, the PUC argued the bill would hinder their efficiency. The committee voted to ITL the bill, encouraging further dialogue between stakeholders.  

5. **Economic and Environmental Benefits**: Throughout the meeting, stakeholders highlighted the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and community power, including job creation, reduced energy costs, and progress toward climate goals.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on balancing transparency, local control, and innovation in energy policy while addressing concerns about economic and environmental impacts. Key bills like HB 549 and HB 213 were retained for further work, while HB 315 and HB 371 faced significant opposition and were likely to be ITL-ed. The discussions reflected a commitment to advancing renewable energy, protecting low-income ratepayers, and empowering municipalities to innovate in energy markets.
