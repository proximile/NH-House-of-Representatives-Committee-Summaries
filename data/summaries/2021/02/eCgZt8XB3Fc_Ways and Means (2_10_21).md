**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (February 10, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 10, 2021, to discuss and vote on several bills related to taxation, state revenue, and economic recovery. Due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the meeting was conducted remotely via Zoom, with members and staff participating electronically and the public accessing the session online. The discussions focused on balancing tax relief with the need to maintain state revenue and fund critical services, with significant debate over the economic and fiscal impacts of proposed tax cuts.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 210 and House Bill 568 (Tax Exemptions and Credits)**:
   - **HB 210**: This bill proposed increasing exemptions under the interest and dividend tax while decreasing research and development (R&D) tax credits against business taxes. Members debated whether to decouple the R&D tax credit reduction from the interest and dividend tax exemptions, with many opposing the reduction of R&D credits. Concerns were raised about the budgetary impact of increasing exemptions, prompting requests for detailed cost analysis from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA).
   - **HB 568**: This bill sought to increase exemptions to the interest and dividends tax and repeal the tax entirely by 2025. Members expressed concerns about the significant revenue loss (estimated at $110 million annually) and its potential impact on state services, such as education, mental health, and substance abuse programs. Skepticism was voiced about repealing the tax without identifying alternative revenue sources.
   - **General Discussion**: Members noted that the exemption thresholds for the interest and dividends tax have not been adjusted for inflation since 1981, making the tax burdensome for lower-income individuals, particularly retirees. There was a consensus that R&D tax credits should not be tied to personal tax exemptions, as they serve different purposes. Broader concerns included the societal costs of cutting state revenue, such as downshifting costs to local property taxpayers and reduced funding for essential services.

2. **House Bill 10 (Business Tax Rates)**:
   - **HB 10**: This bill proposed reducing business tax rates over two years, sparking extensive debate. Supporters argued that tax cuts would aid small businesses in recovering from the pandemic, stimulate economic growth, and enhance New Hampshire’s competitiveness. Opponents countered that the cuts would lead to significant revenue losses, exacerbate the burden on property taxpayers, and lacked evidence of economic benefits. Concerns were also raised about the unpredictability of the pandemic’s economic impact and the potential for "downshifting" costs to local governments.

3. **House Bill 15 (Taxing Online Facilitators)**:
   - **HB 15**: This bill aimed to tax online facilitators for motor vehicle rentals and room occupancies. The discussion centered on fairness, with some arguing that brick-and-mortar businesses and online platforms should be taxed equally. Concerns were raised about unintended consequences, such as taxing travel agents, and the need for clarification from the DRA.

4. **House Bill 306 (Revenue Estimates During Emergencies)**:
   - **HB 306**: This bill proposed requiring more frequent revenue estimates during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Some members suggested broadening the bill to include other economic shifts beyond emergencies.

5. **House Bill 330 (Sports Wagering)**:
   - **HB 330**: The committee discussed allowing Tier 2 sports wagers without lifting the cap on the number of brick-and-mortar locations. The New Hampshire Lottery Commission indicated that expanding to 10 locations was unlikely in the near future, alleviating concerns about overreach.

### **Other Bills Discussed and Voted On**
   - **HB 134**: Repealing certain inactive dedicated funds. The committee unanimously recommended the bill "Ought to Pass" (OTP).
   - **HB 181**: Relative to the local option for operation sports retail locations. The committee unanimously recommended the bill "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL).
   - **HB 324**: Relative to the administration of certain state taxes by the DRA. The committee unanimously recommended OTP.
   - **HB 354**: Relative to the local option for sports betting retail locations. The committee unanimously recommended OTP.
   - **HB 528**: Relative to electronic filing of state tax returns. The committee unanimously recommended ITL.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
   - **Tax Policy and Economic Recovery**: The meeting highlighted the tension between providing tax relief to stimulate economic recovery and maintaining stable state revenues to fund essential services. Members referenced the failed Kansas experiment as a cautionary tale against aggressive tax cuts, emphasizing the need for fiscal stability during the pandemic.
   - **Partisan Divides**: There was a clear partisan divide on the impact of tax cuts, with some members arguing that tax cuts benefit the wealthy and exacerbate inequality, while others contended they promote economic growth and competitiveness.
   - **Downshifting and Local Impacts**: Concerns about "downshifting" costs to local property taxpayers and the potential reduction in funding for critical services like education, mental health, and substance abuse programs were recurring themes.
   - **Next Steps**: The committee planned to continue discussions, with requests for additional data from the DRA to model the financial impact of various proposals. Decisions were to be finalized by March 11 to meet legislative deadlines.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of tax policy in balancing relief for individuals and businesses with the need to sustain state revenues and fund essential services, particularly during a period of economic uncertainty.
