**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Resources, Recreation, and Development (February 10, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on February 10, 2021, to discuss several bills addressing environmental protection, public safety, and recreational use of natural resources. The meeting included detailed discussions on septic systems, wetlands, diver safety, motorized vehicle use on frozen ponds, and off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs). Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and discussions:

---

### **House Bill 426: Septic System Evaluations and Waterfront Property Assessments**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to improve water quality by requiring evaluations of older septic systems (those without permits or over 20 years old) during property transfers.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Septic system evaluations must be conducted when properties are sold, with reports sent to buyers, the Department of Environmental Services (DES), and local health officials.
  - Aligns the 250-foot waterfront property buffer with the Shoreland Water Quality Protection Act.
- **Support**: Proponents, including environmental organizations, emphasized the need to protect water quality, reduce nitrogen pollution in Great Bay, and provide buyers with critical information about septic systems.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, argued the bill adds unnecessary costs and burdens to property transactions, as most buyers already conduct voluntary inspections.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the qualifications of evaluators and the fiscal impact on DES and municipalities for handling additional data.
- **Outcome**: The bill was seen as a starting point but requires further refinement to balance environmental protection with practical implementation.

### **House Bill 158: Prime Wetlands Designation**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to revise the definition of prime wetlands to include narrow, connecting wetland areas (less than 50 feet wide) that contribute significantly to wetland ecosystems.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Allows municipalities to voluntarily designate prime wetlands, providing local control over sensitive areas.
  - Includes exemptions for the Department of Transportation (DOT) to facilitate maintenance within existing rights-of-way.
- **Support**: Environmental advocates highlighted the ecological benefits of wetlands, including flood control, water quality maintenance, and wildlife habitat. The voluntary nature of the designation process was emphasized.
- **Opposition**: Stakeholders like the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association and the Home Builders Association argued the bill would create regulatory hurdles for forestry and development, imposing economic burdens on landowners.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the balance between environmental protection and economic development, with concerns raised about the methodology for assessing wetland functions.
- **Outcome**: The bill remains under review, with potential amendments to address stakeholder concerns.

### **House Bill 447: Diver Safety and GPS Devices**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires dive shops to offer GPS devices for rent with scuba equipment to enhance diver safety.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - GPS devices (e.g., Nautilus Lifeline) would be available for rent but not mandated for use.
  - Inspired by a constituent's tragic diving accident, the bill aims to improve diver location and rescue efforts.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill provides a low-cost safety option for divers, particularly those without their own equipment.
- **Opposition**: Dive shop owners and experts expressed concerns about the effectiveness of GPS technology, the financial burden on businesses, and the practicality of surface marker buoys (SMBs) as alternatives.
- **Outcome**: The bill faced skepticism but remains under consideration.

### **House Bill 534: Regulation of Motorized Vehicles on Frozen Ponds**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows municipalities to regulate noise-creating activities on frozen public waters of 100 acres or less, addressing conflicts between recreational uses like ice fishing, snowmobiling, and motorbike racing.
- **Support**: Residents near small ponds, such as Terry Pond in Bow, NH, testified in favor, citing noise disturbances and disruptions to traditional winter activities.
- **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including the NH Snowmobile Association and Fish and Game, argued the bill would create inconsistent local regulations, burden law enforcement, and harm winter tourism.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the appropriateness of municipal regulation versus state control, with concerns raised about landowner rights and enforcement challenges.
- **Outcome**: The bill remains contentious, with no final decision reached during the session.

### **House Bill 571: Repeal of OHRV Ban on Hoyt Road Marsh**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to repeal a ban on the use of OHRVs on Hoyt Road Marsh, a wildlife management area in Concord and Loudon.
- **Support**: OHRV enthusiasts argued the ban was improperly introduced without public input and restricts a long-standing recreational tradition.
- **Opposition**: Residents and environmental advocates highlighted the marsh's purpose as a wildlife habitat, emphasizing the negative impacts of noise and activity on wildlife and local communities.
- **Discussion**: The debate centered on balancing recreational use with wildlife conservation, with concerns raised about enforcement and local control.
- **Outcome**: The committee will review testimony and correspondence before making a decision.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Environmental Protection vs. Economic Development**: Bills like HB 158 and HB 426 highlighted the tension between safeguarding natural resources and supporting economic activities like forestry, development, and tourism.
2. **Public Safety**: HB 447 and HB 534 focused on enhancing safety for divers and regulating recreational activities on frozen ponds, though both faced opposition over practicality and enforcement.
3. **Local vs. State Control**: Discussions on HB 534 and HB 571 underscored the challenges of balancing local community needs with statewide regulatory frameworks.
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: The hearings emphasized the importance of involving diverse stakeholders, including residents, industry representatives, and state agencies, in shaping effective legislation.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected the complexity of addressing environmental, recreational, and public safety issues in New Hampshire. While there was broad agreement on the need to protect natural resources and enhance safety, stakeholders differed on the best approaches and potential trade-offs. The committee will continue to deliberate on these bills, considering amendments and stakeholder feedback to achieve balanced and practical solutions.
