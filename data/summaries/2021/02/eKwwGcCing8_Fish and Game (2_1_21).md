### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Fish and Game Committee Meeting (2/1/21)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fish and Game Committee meeting on February 1, 2021, focused on a series of bills addressing hunting regulations, wildlife cruelty, trout management, and the composition of the Fish and Game Commission. The discussions highlighted a balance between modernizing regulations, ensuring public safety, and preserving traditional hunting practices while addressing concerns from stakeholders, landowners, and municipalities.

#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Hunting Regulations and Firearms**
   - **House Bill 192**: Proposed increasing the allowable number of rounds in a handgun for hunting from five to six, primarily to accommodate revolvers. Debate centered on whether this change should be made via legislation or administrative rules, with concerns about enforcement consistency across municipalities.
   - **House Bill 342**: Sought to allow lever-action carbines in towns where only handguns and shotguns are permitted for hunting. Proponents argued these firearms are safer and more accurate, while opponents raised concerns about municipal pushback and the need for public education.
   - **Safety and Consistency**: Colonel Kevin Jordan of the Fish and Game Department emphasized the importance of clear, consistent laws to avoid confusion and unintended criminalization of hunters. He noted that modern firearms and ammunition have evolved significantly since existing laws were enacted.

2. **Game Cameras**
   - **House Bill 490**: Addressed the use of live-action game cameras, which send real-time images to hunters, particularly benefiting disabled hunters. Concerns were raised about fair chase principles, landowner privacy, and the lack of a requirement for written landowner permission. The committee suggested retaining the bill for further refinement.

3. **Wildlife Cruelty**
   - **House Bill 529**: Aimed to establish penalties for cruelty to wildlife, aligning with domestic animal cruelty laws. The bill includes protections for lawful hunting, fishing, and trapping activities. Supporters highlighted New Hampshire’s lack of a wildlife cruelty statute, while opponents expressed concerns about unintended impacts on farmers and drivers. Colonel Jordan assured the committee that accidental harm during normal activities would not meet the legal threshold for negligence.

4. **Trout Management**
   - **House Bill 241**: Sought to clarify the definition of “wild brook trout” to ensure proper management of trout streams. Stakeholders raised concerns about unintended impacts on stocking programs, landowner rights, and water body regulations. The committee considered retaining the bill for further review and addressing the issue through administrative rule changes.

5. **Fish and Game Commission Composition**
   - **House Bill 118**: Proposed modernizing the composition of the Fish and Game Commission to include broader representation, such as non-consumptive outdoor enthusiasts and scientists. Supporters argued the current commission does not reflect the broader population, while opponents emphasized its success in managing wildlife and the importance of firsthand hunting, fishing, and trapping experience. Proposed amendments included reducing the required years of hunting or fishing experience and adding ecology as a qualifying expertise.

#### **Key Themes and Concerns**
- **Modernization vs. Tradition**: The committee grappled with balancing technological advancements in hunting (e.g., game cameras) with traditional hunting ethics and fair chase principles.
- **Municipal and Landowner Concerns**: Several bills raised concerns about their impact on towns with existing hunting restrictions and private landowners, particularly regarding land access and permission for game cameras.
- **Consistency and Enforcement**: Colonel Jordan and others stressed the need for clear, consistent laws to avoid confusion and ensure effective enforcement.
- **Scientific Input and Representation**: Discussions on the Fish and Game Commission highlighted the importance of including scientific expertise and broader public interests in wildlife management decisions.

#### **Next Steps**
- Several bills, including those related to game cameras and trout management, were retained for further review and potential amendments.
- The committee indicated a willingness to work with stakeholders to refine legislation and address concerns through administrative rule changes where appropriate.

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of updating fish and game regulations to reflect modern practices while respecting tradition, safety, and stakeholder interests. The committee’s approach emphasized collaboration, careful drafting, and a commitment to ensuring that New Hampshire’s wildlife management policies are effective, inclusive, and enforceable.
