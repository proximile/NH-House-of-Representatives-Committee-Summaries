**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (February 5, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on February 5, 2021, to discuss several bills related to criminal justice, public safety, and law enforcement practices. The meeting, conducted partially remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began with the chair emphasizing parliamentary procedures and the importance of maintaining order. The committee addressed a range of issues, including bail reform, use of force by law enforcement, self-defense laws, and the use of less-lethal weapons. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and debates:

---

### **Bail Reform and Judicial Processes**
The committee held a public hearing on **House Bill 498 (HB 498)** and **House Bill 469 (HB 469)**, which focus on bail commissioners and related processes. **Judge David King**, the administrative judge of the New Hampshire Circuit Court, testified in opposition to both bills. He raised concerns about the appointment process for bail commissioners, potential conflicts of interest, and the lack of a clear definition of indigency. Judge King also warned that increasing fees for bail commissioners could significantly raise costs for the court system. **Representative Muse**, a co-sponsor of HB 498, suggested amendments to address these issues, including defining indigency and streamlining payment processes. The committee voted to withdraw the motion to pass HB 498 to allow for amendments, planning to revisit the bill in the next session.

### **Use of Deadly Force by Law Enforcement**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill 66 (HB 66)**, which seeks to restrict the use of deadly force by law enforcement to situations where there is an immediate threat to life or serious bodily harm. The bill aligns with the 1985 U.S. Supreme Court decision in *Tennessee v. Garner*, which ruled that deadly force cannot be used solely to prevent a suspect from fleeing unless they pose a significant threat. Proponents argued that the bill would prevent unnecessary use of lethal force, particularly in cases where suspects are fleeing but pose no immediate danger. They emphasized the importance of valuing human life over the act of arrest.

Opponents, including **Chief David Goldstein** of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, argued that removing the authority to use lethal force would endanger officers and limit their ability to protect the public. Goldstein noted that New Hampshire has adhered to the *Tennessee v. Garner* standard since the 1980s and that all deadly force incidents in his career were deemed justified. The committee discussed proposed amendments, including changing "and" to "or" in the statute to allow officers more flexibility in certain scenarios.

### **Restrictions on Less-Lethal Weapons**
**House Bill 564 (HB 564)** was introduced to restrict the use of less-lethal weapons, such as rubber bullets and tear gas, by law enforcement, particularly during protests. **Representative Manuel Espicia** and advocates like **Jordan Thompson** of Black Lives Matter Nashua argued that these weapons can cause severe injuries, permanent disabilities, or even death, particularly when used against peaceful protesters. They cited incidents of harm during racial justice protests and called for preventive measures.

Law enforcement representatives, including **Sergeant Michael Lang** of the Nashua Police Department, opposed the bill, arguing that less-lethal munitions are essential tools for de-escalation and officer safety. They emphasized that these weapons are used sparingly and in accordance with strict guidelines. **Jeannie Herschka** of the ACLU of New Hampshire supported the bill but proposed "guardrails" around the use of these weapons rather than an outright ban. The committee debated the balance between public safety and the potential for harm caused by less-lethal weapons, with discussions on the frequency of use and examples from other states.

### **Self-Defense Laws and "Stand Your Ground"**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 81 (HB 81)** and **House Bill 197 (HB 197)**, which pertain to self-defense laws and the use of deadly force. **HB 81** seeks to clarify the circumstances under which deadly force can be used in self-defense, including defending others in one’s dwelling or property. Supporters argued that the bill protects individuals’ right to self-defense, particularly in protecting family members. Opponents, including psychiatrists and advocacy groups, expressed concerns that the bill could disproportionately impact people of color and increase homicides, citing cases like Trayvon Martin’s death.

**HB 197** aims to expand self-defense rights by allowing individuals to use deadly force in public spaces, including during riots or violent protests. Proponents argued that the bill protects individuals from violent attackers, while opponents warned that it could lead to unnecessary use of lethal force, particularly against peaceful protesters or marginalized communities. Critics highlighted the vagueness of terms like "riot" and "unlawful force," which could lead to misinterpretation and abuse. The committee voted narrowly in favor of HB 81, while HB 197 faced significant opposition, with 971 people opposing it compared to 79 supporters.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Balancing Public Safety and Civil Rights**: The meeting reflected a broader national conversation on policing, use of force, and racial justice. Lawmakers grappled with how to balance public safety, officer protection, and civil liberties.
2. **Racial Justice and Policing**: Several speakers drew attention to racial disparities in policing and advocated for reforms to address systemic biases, particularly in the use of force and self-defense laws.
3. **Legal Clarity and Accountability**: Concerns were raised about the vagueness of certain legal terms and the potential for misuse of laws related to self-defense and less-lethal weapons.
4. **Need for Amendments**: Many bills, including HB 498 and HB 564, were discussed with the understanding that amendments would be necessary to address concerns and ensure fairness.

The committee ultimately voted to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** on **House Bill 145 (HB 145)**, which sought to remove the duty to retreat in self-defense situations, citing concerns about its implications. The meeting highlighted deep divisions over self-defense laws, with strong arguments on both sides regarding their impact on justice, safety, and civil rights.
