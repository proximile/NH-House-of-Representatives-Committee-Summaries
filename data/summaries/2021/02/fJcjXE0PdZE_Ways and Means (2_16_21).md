**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (February 16, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 16, 2021, to discuss a wide range of revenue-related topics, including sports betting, taxes, the hospitality industry, housing market trends, and economic challenges. Due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the meeting was conducted electronically, with public access via Zoom or telephone. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Revenue and Taxation**
1. **Sports Betting Revenue**:  
   Charlie McIntyre, Executive Director of the New Hampshire Lottery, reported that sports betting generated $11 million in revenue for the state in 2020, exceeding initial estimates of $10 million. The state ranked third nationally in per capita sports betting revenue, with major events like the Super Bowl significantly boosting income. Key metrics included "handle" (total wagers), "gross gaming revenue" (profit after payouts), and "hold" (percentage retained by the state and DraftKings).

2. **Communication Services Tax (CST)**:  
   Commissioner Lindsey Stepp addressed questions about applying CST to video conferencing platforms like Zoom. The department is auditing compliance but lacks a precise revenue estimate. The tax applies to two-way communication services, and enforcement is ongoing.

3. **Interest and Dividend Tax (IND)**:  
   Representatives clarified the breakdown of IND tax components for 2018 and 2019, distinguishing between dividends and distributions. Both are taxed at a rate of 5%.

4. **Tobacco and E-Cigarette Taxes**:  
   Revenue from e-cigarette taxes, implemented in January 2020, was reviewed. Discussions included tracking revenue from open and closed e-cigarette systems.

5. **Utility Property Tax**:  
   The committee discussed the application of utility property tax to assets like dams and hydroelectric facilities. The tax is based on appraised value, with revenue allocated to the state’s education trust fund. Approximately 20 towns accept the state’s assessed property values without local assessors.

### **Hospitality Industry Challenges**
Mike Summers, President and CEO of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, highlighted the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry. Key points included:
- Significant revenue losses in casual and fine dining, lodging, and event sectors.
- Corporate travel nearly disappeared, with recovery expected by 2023.
- Increased operating costs and workforce challenges.
- The importance of vaccine distribution for recovery, with pent-up demand for leisure travel anticipated by mid-2021.
- The need for additional federal aid for businesses that started in late 2019 or early 2020 and missed out on PPP loans.

### **Housing Market Trends**
1. **Rental and Home Sales**:  
   Rental costs in New Hampshire increased by 22% over the past five years, driven by low vacancy rates (below 1% in 2019). The housing market rebounded strongly in the second half of 2020, with median home prices reaching a new peak of $340,000, a 17% increase from the previous year.

2. **Inventory Shortage**:  
   The state faces a severe housing shortage, with inventory levels at historic lows (about one month of supply). Low interest rates and increased demand from out-of-state buyers, particularly from Massachusetts, have exacerbated the situation.

3. **Mortgage Trends**:  
   Refinancing dominated mortgage activity in 2020, accounting for 80% of loan applications. Fixed-rate mortgages remain the most popular choice. Mortgage delinquency rates increased due to pandemic-related forbearance programs, which were extended through June 2021.

4. **Affordability and Supply Constraints**:  
   Housing affordability is a significant concern, especially for lower-income individuals. Regulatory barriers and labor shortages constrain new construction, while multi-family housing development remains limited.

5. **Commercial Property Repurposing**:  
   There is interest in converting vacant commercial properties into housing, with some initiatives already underway, such as the Newington planning board’s study of alternative uses for a local mall.

### **Legislative Updates**
1. **Revenue Estimates**:  
   The committee discussed updated revenue estimates based on the governor’s budget proposal, including potential impacts of tax law changes. The governor’s budget director is expected to provide detailed estimates in a later meeting.

2. **House Bill 2 (HB2)**:  
   The trailer bill accompanying the budget is still in draft form and will include language on proposed tax changes and other revenue impacts. The committee requested an index for HB2 to navigate relevant sections.

3. **Delinquency and Forbearance**:  
   The long-term impact of mortgage forbearance programs on the housing market remains uncertain, with potential for increased foreclosures as the economy recovers.

### **Population and Economic Shifts**
- Significant in-migration to New Hampshire, particularly from Massachusetts, is driven by lifestyle factors and proximity to the Boston metro area. Seasonal residents are increasingly converting properties into permanent residences.
- Businesses, particularly healthcare institutions like Dartmouth-Hitchcock, are exploring workforce housing projects to address employee housing needs, though such initiatives are still rare.
- Manufactured housing, which lacks federal mortgage protections, may face higher risks of foreclosure as the economy recovers.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to continue addressing revenue-related issues, including budget reviews and road toll analyses. The committee emphasized the need for clarity on revenue estimates, the challenges of housing affordability, and the importance of legislative support for industries impacted by the pandemic. Future discussions will focus on aligning revenue estimates with proposed tax changes and monitoring economic recovery trends.
