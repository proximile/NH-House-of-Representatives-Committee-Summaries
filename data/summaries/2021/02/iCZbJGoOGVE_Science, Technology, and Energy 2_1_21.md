The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 1, 2021, via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting addressed a wide range of legislative items, focusing on energy policy, climate change, utility regulation, broadband access, and technological advancements. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Legislative Discussions:**

1. **Reconsideration of HB 624**  
   The committee revisited HB 624, which had previously resulted in a tied vote. Representative Michael Harrington, who missed the initial vote due to a family emergency, prompted the reconsideration motion. After significant debate on procedural fairness and concerns about partisanship and precedent, the motion passed, and the bill was ultimately approved with a vote of 11 to 9.

2. **Public Hearings on HB 394 and HB 410**  
   - **HB 394**: This bill proposed establishing a commission to study the impacts of national and regional carbon pricing mechanisms on New Hampshire. Testimony emphasized the urgency of addressing climate change, the economic benefits of carbon pricing, and the need for the state to prepare for inevitable carbon pricing policies. Supporters argued that carbon pricing is an efficient and equitable way to reduce emissions.  
   - **HB 410**: This bill addressed utility companies’ failure to report necessary information for property tax assessments. Testimony highlighted the financial impact on towns and cities due to non-reporting, particularly by federally regulated utilities. The bill aimed to require utilities to report essential information annually to ensure accurate property valuations.

3. **Energy Efficiency and Broadband Access (HB 153, HB 119, HB 351)**  
   - **HB 153**: This bill proposed a study committee to address affordable broadband access, particularly for low-income families. Testimony highlighted the affordability barrier rather than availability, with efforts to provide Wi-Fi hotspots during the pandemic underscoring the need for accessible internet.  
   - **HB 119**: Introduced by Representative John Mann, this bill sought to restore the Public Utilities Commission’s (PUC) authority to set the system benefits charge (SBC) for energy efficiency programs without legislative approval. Supporters, including Consumer Advocate Don Kreese and Clean Energy New Hampshire, emphasized the economic and environmental benefits of energy efficiency programs, such as job creation and reduced energy consumption.  
   - **HB 351**: Introduced by Representative Harrington, this bill aimed to limit the SBC to measures directly reducing electricity consumption, excluding thermal projects like insulation for oil-heated homes. Opponents, including utilities like Eversource and Liberty, argued that the bill would disrupt existing programs and undermine the PUC’s authority.

4. **Nuclear Power Study (HB 543)**  
   Representative Keith Ammon introduced HB 543, which proposed establishing a commission to study nuclear power and Generation 4 nuclear reactor technology in New Hampshire. The bill aimed to explore the potential for safer, more compact reactors contributing to carbon-free energy production. Committee members raised questions about feasibility, federal regulation, and economic impact, with the bill being retained for 2022 to allow for bipartisan improvements.

5. **Energy Efficiency and RPS Amendments (HB 614)**  
   Representative Harrington introduced an amendment to HB 614, exempting municipalities and competitive electricity suppliers from paying Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance costs. The amendment sparked debate, with some members arguing it would undermine energy efficiency funding and others supporting it as a cost-saving measure for taxpayers. The committee recessed the executive session on HB 614 to allow broader dissemination of the amendment and a potential fiscal analysis.

### **Procedural and Time Management Issues**  
The meeting faced challenges with time management, particularly due to the lengthy reconsideration of HB 624, which delayed subsequent public hearings. Members discussed the possibility of additional remote meetings to accommodate the workload and ensure thorough deliberation on bills. Procedural issues also arose with the Zoom format, including distributing amendments and managing executive sessions.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**  
- **Climate Change and Energy Policy**: The committee emphasized the urgency of addressing climate change, with discussions on carbon pricing, nuclear power, and energy efficiency programs.  
- **Broadband Access**: Affordable broadband, particularly for low-income and rural areas, was highlighted as a critical need, especially in the context of the pandemic.  
- **Legislative vs. PUC Authority**: A recurring debate centered on whether the legislature or the PUC should control energy efficiency funding, with arguments for the PUC’s expertise and efficiency in rate-setting.  
- **Economic and Environmental Benefits**: Supporters of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs emphasized their economic and environmental benefits, including job creation, reduced energy consumption, and lower utility costs.  

The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on forward-looking energy and technology policies, balancing economic, environmental, and regulatory considerations to address the needs of New Hampshire residents.
