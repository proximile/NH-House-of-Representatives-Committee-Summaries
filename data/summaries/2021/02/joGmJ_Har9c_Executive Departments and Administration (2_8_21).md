**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Executive Departments and Administration (2/8/21)**

The meeting focused on a wide range of legislative bills, amendments, and procedural matters, with discussions spanning constitutional amendments, election integrity, cybersecurity, youth advocacy, municipal governance, and more. Key highlights from the segments include:

### **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 7 (CACR 7)**
- **Purpose**: CACR 7 proposes establishing a lieutenant governor position in New Hampshire to address issues with the current line of succession, where the State Senate President acts as governor in cases of incapacitation, resignation, or death. This has led to concerns about partisanship and the separation of powers.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - Provides a clear, nonpartisan line of succession.
  - Enhances separation of powers by preventing the Senate President from holding dual legislative and executive roles.
  - Low cost, with a proposed salary of $125 per year and minimal additional expenses.
  - Increases productivity by allowing the lieutenant governor to assist with ceremonial duties and other tasks.
- **Concerns Raised**:
  - Lack of defined duties for the lieutenant governor role.
  - Potential costs for staffing and operations.
  - Lengthy ballot text could confuse voters.
  - Historical precedent: New Hampshire has functioned without a lieutenant governor for over 40 years.
- **Outcome**: The proposal faced significant opposition, with a motion to deem it inexpedient to legislate (ITL).

### **Election Integrity and Secretary of State’s Role**
- A bill aimed at ensuring election integrity by addressing potential biases in ballot design and recount processes was discussed. Concerns were raised about the Secretary of State’s role, referencing past issues in other states. Maintaining New Hampshire’s election integrity and its “first in the nation” primary status was emphasized.

### **Department of Corrections and Vital Records (HB 456)**
- This bill allows the Department of Corrections access to vital records (marriages, divorces, deaths, and births) to aid in collecting fines, fees, and restitution. Privacy concerns were addressed, with assurances that data access would be limited and controlled by a memorandum of understanding.

### **Building and Fire Code Amendments (HB 72)**
- Reintroduced after failing in the Senate, this bill aims to simplify building requirements and make housing construction easier. Amendments were proposed to address recent changes in state building and fire codes.

### **Cybersecurity and IT Standards (HB 137)**
- This bill seeks to exempt IT, telecommunications, and cybersecurity standards from the standard rule-making process due to their technical nature and potential security risks. The Department of Information Technology supported the bill, citing the need for consistent governance and transparency while protecting sensitive data.

### **Youth Advocacy and Legislative Youth Advisory Council (LYAC) (HB 457)**
- Testimonies from current and former LYAC members highlighted concerns about the lack of consultation in drafting the bill. Key issues included the elimination of public forums, the focus on job growth, and the creation of regional subcommittees. Amendments were suggested to include non-students (e.g., those in the workforce or on gap years) and to allow virtual meetings for better accessibility.

### **Drone Regulation (HB 298)**
- This bill proposes adding a permitted drone operator to the Aviation Users Advisory Board to address the growing use of unmanned aircraft systems. The bill was supported as a way to ensure informed policy recommendations in this evolving area.

### **Electronic Records and Signatures (HB 302)**
- This bill clarifies that municipalities can use electronic records and signatures even if specific standards have not been adopted by the state. It was well-received, with no significant opposition.

### **Municipal Retirement Costs (HB 274)**
- This bill proposes that the state contribute 5% to municipal retirement costs, partially reinstating a previous state commitment. While some argued the state should honor this commitment to alleviate property tax burdens, others cited financial constraints during the pandemic. The motion to declare the bill inexpedient failed, allowing it to proceed.

### **Other Bills and Amendments**
- **HB 94**: Passed to synchronize license renewal dates with individuals’ birthdays, streamlining administrative processes.
- **HB 345**: Amended to clarify definitions and ensure public safety in the regulation of wild mushrooms, enabling restaurants and farmers’ markets to legally sell them.
- **HB 452**: Introduced to prohibit the Secretary of State from running for other offices while serving, to avoid conflicts of interest in election administration.

### **Procedural and Technical Issues**
- The meeting experienced technical difficulties, including audio problems and Zoom issues, which delayed proceedings and required adjustments to ensure all participants could be heard.

### **Key Themes**
- **Governance and Transparency**: Discussions emphasized the need for clear succession plans, effective rule management, and transparency in governance while protecting sensitive information.
- **Youth Involvement**: The importance of meaningful youth participation in legislative processes was highlighted, particularly in the context of the Legislative Youth Advisory Council.
- **Public Safety and Efficiency**: Bills addressing building codes, cybersecurity, drone regulation, and wild mushrooms focused on balancing safety, efficiency, and public access.
- **Municipal Support**: Debates over municipal retirement costs and electronic records underscored the state’s role in supporting local governance and reducing administrative burdens.

The meeting concluded with a recess, with discussions set to resume on March 8th to address pending bills, including **HB 591** and **HB 247**.
