**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Meeting (February 17, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Consumer Affairs convened on February 17, 2021, to discuss several key bills addressing consumer protection, industry regulation, and technological challenges. The meeting, conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on the following topics:

### **1. Internet Service Provider Regulations (House Bill 477):**
   - **Purpose:** The bill aims to establish consumer protections for internet service provider (ISP) customers, addressing service outages and advertised download speeds.
   - **Key Discussions:**
     - **Consumer Credits:** The bill proposes requiring ISPs to provide credits for service outages. Industry representatives, including Chris Hodgson of Comcast, argued that many providers already offer credits, making additional regulations unnecessary.
     - **False Advertising:** Concerns were raised about ISPs advertising speeds that customers often do not receive. Brandon Garod of the New Hampshire Department of Justice noted that many complaints stem from consumer-side issues (e.g., outdated equipment) rather than ISP faults.
     - **Enforcement Challenges:** Garod highlighted the resource-intensive nature of investigating and prosecuting cases related to internet speeds and outages, noting that existing consumer protection laws already cover unfair or deceptive practices.
     - **Industry Opposition:** CTIA and the New Hampshire Telephone Association opposed the bill, citing potential conflicts with federal law and arguing that the competitive market incentivizes ISPs to resolve outages quickly.

### **2. Automatic Contract Renewals (House Bill 553):**
   - **Purpose:** The bill seeks to prohibit the automatic renewal of consumer contracts without explicit written notice.
   - **Key Discussions:**
     - **Consumer Protection:** Representative Christian, the bill’s sponsor, emphasized the need to protect consumers from being charged indefinitely without their knowledge.
     - **Industry Concerns:** Kyle Baker of the Internet Coalition opposed the bill, arguing it would create unnecessary burdens for businesses and consumers, particularly small businesses.

### **3. Robocalls and Consumer Protection:**
   - **Purpose:** The committee discussed the prevalence of robocalls and scams, with proposed legislation to update definitions of auto-dialers and spoofing, require telecom companies to provide call-blocking tools, and increase penalties for illegal robocalls.
   - **Key Discussions:**
     - **Technological Solutions:** Testifiers emphasized the need for a technological fix to stop robocalls at the network level, as most originate from outside the U.S.
     - **Consumer Education:** Recommendations included not answering unknown calls, using caller ID, and independently verifying organizations before making donations.
     - **Enforcement Challenges:** Brandon Garod discussed the difficulty of tracing and prosecuting robocall scammers, particularly those located internationally, and the resource constraints of the Consumer Protection Bureau.
     - **Industry Opposition:** Maura Weston of the New England Cable and Telecommunications Association argued that existing federal and state efforts are sufficient and highlighted potential flaws in the proposed legislation.

### **4. Pet Groomer Regulation (House Bill 92):**
   - **Purpose:** The bill proposes establishing a committee to study best practices for pet groomers in New Hampshire, where the industry is currently unlicensed and unregulated.
   - **Key Discussions:**
     - **Tragic Incident:** Joanne Schwab shared her story of losing her golden retriever, Teddy, due to unsafe grooming practices, underscoring the need for accountability and safety standards.
     - **Industry Standards:** The bill aims to address issues such as the use of drying cages, proper sanitation, and monitoring of pets during grooming.
     - **Licensing vs. Certification:** Representatives discussed the necessity of state licensing versus private certification and whether groomers themselves support the proposed committee.

### **5. Right to Repair Appliances (House Bill 449):**
   - **Purpose:** The bill focuses on ensuring consumers and independent repair providers have access to diagnostic tools, documentation, and parts to repair home appliances.
   - **Key Discussions:**
     - **Support for Right to Repair:** Advocates argued that the bill would reduce consumer burden, lower repair costs, and extend the life of appliances, thereby reducing landfill waste.
     - **Safety Concerns:** The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) opposed the bill, citing safety risks from untrained repairs and compromised data security for smart appliances.
     - **Environmental and Economic Benefits:** Proponents highlighted the environmental benefits of reducing waste and the economic benefits of lowering repair costs for consumers.
     - **Enforcement Challenges:** Concerns were raised about the Attorney General’s capacity to handle complaints and the feasibility of requiring manufacturers to provide parts and documentation for older appliances.

### **Overall Themes:**
   - **Consumer Protection:** The meeting underscored the importance of consumer protection in various sectors, from internet services to pet grooming and appliance repairs.
   - **Enforcement Challenges:** Representatives and testifiers repeatedly highlighted the resource constraints and technical difficulties of enforcing new regulations, particularly against out-of-state and international entities.
   - **Industry Impact:** Industry representatives expressed concerns about the potential burdens and unintended consequences of new regulations, emphasizing the need to balance consumer protection with business viability.
   - **Need for Education:** Across all topics, there was a strong emphasis on the importance of consumer education to empower individuals to make informed decisions and protect themselves from scams and unsafe practices.

The committee concluded the meeting with plans to continue discussions on the proposed bills, including potential amendments and further testimony. The overarching goal was to address consumer protection issues while considering the practical challenges of enforcement and the impact on businesses.
