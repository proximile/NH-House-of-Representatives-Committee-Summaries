The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on February 10, 2021, addressed several significant bills, each sparking robust debate and testimony from stakeholders. The meeting, held virtually due to COVID-19, focused on four key pieces of legislation: **House Bill 434 (HB 434)**, **House Bill 596 (HB 596)**, **House Bill 233 (HB 233)**, and **House Bill 359 (HB 359)**. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and testimonies:

---

### **Abortion-Related Bills: HB 434 and HB 596**

Both bills aimed to restrict public funding for abortions, with HB 434 prohibiting the use of public funds for abortions (with exceptions for life-threatening situations) and banning public schools and employees from performing abortions or providing abortion-related medication. HB 596 included similar provisions but also established a foster care and adoption initiative fund.

**Key Arguments:**
- **Support**: Proponents, including pro-life advocates and organizations, argued that the bills align with moral and religious beliefs, prevent taxpayer funding of abortions, and promote adoption as an alternative. They emphasized the sanctity of life and the need to protect taxpayers from funding practices they oppose.
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including healthcare providers, advocacy groups, and individuals, argued that the bills would restrict access to reproductive healthcare, disproportionately affect marginalized communities, and violate medical ethics. They highlighted concerns about gag rules on campus health centers and the redundancy of Medicaid funding restrictions, as New Hampshire already does not use public funds for abortions.

**Themes**:
- Moral and constitutional arguments (conscience rights vs. reproductive rights).
- Impact on marginalized groups, including low-income individuals and students.
- The role of public funds in healthcare and the promotion of adoption as an alternative to abortion.

### **End-of-Life Decisions for Infants: HB 233**

HB 233, the "Born Alive Infant Protection Act," aimed to ensure that any infant born alive, including those surviving abortion attempts, receives appropriate medical care.

**Key Arguments:**
- **Support**: Sponsors and supporters argued that the bill protects the lives of infants and ensures they receive medical care, citing moral and legal obligations. They referenced cases of infants born alive after abortions.
- **Opposition**: Medical professionals and advocacy groups, including the ACLU, opposed the bill, stating it was unnecessary, misleading, and medically inaccurate. They argued it could force painful, futile interventions on non-viable infants and interfere with parental and medical decision-making.

**Themes**:
- Ethical and legal concerns about government intervention in medical decisions.
- Balancing the protection of life with compassionate end-of-life care.
- The potential for increased trauma for families and criminalization of medical professionals.

### **Discrimination Based on Natural Hairstyles: HB 359**

HB 359 sought to prevent discrimination based on natural hairstyles and protective styles, such as dreadlocks, braids, and afros, particularly for African-Americans and other people of color.

**Key Arguments:**
- **Support**: Witnesses shared personal experiences of discrimination, emphasizing the cultural significance of natural hairstyles and their impact on education, employment, and self-esteem. Advocates highlighted the need for New Hampshire to align with national efforts to combat systemic racism.
- **Concerns**: Some legislators questioned the necessity of the bill, given existing anti-discrimination laws, and raised questions about its scope, including whether it would cover religious hairstyles. The ACLU raised concerns about the exclusion of incarcerated individuals from protections.

**Themes**:
- Addressing systemic racism and promoting inclusivity.
- The cultural and historical significance of natural hairstyles.
- Legal and practical implications of expanding anti-discrimination protections.

### **Overall Summary**

The meeting underscored deep divisions on issues of reproductive rights, end-of-life care, and racial discrimination. Key themes included:
- **Moral and Constitutional Debates**: Discussions on abortion funding and infant protection highlighted tensions between moral beliefs, constitutional rights, and individual freedoms.
- **Healthcare Access and Equity**: Opponents of HB 434, HB 596, and HB 233 emphasized the importance of access to healthcare, particularly for marginalized groups, and the need for compassionate, patient-centered care.
- **Systemic Racism and Inclusion**: HB 359 brought attention to the ongoing impact of racial discrimination and the importance of explicit legal protections for natural hairstyles.
- **Government Role in Personal Decisions**: The debates reflected broader questions about the role of government in medical and personal decisions, balancing individual rights with societal values.

The testimonies and discussions revealed the complexity of these issues, with passionate arguments from both sides. The committee's deliberations will likely continue as they consider amendments, legal implications, and the broader societal impact of these bills.
