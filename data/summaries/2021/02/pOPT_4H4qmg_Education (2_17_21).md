**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (February 17, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 17, 2021, to discuss several key education-related bills, with a primary focus on **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)** and **school building aid**. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed complex issues surrounding education funding, accountability, and equity. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

### **1. Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**
The EFA program, central to **HB 20**, was a major topic of debate. The program allows parents to use state funds for alternative educational options, including private schools, homeschooling, and other educational services. Key points included:

- **Enrollment and Eligibility**: Students cannot be enrolled in both their resident public school and the EFA program simultaneously. However, EFA students can take courses at their resident public school for less than 50% of their time, with potential fees charged to the EFA account.
- **Homeschooling and Accountability**: Homeschooled students participating in EFAs must comply with EFA accountability measures, such as progress reports, which are not required for traditional homeschooling.
- **Accountability Measures**: Options for demonstrating student progress include standardized tests, portfolios, or educational records. Scholarship organizations oversee accountability, not the Department of Education.
- **Funding and Expenditures**: EFA funds can cover tuition, college courses, summer programs, and transportation, with a cap on total family allocations to prevent misuse.
- **Public School Participation**: EFA students can take specific courses at public schools, but the school may charge fees.
- **Legal and Regulatory Issues**: Concerns were raised about using public funds for private education, though similar programs in other states have faced minimal legal challenges.
- **Parental Control vs. Government Oversight**: The program emphasizes parental control but includes accountability measures to ensure educational standards are met.
- **Amendments to HB 20**: Amendments introduced a **phase-out grant** for school districts (100% funding in the first year, 50% in the second, 25% in the third), repealed the income limit (375% of the federal poverty level) in 2026, and clarified allowable expenses and accountability provisions.

### **2. School Building Aid (HB 594)**
The committee discussed **HB 594**, which addresses school building aid funding. Key points included:

- **Funding Allocation**: The bill proposes **$50 million annually** for school building aid, with an amendment introducing a **10-year school facilities plan** to prioritize projects.
- **Equity Concerns**: The amendment removes provisions to expand the grant range from 30-60% to 20-80%, raising concerns about funding equity for property-poor districts.
- **Backlog and Long-Term Impact**: The committee debated the **$104 million backlog** of projects and the long-term financial implications of debt repayment over 20 years.
- **Vote Outcome**: The amendment passed **11-9**, and the bill, as amended, passed **15-5**.

### **3. Special Education and IDEA Protections**
The committee addressed the rights of special education students under **IDEA**:

- **IDEA Funds**: While primarily for public schools, private schools and parents can negotiate service plans. However, local school districts are not responsible for implementing IEPs for students who leave public schools.
- **Hybrid Students**: Concerns were raised about the impact of hybrid students (part-time homeschoolers and part-time public school attendees) on school funding.

---

### **4. Fraud Prevention and Audits**
To ensure accountability, the committee discussed measures to prevent fraud in the EFA program:

- **Random Audits**: Random audits would be conducted to monitor fund usage, with debates over the minimum number of audits required.
- **Payment Processes**: Electronic systems like **ClassWallet** would manage direct payments to service providers, with pre-approval processes in place.

---

### **5. Discrimination Concerns**
Representatives raised concerns about potential discrimination in private schools receiving public funds:

- **LGBTQ+ Students**: Some expressed concerns about discrimination against LGBTQ+ students, while others argued that private schools often provide safer environments.
- **Religious Schools**: Questions were raised about whether religious schools could exclude students based on religious beliefs.

---

### **6. Education Funding (HB 608)**
The committee discussed **HB 608**, which addresses education funding disparities:

- **Hold Harmless Provision**: A proposed provision would mitigate funding losses for some districts, estimated to cost **$25 million**.
- **Equity and Sustainability**: Representatives emphasized the need for a sustainable and equitable funding model to support students in need.

---

### **7. Procedural and Policy Concerns**
The meeting highlighted several procedural and policy issues:

- **Lack of Fiscal Impact Analysis**: Concerns were raised about the financial implications of EFAs for the stateâ€™s education trust fund.
- **Oversight and Rulemaking**: The State Board of Education and Department of Education would adopt rules to ensure program oversight.
- **Public Input and Transparency**: Some representatives called for additional public hearings to address significant amendments, while others argued that refinements were based on prior input.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of education policy in New Hampshire, with debates over funding equity, accountability, and the balance between parental control and government oversight. The committee passed **HB 594** with amendments but delayed decisions on **HB 20** and **HB 608** pending further review. The discussions highlighted the need for careful consideration of long-term financial impacts, equitable resource allocation, and safeguards for student rights. The committee planned to reconvene the next morning to continue deliberations and potentially vote on the remaining bills.
