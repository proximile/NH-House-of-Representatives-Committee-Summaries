The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce Committee convened on February 2, 2021, to discuss several key healthcare and insurance-related bills. The meeting focused on issues such as prior authorizations, non-compete clauses for mental health professionals, retroactive insurance denials, PANDAS coverage, and ambulance balance billing. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 62: Continued In-Network Access to Certain Healthcare Providers**
- **Sponsor**: Representative William Marsh introduced the bill to ensure patients retain access to specific healthcare providers even if they leave the insurance network, particularly critical for rare disease patients.
- **Opposition**: Anthem, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare opposed the bill, citing concerns about undermining provider networks, increasing premiums, and operational challenges.
- **Insurance Department Input**: Tyler Brandon from the New Hampshire Insurance Department noted the bill would extend access to providers for the duration of the insurance plan year, potentially increasing claims costs.
- **Key Concerns**: Opponents highlighted issues with balance billing, network adequacy, and the administrative burden of tracking provider directories and member enrollments.

### **House Bill 191: Prior Authorizations and Patient Transfers**
- **Sponsor**: Representative William Marsh also introduced this bill, which aims to reform the prior authorization process for medical services.
- **Provisions**:
  1. Requires 60 days' notice for new prior authorization requirements.
  2. Ensures prior authorizations remain valid for six months.
  3. Limits the use of prior authorizations to delay patient transfers to step-down facilities, particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Support**: The New Hampshire Hospital Association, Dartmouth-Hitchcock, and the New Hampshire Medical Society supported the bill, emphasizing the need to reduce administrative burdens and ensure timely patient care.
- **Opposition**: AHIP and Anthem argued that prior authorizations are essential for patient safety and cost control, warning that the bill could lead to higher premiums.

### **House Bill 165: Non-Compete Clauses for Mental Health Professionals**
- **Sponsor**: Representative Abrami introduced the bill to prohibit non-compete clauses for mental health professionals, citing the ongoing mental health and addiction crisis.
- **Support**: Mental health professionals testified about the negative impact of non-compete clauses on their ability to practice and maintain continuity of care for their clients.
- **Committee Discussion**: Representatives discussed potential amendments, such as allowing buyout options for non-compete clauses, to provide flexibility for professionals while protecting employers' investments.

### **House Bill 472: Retroactive Denials of Insurance Claims**
- **Sponsor**: Constance Van Houten introduced the bill to reduce the time frame for insurance companies to retroactively deny claims from 12 months to 6 months.
- **Support**: Healthcare providers shared personal experiences of financial and administrative burdens due to clawbacks, emphasizing the need for legislative action.
- **Opposition**: AHIP questioned the need for continual rewrites of insurance statutes, suggesting that the issue affects only a small portion of the provider community.

### **PANDAS Coverage**
- **Discussion**: The committee reviewed a bill requiring the insurance commissioner to report on the implementation of PANDAS coverage, mandated in a 2019 law. Challenges include the lack of specific ICD-10 diagnosis codes and varying treatment codes used by insurers.
- **Proposed Solutions**: Extend the reporting deadline to November 2022 to allow more time for data collection and analysis.

### **House Bill 343: Ambulance Service Billing Practices**
- **Issue**: The bill addresses balance billing for ambulance services, particularly in rural areas where services struggle with low reimbursement rates.
- **Support**: The NH Insurance Department supported legislative action, citing frequent consumer complaints about surprise ambulance bills.

- **Proposed Solutions**: Including the Commissioner of Safety in rate-setting decisions and requiring insurers to maintain network adequacy for ambulance services statewide.

### **General Discussion**
