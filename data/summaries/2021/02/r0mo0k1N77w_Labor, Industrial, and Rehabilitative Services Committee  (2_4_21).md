### **House Bill 590: Paid Sick Leave**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 590**, which proposes requiring employers to provide paid sick leave to employees. Key points included:

1. **Provisions of the Bill**: Employees would earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 72 hours per year. The leave could be used for personal illness, medical care, caring for a family member, or issues related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

2. **Support for the Bill**:
   - **Public Health Benefits**: Healthcare professionals emphasized that paid sick leave is critical for public health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it prevents workers from going to work sick and spreading illness.
   - **Economic and Equity Benefits**: Advocates highlighted that low-income workers, part-time employees, women, and caregivers are disproportionately affected by the lack of paid sick leave. The bill aims to address these disparities and create a family-friendly economy.
   - **Business Perspectives**: Some small business owners supported the bill, arguing that paid sick leave reduces employee turnover and improves workplace health. Others expressed concerns about the financial burden on businesses, particularly small ones.

3. **Opposition to the Bill**: Business groups, including the Associated General Contractors of New Hampshire and the Business and Industry Association, argued that the bill imposes a one-size-fits-all mandate that could harm small businesses, especially during the pandemic. They advocated for business autonomy in designing benefits.

4. **Personal Testimonies**: Workers shared personal stories of financial hardship and health risks due to the lack of paid sick leave, underscoring the moral and economic necessity of the bill.

### **House Bill 385: Firefighters’ Workers’ Compensation**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 385**, which seeks to expand workers’ compensation for firefighters suffering from heart, lung diseases, and cancer. Key points included:

1. **Health Risks for Firefighters**: Testimonies highlighted the significant health risks firefighters face due to exposure to toxins, with many developing illnesses years after exposure. Current laws have a 5-year look-back period and an age 65 cap, which many argued are insufficient.

2. **Proposed Changes**: The bill would eliminate the age 65 cap, allowing firefighters to claim benefits regardless of when their illness manifests. Advocates emphasized that 75% of firefighters added to the Fallen Firefighters Memorial in 2019 died from occupational cancer.

3. **Support for the Bill**: Firefighters, unions, and legislators overwhelmingly supported the bill, arguing that firefighters risk their lives for the community and deserve comprehensive protections.

### **House Bill 501: Adjunct Faculty Pay**
The committee discussed **House Bill 501**, which aims to establish a minimum pay rate for adjunct faculty in the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH). Key points included:

1. **Pay Disparities**: Adjunct faculty are paid significantly less than full-time faculty, often earning $836 per credit hour compared to $3,300 for full-time faculty. Many adjuncts lack job security and benefits.

2. **Support for the Bill**: Adjunct faculty and union representatives testified about the financial struggles of adjuncts, including reliance on food stamps and inability to afford rent. They argued that the bill would provide fairness and stability.

3. **Opposition from Institutions**: Representatives from USNH and CCSNH opposed the bill, arguing that wages should be negotiated through collective bargaining. They expressed concerns about the financial impact on institutions and potential cost increases for students.

### **House Bills 107 and 517: Minimum Wage Increase**
The committee also debated **House Bills 107 and 517**, which propose increasing the state’s minimum wage. Key points included:

1. **Current Context**: New Hampshire defaults to the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hour, which many argued is insufficient for workers to meet basic needs.

2. **Support for Raising the Minimum Wage**:
   - **Moral and Economic Arguments**: Advocates emphasized that a living wage is a moral imperative and would reduce reliance on public assistance, stimulate the local economy, and provide dignity to workers.
   - **Bipartisan Support**: Speakers noted that raising the minimum wage has broad support among New Hampshire voters and has been successful in other states.

3. **Opposition to Raising the Minimum Wage**: Business groups argued that higher wages would harm small businesses, lead to job losses, and increase consumer prices. They suggested that wage increases should be addressed at the federal level.

4. **Legislative Proposals**:
   - **HB 107**: Proposes raising the minimum wage to $22.50/hour.
   - **HB 517**: Proposes a phased increase to $15/hour, with provisions for tipped workers and youth wages.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted deep divides between advocates for worker protections and business interests. Supporters of the bills emphasized the moral, public health, and economic necessity of paid sick leave, fair wages, and expanded workers’ compensation, particularly for vulnerable populations. Opponents argued for business autonomy and warned of potential economic harm. The committee’s decisions will hinge on balancing these competing interests, with further discussions and amendments expected. The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue addressing these critical issues to ensure dignity and economic stability for all workers in New Hampshire.
