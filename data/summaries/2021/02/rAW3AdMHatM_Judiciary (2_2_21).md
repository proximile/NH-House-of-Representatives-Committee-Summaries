The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on February 2, 2021, outlines the procedural details of the session conducted under the state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The chair of the Judiciary Committee confirmed that the meeting was authorized to be held electronically in compliance with the governor's emergency orders. The meeting was a committee orientation session, and there was no physical location for public observation. However, the public was provided access to listen and, if necessary, participate in the meeting via the Zoom platform or by telephone. The necessary access information was made available through the House calendar and the electronic calendar on the General Court website. This arrangement ensured that all committee members and select legislative staff could communicate contemporaneously during the meeting.
