**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (February 12, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on February 12, 2021, to discuss several transportation-related bills. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting was held virtually via Zoom, with public access provided through the platform or by telephone. The session focused on a range of issues, including driver education, child passenger safety, bridge weight limits, personal rapid transit systems, driver's license citizenship markings, license plate covers, reciprocal driver education, certificates of title and driver's licenses for foreign service members, storage of rail cars containing hazardous materials, and tandem axle weight for forest products. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions:

### **Driver Education and Child Passenger Safety**

1. **House Bill 300: Driver Education**
   - **Purpose**: To allow parents to teach their children driver education instead of requiring enrollment in certified programs.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill restores parental rights, reduces financial burdens (driver education costs $600-$750), and addresses access issues, especially in rural areas. They noted that COVID-19 highlighted challenges with mandated programs.
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including the New Hampshire Drivers Education Teachers Association, raised concerns about safety, lack of oversight, and potential negative impacts on small businesses (driver education schools). They emphasized the importance of professional instruction and the need to wait for a national assessment of driver education programs.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Parents already provide 80% of driving practice.
     - The bill could create socioeconomic disparities, as lower-income families may struggle to afford driver education.
     - Some suggested improving access to driver education programs rather than eliminating the requirement.

2. **House Bill 251: Child Passenger Safety**
   - **Purpose**: To require children under age two to be restrained in rear-facing car seats.
   - **Support**: Advocates, including AAA, Concord Hospital, and child safety experts, emphasized that rear-facing seats significantly reduce injuries and fatalities. They cited studies showing a 75% reduction in severe injuries when children are rear-facing.
   - **Opposition**: The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) supported the concept but raised concerns about the wording of the bill. They recommended deferring to manufacturer instructions for height, weight, and age limits to ensure proper use of car seats.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Rear-facing seats protect fragile head, neck, and spinal cord development.
     - Current law lacks specific guidance for infants, and this bill would close that gap.
     - JPMA suggested model language to align with federal safety standards and manufacturer guidelines.

### **Bridge Weight Limits and Personal Rapid Transit Systems**

3. **House Bill 279: Bridge Weight Limits**
   - **Purpose**: To increase axle weight limits for trucks carrying forest products.
   - **Concerns**: The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT) highlighted the need for reanalyzing and potentially posting additional bridges if the bill passed, which could restrict all certified vehicles, not just forest product trucks, from crossing certain bridges. The discussion also touched on the differing standards between states like Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire regarding vehicle safety and road conditions.

4. **House Bill 104: Personal Rapid Transit Systems**
   - **Purpose**: To explore innovative public transportation solutions, such as personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, which are small, lightweight, and efficient.
   - **Key Points**: Representative Stephen Smith emphasized the potential for these systems to serve less populated areas and reduce reliance on traditional mass transit. The bill aimed to retain the issue for further discussion and potential implementation by private investors.

### **Driver's License Citizenship Markings and License Plate Covers**

5. **House Bill 587: Driver's License Citizenship Markings**
   - **Purpose**: To add markings on driver's licenses to indicate citizenship or legal residency status.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued it would streamline voter registration.
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including immigrant rights advocates, criticized it as discriminatory and unnecessary. They pointed out that driver's licenses are primarily for driving and identification purposes, not for verifying citizenship, and that immigration status is already checked during voter registration.

6. **House Bill 496: License Plate Covers**
   - **Purpose**: To address the issue of license plate covers that obscure visibility.
   - **Key Points**: The bill aimed to clarify existing laws by specifying that colored, smoked, or tinted covers are prohibited. Law enforcement supported the bill, stating that it would help enforce existing regulations and improve vehicle identification.

### **Reciprocal Driver Education**

7. **House Bill 175: Reciprocal Driver Education**
   - **Purpose**: To establish reciprocity for driver education programs across state lines.
   - **Key Points**: Representative Lisa Comtois shared a constituent's struggle with transferring driver education credits from North Carolina to New Hampshire, highlighting the bureaucratic hurdles faced. However, the New Hampshire Driver Education Teachers Association and the DMV opposed the bill, arguing that existing processes ensure safety standards are met and that programs vary significantly between states.

### **Certificates of Title and Driver's Licenses for Foreign Service Members**

8. **House Bill 78: Certificates of Title and Driver's Licenses for Foreign Service Members**
   - **Purpose**: To address challenges faced by U.S. Foreign Service members from New Hampshire in maintaining and renewing driver's licenses while deployed overseas.
   - **Testimony**:
     - **Eric Anderson** and **David Mulkey**, Foreign Service officers, explained the difficulties in renewing NH driver's licenses due to residency requirements and the inability to convert out-of-state licenses back to NH licenses after domestic deployments.
     - **DMV Director Elizabeth Bilecki** opposed the bill in its current form, citing logistical issues such as the inability to issue licenses without in-person photos and concerns about documentation for redeployment.
   - **Outcome**: The committee heard testimony from supporters and opponents, with discussions on potential amendments to address concerns.

### **Storage of Rail Cars Containing Hazardous Materials**

9. **House Bill 329: Storage of Rail Cars Containing Hazardous Materials**
   - **Purpose**: To regulate the storage of rail cars containing hazardous materials, requiring placards indicating whether cars are full or empty and limiting storage near occupied dwellings or traveled ways.
   - **Testimony**:
     - **Representative Dennis Thompson**, the bill's sponsor, highlighted safety concerns, particularly in North Stratford and Columbia, where rail cars are stored close to homes.
     - **Opponents**, including representatives from Amerigas Propane, Pan Am Railways, and the NH Department of Transportation, argued that the bill would disrupt the propane supply chain, increase costs, and potentially violate federal regulations.
     - **Supporters** emphasized the need for safety measures, but most testimony opposed the bill, citing its potential to harm New Hampshire's energy security and infrastructure.
   - **Outcome**: The committee closed the public hearing with a majority of opposition to the bill.

### **Tandem Axle Weight for Forest Products**

10. **House Bill 279: Tandem Axle Weight for Forest Products**
    - **Purpose**: To increase the tandem axle weight limit for trucks hauling forest products from 36,000 to 40,000 pounds, aligning with Maine's regulations.
    - **Testimony**:
      - **Representative Howard Pearl**, the bill's sponsor, explained the need for the change to help the forestry industry comply with axle weight restrictions while maintaining safety.
      - **Supporters**, including the NH Timberland Owners Association and NH Motor Transport Association, argued that the current restrictions are impractical for trucks hauling wood chips and logs from forested areas.
      - **Opponents**, including the NH Department of Transportation, expressed concerns about increased wear and tear on roads and bridges, as well as potential demands for similar exemptions from other industries.
    - **Outcome**: The committee heard testimony from both sides, with discussions on the bill's potential impact on infrastructure and safety.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Virtual Meeting**: The meeting was conducted electronically under the governor's emergency order, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone.
- **Legislative Focus**: The committee addressed issues related to transportation safety, infrastructure, and industry needs, balancing concerns from stakeholders and state agencies.
- **Federal vs. State Regulations**: Several discussions highlighted the tension between federal preemption and state-level regulations, particularly in the context of railroad operations and hazardous materials.
- **Industry Concerns**: Testimony from industry representatives emphasized the economic and logistical challenges of proposed regulations, particularly in the propane and forestry sectors.

The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions and consider amendments to the bills. The committee members expressed various viewpoints, with some supporting the bills for their potential benefits and others opposing them due to perceived flaws or unintended consequences.
