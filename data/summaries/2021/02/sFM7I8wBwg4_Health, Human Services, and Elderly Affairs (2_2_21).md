The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee meeting on February 2, 2021, addressed several critical healthcare and public health issues, focusing on telemedicine reimbursement, food safety in childcare, cannabis use, and Medicaid work requirements. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **1. Telemedicine Reimbursement (House Bills 617 and 602)**
The committee extensively discussed telemedicine reimbursement, with two bills at the center of the debate: **House Bill 617** and **House Bill 602**.  
- **House Bill 617**, introduced by Representative Jess Edwards, proposed decoupling telemedicine reimbursement rates from in-person care rates, allowing insurers to determine pricing based on clinical efficacy. Edwards emphasized the need for a 180-day transition period post-pandemic to help providers adjust. Concerns were raised about excluding **audio-only visits** from mandated reimbursement, particularly for mental health and substance use disorder treatment. Discussions also highlighted the need for research on the effectiveness of various telemedicine modalities and the financial impact on providers.  
- **House Bill 602** addressed **telehealth reimbursement parity**, with advocates arguing that equal reimbursement supports access to care, especially for rural and vulnerable populations. Opponents questioned whether telehealth should be reimbursed at the same rate as in-person visits, citing potential cost differences. Senator Kahn highlighted the role of the **Commission to Study Telehealth Services** in gathering data to inform future decisions. The committee remained divided on whether to proceed with the bill or wait for more evidence.  

### **2. Food Safety in Childcare (House Bill 617)**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 617**, which mandates food safety training for employees in licensed childcare centers to address food allergies and safety concerns.  
- Representative Jan Schmidt introduced the bill, emphasizing the importance of training staff to prevent allergic reactions and cross-contamination. Public testimony from Heather Gass, a parent of a child with severe food allergies, highlighted gaps in existing childcare rules, such as the lack of hands-on training for recognizing and treating allergic reactions.  
- Discussions focused on balancing regulatory requirements with the practical challenges faced by small, family-run childcare centers. Suggestions included expanding the bill to include broader **food allergy and anaphylaxis training** and standardized care plans for children with allergies. The committee considered amending the bill to avoid overly prescriptive statutory language while addressing critical safety concerns.  

### **3. Cannabis Use During Pregnancy and Adolescence (House Bills 163 and 1633)**
The committee examined two bills addressing the risks of cannabis use during pregnancy and adolescence.  
- **House Bill 163** requires **conspicuous warnings** about the risks of cannabis use during pregnancy, lactation, and adolescence, as well as documentation of counseling by healthcare providers. Representative Marsh cited studies linking cannabis use during pregnancy to preterm birth and developmental issues. The bill was widely supported as a public health measure, though some suggested integrating it into a broader health communication strategy.  
- **House Bill 1633** mandates that **Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs)** provide warnings about cannabis risks for pregnant women and adolescents. The Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board supported the bill but recommended amendments to ensure flexibility as medical knowledge evolves. Concerns were raised about the qualifications of ATC staff to provide counseling, with suggestions to focus on certifying providers instead.  

### **4. Therapeutic Cannabis Program (House Bill 240)**
**House Bill 240** addresses the labeling of cannabis strains in the therapeutic cannabis program.  
- The bill proposes allowing ATCs to use **full botanical names** of cannabis strains on labels and packaging, rather than initials or shorthand. Representative Conley argued that this would reduce confusion for patients, especially the elderly and disabled. Public testimony from Helena Josephson highlighted the challenges patients face in identifying effective strains due to unclear labeling.  
- Michael Holt, the administrator of the Therapeutic Cannabis Program, explained that current rules prohibiting commercial strain names were implemented to protect children. However, he acknowledged significant pushback from patients and dispensaries. The committee considered amending the bill to clarify the use of commercial strain names and delayed voting to allow for further discussion.  

### **5. Granite Advantage Health Care Program (House Bill 185)**
**House Bill 185** seeks to repeal the **work/community engagement requirement** for the Granite Advantage Health Care Program (expanded Medicaid).  
- Representative Joe Shapiro argued that the requirement, part of a 2017 compromise, is no longer viable due to legal challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its adverse effects on Medicaid coverage. He noted that similar programs in other states have faced legal challenges and resulted in significant coverage losses.  
- Testimony from Henry Lipman (DHHS) and Don McKinney (New Hampshire Legal Assistance) supported the bill, emphasizing that Medicaid is a healthcare program, not a work program. The committee decided to consider the pending Supreme Court case on the legality of work requirements before making a decision.  

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Telemedicine**: The committee grappled with balancing **patient access**, **provider sustainability**, and **market-driven solutions** in telemedicine reimbursement.  
- **Childcare Safety**: Discussions emphasized the need to improve **food safety and allergy management** in childcare centers while minimizing regulatory burdens.  
- **Cannabis**: Both cannabis-related bills focused on **patient clarity and safety**, with strong support for educating the public about the risks of cannabis use during pregnancy and adolescence.  
- **Medicaid**: The committee recognized the need to align Medicaid policies with public health objectives, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

The meeting concluded with plans to revisit several bills after further consideration and potential amendments, reflecting the committeeâ€™s commitment to evidence-based and patient-centered policymaking.
