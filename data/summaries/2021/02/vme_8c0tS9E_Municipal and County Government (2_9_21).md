The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on February 9, 2021, to discuss a wide range of bills and issues affecting municipalities and counties. The meeting highlighted key debates on property tax reform, affordable housing, local governance, and legal concerns, reflecting the complexity of balancing state regulations with local control. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Property Tax Reform and Constitutional Amendments**
The committee extensively discussed **CACR 9**, a proposed constitutional amendment introduced by Representative Terry Roy, aiming to cap property tax increases at **2% annually** for the general population and **1% for senior citizens and disabled residents**. Any increase beyond these limits would require voter approval. Roy argued that rising property taxes disproportionately burden fixed-income residents, forcing some to sell their homes. The amendment drew comparisons to Massachusetts’ **Proposition 2½**, though Roy acknowledged differences in revenue streams. Concerns were raised about potential impacts on emergency funding, essential services, and legal risks, particularly regarding collective bargaining agreements. The committee planned further debate in an executive session.

### **Affordable Housing Initiatives**
Several bills addressed New Hampshire’s housing affordability crisis:
- **House Bill 132** aimed to reduce minimum lot size requirements for single-family housing in areas serviced by municipal water and sewer systems. Proponents argued this would lower housing costs and encourage infill development, while opponents raised concerns about overdevelopment and infrastructure strain.
- **House Bill 154** sought to expand the use of tax incentives under **RSA 79e** to promote housing development, particularly affordable housing. The bill would extend tax incentives to 10 years if a third of units were designated for moderate-income residents. Supporters, including the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority, emphasized its potential to attract investment and address housing shortages.
- **Bill 586** focused on workforce housing development, incentivizing affordable housing projects. It passed after extensive debate, with supporters highlighting the urgent need for housing and opponents expressing concerns about its impact on small towns.

### **Local Governance and Zoning**
The committee debated the balance between state regulation and local control:
- **House Bill 67** addressed concerns in SB2 districts, where petition warrant articles could be amended at deliberative sessions, often altering their intent. The bill proposed allowing voters to choose between original and amended versions of articles. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, argued it could create confusion.
- **House Bill 183**, dubbed the “Lemonade Stand Bill,” allowed children to operate soft drink stands without permits. After debate and an amendment, the bill passed.
- **House Bill 332**, addressing planning board responsibilities for developments of regional impact, resulted in a tied vote. The committee decided to send it to the full House without a recommendation.

### **Renewable Energy and Tax Issues**
- **House Bill 64** clarified that renewable energy facilities with Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreements should be excluded from statewide education property tax calculations. This aimed to prevent double taxation and ensure fair funding for municipalities, particularly those with significant tax-exempt properties like wind farms.

### **Legal Concerns and Volunteer Protections**
- **Bill 459** allowed citizens to take legal action against local officials but raised concerns about its punitive nature toward volunteers. An amendment clarified that legal standing must come from within the affected municipality. The bill passed 15-3, with some members opposing due to its potential chilling effect on volunteerism.
- **Bill 445** was retained for further review due to legal concerns, with Representative Cordell Johnson tasked with addressing these issues.

### **Other Key Bills**
- **House Bill 79**, involving collaboration between town health officers and DHHS, passed with a 17-1 vote.
- **House Bill 88**, shifting police commission appointment authority to city councils, passed unanimously.
- **Bill 380**, addressing Grafton County commissioners’ elections, passed 17-0.
- **Bill 404**, addressing boundary disputes and historic markers, was deemed redundant and recommended “inexpedient to legislate.”

### **Themes and Takeaways**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
1. **Affordable Housing**: Multiple bills aimed to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis, with debates centering on balancing affordability, local control, and infrastructure impacts.
2. **Property Tax Reform**: Discussions highlighted the need to protect vulnerable populations from rising taxes while ensuring municipalities can fund essential services.
3. **Local Control vs. State Regulation**: Many bills sparked debates about the extent to which the state should set guidelines versus allowing local autonomy.
4. **Legal and Procedural Concerns**: Several bills raised legal and procedural issues, particularly regarding volunteer protections and the potential for unintended consequences.

Overall, the meeting reflected a mix of bipartisan cooperation and differing opinions on specific legislative measures, with a focus on addressing pressing issues like housing affordability, property taxes, and local governance.
