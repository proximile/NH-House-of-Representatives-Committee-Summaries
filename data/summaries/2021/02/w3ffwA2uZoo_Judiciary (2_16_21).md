The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on February 16, 2021, addressed a wide range of bills and issues, including medical monitoring, PFAS contamination, water pollution accountability, abortion-related legislation, judicial retirement age, and public records transparency. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Medical Monitoring and PFAS Contamination**
1. **House Bill 368 (Medical Monitoring)**:
   - The bill proposes allowing claims for medical monitoring in cases of exposure to hazardous or toxic substances, even without immediate injury.
   - **Opposition**: Chris Appel of the American Tort Reform Association argued the bill is overly broad, lacks safeguards, and could lead to excessive liability for businesses, especially during the pandemic.
   - **Support**: Wendy Thomas and Mindy Mesmer, both former representatives, shared personal experiences with PFAS contamination, emphasizing the need for early detection of health risks like cancer and kidney damage.
   - **Discussion**: Questions were raised about the costs of widespread testing versus the benefits of early detection, though specific cost data was not provided.

2. **House Bill 236 (PFAS Statute of Limitations)**:
   - The bill seeks to extend the statute of limitations for PFAS-related injury claims from 3 to 6 years, starting when the harm is discovered.
   - **Support**: Advocates highlighted the long-term health impacts of PFAS, particularly on firefighters, and the need for more time to hold polluters accountable.
   - **Opposition**: The Business and Industry Association argued the current 3-year limit is sufficient and that the extension would burden businesses with increased litigation risks.

### **Water Pollution Accountability**
3. **House Bill 135 (Polluter Accountability)**:
   - The bill requires parties responsible for polluting drinking water to connect affected residents to public water or install whole-house filters within six months and pay for water bills for five years.
   - **Support**: Barbara Healey and Laureen Allen emphasized the health risks of PFAS contamination and the need for timely action.
   - **Concerns**: Mike Wimsatt of the DES and David Creer of the BIA raised issues about the feasibility of the six-month timeline, the financial burden on businesses, and the lack of clarity on filter permanence.

### **Abortion-Related Legislation**
4. **House Bill 622 (Fetal Life Protection)**:
   - The bill aims to protect fetal life at viability (23-24 weeks). It was retained for further study due to its similarity to other bills under consideration.
5. **House Bill 625 (Abortion Procedures)**:
   - Amendments addressed training for abortion procedures and federal funding issues. The bill was retained after contentious discussions and close votes.
6. **House Bill 596 (Public Funding for Abortions)**:
   - The bill sought to establish public funding for abortions and an adoption fund. It was indefinitely postponed due to insufficient information.

### **Judicial Retirement Age and Other Bills**
7. **CACR 6 (Judicial Retirement Age)**:
   - The proposed constitutional amendment to raise the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75 was debated. An amendment to remove the governor and council’s approval process was adopted, but the main motion to pass the bill failed. A motion to indefinitely postpone the bill succeeded.
8. **House Bill 420 (Drug Forfeiture Fund)**:
   - The bill aimed to redirect funds seized in drug cases to a drug treatment fund. It was indefinitely postponed after failing to pass.
9. **House Bill 481 (Right to Know Ombudsman)**:
   - The bill proposed establishing an ombudsman to handle public records disputes, reducing the need for costly litigation. It passed with support for its potential to resolve disputes efficiently.

### **Other Discussions and Technical Issues**
- **House Bill 232 (Property Negotiations)**: Concerns about public transparency led to the bill being held for further consideration.
- **Technical Difficulties**: The meeting faced connectivity issues, occasionally disrupting discussions and voting.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s careful consideration of complex and emotionally charged issues, including public health, environmental accountability, and constitutional rights. Decisions ranged from passing bills like HB 481 to retaining or indefinitely postponing others, such as HB 622 and CACR 6. The committee emphasized the need for full participation and balanced approaches to address the diverse concerns raised during the discussions.
