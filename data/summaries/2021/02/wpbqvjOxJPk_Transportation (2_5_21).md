### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (February 5, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened virtually on February 5, 2021, to discuss a range of bills addressing transportation-related issues. The meeting, held due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on topics such as organ donation, driver’s licenses, traffic safety, and vehicle regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **Driver’s Licenses and Organ Donation**
1. **House Bill 393**: Proposed adding blood type information to driver’s licenses and non-driver ID cards. The Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) raised concerns about space limitations and the need for blood type verification. No public testimony was provided, and the hearing was closed.
   
2. **House Bill 421**: Aimed to strengthen organ donation laws by ensuring a donor’s decision cannot be revoked by others after death. Prime sponsor Representative Peter Torosian shared a personal story about a constituent who died waiting for a lung transplant due to revoked consent. New England Donor Services supported the bill, clarifying that the DMV’s computerized registry, not the license symbol, determines donor status.

3. **House Bill 583**: Proposed allowing New Hampshire residents to designate their organs for donation to fellow residents first when obtaining or renewing a driver’s license. Sponsor Representative Jose Cambrell, a kidney transplant recipient, emphasized the importance of helping local residents. The bill was amended to include all organs, not just kidneys. Supporters argued it respects donor autonomy, while opponents, including New England Donor Services, contended it conflicts with the **National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA)**, which mandates a nationwide allocation system based on medical need.

#### **Traffic Safety and Animal Welfare**
1. **House Bill 174 (Arrow’s Law)**: Sought to require drivers to report collisions with cats, aligning the law with existing requirements for dog-related incidents. Sponsor Representative Abis emphasized fairness and property rights, sharing personal experiences of losing a pet and being involved in a cat collision. The bill, previously passed by the House but tabled in the Senate, was discussed but no immediate action was taken.

2. **House Bill 268**: Proposed allowing cyclists to ride on the left side of the road. The bill faced strong opposition due to safety concerns, with testimony highlighting that 90% of car-bike collisions occur in front of the cyclist. The committee moved to **kill the bill**, citing its potential to increase accident risks.

#### **Vehicle Regulations**
1. **House Bill 224**: Proposed allowing front driver and passenger windows to be tinted at 35% visible light transmission, aligning with neighboring states like Massachusetts and Maine. Supporters highlighted health benefits (UV protection, reduced glare), environmental advantages (lower emissions), and safety (preventing shattered glass). Opponents, including law enforcement, raised concerns about officer safety during traffic stops, as tinted windows hinder visibility. The hearing concluded with no immediate resolution, as the committee planned to review further testimony.

2. **Autonomous Delivery Devices (Pizza Robot Bill)**: Introduced by Representative Smith, this bill aimed to regulate autonomous delivery devices, addressing issues like weight, speed, and operational areas (sidewalks vs. roads). The committee decided to retain the bill for further stakeholder input and regulatory development.

3. **License Plate Legislation**:
   - **House Bill 260 Amendment**: Proposed allowing antique, custom, and street rod vehicles to display only one rear license plate instead of two. The amendment passed 11-8 after debate, with some members concerned about law enforcement and revenue impacts.
   - **Merged Bills (HB 451, 159, 361)**: Streamlined legislation related to license plates and decals for organizations like the Knights of Columbus and Goldstar families. The merged bill passed unanimously (19-0).

#### **Other Legislation**
1. **House Bill 424**: Established a commission to study texting and driving. The bill, previously approved but delayed due to the pandemic, passed unanimously (19-0).

2. **House Bill 222**: Addressed special license plates for municipal elected officials. The bill passed with amendments.

3. **House Bill 423**: Reintroduced after being lost during the COVID-19 situation, the bill also passed with amendments.
