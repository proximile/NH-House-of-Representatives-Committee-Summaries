**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education (February 11, 2021):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 11, 2021, centered on **House Bill 20 (HB 20)**, which proposes the establishment of **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**. The bill aims to provide families with state funds to use for educational expenses outside the traditional public school system, including private schools, homeschooling, and other educational services. The meeting included extensive testimony from various stakeholders, including parents, educators, school administrators, and advocacy groups, with passionate arguments both in support of and opposition to the bill.

### **Key Arguments in Support of HB 20:**
1. **Parental Choice and Educational Fit**: Proponents argue that HB 20 empowers parents to choose the best educational environment for their children, particularly for those with unique needs or learning styles that may not be met in public schools. Parents shared personal stories of struggling with public schools and the positive impact of alternative education options.
2. **Access for Low-Income Families**: Supporters, including **Kate Baker Demers** of the Children’s Scholarship Fund New Hampshire, emphasized that EFAs would help low-income and vulnerable children access educational opportunities they otherwise couldn’t afford, such as private schools, tutoring, and specialized therapies.
3. **Competition and Innovation**: Proponents likened the bill to fostering competition in education, arguing that it would drive innovation and improve outcomes in both public and private schools. They believe public schools would rise to the challenge and improve in response.
4. **Financial Relief**: Parents, including single mothers and low-income families, testified that HB 20 would alleviate the financial burden of private education, tutoring, or transportation costs, making alternative education more accessible.
5. **Transparency and Accountability**: Supporters highlighted the bill’s provisions for transparency, including auditing, public reporting, and a system for rating educational providers. Financial technology companies like **First Class Wallet** also discussed their role in managing funds to prevent fraud and ensure compliance.

### **Key Arguments in Opposition to HB 20:**
1. **Diverting Funds from Public Schools**: Critics, including the **New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA)**, argued that HB 20 diverts public funds away from already underfunded public schools, exacerbating inequities and potentially harming public education systems, particularly in low-income communities.
2. **Lack of Accountability**: Opponents raised concerns about the bill’s lack of oversight and transparency, noting that private schools and homeschooling providers receiving state funds are not held to the same standards as public schools, such as teacher certification, curriculum oversight, or criminal background checks.
3. **Equity and Discrimination**: Critics expressed concerns that HB 20 could lead to discrimination, particularly against students with disabilities, LGBTQ+ students, or those from marginalized communities, as private schools are not required to adhere to the same anti-discrimination policies as public schools. They also warned that parents may not fully understand the rights they forfeit when opting into the EFA program.
4. **Fiscal Impact**: Testimony emphasized the significant financial strain on public schools, particularly in districts like Manchester and Nashua, where per-student spending is already below the state average. Critics argued that the bill could lead to higher property taxes as public schools lose state funding due to declining enrollment.
5. **Duplication of Services**: Opponents noted that many services covered by EFAs, such as transportation and special education, are already provided free by public schools, leading to double spending and inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.
6. **Long-Term Consequences**: Critics warned about the long-term financial impact on public schools, particularly regarding infrastructure investments funded by bonds that span decades. They argued that a three-year funding buffer is insufficient to address these long-term costs.

### **Key Themes and Broader Implications:**
- **Equity and Access**: The debate highlighted deep concerns about equity, with supporters arguing that EFAs provide more options for underserved families and opponents warning that the bill could exacerbate existing disparities.
- **Role of Public Education**: The discussion underscored broader policy debates about the role of government in education, the balance between public and private funding, and the potential long-term impacts on public school systems.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: Both sides acknowledged the importance of accountability but disagreed on whether HB 20’s provisions were sufficient to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and effectively.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Opponents advocated for addressing the state’s education funding formula to ensure equitable resources for all students, particularly those in property-poor towns, and focusing on improving public schools rather than diverting funds to private institutions.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting reflected a deep divide over HB 20, with supporters emphasizing **parental choice, competition, and access** for low-income families, and opponents highlighting **fiscal concerns, accountability issues, and potential harm to vulnerable students**. The discussion underscored the broader debate over the role of public education and the implications of diverting public funds to private alternatives. The bill remains contentious, with strong arguments on both sides regarding educational quality, equity, and fiscal responsibility.
