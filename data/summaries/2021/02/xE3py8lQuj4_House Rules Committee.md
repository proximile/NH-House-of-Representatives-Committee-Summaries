The transcript captures a New Hampshire House of Representatives Rules Committee meeting conducted electronically via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting began with informal banter among members, including comments about Speaker Shurtleff's beard and updates on attendees. The chair, Representative Packard, confirmed the meeting's legality under emergency orders and provided public access details, including Zoom and phone access.

Key agenda items included:
1. **Roll Call Attendance**: Members confirmed their presence and whether anyone was with them, as required by the Right-to-Know Law.
2. **Approval of Minutes**: The committee unanimously approved the minutes from December 16, 2020.
3. **Late Drafting and Introduction of Bills**: The committee unanimously approved the introduction of House Bills 1, 2, and 25.
4. **Representative Splain's Request**: A request for late drafting and introduction of a bill by Representative Splain was noted, but he was not present, so the matter was deferred.
5. **Rules Amendment Clarification**: Representative Weber confirmed the process for submitting rules amendments under emergency Rule 67.

The meeting concluded with a unanimous vote to adjourn, lasting significantly shorter than previous sessions. Members expressed appreciation and planned to reconvene the next day.
