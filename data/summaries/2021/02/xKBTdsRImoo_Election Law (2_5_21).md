**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (2/5/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 5, 2021, to discuss several bills related to election law and campaign finance reform. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on enhancing transparency, closing loopholes, and modernizing campaign finance laws. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed:

---

### **Campaign Finance Reform and Transparency**

1. **HB 105: Closing the LLC Loophole**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill aims to prevent individuals from circumventing campaign contribution limits by donating through multiple Limited Liability Companies (LLCs).  
   - **Key Changes**:  
     - Requires disclosure of LLC donors’ identities.  
     - Apportions LLC contributions based on ownership percentages to ensure individuals do not exceed personal contribution limits.  
   - **Support**: Testimony highlighted instances where individuals used multiple LLCs to donate well beyond the $7,000 limit, particularly in the 2020 gubernatorial race. Supporters, including the League of Women Voters and American Promise, emphasized the need to reduce corruption and concentrate power.  
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about potential loopholes for unions or other entities, but the bill was clarified as specifically targeting LLC contributions.  

2. **HB 465: Restricting Corporate Campaign Contributions**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill seeks to reinstate a ban on corporate donations from general funds, allowing only contributions from segregated funds (e.g., PACs) explicitly designated for political purposes.  
   - **Context**: Aligns with a 1999 NH Supreme Court ruling that struck down a broad ban on corporate donations but suggested a more targeted approach.  
   - **Support**: Advocates, including Open Democracy Action, argued that the bill would prevent undue corporate influence and ensure fairness in elections.  
   - **Concerns**: Discussions included the technical and fiscal implications of implementing the bill, such as programming changes for campaign finance systems.  

3. **HB 263: Modernizing Campaign Finance Practices**  
   - **Purpose**: Streamlines campaign finance laws to reduce confusion and barriers for candidates.  
   - **Key Changes**:  
     - Removes the voluntary expenditure limit and exploratory phase.  
     - Sets donation limits at $3,500 per donor per election, maintaining the $7,000 per cycle for candidates not limiting expenditures.  
     - Simplifies reporting by reducing the number of reporting periods from three (exploratory, primary, general) to two (primary and general).  
     - Requires all candidates to form candidate committees, eliminating individual filings.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued the changes would modernize the system and make it easier for candidates to comply.  
   - **Concerns**: Some raised questions about the complexity of requiring candidates to form committees, though it was clarified as straightforward and free of cost.  

4. **HB 482: Prohibiting Personal Use of Campaign Funds**  
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies the line between personal and political campaign expenditures to prevent misuse of funds.  
   - **Examples**: Cited instances included using campaign funds for flowers, auto repairs, and Chamber of Commerce memberships.  
   - **Support**: Advocates emphasized the need to ensure campaign funds are used for their intended purpose—electing candidates.  

5. **HB 489: Limiting Transfers of State Campaign Funds to Federal Elections**  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes a $10,000 limit on transferring state campaign funds to state parties for federal elections.  
   - **Rationale**: The sponsor argued that such transfers circumvent federal law and create an undue advantage in federal elections.  

6. **HB 468: Lowering Campaign Finance Disclosure Thresholds**  
   - **Purpose**: Reduces the threshold for filing campaign finance disclosures from $5,000 to $2,500 and clarifies electioneering communication.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued it would increase transparency.  
   - **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about potential constitutional issues and overreach, particularly for non-political organizations.

### **Election Integrity and Free Speech**

1. **HB 87: Definition of Electioneering**  
   - **Purpose**: Seeks to remove restrictions on wearing political clothing (e.g., hats, t-shirts) at polling places.  
   - **Support**: Sponsor Representative Pusk argued that such restrictions infringe on First Amendment rights, citing a 2018 Supreme Court case (Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky).  
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including town moderators, argued that allowing political clothing could disrupt the neutrality of polling places and create tension.  

2. **HB 483: Prohibition of Misleading Political Advertisements**  
   - **Purpose**: Introduced to address misleading political advertisements, criticizing the spread of half-truths and untruths in campaign materials.  
   - **Support**: Representative Infantine argued for stricter regulations on political advertising.  
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Association of Broadcasters opposed the bill, citing First Amendment protections and existing FCC oversight.

### **General Observations and Themes**  
- **Transparency and Fairness**: Many bills aimed to increase transparency and fairness in campaign finance, with bipartisan support for closing loopholes like the LLC loophole.  
- **Free Speech vs. Election Integrity**: Debates centered on balancing First Amendment rights with the need to maintain the neutrality and integrity of elections, particularly in polling places.  
- **Practical Concerns**: Discussions highlighted potential administrative burdens on candidates and poll workers, as well as the need to ensure legislation’s effectiveness without unintended consequences.
