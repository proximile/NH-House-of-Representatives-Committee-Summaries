The transcript is from a New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on February 16, 2021, focusing on several bills, primarily **House Bill 521 (HB 521)** related to increasing the lease aid cap for public charter schools. Below is a summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **HB 521: Charter School Lease Aid**
- **Prime Sponsor**: Representative Maureen Mooney introduced the bill, which seeks to increase the lease aid cap for public charter schools from $30,000 to $50,000 annually. 
- **Testimony**: Multiple stakeholders testified in support, including charter school founders, board members, and parents. They emphasized the financial challenges charter schools face, particularly those leasing commercial spaces, and how the increased aid would help reallocate funds to educational resources.
- **Key Points**:
  - Charter schools in NH operate on tight budgets and do not receive local funding.
  - Only 3 out of 29 charter schools own their facilities; the rest lease space.
  - The fiscal note indicates no state, county, or local government impact.
  - Representative Mooney highlighted that the bill would assist schools with higher lease costs, benefiting approximately 4,300 students.
- **Committee Discussion**: Questions were raised about the number of schools exceeding the current $30,000 cap and the potential cost to the state. Amy Clark from the Department of Education clarified that the bill does not increase appropriations but would require prorating funds if the cap is raised, potentially reducing aid to some schools.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **21-0** to retain the bill for further consideration during the budget process.

### **Other Bills Discussed**
1. **HB 297**: A bill requiring $10 million for a specific purpose. The committee voted **12-9** to retain it for budget discussions.
2. **HB 398**: A bill related to wastewater treatment funding. The committee voted **21-0** to retain it, citing the need to align it with budget priorities.
3. **HB 412**: A bill addressing public water systems. The committee voted **21-0** to retain it, noting the need for staffing and cost considerations.
4. **HB 623**: A bill addressing education funding and free/reduced lunch programs. The committee voted **12-9** to retain it, with some members advocating for immediate action to support school districts.

### **Additional Notes**
- **Upcoming Meeting**: The committee planned to meet the next day to hear the governor’s budget presentation.
- **Public Testimony**: Several members of the public, including parents and charter school representatives, testified in support of HB 521, emphasizing the positive impact of charter schools on students and the need for financial support.
- **Committee Dynamics**: Members discussed the challenges of balancing budget constraints with the needs of schools and municipalities, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
