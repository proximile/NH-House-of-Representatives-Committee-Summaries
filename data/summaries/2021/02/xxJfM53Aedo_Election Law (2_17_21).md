**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (February 17, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 17, 2021, to discuss and deliberate on several bills related to election law, voting rights, and electoral processes. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, covered a wide range of topics, including minor party ballot access, voting rights for incarcerated individuals, presidential elector allocation, voter registration, ballot design, redistricting transparency, and campaign finance reform. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Minor Party Ballot Access and Voting Rights for Incarcerated Individuals**
- **House Bill 570 (HB 570)**: Introduced by Representative Max Abramson, HB 570 seeks to make it easier for minor political parties to gain official recognition in New Hampshire. Currently, minor parties face significant challenges in securing ballot access, often requiring signatures or a percentage of the vote in statewide elections. The bill proposes that a party can gain recognition if 500 people register as members statewide. Rep. Abramson highlighted the Libertarian Party’s recent success in gaining ballot access by winning over 4% of the vote in a gubernatorial race. The bill aims to streamline the process for minor parties to participate in elections, starting at the local and county levels before expanding to state and national races.
  
- **House Bill 555 (HB 555)**: Introduced by Representative Andrew Balon, HB 555 addresses the absentee voting process for individuals incarcerated pre-trial or serving time for misdemeanors. The bill seeks to clarify the application process by adding a checkbox and language to the affidavit, ensuring eligible voters can accurately describe their circumstances. Supporters, including the ACLU and the New Hampshire High School Democrats, emphasized the importance of maintaining civic engagement for incarcerated individuals who will re-enter society.

### **2. Presidential Elector Allocation (HB 370)**
- **House Bill 370 (HB 370)**: This bill proposes allocating New Hampshire’s presidential electors based on the plurality of votes in executive council districts rather than the statewide popular vote. Proponents, including Representative Cody Bander, argued that this would encourage presidential candidates to campaign more broadly across the state, ensuring diverse regional concerns are addressed. Opponents, including Representatives Linda Bundy and Timothy Horgan, criticized the bill as potentially undemocratic, as it could allow a candidate to win electoral votes without winning the statewide popular vote. Concerns about gerrymandering and the timing of the bill, following the contentious 2020 election and the January 6 Capitol riot, were also raised. An amendment proposed by Rep. Abramson to allocate electors based on the statewide popular vote was opposed by Rep. Bander but supported by some committee members.

### **3. Voter Registration and Ballot Design**
- **House Bill 86 (HB 86)**: This bill addresses voter qualifications and registration procedures. The sponsor argued that New Hampshire’s election laws are too lenient, allowing non-residents to vote without proper identification, which undermines voter confidence. The bill was criticized for being imperfect and incorporating non-germane issues, such as suppressing college student voting. The motion to retain the bill passed 15-5, allowing further work on the legislation.

- **House Bill 151 (HB 151)**: Introduced by Representative Majori, this bill simplifies the process for Undeclared voters to return to Undeclared status after voting in a primary. Currently, Undeclared voters must fill out a form to return to Undeclared status; this bill would automate that process. Supporters argued it would reduce confusion and streamline the process for voters and election officials.

- **House Bill 470 (HB 470)**: Introduced by Representative Sweeney, this bill requires the Secretary of State to highlight the maximum number of votes a voter can cast for an office on the ballot. The bill aims to make ballot instructions clearer, especially in multi-member districts with many candidates. Concerns were raised about the complexity of implementing this change.

### **4. Redistricting Transparency (HB 428)**
- **House Bill 428 (HB 428)**: This bill received strong support for its focus on transparency in the redistricting process. It mandates public hearings in each county, requires the release of preliminary redistricting plans, and ensures public access to redistricting data. Supporters, including the League of Women Voters and Open Democracy Action, emphasized the importance of fairness, transparency, and public trust in the process. Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency in the 2011 redistricting process, where maps were drawn in secret and released just before voting.

### **5. Campaign Finance and Election Procedures**
- **House Bill 77 (HB 77)**: This bill requires town and city clerks to provide daily notifications to the Secretary of State regarding candidate filings. An amendment clarified that clerks only need to report on days their offices are open. The bill, as amended, passed 14-6.

- **House Bill 223 (HB 223)**: This bill allows political parties to access lists of absentee ballot requests directly from the Secretary of State, rather than through candidates. It passed 11-9.

- **House Bill 263 (HB 263)**: This bill addresses campaign finance reform. An amendment increased the reporting threshold from $500 to $1,500. The bill, as amended, passed 11-9.

- **House Bill 326 (HB 326)**: This bill requires town and city clerks to make electronic lists of absentee ballot requests public. It passed unanimously (20-0).

- **House Bill 468 (HB 468)**: This bill modifies the definition of political advocacy organizations and lowers the spending threshold for reporting from $5,000 to $2,500. It was deemed inexpedient to legislate and passed 11-9.

- **House Bill 476 (HB 476)**: This bill allows moderators to recruit election officers from outside their districts to work at polling places. It passed unanimously (20-0).

- **House Bill 489 (HB 489)**: This bill aimed to prohibit certain political contributions. It was deemed inexpedient to legislate and passed 11-9.

- **House Bill 514 (HB 514)**: This bill addresses ballot column rotation. Due to its complexity, it was retained in committee with a unanimous vote (20-0).
