### **House Bill 68: Redefining Child Abuse to Include Gender-Affirming Care**

**Overview**:  
HB 68 seeks to classify providing gender-affirming medical care to transgender minors as child abuse. The bill sparked significant opposition from medical professionals, parents, legal experts, and advocates, who argued that it would harm transgender youth, infringe on parental rights, and violate medical and ethical standards.

**Key Testimonies and Arguments Against HB 68**:
1. **Medical Necessity**:  
   - Healthcare professionals, including **Brandy Brown**, a licensed clinical social worker, emphasized that gender-affirming care is evidence-based and medically necessary for treating gender dysphoria, a condition recognized in the DSM-5.  
   - Treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgeries are supported by major medical organizations like the American Medical Association (AMA), the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and the Endocrine Society.  
   - Denying this care could lead to severe mental health consequences, including increased rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide among transgender youth.

2. **Parental Rights and Family Support**:  
   - Parents of transgender children shared personal stories of their children’s struggles with gender dysphoria and the positive impact of gender-affirming care on their mental health.  
   - They argued that the bill would criminalize parents for seeking necessary medical treatment, forcing families to choose between complying with the law and their child’s well-being.

3. **Legal and Constitutional Concerns**:  
   - Legal experts, including representatives from the ACLU, highlighted that HB 68 violates federal and state anti-discrimination laws by targeting transgender individuals based on their gender identity.  
   - They warned that the bill could lead to costly legal challenges and set a dangerous precedent of government interference in private medical decisions.

4. **Harm to Transgender Youth**:  
   - Testimonies underscored that the bill would exacerbate the marginalization and stigma faced by transgender youth, increasing their risk of mental health issues and suicide.  
   - Advocates emphasized that supporting transgender youth through gender-affirming care is crucial for their development and well-being.

5. **Lack of Scientific Basis**:  
   - Critics argued that the bill is not grounded in medical or scientific evidence and misrepresents the nature of gender-affirming care, which is carefully monitored and reversible in its early stages.

**Support for HB 68**:  
Supporters of the bill expressed concerns about the long-term effects of medical interventions, arguing that puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgeries are experimental and irreversible. They also contended that children cannot provide informed consent for these treatments and that some individuals may later regret their decisions.

**Outcome**:  
The committee voted **15-0** to recommend that HB 68 be deemed **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)**, effectively stopping the bill from moving forward.

### **House Bill 317: Excluding VA Disability Benefits from Child Support Calculations**

**Overview**:  
HB 317 seeks to exclude VA disability compensation from being counted as gross income when calculating child support payments. The bill sparked debate over the financial stability of disabled veterans and the adequacy of support for dependents.

**Key Testimonies and Arguments**:
1. **Purpose of HB 317**:  
   - Proponents argued that VA disability benefits are intended to compensate veterans for impaired earning capacity and should not be treated as income for child support calculations.  
   - They emphasized that including these benefits in child support calculations leaves veterans with minimal income to cover living expenses.

2. **Federal vs. State Law**:  
   - Advocates for the bill, including attorney **Carson Tucker**, argued that federal law (e.g., **42 USC 659** and **38 USC 5301**) preempts state law, as VA disability benefits are federally protected and should not be subject to state child support calculations.  
   - Opponents, including the **NH Department of Military Affairs and Veteran Services**, contended that including VA benefits in child support calculations is compliant with federal law, as these benefits are intended to support the veteran and their family.

3. **Apportionment Process**:  
   - Proponents suggested that the VA’s apportionment process, which allocates a portion of a veteran’s disability benefits to dependents, should be the sole method for determining child support obligations.

4. **Impact on Veterans and Dependents**:  
   - Disabled veterans, including **Derek Champagne** and **Sean Bronstein**, testified about the financial strain of child support payments, arguing that VA disability benefits are essential for their survival.  
   - Opponents, including **Jesse Bolan**, raised concerns that excluding VA benefits from child support calculations could leave dependents without adequate financial support, potentially shifting the burden to state welfare programs.

**Committee Concerns**:  
Committee members expressed concern about ensuring that children receive adequate financial support, regardless of the parent’s disability status. They also sought clarity on the extent to which federal law preempts state law and the effectiveness of the apportionment process.

**Outcome**:  
The committee did not reach a final decision on HB 317, as the discussion highlighted the complex legal and ethical issues surrounding the bill.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the importance of balancing competing interests in legislation affecting vulnerable populations. HB 68, which sought to restrict access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth, was overwhelmingly opposed and ultimately rejected by the committee. HB 317, addressing the inclusion of VA disability benefits in child support calculations, remains under discussion, with the committee grappling with the need to protect both veterans’ financial stability and the welfare of their dependents. The testimonies highlighted the critical role of evidence-based policymaking and the need to consider the real-world impact of legislation on individuals and families.
