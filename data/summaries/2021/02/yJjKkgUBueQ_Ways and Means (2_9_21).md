The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 9, 2021, in a virtual setting due to the COVID-19 state of emergency.

### **Key Revenue Discussions and Projections**

1. **Sports Betting**:  
   The committee noted an uptick in revenue assumptions, driven by mobile and internet sports betting. Concerns were raised about potential losses from sports betting, prompting a suggestion to consult an expert for clarification. The unexpected $3 million loss from Super Bowl betting (due to heavy betting on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) highlighted the volatility of this revenue stream, though long-term trends were deemed more important.

2. **Real Estate Taxes**:  
   A surge in real estate activity, fueled by an influx of people moving to New Hampshire, was discussed. Members debated whether this trend represented a housing bubble and raised concerns about the availability of affordable housing. The pandemic’s impact on the real estate market and its potential long-term effects were also considered.

3. **Tobacco Taxes**:  
   The committee examined the impact of vaping and menthol cigarettes on tobacco tax revenues. The potential reversal of Massachusetts’ menthol cigarette ban was noted as a factor that could affect New Hampshire’s revenues. Members considered reaching out to experts for insights into tobacco usage trends.

4. **Meals and Rooms Taxes**:  
   The hospitality industry’s struggles during the pandemic were acknowledged, with members expressing the need for clarity on when normalcy might return. Discussions included the potential effects of herd immunity and business reopenings. Representatives from the lodging and restaurant associations were expected to provide further insights.

5. **Insurance and Statewide Property Taxes**:  
   The committee accepted the insurance agency’s revenue estimates due to their accuracy. The statutory amount of $363.1 million for the statewide property tax was confirmed, as no changes had been made to the statute.

6. **Communication Services Tax**:  
   Declining revenues from landline usage were offset by new regulations on VoIP and other communication platforms. The committee also debated whether services like Zoom could be taxed and acknowledged the need for legislative clarity.

7. **Tobacco Settlement and Legal Cases**:  
   The tobacco settlement revenue was discussed, with potential changes expected in April. The committee also considered revenue from legal settlements, such as the PFAS lawsuit against 3M, noting that funds could be directed to dedicated or general funds based on legislative decisions.

8. **Liquor Revenue and Medicaid Expansion**:  
   A portion of liquor revenue supports the Substance Abuse and Alcohol Fund and the Granite Advantage (Medicaid expansion) program. The committee discussed potential future funding needs and opted to delay finalizing estimates until more information was available.

9. **Interest Revenue and Utility Property Tax**:  
   Interest revenue projections were removed due to economic uncertainties, though unexpected income could offset shortfalls. The utility property tax was deemed a stable revenue source, with minimal fluctuations unless significant infrastructure changes occurred.

10. **Business Taxes and Interest/Dividends Tax**:  
    The pandemic’s uneven impact on businesses was highlighted, with large corporations faring better than small businesses. The committee also discussed raising the exemption threshold for the interest and dividends tax to assist lower-income individuals.

2. **Federal and State Tax Conformity**:  
   The complexities of aligning state tax laws with federal changes, such as the tax implications of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, were discussed.
