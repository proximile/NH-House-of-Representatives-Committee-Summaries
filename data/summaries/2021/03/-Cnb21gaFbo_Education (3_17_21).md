### **Key Challenges Facing NH Higher Education**

1. **Financial Crisis**:
   - Public higher education in NH is experiencing a generational revenue crisis, driven by declining enrollments, weaker student retention, and reduced campus revenue from room and board.
   - The pandemic has accelerated these issues, particularly impacting low-income students and institutions' financial stability.
   - NH has incurred $136 million in COVID-related losses, partially offset by $61 million in stimulus funds. Institutions are managing cash reserves carefully, but long-term impacts include depleted reserves and a shrinking student pool.

2. **Demographic Decline**:
   - NH is facing a significant decline in high school graduates, projected to drop by 26% by 2032. This decline is compounded by the state being the second-largest exporter of high school students, with nearly 60% leaving NH for college.
   - Regional disparities in college-going rates and declining high school graduation rates further exacerbate the enrollment challenges.

3. **High Tuition Costs**:
   - NH has the second-highest in-state tuition for public higher education in the U.S., creating a significant barrier to attracting and retaining students. This high cost, combined with demographic challenges, makes it difficult to reverse enrollment declines.

4. **Workforce Development and Credentialing**:
   - There is a growing demand for workforce development programs and credentialing, particularly for non-traditional students. Institutions are adapting by offering flexible, distance learning options and focusing on lifelong learning.

### **Proposed Solutions and Restructuring Efforts**

1. **Unification of USNH and CCSNH**:
   - A major proposal discussed was the unification of USNH and CCSNH into a single system. This aims to streamline operations, reduce costs, and create a more cohesive educational pathway for students.
   - The unified system would be overseen by a single board, with the goal of optimizing resources, improving economic development, and enhancing the state’s ability to compete with out-of-state institutions.

2. **Restructuring and Cost Reduction**:
   - A restructuring plan aims to reduce costs by 10% by 2023 through measures such as consolidating administrative functions, rebalancing academic programs, and voluntary staff separations.
   - However, these efforts may not fully address the demographic and financial challenges without additional legislative support.

3. **Governance and Leadership**:
   - The creation of a unified governance structure was emphasized as critical to the success of the merger. A strong board and CEO would be needed to navigate the complexities of merging two systems with different missions, accreditation processes, and faculty structures.
   - Concerns were raised about maintaining the unique missions of community colleges and avoiding bureaucratic inefficiencies.

### **Benefits and Challenges of the Merger**

1. **Potential Benefits**:
   - A unified system could provide strategic representation across the state, improve economic development, and create seamless educational pathways for students.
   - It could enhance branding, affordability, and the ability to compete with out-of-state institutions.
   - The merger could also address workforce development needs by preserving the critical role of community colleges in providing second chances and workforce training.

2. **Challenges and Concerns**:
   - The complexity of merging two systems with different missions, accreditation processes, and faculty structures was highlighted as a significant challenge.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential loss of regional identity, the need for careful planning, and the involvement of all stakeholders in the process.
   - The experience of other states, such as Connecticut and Vermont, was cited as a cautionary tale of how rushed mergers can lead to opposition and complications.

### **Urgency and Call to Action**

1. **Immediate Action Needed**:
   - Speakers emphasized that NH is "out of time" to address the impending crisis, with the proposed unification expected to be operational by July 2023.
   - Extensive planning will be required to address issues like accreditation, IT systems, admissions policies, and financial aid.

2. **Legislative Support**:
   - The panel stressed the need for legislative funding to support the restructuring and ensure the financial viability of public higher education. Without financial cushioning, institutions risk failure.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting concluded with a call for urgent action, collaboration, and investment to address the systemic challenges facing NH’s public higher education system. While the unification of USNH and CCSNH was proposed as a potential solution, it will require careful planning, strong leadership, and stakeholder involvement to ensure the missions of both systems are preserved and that students continue to have access to affordable, high-quality education. The success of these efforts will be critical to the future of higher education and economic development in New Hampshire.
