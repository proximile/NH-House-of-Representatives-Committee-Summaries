### **Department of Education Structure and Budget**
The DOE Commissioner provided an overview of the department’s structure, which includes four divisions:  
1. **Educator Education Analytics and Resources**: Manages educator credentials and federal grant programs.  
2. **Learner Supports**: Oversees special education, CTE, and vocational rehabilitation.  
3. **Educator Support and Higher Education**: Focuses on teacher preparation and higher education initiatives.  
4. **Workforce and Innovation**: Promotes workforce development and innovation in education.  

The Commissioner presented the DOE budget, emphasizing the importance of maintaining state funding levels to meet federal maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements. Key funding sources include the Education Trust Fund, federal Perkins grants for CTE, and IDEA funds for special education. The Commissioner also highlighted challenges in managing federal grants with strict MOE requirements.

### **Federal Funding and COVID-19 Response**
New Hampshire received significant federal funds to address the impact of the pandemic on education, including:  
- **$156 million from SR2 (similar to ESSER funds)**: Allocated to school districts for COVID-19 response, covering student learning loss, facility repairs, air quality systems, and operational expenses.  
- **Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund**: Directed toward compensatory education for students with special needs, mental and behavioral health services, and equitable services for non-public schools.  

As of the meeting, only $6 million of the $37 million allocated had been drawn down by schools, prompting concerns about spending timelines. The state anticipates additional federal funds if pending relief legislation is passed, bringing the total federal funds for COVID-19 response to approximately $305 million.

### **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**
The Commissioner discussed barriers to CTE access, particularly for students in sending schools, and efforts to improve scheduling and coordination. CTE programs, including automotive, agriculture, and machining, continue to receive support, though minor budget adjustments were made, such as reducing expenses for student clubs.

### **Vocational Rehabilitation and Disability Determinations**
The Vocational Rehabilitation Bureau faced issues with overspending and internal control deficiencies, which are being addressed through ongoing corrective actions. Additionally, the DOE administers disability determinations for the Social Security Administration, a fully federally funded activity.

### **Program Highlights and Budget Adjustments**
The committee reviewed several key programs and budget adjustments:  
- **Dropout Prevention**: New Hampshire has one of the highest graduation rates in the nation, thanks to successful dropout prevention initiatives.  
- **Dual and Concurrent Enrollment**: This program allows high school students to earn college credits. Funding was exhausted in the current budget cycle, prompting discussions about more efficient funding mechanisms through community colleges.  
- **New Hampshire Scholars Program, Robotics, and Other Initiatives**: These programs were not funded in the current cycle due to pandemic-related disruptions and the need to prioritize other areas.  
- **Statewide Student Information System**: The Commissioner advocated for this system to improve efficiency, data security, and reporting capabilities, though it was not included in the current budget.

### **New Positions and Charter School Grants**
The DOE requested seven new federally funded positions, including roles for the charter school grant program and the Social Security Disability Administration. The charter school grant is an innovation and startup grant, not intended for ongoing operations, and does not create a long-term financial burden on the state.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of managing state and federal education funds, particularly in the context of the pandemic. The committee emphasized the importance of equitable fund distribution, program prioritization, and addressing ongoing challenges in education. Work sessions were planned for the following week to further explore the budget and related issues, including transportation, safety, and school aid. Overall, the discussion highlighted New Hampshire’s commitment to maintaining high educational standards while navigating fiscal and operational challenges.
