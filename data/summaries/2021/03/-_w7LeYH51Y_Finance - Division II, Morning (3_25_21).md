**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II Meeting (March 25, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened on March 25, 2021, to discuss amendments to HB1 and HB2, the state budget bills, with a focus on education and transportation funding. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with public access provided via Zoom and telephone. Key discussions and decisions included:

---

### **Highway Fund and General Fund Support**
The committee debated the use of general fund support to balance the highway fund, noting that most available resources had already been utilized. This discussion underscored the financial pressures on the state’s transportation infrastructure.

---

### **Education Trust Fund Amendments**
Two amendments, 1018H and 1019H, were central to the debate. Amendment 1019H proposed transferring funds from the Education Trust Fund to the General Fund to support transportation needs, while 1018H sought to transfer general funds back into the Education Trust Fund. The committee considered blending these transfers to net their impact.

- **Concerns About Education Funding**: Representative Heath raised significant concerns about diverting education trust fund money to transportation, emphasizing the need to support school districts facing enrollment declines and budget challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. Heath proposed an amendment (0721H) to restore funding levels to those of the 2021 biennium, including disparity aid and targeted aid. However, this amendment was defeated in a 4-3 vote.
- **Statewide Property Tax (SWEPT)**: The committee debated reducing SWEPT revenue by $100 million and replacing it with general funds. Some members argued this would shift the burden to local property taxes, particularly in less affluent towns, while others saw it as a way to reduce statewide property taxes.
- **One-Time Funding Concerns**: Concerns were raised about using one-time funds to increase education funding, as this could set expectations for future budgets and create recurring demands.

### **Supreme Court Decision on Education Funding**
Representative Lynn provided an analysis of a recent Supreme Court decision regarding education funding. The court remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings, indicating that the issue of what constitutes an "adequate education" would require extensive discovery and a lengthy trial. Lynn expressed concerns about the court potentially setting funding levels rather than the legislature, emphasizing the need for legislative control over budgetary decisions.

### **Amendment on School Board Replacement Process**
Representative Wyler presented an amendment addressing the replacement process for school board members, particularly focusing on the role of at-large members in selecting replacements. The amendment was discussed in detail, and the committee voted unanimously (7-0) to accept it.

---

### **Transportation Funding and Education Trust Fund**
The committee debated another amendment (2021-1019h) that would transfer funds from the Education Trust Fund to the General Fund to support transportation needs, including highway block grants, bridge betterment, fleet vehicles, and winter maintenance. The amendment also included provisions for school building aid, accelerating payments for outstanding obligations, and suspending the $50 million cap on school building aid for the biennium.

- **Concerns and Support**: Representative Heath and others expressed discomfort with diverting education funds to transportation, questioning the precedent it might set. Representative Murray acknowledged the critical needs of the highway fund but questioned whether this was a sustainable solution. The committee also discussed potential federal funding for transportation and the legal mechanisms in place to address deficits in the Education Trust Fund.

---

### **Voting and Next Steps**
The committee voted on several amendments, with 0721H being defeated (4-3) and 1018H passing unanimously (7-0). The committee agreed to revisit the issue later in the day to craft a new amendment utilizing the $100 million in a way that better addresses school district needs. The meeting concluded with a discussion of next steps, including reconvening at 2:00 PM to finalize amendments and ensure alignment with the committee’s intent before moving forward to the full Finance Committee.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the tension between reducing statewide property taxes and adequately funding education, with a focus on ensuring equitable support for all school districts. The complexities of balancing education and transportation funding within the state budget were evident, with significant debate over the appropriate use of the Education Trust Fund and the potential implications of using one-time funds. The committee’s discussions underscored the challenges of addressing competing priorities while maintaining fiscal responsibility and legislative control over budgetary decisions.
