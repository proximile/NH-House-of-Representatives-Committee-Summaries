**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Commerce and Consumer Affairs (March 30, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 30, 2021, to discuss several bills related to commerce and consumer affairs. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on five key pieces of legislation: **Senate Bill 68 (SB 68)**, **Senate Bill 36 (SB 36)**, **Senate Bill 49 (SB 49)**, and **Senate Bill 69 (SB 69)**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points raised during the meeting.

### **Senate Bill 68: Protections for Pregnant Workers**
SB 68 aims to codify protections for pregnant workers in New Hampshire by clarifying and consolidating existing practices of the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights. Key points include:
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to formalize accommodations for pregnant workers, such as bathroom breaks, lifting restrictions, and other needs, into state law.
- **Current Practices**: The Commission has addressed pregnancy-related discrimination since 1965, but the bill would provide clearer guidelines for employers and employees.
- **Concerns**: Representatives expressed concerns about the bill’s vagueness, particularly around terms like "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship." Critics, including law student Kate Frederick, argued that the lack of specificity could lead to confusion. Supporters, like attorney Sarah Braffman, emphasized the need to ensure accommodations are not limited to temporary disabilities.
- **Interactive Process**: The Commission highlighted that accommodations are determined through an interactive process between employers and employees, tailored to individual needs.
- **Potential Impact**: Some representatives worried the bill might discourage employers from hiring women of childbearing age due to concerns about accommodations.
- **Legal Framework**: The bill aligns with federal laws like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act but aims to provide more clarity within New Hampshire’s legal framework.

### **Senate Bill 36: Automobile Insurance Residency Requirements**
SB 36 proposes to eliminate the requirement for applicants to sign a **statement of residency** when applying for automobile insurance in New Hampshire. Key points include:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to modernize insurance requirements by removing an outdated form that has caused confusion and unnecessary cancellations.
- **Support**: The New Hampshire Insurance Department and industry representatives, including Senator Harold French and James Fox, testified that the form is no longer necessary and has caused more problems than it solves.
- **Opposition**: Bruce Berkey of the Professional Insurance Agents of New Hampshire argued that the residency statement helps prevent fraud and ensures proper insurance practices.
- **Concerns**: Legislators raised questions about how the bill would handle non-residents or those with multiple residences, particularly regarding exclusive garaging requirements.
- **Outcome**: The discussion centered on balancing consumer convenience with regulatory oversight, with most speakers supporting the bill as a step toward modernization.

### **Senate Bill 49: Updates to Trust Laws**
SB 49 seeks to modernize New Hampshire’s trust laws to remain competitive with states like Delaware and South Dakota. Key provisions include:
- **Representation**: Allows settlors to appoint representatives for beneficiaries who are minors or have special needs.
- **Decanting**: Simplifies the process of transferring assets from one trust to another, reducing administrative burdens.
- **ESG Investments**: Permits beneficiaries to direct trustees to invest in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria without exposing trustees to fiduciary liability.
- **Economic Impact**: The bill aims to attract trust companies to New Hampshire, create jobs, and provide flexibility for trustees and beneficiaries.

### **Senate Bill 69: Workplace Accommodations for Nursing Mothers**
SB 69 focuses on providing workplace accommodations for nursing mothers, extending protections beyond hourly workers to all employees. Key points include:
- **Purpose**: The bill requires employers to provide reasonable break time and private space for employees to express milk during the workday, excluding direct breastfeeding.
- **Support**: Advocates, including Senator Becky Whitley, emphasized the bill’s benefits for public health, workforce retention, and business productivity. Testimonies from working mothers and business owners highlighted the importance of lactation accommodations.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about the exclusion of direct breastfeeding and the potential financial burden on small businesses. Some questioned how accommodations would work in industries like road construction or transportation.
- **Flexibility**: The bill includes an undue hardship exemption, allowing employers to request exemptions if compliance poses a significant financial or operational burden.
