### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Gifted and Talented Education (HB 321)**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires school districts to submit reports on their policies and procedures for identifying and supporting gifted and talented students.
- **Debates**:
  - **Growth Mindset vs. Labeling**: Representative Luno proposed an amendment emphasizing growth mindset and effort over labeling students as "gifted." While some supported this approach, others argued it diverged from the billâ€™s original intent. The amendment was ultimately rejected.
  - **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Representatives debated whether broad definitions of "gifted and talented" should be left to local districts or standardized at the state level.
  - **Implementation Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the lack of clarity in the bill, potential burdens on school districts, and the absence of a dedicated position at the Department of Education to oversee gifted programs.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with its original amendments, though some members expressed reservations about its effectiveness.

#### **2. Special Education (HB 581)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to address the burden of proof in special education hearings.
- **Amendment**: A committee was proposed to examine the special education process and recommend improvements. The amendment passed unanimously.
- **Outcome**: The bill was recommended to pass with the amendment, with members emphasizing the need for a deeper dive into the special education system to better serve students.

#### **3. Transgender Athletes in Sports (HB 198)**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses the participation of transgender athletes in school sports.
- **Debates**: The bill sparked significant controversy, with opponents arguing it was unnecessary, discriminatory, and interfered with existing policies. Supporters contended it addressed fairness in sports.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to retain the bill, reflecting the divisive nature of the issue.

#### **4. School Funding and Cooperative Districts (HB 152)**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows cooperative school districts to continue using their current funding formulas without requiring changes.
- **Debates**: Initially, there was a motion to retain the bill, but it was withdrawn after discussion.
- **Outcome**: The bill was recommended to pass.

#### **5. Menstrual Hygiene Products in Schools (HB 458)**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to repeal the requirement for schools to provide free menstrual hygiene products to students.
- **Debates**:
  - **Unfunded Mandate Concern**: Proponents argued the mandate violated RSA 28-a, which prohibits unfunded state mandates, and emphasized local control.
  - **Impact on Students**: Opponents highlighted the importance of menstrual products for students' health, dignity, and school attendance, citing period poverty.
  - **Equity and Access**: Representatives discussed the disproportionate impact on low-income students and the need for educational equity.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with a vote of 11-9, though the discussion reflected deep divisions.

#### **6. School Lunch Programs (HB 202)**
- **Purpose**: The bill ensures all students, including middle and high schoolers, have access to free meals if they cannot afford them.
- **Debates**: Confusion arose over whether current law (RSA 189:11a) already covers all grades or only elementary students. A 2016 Department of Education advisory suggested it only applied to elementary schools, but the statute was updated in 2019, potentially extending it to all grades.
- **Outcome**: The committee decided to recess the bill until the following week to clarify the discrepancy.

#### **7. Emergency Meetings and Collective Bargaining (HB 71)**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses emergency meetings, particularly in the context of collective bargaining agreements.
- **Amendment**: An amendment clarified that courts cannot authorize special emergency meetings if the emergency involves a collective bargaining agreement that was previously voted down.
