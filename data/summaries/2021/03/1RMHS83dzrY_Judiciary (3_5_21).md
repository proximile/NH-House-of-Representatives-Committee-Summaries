### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 149: COVID-19 Liability Protections**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to provide limited civil immunity to businesses, organizations, and individuals acting in good faith during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting them from frivolous lawsuits related to COVID-19 exposure or transmission.
- **Support**: Supporters, including the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire and the American Heart Association, argued that the bill would protect businesses and nonprofits from costly legal battles, encouraging reopening and public gatherings.
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including legal professionals, contended that the bill is unnecessary, as no COVID-19-related lawsuits have been filed in New Hampshire. They argued that existing negligence laws already protect businesses acting reasonably and that the bill could undermine constitutional rights to legal remedies.
- **Key Concerns**: Questions arose about the definition of "willful negligence" and the potential for the bill to shield bad actors. Critics also noted the lack of evidence supporting the need for such protections.

#### **House Bill 542: Religious Freedom During Emergencies**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to protect religious freedom during states of emergency by ensuring that churches and religious organizations are not unfairly restricted.
- **Support**: Pastors and religious leaders testified that churches provide essential spiritual, emotional, and practical support, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. They argued that church closures harmed mental health and community well-being and that religious freedom is a fundamental right.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about potential abuse of the bill, such as non-religious groups using it as a loophole to bypass public health measures.
- **Key Themes**: The debate centered on balancing religious freedom with public health accountability during emergencies.

#### **House Bill 478: PFAS Contamination in Merrimack**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to hold **Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics** accountable for the long-term remediation of **PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)** contamination in Merrimack’s drinking water, extending the company’s financial obligations beyond the current 2025 deadline.
- **Background**: PFAS contamination, linked to Saint-Gobain’s manufacturing processes, has caused significant health and environmental issues in Merrimack. A 2018 settlement agreement limited the company’s responsibility to five years, but subsequent studies revealed higher-than-expected costs.
- **Support**: Proponents, including local representatives and community members, argued that Saint-Gobain should bear the full long-term costs of water treatment to protect public health and prevent financial burdens on taxpayers.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, argued that altering the settlement after the fact would set a bad precedent and discourage businesses from cooperating in future negotiations.
- **Key Concerns**: The bill’s supporters emphasized its unique nature, citing a similar bill related to the Coakley Landfill as a model, while opponents expressed concerns about legislative interference in private agreements.

#### **House Bill 379: Electronic Notice for Municipalities**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows municipalities to post public notices on their websites instead of newspapers, modernizing communication and reducing costs.
- **Support**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association supported the bill, noting the declining availability of local newspapers and the efficiency of digital communication.
- **Key Themes**: The bill reflects a shift toward digital communication for public notices, addressing accessibility and cost concerns.

#### **House Bill 597: Privacy Protections for Personal Information**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to protect the privacy of personal information held by third-party organizations, requiring government entities to obtain warrants or subpoenas to access such information, except in emergencies or when required by law.
- **Support**: Advocates argued that the bill aligns with New Hampshire’s constitutional privacy amendment and prevents government overreach.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Banking Department and municipalities, raised concerns about ambiguous language, compliance challenges, and potential unintended consequences for law enforcement and regulatory functions.
- **Key Themes**: The debate highlighted the balance between privacy protections and the need for government access to information.

---

#### **House Bill 288: Repeal of the Housing Appeals Board**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to repeal the Housing Appeals Board, which was established to expedite housing development appeals.
- **Support**: Opponents of the board argued it undermines local control and primarily benefits real estate developers.
- **Opposition**: Supporters, including Senator Bob Giuda, emphasized the board’s role in addressing the state’s housing shortage by reducing delays and costs associated with Superior Court appeals.
- **Key Themes**: The discussion reflected tensions between local control and state efforts to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis.
