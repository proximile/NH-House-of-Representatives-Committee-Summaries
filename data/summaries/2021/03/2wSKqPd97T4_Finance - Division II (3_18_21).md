**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division II Meeting (March 18, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II convened on March 18, 2021, to discuss a range of legislative and budgetary issues, including education funding, infrastructure, and a proposed merger between the New Hampshire Community College System (CCSNH) and the University System of New Hampshire (USNH). The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with public participation facilitated through Zoom or telephone.

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

#### **Legislative Process and Amendments**
- Members emphasized the need to finalize amendments and proposals for review, planning to consolidate proposals by the following Monday or Tuesday.
- Several amendments were debated, including one addressing cooperative school board vacancies and another concerning liability for highway obstructions or injuries.

#### **Education Funding**
- Significant discussion focused on funding for public education, including the public school infrastructure fund, special education, and dual/concurrent enrollment programs.
- Members debated reallocating funds from the public school infrastructure fund to other education needs, such as special education or dual enrollment programs.
- The possibility of transferring money between the Unique Fund and the Governor’s Scholarship Fund was explored.
- Concerns were raised about the adequacy of building aid for schools, with suggestions to redirect funds given anticipated federal funding for infrastructure projects.

#### **Highway and DOT Funding**
- The committee discussed allowing the Department of Transportation (DOT) to retain excess funds for equipment purchases, ensuring alignment with budgetary estimates and no impact on the overall budget balance.

#### **Dual and Concurrent Enrollment**
- A proposal was made to move the dual and concurrent enrollment program from the Department of Education to the Community College System (CCSNH) for more direct administration and funding.

#### **Budgetary Adjustments**
- The committee considered various budget adjustments, including funding for safety, aeronautics, and other state programs, ensuring all budgetary impacts were accounted for and balanced.

#### **Proposed Merger of CCSNH and USNH**
- The discussion centered on HB2, which proposes the unification of the New Hampshire Community College System and the University System of New Hampshire.
- The merger is motivated by demographic changes, particularly a projected decline in the traditional college-age population (18-22 years old), which is expected to impact enrollment over the next 5-10 years.
- **Governance Structure**: The proposed merger would create a new 15-member Board of Trustees, with five members from each system, and five appointed by the governor. Concerns were raised about the potential for the community college system to be overshadowed by the larger university system.
- **Funding Concerns**: Representatives expressed concerns about the lack of level funding for both systems in recent years, which has led to increased tuition costs. Some argued that stable funding is needed before undertaking a merger.
- **Pace of the Merger**: Several representatives, including Rep. Heath and Rep. Turcotte, voiced concerns about the rapid pace of the merger process, suggesting a slower, more thorough approach, possibly through a study commission or coordinating council.
- **Mission Differences**: Rep. Turcotte highlighted the distinct missions of the community college and university systems, emphasizing that community colleges focus on workforce readiness while universities offer broader academic programs. He expressed concern that a merger could dilute the community college system’s focus.
- **Online Education**: The need for both systems to adapt to the growing trend of online education was discussed, as brick-and-mortar institutions face challenges with declining enrollments.
- **Chancellor Search**: Susan Huard, representing the community college system, mentioned that a search for a new chancellor is underway, with a two-year contract proposed due to the uncertainty surrounding the merger.
- **Coordination and Planning**: Representatives discussed the need for a coordinated approach to planning the merger, with suggestions to form a coordinating council to oversee the process rather than immediately creating a new board of trustees.
- **Legislative Oversight**: There was consensus that the legislature should retain oversight and the ability to approve or reject the merger proposal in the future.

### Conclusion
The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene on Monday to finalize decisions on the discussed issues, with members encouraged to submit any additional amendments or proposals beforehand. Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexity of the proposed merger, the need for careful planning and coordination, and the importance of addressing funding and mission differences to ensure a successful transition. Additionally, the committee addressed critical budgetary and legislative matters, emphasizing the need for balanced and level funding across various state programs.
