### **Constitutional Amendment to Repeal the Blaine Amendment (CACR 3)**  
   - **Overview**: CACR 3 proposes removing the Blaine Amendment from the state constitution, which prohibits public funding of religious schools.  
   - **Arguments for Repeal**:  
     - The Blaine Amendment is rooted in 19th-century anti-Catholic bigotry and is inconsistent with modern constitutional principles.  
     - Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings (*Espinoza v. Montana*, *Trinity Lutheran*) have deemed such amendments unconstitutional.  
     - Supporters argued that removing the amendment would prevent unnecessary litigation and align New Hampshire’s constitution with federal law.  
   - **Arguments Against Repeal**:  
     - Opponents emphasized the importance of the separation of church and state and the need to prioritize public school funding.  
     - Concerns were raised about potential discrimination in admissions by religious schools and the timing of the amendment, which wouldn’t go to voters until 2022.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee heard extensive testimony on the amendment’s history, legal implications, and potential consequences, with supporters urging its removal as a relic of bigotry.

### **Expanding School Choice (HB 455)**  
   - **Overview**: HB 455 proposes allowing students to attend public schools outside their resident districts, aiming to eliminate "zip code discrimination."  
   - **Concerns**:  
     - Financial burdens on receiving districts, as only state adequacy funding (around $4,000-$5,000 per student) would follow the student, leaving local taxpayers to cover additional costs.  
     - Questions about responsibility for special education services and the potential to exacerbate inequities, with wealthier districts attracting students from poorer ones.  
     - Stakeholders, including the NH School Administrators Association and NH School Boards Association, opposed the bill, citing its potential to widen achievement gaps and disrupt local control.  
   - **Outcome**: The discussion highlighted significant concerns about the bill’s impact on equity, funding, and local school systems, with calls for a more comprehensive approach to addressing educational disparities.

### **Tuition Program for Religious Schools (HB 282)**  
   - **Overview**: HB 282 seeks to remove the term "nonsectarian" from the state’s tuition program, allowing religious schools to be included.  
   - **Arguments for the Bill**:  
     - The bill aligns with recent Supreme Court rulings prohibiting discrimination against religious schools in public benefit programs.  
     - Supporters emphasized parental choice and local control, with decisions about contracts with religious schools made by local school boards.  
   - **Concerns**:  
     - Opponents raised issues about potential conflicts with families’ religious beliefs and the state’s constitutional protections against funding religious schools.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill sparked debate over its legal implications and impact on families, with a proposed amendment clarifying that parents, not school boards, would choose schools for their children.

- **Equity and Funding**: Concerns about the financial impact of school choice policies on public schools and local taxpayers.
