**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division I Meeting (March 4, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division I, convened on March 4, 2021, to address a range of budgetary, environmental, and operational issues. The meeting focused on aligning state practices with federal regulations, tackling environmental challenges, and ensuring efficient departmental operations through budgetary adjustments and new hires. Key discussions and decisions included:

### **Environmental and Infrastructure Concerns**
1. **Contamination Issues**: The state is confronting widespread contamination in private wells, necessitating increased focus and resources to address this critical public health issue.
2. **Solid Waste Management**: Renewed emphasis was placed on solid waste management, including recycling and diversion technologies, with optimism for progress due to increased support from state leadership.
3. **Dam Maintenance**: Aging dam infrastructure is a priority, with increased funding allocated for assessments and maintenance. Additional capital budget support may be requested in the future.
4. **PFAS and Emerging Contaminants**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) budget includes a $50 million bonding authorization to address PFAS contamination and other emerging contaminants.
5. **Water and Wastewater Infrastructure**: The state administers loan programs for municipalities to fund water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with interest rates set according to federal guidelines.

### **Departmental Operations and Budgetary Adjustments**
1. **Waste Management and Database Work**: The Waste Management Division requires additional support, particularly for database work, which is increasingly relied upon by the public and regulated entities.
2. **New Positions and IT Upgrades**: DES requested new positions, including a public information officer, a business systems analyst for the "One Stop" database system, and an environmentalist to address residential well water issues. The "One Stop" system, which consolidates various databases, needs significant upgrades to improve cybersecurity and functionality.
3. **Federal Grants**: New federal grants for dam assessments, particularly for state-owned flood control dams, were highlighted, with funds allocated for detailed engineering assessments.

### **Legislative and Regulatory Alignment**
1. **Apprenticeship Board Authority**: The committee discussed the transfer of authority from the state apprenticeship board to the federal government since 2007, aiming to align state law with federal control over registered apprenticeships.
2. **Workers' Compensation and Mail Notifications**: Changes to workers' compensation procedures, including the shift from certified mail to first-class mail for notifications, were debated. Concerns about ensuring due process and follow-up in cases of default led to a push to codify additional contact attempts in such scenarios.

### **Budgetary Approvals and Reviews**
1. **Budgetary Constraints**: Fiscal constraints led to the elimination of certain positions, such as a financial analyst for the MS4 program, despite their importance for assisting municipalities with federal program compliance.
2. **Unanimous Approvals**: Sections 125, 126, and 127 of the budget, dealing with workers' compensation and fiscal year adjustments, were approved unanimously.
3. **Legislative Process**: The committee reviewed various budgetary items and legislative bills, focusing on identifying significant changes and variances in the budget.

### **Department of Energy**
1. **Creation and Interactions**: The establishment of the Department of Energy is expected to have peripheral interactions with existing environmental programs, particularly in areas like electrification and diesel emissions retrofits.

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene for further discussions on specific bills and continued budgetary considerations, emphasizing the importance of addressing environmental challenges, aligning with federal regulations, and ensuring efficient state operations.
