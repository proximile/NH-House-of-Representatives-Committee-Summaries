### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 362 (HB 362): Domicile of Students for Voting Purposes**
   - **Purpose**: HB 362 seeks to repeal the provision allowing students to claim their educational institution as their domicile for voting purposes.
   - **Support**: Proponents, including Representative Norman Silber, argued that the current law creates a "special class" of voters and that students should meet standard domicile requirements to vote. Representative Al Baldasaro drew parallels to military personnel voting absentee from their home of record.
   - **Opposition**: Students, university representatives, and organizations like the ACLU strongly opposed the bill. Testifiers emphasized that students contribute economically and socially to their communities, often spending the majority of the year in New Hampshire. They argued that the bill would disenfranchise students, particularly those living on campus, and undermine their constitutional right to vote.
   - **Legal Concerns**: Opponents highlighted that the bill contradicts the New Hampshire Supreme Court’s ruling in *Casey v. Gardner*, which affirmed that students must meet the same residency obligations as other voters.

2. **House Bill 429 (HB 429): College or University Student Voting**
   - **Purpose**: HB 429 ties in-state tuition eligibility to voter registration, requiring students who vote in New Hampshire to pay in-state tuition.
   - **Support**: Representative Baldasaro argued that voting should align with residency status and in-state tuition eligibility.
   - **Opposition**: Students and university representatives testified that the bill penalizes students for civic engagement, discourages participation in elections, and could financially burden universities. They emphasized that students contribute to local economies and communities and should have the right to vote where they reside.

3. **House Bill 554 (HB 554): Temporary Residence Definition**
   - **Purpose**: HB 554 seeks to clarify the definition of "temporary residence," particularly for individuals who own property in New Hampshire but may not reside there permanently.
   - **Concerns**: Testifiers, including the ACLU, argued that the bill could create confusion and disenfranchise voters, particularly students and military personnel who temporarily leave the state. Students shared personal experiences of bureaucratic challenges in registering to vote.

4. **House Bill 531 (HB 531): Provisional Ballots and Voter Registration**
   - **Purpose**: HB 531 aims to eliminate affidavits for voter registration and establish a provisional ballot system, requiring voters to provide proof of citizenship, age, and domicile within five days for their vote to count.
   - **Support**: Representative Lynn argued that the bill strengthens voter identification laws and addresses concerns about fraud.
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including Ken Barnes and Henry Clementowicz, argued that the current affidavit system works well and that the bill could disenfranchise voters, particularly those who lack immediate access to required documents.

5. **House Bill 535 (HB 535): Voter Identification and Proof of Citizenship**
   - **Purpose**: HB 535 seeks to eliminate the qualified voter affidavit, requiring photo ID and proof of citizenship for voter registration.
   - **Support**: Representative Barry claimed the bill would restore faith in elections, citing voter skepticism.
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including the ACLU, argued that the bill would disenfranchise voters, particularly new Americans, and that voter fraud is exceedingly rare.

6. **Absentee Voting and Ballot Verification Bills**:
   - Several bills addressed absentee voting and ballot verification, including **HB 61**, **HB 144**, **HB 285**, **HB 291**, **HB 292**, **HB 406**, **HB 480**, **HB 491**, **HB 516**, and **HB 524**.
   - **Key Themes**: Discussions focused on ensuring the accuracy and integrity of ballots, increasing transparency in absentee ballot processing, and conducting routine election audits.
   - **Outcomes**: The committee voted to recommend most of these bills as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) or retained them for further work, reflecting concerns about voter suppression and the need for clarity in election laws.

2. **Residency and Domicile**:
