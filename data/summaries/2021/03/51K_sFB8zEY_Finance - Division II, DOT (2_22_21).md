**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Committee (Division II) Meeting on February 22, 2021: Department of Transportation (DOT) Budget and Operations**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee (Division II) convened virtually on February 22, 2021, to discuss the Department of Transportation (DOT) budget and the impacts of COVID-19 on transportation planning and infrastructure. The meeting highlighted the DOT’s efforts to navigate budget shortfalls, adapt to changing travel patterns, and prioritize critical infrastructure needs while awaiting potential federal support.

### **DOT Overview and Responsibilities**
The DOT’s mission is to provide safe, reliable transportation systems that support New Hampshire’s economy and quality of life. The department oversees a wide range of infrastructure, including 2,160 state-owned bridges, 4,600 lane miles of roadway, 195 miles of active state-owned rail lines, 24 public airports, and 11 public transit systems. It employs approximately 1,650 full-time staff, with additional part-time and seasonal workers.

### **Budget Overview and Challenges**
The DOT’s budget for FY 2022 is $674 million, with $354 million allocated for municipal aid and construction and $320 million for operations. For FY 2023, the budget increases slightly to $684 million, with $350 million for construction and $334 million for operations. Funding sources include the Highway Fund (36%), federal funds (35%), Turnpike funds (19%), and other sources.

**Impact of COVID-19:** The pandemic significantly reduced revenues, particularly for the Turnpike system, which saw a 20% drop in traffic and toll revenue. The DOT also faced a 15% vacancy rate due to a hiring freeze, which has since been lifted. The FY22 budget required a 7% reduction, leading to delays in some capital projects by 1-2 years. Federal relief funds ($41 million) and general fund transfers have helped balance the budget, but long-term structural issues remain.

### **Key Challenges and Priorities**
1. **Work-from-Home Trends**: The pandemic has shifted commuting patterns, with more local trips and fewer long commutes. Firms are adopting varying work-from-home policies, which may permanently alter traffic patterns and reduce revenue from tolls and gas taxes.
   
2. **Transportation Needs**: The DOT is working with businesses and chambers of commerce to understand future transportation needs, as remote work, telehealth, and online learning could reduce demand for traditional commuting and travel.

3. **Fleet Maintenance**: The DOT’s fleet replacement is significantly underfunded. With a replacement value of $90 million, the department should be spending $8-9 million annually but is currently only budgeting $2-3 million. This has led to a backlog of outdated equipment, with 22% of the fleet exceeding life expectancy parameters.

4. **Preventative Maintenance**: Programs like guardrail repairs, bridge washing, and graffiti removal have been cut due to budget constraints, impacting safety and infrastructure longevity.

5. **Winter Maintenance**: The DOT has secured funding for winter maintenance at a three-year average, reducing the need for frequent fiscal committee requests. However, contractor availability remains a challenge, especially in southern New Hampshire.

6. **Conway Bypass Project**: The project has been delayed, and the DOT must repay federal funds spent on right-of-way acquisitions. Approximately $6-8 million is needed to cover these costs.

### **Federal Funding and Advocacy**
The DOT is awaiting federal reauthorization of transportation funding, which could provide additional flexibility and resources. The department is also monitoring how Congress addresses declining gas tax revenue due to increased fuel efficiency and reduced travel. New Hampshire leverages toll credits to access federal funding without requiring state cash matches, though this results in a smaller overall construction program compared to neighboring states.

### **Unfunded Priorities and Future Challenges**
Unfunded priorities include fleet replacement, bridge maintenance, ITS device repairs, and telematics for equipment monitoring. These are critical for maintaining infrastructure and ensuring safety. The DOT also faces challenges with non-federal aid roads, approximately 140 miles of which are ineligible for federal funding, creating a reliance on state resources.

### **Legislative and Financial Strategies**
- **SB 367**: This bill, which increased gas taxes, has provided flexibility for rural road and bridge maintenance. However, as the state begins paying the principal on loans for projects like I-93, there will be less capacity for rural infrastructure work. The gas tax increase is set to sunset once the loan is paid off, projected for 2034.
  
- **Advocacy for Federal Support**: The DOT is advocating for more federal investment and flexibility, especially for non-federal aid roads and bridges. The state also faces challenges with declining revenue from traditional sources like gas taxes due to increased fuel efficiency and electric vehicle adoption.

### **Conclusion**
The DOT is navigating a complex landscape of budget constraints, changing travel patterns, and aging infrastructure. While federal relief funds have provided temporary relief, long-term solutions are needed to address structural issues and ensure the state’s transportation systems remain safe and efficient. The committee concluded with a commitment to further discuss the Highway Fund’s finances and address the DOT’s equipment and maintenance challenges in future sessions.
