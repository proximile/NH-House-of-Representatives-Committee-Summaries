### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Finance - Division II, USNH, CCSNH, Governor, Part I (2/26/21)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened on February 26, 2021, to discuss the University System of New Hampshire (USNH), the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH), and the governor’s budget proposal. The meeting, held electronically due to COVID-19, focused on the challenges and opportunities facing New Hampshire’s higher education systems, particularly in light of the pandemic and the proposed merger of USNH and CCSNH.

#### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Public Mission and Workforce Development**  
   Both USNH and CCSNH emphasized their roles as critical public resources for Granite Staters. USNH highlighted its contributions to workforce development, research (over $140 million annually), and community impact through initiatives like the Cooperative Extension. CCSNH, serving over 26,000 students annually, underscored its focus on affordability, accessibility, and responsiveness to community needs, offering certificates, associate degrees, and customized training programs. Both systems are integral to the state’s **65 by 25 Initiative**, which aims for 65% of New Hampshire adults to have post-secondary credentials by 2025.

2. **Impact of COVID-19**  
   The pandemic significantly disrupted education and operations for both systems. USNH faced $46 million in unrecovered costs and $76 million in revenue losses due to reduced dorm occupancy and canceled summer programs. CCSNH experienced enrollment declines, particularly among older students, as work and family responsibilities took precedence. Despite these challenges, both systems collaborated with the state on COVID-19 initiatives, such as testing and vaccine distribution, and adapted to meet workforce needs, such as reinstating the Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) program.

3. **Budgetary Challenges and State Funding**  
   USNH is addressing declining enrollment (projected to drop sharply by 2025) and increasing financial aid needs by restructuring costs, aiming to cut $70 million (9% of its budget) by 2023. The governor proposed a $4.5 million cut in state funding for fiscal year 2022, a 5% reduction, adding pressure to USNH’s budget despite its commitment to freezing in-state tuition. CCSNH, meanwhile, reduced operating costs by nearly 8% from FY18 to FY20 and sought continued state support to maintain affordability and student success.

4. **Proposed Merger of USNH and CCSNH**  
   A central focus of the meeting was the governor’s proposal to merge USNH and CCSNH into a single entity. The merger aims to create a unified, seamless educational pathway for students, eliminate inefficiencies, and improve credit transfer processes. Key aspects of the proposal include:  
   - **Level Funding in Year One**: Both systems would maintain their current operations in the first year.  
   - **Unified Leadership in Year Two**: A single chancellor would oversee the combined system, fostering collaboration and eliminating competition between the two.  
   - **Efficiency and Synergy**: The merger would eliminate duplicated systems (e.g., IT) and create a more efficient, student-focused model with 11 units maintaining their identity under unified leadership.  
   - **Affordability and Access**: The governor emphasized rethinking higher education pricing, potentially offering tiered options to ensure community colleges remain an affordable pathway for students.  

5. **Bipartisan Support and Leadership**  
   The proposal received bipartisan support, with participants agreeing on the urgency of acting now to avoid further decline in the systems’ competitiveness. Representative Lynn suggested appointing a chancellor early in the process to ensure the merger stays on track, a recommendation the governor supported. Strong leadership was seen as essential to navigate the complexities of the transition and maintain flexibility in designing the new system.

6. **Opportunities for Students**  
   The merger was framed as a way to provide students with greater access to resources, partnerships, and career pathways across both systems. By eliminating the stigma of community colleges being "second tier," the merger aims to create a more integrated educational experience that better serves students’ evolving needs and aligns with workforce demands.

7. **Challenges and Concerns**  
   While the merger was broadly supported, concerns were raised about funding distribution, particularly given the historical tendency to allocate more resources to community colleges. Representative Weiler questioned how a merged system would ensure equitable funding. Additionally, maintaining the affordability and accessibility of community colleges was a key priority, with participants emphasizing the need to protect these pathways for students who cannot afford four-year universities.

#### **Conclusion**  
The meeting concluded with a call for collaboration and timely action to ensure the long-term sustainability and success of New Hampshire’s higher education systems. Participants highlighted the potential benefits of the merger, including cost savings, increased efficiency, and expanded opportunities for students, while acknowledging the challenges of integrating two large systems. The governor’s proposal represents a forward-looking approach to reimagining higher education in New Hampshire, with a focus on affordability, accessibility, and alignment with the state’s workforce needs.
