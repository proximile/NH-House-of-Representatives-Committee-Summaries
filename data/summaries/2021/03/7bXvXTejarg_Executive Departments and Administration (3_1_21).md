**Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Executive Departments and Administration (March 1, 2021)**

On March 1, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting focused on revising the governor's emergency powers and addressing related legislation, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussions centered on balancing executive authority with legislative oversight, protecting constitutional rights, and ensuring effective emergency management. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and points from the meeting:

---

### **1. Constitutional Concerns and Emergency Powers**
Representatives engaged in a robust debate about the constitutionality of the governor's emergency powers, particularly the ability to issue executive orders that carry the force of law. Some members referenced Supreme Court rulings to argue that emergency services, such as police, have no constitutional duty to protect individuals, emphasizing their general function rather than specific obligations. This led to broader discussions about the separation of powers and the need to ensure that the governor's emergency authority does not override the legislative process.

### **2. Legislative Oversight and Checks on Executive Authority**
A recurring theme was the desire to introduce greater legislative oversight of the governor's emergency powers. Multiple bills were discussed to achieve this goal:
- **HB 275** (introduced by Representative Greg Huff) proposed requiring the legislature or executive council to renew a state of emergency, adding conditions for extensions, and creating a "nominal state of emergency" to maintain federal funding while limiting executive powers.
- **HB 417** (introduced by Representative Roy) suggested a 30-day emergency declaration period, renewable only with legislative approval for subsequent executive orders.
- **HB 433** (introduced by Representative Andrew Prout) aimed to involve the legislature in approving long-term states of emergency, setting a 42-day limit for initial declarations and requiring legislative approval for extensions.

These bills reflected a shared concern that the governor's ability to unilaterally extend states of emergency could undermine democratic accountability. However, practical concerns were raised about the feasibility of legislative involvement during crises, especially when convening in person is difficult.

### **3. Evacuation Orders and Emergency Services**
The committee also addressed emergency evacuation policies:
- **HB 414** (introduced by Representative Leus) proposed changing the language in evacuation orders from "compel" to "recommend," emphasizing individual choice. It also stipulated that emergency services are not required to assist individuals who initially refuse to evacuate but later change their minds.
- Representatives debated the implications of these changes, including the potential risks to first responders and the moral versus legal obligations of emergency services.

---

### **4. Federal Funding and Practical Considerations**
A significant concern was the potential impact of legislative changes on federal funding. Discussions highlighted the importance of maintaining eligibility for federal aid, particularly from FEMA, during emergencies. Some members cautioned against creating a "nominal state of emergency" that might not be recognized by federal agencies, potentially jeopardizing funding for disaster recovery and other critical programs.

---

### **5. Philosophical and Practical Debates**
The meeting included both philosophical and practical debates about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches:
- Some representatives argued that the governor's emergency powers should not override the legislative process, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a republic where laws are created by the legislature.
- Others acknowledged the need for swift executive action during crises but stressed the importance of ensuring that such actions are subject to legislative review and approval.

### **6. Testimony and Stakeholder Input**
Justin Kates, Director of Emergency Management for the city of Nashua, testified against HB 275, highlighting the need for rapid emergency responses and expressing concerns about the bill's potential impact on disaster recovery and federal funding. His testimony underscored the challenges of balancing executive authority with legislative oversight.

### **7. Future Preparedness and Collaboration**
The committee acknowledged the need to prepare for future emergencies, including pandemics, natural disasters, and potential incidents like nuclear emergencies or wildfires. They emphasized the importance of collaboration with other legislative committees to avoid redundancy and ensure alignment in addressing overlapping issues.

---

### **8. Next Steps**
The committee planned to hold work sessions to review and amend the proposed bills, focusing on incorporating oversight mechanisms and addressing long-term emergencies. They scheduled their next meeting for March 4th to continue deliberations.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a thoughtful and bipartisan effort to balance the need for effective emergency response with democratic accountability. Representatives across the political spectrum agreed on the importance of legislative involvement in emergency decisions, while also addressing practical challenges and constitutional concerns. The discussions underscored the complexity of revising emergency powers and the need for careful consideration of both immediate and long-term implications.
