**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division II, Safety Meeting (2/22/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division II, Safety meeting on February 22, 2021, focused on budgetary requests, operational needs, and strategic adjustments for the Department of Safety, including its various divisions. The meeting featured detailed presentations by Commissioner Robert Quinn and Director of Administration Steve Lavoy, who outlined the challenges and priorities for fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Key discussions centered on funding gaps, unfunded positions, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public safety services. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

### **Department of Safety Overview**
The Department of Safety’s mission is to enhance safety, security, and quality of life in New Hampshire through professional and innovative services. The governor’s recommended budget for FY 2022 is $203.5 million (a 5% increase over FY 2021), and $209.3 million for FY 2023 (a 3% increase over FY 2022). Despite these increases, the department faces significant funding challenges due to declines in general funds (7.1%), turnpike funds (9.7%), and highway funds (11.5%), driven by reduced revenues and increased costs in salaries, benefits, equipment replacement, and IT infrastructure.

### **Key Divisions and Budget Requests**
1. **Forensics and Lab Positions**:
   - Nine positions in forensics (CODIS and the talks lab) are needed to meet service demands and avoid delays in court deadlines. Vacancies in the forensic lab could impact evidence processing for narcotics, firearms, and digital evidence.

2. **Civilian Positions**:
   - Six existing civilian positions are essential for administrative support and direct public safety services. Shifting these duties to troopers is undesirable and could strain resources.

3. **Vehicle Replacement Plan**:
   - An additional $1.5 million in FY22 and $1.6 million in FY23 is requested to fund 28 cruisers. The State Police are transitioning to all-wheel drive vehicles, particularly for snowy conditions and the north country.

4. **Detective Bureau**:
   - Additional funding ($150,000 annually) is requested to meet demands for investigative services, particularly for major crime investigations.

5. **Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM)**:
   - HSEM coordinates the state’s response to disasters. The FY22 budget request is $17.1 million, a 63.9% increase from FY21, largely due to anticipated disaster-related expenses, including COVID-19.

6. **Emergency Services and Communications**:
   - This division oversees the statewide 9-1-1 system. The FY22 budget request is $16.7 million, a 3.2% increase from FY21, supported by the 911 fund.

7. **Fire Standards and Training and EMS**:
   - This division trains and certifies emergency responders. The FY22 budget request is $8.2 million, a 5% decrease from FY21, due to reduced part-time salaries and increased online training.

8. **Fire Safety**:
   - This division focuses on fire prevention and safety. The FY22 budget request is $4.5 million, a 14.9% decrease from FY21, due to the transfer of the mechanical licensing function to another office.

### **Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**
- **Mission**: Enhance public safety on roadways by ensuring proper credentialing of drivers, vehicles, and service providers while providing efficient customer service.
- **COVID-19 Adaptations**: The DMV shifted to an appointment-based system, reducing walk-ins and improving efficiency.
- **Budget Requests**:
  - FY 2022: $28.1 million (a 7.6% decrease from FY 2021).
  - FY 2023: $29.1 million (a 3.3% increase from FY 2022).
  - Decreases are due to unfunded positions, reduced part-time funding, and decreased operating costs.
- **Unfunded Positions**: Sixteen unfunded positions may lead to delays in driver licensing, registrations, and title processing.
- **Online Services**: The DMV is migrating more services online, improving efficiency and customer service.

### **Division of State Police**
- **Mission**: Enforce criminal, motor vehicle, and public safety laws statewide.
- **Budget Requests**:
  - FY 2022: $96.5 million (a 12.9% increase from FY 2021).
  - FY 2023: $99.8 million (a 3.5% increase from FY 2022).
  - Increases are due to salary and benefit increments, operating costs, and training expenses.
- **Unfunded Positions**: Twenty-three unfunded troopers and 15 unfunded civilian positions could impact operations.
- **LEE Act Implementation**: Includes body and cruiser cameras, digital evidence management, and increased training costs. The estimated cost for body and cruiser cameras is $1 million annually, including three new positions to manage the program.
- **Marine Patrol**: Two new federally funded positions are added to meet demands for services on the seacoast.
- **Dispatch Services**: Emergency dispatch operations between Fish and Game and State Police are formally unified, moving from part-time to full-time dispatching.
- **Training and Mental Health**: Increased training and psychological support for SWAT teams and other specialized units.

### **Funding Challenges and Strategic Adjustments**
- **Unfunded Positions**: The department has 50 unfunded full-time positions (9 of which are currently filled), which could lead to delays in scheduling, increased caseloads, and potential risks to meeting statutory deadlines.
- **Budget Adjustments**: The budget includes shifting some general-funded services to dedicated funds, reducing operating costs, and prioritizing critical areas.
- **Technology Investments**: Significant funding is required for body and cruiser cameras, digital evidence systems, and online services.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with discussions on prioritizing personnel and vehicle needs, ensuring efficient service delivery, and addressing staffing and budgetary constraints. Representatives requested hard copies of presentations for better reference during budget discussions and expressed appreciation for the detailed presentations. Further discussions on funding allocations and strategic priorities will continue in subsequent meetings. The Department of Safety remains committed to maintaining public safety services despite financial challenges and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
