### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division II Meeting (March 12, 2021)

The NH House of Representatives Finance - Division II meeting on March 12, 2021, focused on the financial, operational, and strategic challenges facing New Hampshire’s higher education systems, particularly the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH). The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, addressed declining enrollment, rising financial pressures, and the proposed merger of the two systems. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Demographic and Financial Challenges**
Both USNH and CCSNH are grappling with significant challenges driven by demographic shifts and financial strains:
- **Declining Enrollment**: The traditional college-age population in the Northeast is shrinking, with projections indicating a worsening trend, particularly for two-year colleges. This decline threatens enrollment and revenue, especially for lower-tier institutions as elite schools attract top students.
- **Rising Financial Need**: The remaining student pool increasingly consists of lower-income and minority populations, requiring higher financial aid. Simultaneously, schools are engaged in price wars to attract students, further straining budgets.
- **High Tuition and Low State Support**: New Hampshire has some of the highest public university tuition rates in the country, exacerbated by relatively low state funding per student. This makes it difficult for public institutions to compete with out-of-state schools offering better financial aid packages.
- **Revenue Crisis**: Both systems are experiencing declining net revenue due to rising financial aid costs, shrinking state support, and reduced enrollment. Cost-cutting measures, such as early retirement programs, benefits restructuring, and IT consolidation, have been implemented to reduce expenses.

### **2. Community College System (CCSNH)**
CCSNH plays a critical role in workforce training and serving non-traditional students:
- **Student Demographics**: The majority of CCSNH students are 21 or older and often work part-time while attending school.
- **Cost-Saving Measures**: CCSNH has reduced costs through shared services, centralized operations, and efficient technology use. Minimal tuition increases have been implemented to maintain affordability.
- **Programs and Partnerships**: CCSNH collaborates with industry sectors, offers apprenticeship grants, and aligns programs with workforce needs.
- **Student Support**: The system has introduced food pantries, transportation assistance, and other supports to help students during the pandemic.

### **3. University System of New Hampshire (USNH)**
USNH faces similar challenges but with a focus on traditional four-year degrees:
- **Strategic Focus**: USNH is addressing demographic declines by focusing on differentiated programs, employer partnerships, and financial sustainability.
- **Cost-Cutting Measures**: USNH has implemented measures to reduce expenses by 10% by 2023, including IT consolidation and restructuring employee benefits.

### **4. Shared Initiatives and Collaboration**
Both systems have emphasized collaboration to improve efficiency and reduce costs:
- **Technology Platforms**: Shared platforms like Canvas, Kaltura, and Zoom have been adopted to streamline operations.
- **Open Educational Resources (OER)**: OER initiatives have saved students nearly $1 million in textbook costs over two years.
- **Federal Funding**: Both systems are leveraging federal funding to support students and operations.

### **5. Proposed Merger of USNH and CCSNH**
The proposed merger was a central topic of discussion, with arguments for and against the consolidation:
- **Rationale for Merger**: The merger is seen as a way to address financial challenges, declining enrollment, and inefficiencies in the state’s higher education system. It could help institutions like Plymouth and Keene State survive, which might struggle as standalone entities.
- **Concerns About Community Colleges**: There is significant concern about preserving the unique mission of community colleges, which serve diverse, non-traditional, and lower-income populations. Participants worry that the community college voice could be overshadowed in a merged system.
- **Board Structure**: The proposed merger includes a new board structure with balanced representation from USNH, CCSNH, and at-large members selected by the governor.
- **Financial and Administrative Challenges**: The merger would require careful planning, external support, and significant resources. Pension liability is a major concern, with calls for state assistance to address unfunded liabilities.
- **Timeline and Implementation**: The merger is expected to take several years to implement fully. A clear roadmap and stakeholder involvement are essential to avoid rushed decisions that could harm students and faculty.
- **Legislative Role**: The legislature’s support through funding and enabling legislation is critical to the merger’s success.

### **6. Future Challenges and Strategic Planning**
Both systems are at the beginning of a long-term structural change in higher education, with challenges expected to persist through the mid-2020s:
- **Strategic Planning**: Strong governance, collaboration, and differentiated programs are essential to navigate declining enrollment and financial pressures.
- **Workforce Alignment**: Both systems are working to align programs with the state’s workforce needs, ensuring graduates are prepared for in-demand jobs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the urgent need for strategic changes in New Hampshire’s higher education systems to address declining enrollment, rising financial pressures, and the need for greater efficiency. The proposed merger of USNH and CCSNH remains a contentious issue, with some advocating for a more gradual approach to ensure the unique missions of both systems are preserved. Collaboration, careful planning, and legislative support will be critical to ensuring the sustainability and relevance of higher education in New Hampshire.
