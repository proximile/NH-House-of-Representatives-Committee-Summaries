### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 106 (Net Metering Cap Expansion)**:
   - **Primary Focus**: The committee debated whether to raise the net metering cap from **1 megawatt (MW)** to **2 MW**, **3 MW**, or **5 MW** for municipalities. This issue dominated the meeting, with significant discussion on the potential benefits and drawbacks of expanding net metering.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that raising the cap would promote renewable energy development, reduce energy costs for municipalities, create jobs, and support New Hampshire’s energy independence. They highlighted the economic and environmental benefits of solar and hydroelectric projects.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents expressed worries about cost-shifting to non-net metering ratepayers, the sustainability of subsidies, and the need for further study. Some suggested limiting the expansion to hydroelectric projects, viewed as more stable and cost-effective.
   - **Amendments and Compromise**: Multiple amendments were proposed, with **Representative Callie Pitts** advocating for a **3 MW cap** as a middle ground. Discussions also explored allowing contiguous municipalities to share energy resources, though concerns about potential disputes were raised.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **11-10** to **retain** the bill for further study, with plans to revisit the proposed amendments to seek a compromise that avoids contentious floor debates.

2. **Other Bills Discussed**:
   - **HB 172 (Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Goals)**: The committee voted to retain the bill, reflecting divided opinions on the urgency of climate action. Some members emphasized the need for immediate action, while others favored further study.
   - **HB 167 (Net Energy Metering)**: The committee voted **11-10** to retain the bill, continuing the broader discussion on net metering policies.
   - **HB 153 (Universal Internet Access Study Committee)**: The committee voted **17-3** to retain the bill, with plans to form a subcommittee to study the issue further.
   - **HB 315 (Energy Policy)**: The committee passed an amendment to correct typos in the bill, which was then approved without opposition.
   - **HB 213 (Energy Subsidies)**: The committee voted to retain the bill, citing concerns about its potential negative impact on industries like timber and forestry and the likelihood of Senate rejection.
   - **HB 148 (Municipal Hydroelectric Facilities)**: The committee voted **18-2** to retain the bill, which allows increased net metering limits for municipal hydroelectric projects.
   - **HB 394 (Carbon Pricing Study Commission)**: The committee voted **11-10** to retain the bill, reflecting significant disagreement over the need for proactive climate policy.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**

1. **Retention vs. Action**: The committee frequently debated whether to retain bills for further study or take immediate action. Many members expressed frustration that retention delays progress, while others argued that thorough deliberation is necessary to craft effective policies.
2. **Compromise**: Throughout the discussions, members emphasized the importance of finding middle ground to address stakeholder concerns and avoid contentious floor debates, particularly on HB 106.
3. **Time Constraints**: The committee faced tight deadlines to process bills before the April 8 crossover date, compounded by scheduling challenges and Zoom license limitations.
4. **Climate and Energy Policy**: The meeting highlighted differing views on the urgency of addressing climate change, the role of science in policymaking, and the economic impacts of energy and climate legislation. Some members advocated for immediate action, while others preferred a cautious, data-driven approach.
5. **Stakeholder Involvement**: There were calls for input from stakeholders, including the Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI), to help shape balanced and effective policies.

### **Post-Meeting Plans**

The committee planned to reconvene for a work session to further discuss HB 106 and explore potential compromises on the net metering cap. The goal was to craft a version of the bill that could move forward without generating a floor fight. Additionally, the committee outlined plans to address other retained bills in future sessions.
