The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 20, 2021, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, covered a wide range of topics across executive departments, administration, and commerce. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Emergency Orders and Legislative Oversight**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on **House Bill 417**, which seeks to establish legislative oversight of the governor's emergency orders. Representatives debated the balance between granting the governor flexibility during emergencies and ensuring legislative accountability, particularly in prolonged crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed amendments included extending the initial emergency period from 21 to 30 days and requiring legislative approval for extended emergencies. There was also discussion about involving the Fiscal Committee in decisions related to emergency funds. Additionally, **House Bill 275** was retained for further review, as it pertains to the governor's power to initiate and extend states of emergency, with concerns raised about potential overreach.

### **Audit Findings and Reforms**
The meeting included a presentation on the performance audit of the **New Hampshire Liquor Commission's Division of Enforcement and Licensing** for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The audit revealed systemic management control deficiencies, including inconsistent rule implementation and unresolved issues from previous audits. Of the 47 recommendations made, management concurred with 44 and partially concurred with 3. Key areas of concern included the complexity of licensing controls, inefficiencies in enforcement activities, and issues with the Direct Shipper Program for out-of-state alcohol purchases. The Liquor Commission acknowledged the findings and outlined a plan to address them, with 80% of the issues partially or fully resolved. Legislative changes may be required to simplify licensing structures and address statutory complexities.

### **Regulatory and Jurisdictional Concerns**
Representatives raised concerns about the Liquor Commission's jurisdictional enforcement and the need for clarity in statutes to avoid overregulation while ensuring public safety. The Commission emphasized a focus on education and compliance rather than strict enforcement, aiming to create a safe environment for licensees and the public.

### **Bills and Resolutions**
- **House Bill 433**: The committee voted to expedite legislation limiting the renewal of states of emergency.
- **Senate Bill 105**: This bill was discussed in three parts:
  - **State Song**: A proposal to adopt "My 603" as New Hampshireâ€™s 11th state song sparked debate over copyright issues and the necessity of adding another state song.
  - **Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day**: While supported, some members felt it was redundant given existing federal recognition.
  - **Solar Eclipse Day**: Broad support was expressed for designating April 8, 2024, as Solar Eclipse Day, with emphasis on the economic and educational opportunities it presents. An amendment was passed to focus solely on the solar eclipse day, removing the state song and awareness day sections.
- **House Bill 187**: An amendment was proposed to clarify the process for suspending emergency orders by the commissioner until legislative action is taken. The amendment was adopted, and the amended bill passed.

### **Procedural and Legal Discussions**
The meeting included detailed procedural discussions about handling amendments, voting order, and the potential for future bills to be added to the calendar. There was also debate about the legal and procedural implications of legislative oversight, including the need for joint resolutions and the role of the Fiscal Committee in emergency fund approvals.

### **Economic and Educational Opportunities**
The committee emphasized the importance of planning for the **total solar eclipse** on April 8, 2024, which is expected to attract significant visitor interest. Discussions highlighted the need for safe viewing practices, logistical planning, and involvement of local businesses to capitalize on the event.

### **Employee Compensation and Sales Tracking**
The meeting briefly touched on issues related to employee compensation and tracking out-of-state sales, particularly regarding cash transactions and IRS requirements for large cash purchases.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the legislature's efforts to balance executive authority with legislative oversight, particularly in emergencies, while addressing audit findings and regulatory concerns. Key outcomes included the advancement of bills related to emergency oversight, the adoption of amendments to streamline legislation, and a focus on leveraging economic and educational opportunities like the upcoming solar eclipse. The Liquor Commission audit highlighted the need for improved management controls and legislative action to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in enforcement and licensing.
