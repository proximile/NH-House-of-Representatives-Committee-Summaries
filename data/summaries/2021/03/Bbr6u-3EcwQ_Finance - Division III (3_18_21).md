The meeting was conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with public access provided via Zoom and telephone. Key themes included budget neutrality, transparency, and flexibility in managing state funds, especially in the context of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other critical programs. Below is a cohesive summary of the meetingâ€™s key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

#### **1. Sununu Center and DHHS Funding**
   - **Sununu Center**: Representatives discussed potential amendments related to the Sununu Center, though no specific amendments were drafted. Concerns were raised about budget cuts and the need for DHHS to establish new accounting units if changes were accepted. The base funding amount for the Sununu Center in HB1 was also questioned, with clarification sought on whether it was $12.5 million, $14.5 million, or another figure.
   - **Section 41 (HB2)**: This section involves the transfer of the Controlled Drug Prescription Health and Safety Program to DHHS. It was noted that this would require DHHS to create new accounting codes, but the program would remain budget-neutral. Historical legislative decisions against such a transfer were also mentioned, with additional context expected from Representative McGuire.

#### **2. County Cap and Budget Adjustments**
   - **Section 24 (HB2)**: Discussions centered on proposals to adjust the rate of increase for certain line items, with potential amendments to cap future growth at 3%.
   - **Section 25 (HB2)**: This section was deemed potentially redundant due to upcoming RSA language effective July 1, leading to considerations for its deletion.

#### **3. Veterans Home and Child Care Funding**
   - **Veterans Home Sections (106-110, HB2)**: These sections, submitted by the Veterans Home, were accepted despite some internal redundancy, as they were deemed harmless and provided necessary flexibility.
   - **Employment-Related Child Care**: Representative Wallner proposed an amendment to safeguard child care funding by allowing transfers from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reserve fund if needed, ensuring no wait lists for low-income families. Suggestions were made to adjust the language to avoid a "blank check" scenario and incorporate federal regulations.

#### **4. Non-General Fund Accounts**
   - Representatives reviewed 32 line items that do not use general funds, with plans to accept them into the Division III budget proposal.

#### **5. Transparency and Reporting Requirements**
   - **Section 33 (HB2)**: The committee debated a reporting requirement for transferring or using general funds, particularly in the context of federal funds supplanting state dollars. The amendment aimed to increase transparency and accountability. The committee voted unanimously (7-0) to accept the proposed amendment.

#### **6. Operational and Capital Expenses**
   - **Section 38 (HB2)**: The committee considered deleting this section, which involves funding for ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) transactions in healthcare. Members discussed whether this should be moved to HB1, as it pertains to an ongoing operational expense. The decision was deferred pending further input from Mr. Watters and DHHS.
   - **Section 39 (HB2)**: The committee voted unanimously to delete this section, which involved bonding for capital projects, and suggested holding a public information session in April to gather more input.

#### **7. Reproductive Health and A&M Study**
   - **Section 34 (HB2)**: Representative Erica Leon was expected to introduce an amendment related to reproductive health facilities, with detailed discussions planned for the following day.
   - **Section 35 (HB2)**: The committee reviewed a $10 million allocation for an A&M study, questioning whether the funding was justified based on the study's findings. The discussion was postponed until A&M representatives could provide an overview.

#### **8. Senior Citizen Grants and Parental Reimbursement**
   - **Section 37 (HB2)**: The committee examined grants for senior citizens, questioning whether this was a new or existing program and whether the funding should be classified as capital or operational. Further clarification from the governor's office was requested.
   - **Sections 30 and 31 (HB2)**: These sections pertain to the termination of parental reimbursement obligations for child services. The department explained that the program was no longer cost-effective and had been discontinued. The proposed changes would retroactively stop the program from July 1, 2020, and allow the department to petition the court to stop existing enforcement orders.

#### **9. Flexibility in Budget Management**
   - **Section 26 (HB2)**: This section allows DHHS to transfer funds from personnel lines to other areas. The committee debated whether to keep this flexibility, with DHHS advocating for its importance in managing budgets, especially during crises. The expiration date for this authority was also discussed, with the governor's office proposing January 1, 2023, instead of the traditional biennium end date of June 30, 2023. Further clarification was sought.
