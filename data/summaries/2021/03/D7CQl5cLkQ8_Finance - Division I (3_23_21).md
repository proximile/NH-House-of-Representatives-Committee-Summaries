### **Key Discussions and Amendments**

#### **1. Family Leave Plan**
The committee discussed and passed **Amendment 2021-080h** to HB2, which adjusted the timeline for the family leave plan to the last six months of the biennium. This primarily involved date changes to align with the state’s fiscal calendar.

#### **2. Energy-Related Amendments**
The committee reviewed and passed **Amendment 2021-0917h**, an extensive energy-related amendment that:
- Renamed divisions and clarified authorities within the Department of Energy.
- Made technical corrections to the Site Evaluation Committee and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
- Abolished vacant or redundant positions within the Department of Energy and the PUC.

#### **3. IT Consolidation**
A proposal to consolidate IT funding streams into a single accounting unit (1891) was discussed. The committee viewed this as a way to better allocate costs across funding streams. While there was no opposition, further action was expected in the Senate.

#### **4. Business and Tax Reforms**
- **Business Tax Reduction**: The committee unanimously supported amendments to reduce the amount of tax businesses may owe, which was included in HB2.
- **Interest and Dividend Tax**: The committee debated phasing out the interest and dividend tax by December 31, 2026. The vote was split, with some members opposing the reduction.
- **Rooms and Meals Tax**: A proposal to lower the rooms and meals tax was met with mixed support, with some members arguing it could be counterintuitive and harmful.
- **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**: The committee voted to reduce the BET rate from 0.0675 to 0.55, passing with some opposition.

#### **5. Department of Administrative Services (DAS) Funding**
The committee unanimously approved funding for several unfunded positions within DAS, including administrative supervisors, purchasing assistants, and internal auditors.

#### **6. Parole Board Digital Transition**
Funding was approved for the Parole Board to transition to a more digital environment, including necessary equipment and networking hardware. This was unanimously supported.

#### **7. Law Enforcement Accountability Commission (LEAC)**
The committee removed funding for the LEAC, deeming it premature and incorrectly budgeted. A study committee is determining the commission’s future, and funding will be reconsidered if needed.

#### **8. Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA)**
The committee approved transferring the Office of Planning and Development from the Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI) to the BEA.

#### **9. Reorganization of Funds and Positions**
- **Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Department of Energy**: The committee debated moving administrative support positions from the PUC to the Department of Energy. A vacant administrator position in the Site Evaluation Committee was unfunded, saving approximately $250,000.
- **Gas Pipeline Safety Program**: A significant discussion focused on retaining the Gas Pipeline Safety Program within the PUC rather than transferring it to the Department of Energy. Concerns about losing expertise led to the amendment being voted down (5-2).

#### **10. Business Profits Tax Credit Amendment**
An amendment proposed by Representative Major addressed the business profits tax credit carry forward, replacing sections 102-105 in HB2. This amendment, unanimously approved by the Ways and Means Committee, introduced changes to tax credit limits for different taxable periods, with gradual reductions in allowable credits over time.

#### **11. Mercury Analyzer Amendment**
A $55,000 amendment for a mercury analyzer for the Department of Environmental Services was voted down due to lack of communication from the commissioner and absence in the original budget.
