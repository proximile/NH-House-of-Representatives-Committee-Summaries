### **Health and Human Services Programs**
1. **Legacy System Upgrades and Maintenance**:  
   - The state faces risks of losing federal certification for the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) if outdated systems are not upgraded. Vendors like IBM and Oracle have announced they will no longer support older systems.  
   - Estimated costs: $12.5 million in FY22 and $13.1 million in FY23.  
   - The upgrades aim to improve care coordination, reduce emergency department visits, and avoid CMS decertification penalties.  

2. **Critical Time Intervention (CTI)**:  
   - CTI helps individuals transition from psychiatric hospitals back into their communities by providing housing, employment, and healthcare support.  
   - Expected outcomes: A 26% reduction in hospital readmissions and annual savings of $1.3 million for every $1 million spent.  

3. **Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs)**:  
   - Funding adjustments include shifting some costs to Medicaid through bundled rates for services like Assertive Community Treatment (ACT).  
   - Projected savings: $1.7 million annually.  

4. **4e Funding Improvements**:  
   - The state identified inefficiencies in 4e funding claiming rates and developed processes to improve them.  
   - Anticipated ROI: $2 million to $4 million annually in general funds.

### **Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities**
1. **Medicaid Reimbursement and Bundled Rates**:  
   - Efforts are underway to bundle services to make them Medicaid-reimbursable, shifting costs from the general fund to Medicaid.  

2. **IMD Waiver Expansion**:  
   - The state aims to expand the IMD waiver to include serious mental illness (SMI) alongside substance use disorder (SUD), enabling Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient behavioral health care.  
   - Goal: Reduce emergency department boarding and improve crisis care.  

3. **Developmental Disabilities System Redesign**:  
   - The system is being modernized to address inequities, with updates to reimbursement rates, waiver redesign, and IT infrastructure improvements.  
   - Focus: Better utilization management and aligning services with individual needs.  

4. **Intensive Treatment Services (ITS)**:  
   - Plans are in place to bring individuals with complex needs back to New Hampshire from out-of-state placements by building in-state infrastructure (e.g., specialized group homes) and partnering with private providers.  

5. **Emergency Department Boarding**:  
   - The state is addressing the issue by increasing throughput in the system, including expanding inpatient capacity and community-based services like mobile crisis teams and transitional housing.

### **Abortion Funding and Provider Regulations**
1. **Abortion Funding**:  
   - Representatives debated a proposed amendment that would restrict healthcare providers from discussing abortion with patients.  
   - Planned Parenthood’s representative, Kayla Montgomery, opposed the amendment, calling it a "gag rule" that mirrors the Trump administration’s Title X restrictions.  
   - Concerns were raised about the impact on access to care for vulnerable populations during the pandemic.  

2. **Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)**:  
   - $12.5 million in general funds was proposed for FY22 and FY23 to support MMIS operations and upgrades.  
   - Concerns were raised about the department’s ability to efficiently implement large IT systems, given past challenges.  
   - David Weeders, Information Services Director, and Commissioner Dennis Boule assured the committee that the department is well-positioned to manage the project, with a strong team and long-term plan in place.

### **Staffing and Project Readiness**
1. **IT Staffing Challenges**:  
   - The department acknowledged difficulties in hiring and onboarding IT staff due to the complexity of the project and the pandemic.  
   - Plans include hiring additional project managers and an MMIS director to support reprocurement and implementation.  

2. **Funding Adjustments**:  
   - The committee discussed whether the $12.5 million general fund allocation for MMIS in FY22 is appropriate, given potential delays in staffing and project readiness.  
   - The funding covers contracts with Conduent and NTT Data, deferred maintenance, and infrastructure upgrades.
