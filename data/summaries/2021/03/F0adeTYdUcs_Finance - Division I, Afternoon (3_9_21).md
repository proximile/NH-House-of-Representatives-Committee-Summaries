The transcript captures a portion of a New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division I meeting held on March 9, 2021. The discussion primarily focused on the budget and operations of the **New Hampshire Human Rights Commission (HRC)** and included the following key points:

1. **Human Rights Commission Overview**:  
   - The HRC, established in 1965, aims to eliminate discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodation, and education.  
   - It comprises seven volunteer commissioners appointed by the governor and collaborates with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws.  
   - The commission investigates complaints, conducts research, and engages in community outreach.  

2. **Budget Requests**:  
   - The HRC requested funding to reinstate positions, including an **administrative assistant** and a **part-time intake coordinator**, as well as shared costs for the Department of Information Technology (DoIT).  
   - A proposed new position would focus on creating and administering training programs, which generate revenue for the general fund.  

3. **Funding Details**:  
   - The HRC’s budget is approximately **85% general funds**, with the remaining 15% from contracts with the EEOC.  
   - The budget adjustments reflected pandemic-related constraints, with reduced general fund usage due to unfilled positions.  

4. **Questions and Clarifications**:  
   - Representatives inquired about the HRC’s funding sources, including income from training programs and document duplication fees.  
   - The commission clarified that while they provide training (e.g., sexual harassment training) upon request, they do not project specific income from these activities.  

5. **Budget Approval**:  
   - The HRC’s budget, as presented by the governor, was unanimously approved by the committee.  

6. **Other Agenda Items**:  
   - The committee discussed and approved **Section 56** of HB2, allowing the Department of Corrections to transfer funds to cover overtime costs.  
   - They also approved **Section 75**, which allocates $250,000 annually to the New Hampshire Internet Crimes Against Children Fund, administered by the Portsmouth Police Department.  

The meeting concluded with updates on upcoming public hearings and plans to address additional amendments in future sessions.
