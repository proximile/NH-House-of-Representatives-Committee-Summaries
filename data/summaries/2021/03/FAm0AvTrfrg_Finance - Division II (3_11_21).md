**Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II Meeting (March 11, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened on March 11, 2021, to discuss the state's transportation budget and operations for fiscal years 2022 and 2023. The meeting, held electronically under the governor's emergency order due to the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on the Department of Transportation (DOT) budget, revenue projections, and the challenges of maintaining infrastructure amid fiscal uncertainties. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Budget Overview and Adjustments**
The committee reviewed adjustments to the highway fund, emphasizing the need to balance expenditures with revenue projections. Key areas of focus included:
- **Winter Maintenance Costs**: Reductions in winter maintenance expenses were considered to align with lower road toll and motor vehicle fee estimates.
- **Revenue Projections**: Discussions centered on the impact of reduced revenues from road tolls, motor vehicle fees, and federal gas taxes on construction and maintenance programs, particularly paving and bridge work. Concerns were raised about the highway fund's ability to cover unexpected costs, such as severe winter maintenance, and the potential for future deficits.
- **Unfunded Positions**: The DOT requested flexibility to manage unfunded positions, especially as the state transitions to electronic tolling, allowing for more efficient resource allocation.

### **Infrastructure and Maintenance**
The committee addressed several infrastructure-related issues:
- **Truck Impact on Roads**: The significant damage caused by heavy trucks on roadways was highlighted, with discussions on revenue from overweight permits and its relation to road maintenance costs.
- **Lift Bridge Operations**: Plans for potential replacements and operational impacts of lift bridges in Portsmouth and Hampton were reviewed.
- **Bridge Maintenance**: The budget for bridge maintenance, including the impact of reduced funding on activities like bridge washing, was discussed.
- **Salt Impact on Wells**: The DOTâ€™s program to replace residential wells contaminated by road salt, a statutory requirement, was addressed. The program typically replaces 3-4 wells annually.
- **Graffiti Removal**: A representative inquired about the budget for graffiti removal, noting an increase in graffiti and its impact on the state's appearance.

### **Aeronautics, Rail, and Public Transit**
The committee reviewed federal funding for airports, the state's bus replacement program, and the impact of the pandemic on public transit ridership. The Capital Corridor Project, aimed at improving rail service from Manchester to Boston, was also discussed.

### **Federal Compliance and Funding**
The Office of Federal Compliance, which ensures DOT adherence to federal guidelines, was discussed, with its funding shifted from highway funds to federal funds. The committee also explored potential federal funding from the CARES Act and other relief bills, emphasizing the need for an infrastructure package to address long-term funding challenges.

### **Future Projects and Legislative Considerations**
Ongoing and future projects, such as the Spaulding Turnpike widening and all-electronic tolling, were discussed, along with their budgetary implications. The committee considered amendments to House Bill 2 (HB2) related to transportation safety and unfunded positions, with plans to draft language for future review.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of managing the state's transportation budget amid revenue uncertainties and the pandemic's financial impact. Representatives acknowledged the DOT's efforts to maintain financial control and advocate for federal assistance while addressing infrastructure needs. The discussions highlighted the importance of strategic budgeting, federal funding, and proactive planning to ensure the sustainability of New Hampshire's transportation systems.
