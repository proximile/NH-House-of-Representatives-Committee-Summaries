**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division I Meeting (March 16, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division I, convened on March 16, 2021, to address a range of budget and legislative matters. The meeting was held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone. Key discussions and decisions focused on the state’s biennial budget, particularly House Bill 2 (HB2), as well as amendments to various programs and funding allocations. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

### **1. Voluntary Paid Family and Medical Leave Program**
A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing the proposed **voluntary paid family and medical leave program** under HB2. Key details include:
- **Program Overview**: The program aims to provide **60% wage replacement** for up to **six weeks per year**, covering events such as childbirth, adoption, care for a family member with a serious health condition, or military-related exigencies. State employees are automatically covered, while private employers and individuals can opt in.
- **Funding and Premiums**: The program is funded through a **premium stabilization trust fund**, supported by insurance premium taxes. Individual premiums are capped at **$5 per week**, with employers able to choose how much of the premium to cover.
- **Implementation**: The program is set to be operational by **July 1, 2022**, with a **request for proposals (RFP)** to be issued by **September 30, 2021**. The Department of Administrative Services (DAS) will oversee the program, and an advisory board will address administration and eligibility.
- **Concerns**: Committee members raised questions about **enforcement mechanisms**, particularly for employees of smaller businesses (fewer than 20 employees), and potential **fraud or misuse**. Concerns about **cost overruns** and premium stability were addressed through the premium stabilization fund and the RFP process.
- **Tax Credits**: Participating businesses can claim a **50% tax credit** against their **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)** liability.

### **2. Rainy Day Fund Amendment**
The committee unanimously approved an amendment to raise the cap on the state’s **Revenue Stabilization Reserve Account (Rainy Day Fund)** from **10% of a single fiscal year’s unrestricted general fund revenue** to **10% of the biennium’s revenue**. This change aims to enhance the state’s financial stability during crises.

### **3. Rooms and Meals Tax Distribution**
The committee voted to **suspend a portion of the Rooms and Meals Tax revenue** allocated to the Division of Travel and Tourism Development for the biennium ending June 30, 2023. While some members expressed concerns about the impact on the hospitality industry, the motion passed unanimously.

### **4. Department of Corrections Funding**
Two amendments were approved to restore funding for transitional housing programs within the Department of Corrections:
- **Shea Farm Program**: Funding was restored for transitional housing at Shea Farm.
- **Manchester Transitional Housing**: Funding was also restored for transitional housing in Manchester. Both amendments passed unanimously, with adjustments made within the budget to accommodate these restorations.

### **5. Judiciary Budget and Sheriff Reimbursement**
The committee discussed amendments related to the judiciary budget, particularly the reimbursement of sheriffs for **court security and prisoner transportation**. Concerns were raised about increased costs due to the elimination of video arraignments, leading to more in-person appearances and transportation expenses. Amendments were approved to shift funding responsibility to the judicial branch and encourage the use of technology to reduce costs. These amendments passed unanimously.

### **6. Laconia Property and Redevelopment**
An amendment was approved to grant the governor authority to dispose of property in Laconia, addressing a point of contention with the redevelopment planning commission.

### **7. Small Business Development Center Funding**
Funding for the **Small Business Development Center** was restored to **$225,000 for each year of the biennium**, fulfilling a previous commitment.

### **8. Travel and Tourism Funding**
Funding for **travel and tourism marketing** was reduced to offset other expenses, though it was noted that federal funds from the Biden COVID-19 relief package would likely supplement this area.

### **9. Parole Board Adjustments**
The size of the **Adult Parole Board** was reduced from **nine to five members**, and the annual stipend for board members was lowered from **$30,000 to $20,000**.

### **10. Historic Racing Bill**
A controversial amendment to include **historic racing** in the budget was discussed. While it had passed the Ways and Means Committee with strong support, it faced opposition from some members who noted that similar measures had been rejected by the full legislature in previous years. Despite the opposition, the amendment passed **6-1**.

### **11. Other Amendments**
Various other amendments were discussed and approved, including changes to the Department of Corrections’ budget and the removal of a newly proposed position to save costs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with representatives expressing appreciation for the collaborative efforts to address these issues. A public hearing was scheduled for later that day, with plans to continue work on the budget the following day. The session highlighted the committee’s focus on fiscal responsibility, program implementation, and addressing concerns from various stakeholders.
