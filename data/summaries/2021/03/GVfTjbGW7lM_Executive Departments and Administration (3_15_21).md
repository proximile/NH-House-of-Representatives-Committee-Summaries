The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on **March 15, 2021**, focused on **Executive Departments and Administration**, addressing several key bills and amendments. Conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the meeting highlighted discussions on retirement system reforms, emergency powers, and organizational changes within state agencies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **Retirement System Reforms (House Bill 141 and Amendments)**
1. **Amendment Proposals**:  
   - **Representative Shu** introduced an amendment modeled after **HB 1561 (2020)**, allowing **county chief administrative officers** to opt out of the state retirement system, similar to the exemption already available to municipal administrators.  
   - The amendment was particularly relevant for **Marat County**, where a corrections superintendent (a Group Two public safety employee) was being considered for a county administrator role (a Group One general employee). Moving between groups could result in the loss of benefits like a 50% surviving spouse benefit and medical subsidies.  
   - **Marty Carlin** from the **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)** clarified that municipalities exempting their administrators do not pay the unfunded actuarial liability (UA) for those positions, raising concerns about the potential impact on the retirement system’s financial health.  

2. **Debate and Concerns**:  
   - Representatives debated the fairness of allowing counties to opt out of the retirement system, with concerns about shifting the unfunded liability to other municipalities and the broader pension system.  
   - Specific cases, such as a highly regarded employee in **Merrimack County**, were cited to emphasize the need to retain skilled personnel. However, some expressed concerns about creating exceptions for individuals.  
   - Questions were raised about the legal and procedural implications, including how the exemption would apply to employees transitioning from other roles.  

3. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee acknowledged the need for further refinement of the amendment, particularly regarding language and financial impacts. **Representative Shu** was tasked with drafting a revised amendment for future consideration.  
   - The broader discussion highlighted the need for comprehensive reforms to address the sustainability and fairness of the state retirement system.

### **Emergency Powers and Oversight (House Bill 187)**
1. **Legislative Oversight of DHHS Emergency Orders**:  
   - **Representative William Marsh** introduced **HB 187**, which aims to ensure legislative oversight of emergency orders issued by the **Commissioner of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**.  
   - The bill redefines the **Ethics Committee** to include appointees who can review public health orders, balancing emergency response capabilities with accountability.  
   - **Representative Max Abramson** proposed an alternative mechanism allowing **100 legislators** to object to emergency orders, emphasizing responsiveness to constituent concerns without requiring full legislative sessions.  

2. **Emergency Management and Fiscal Oversight**:  
   - Discussions also touched on the role of the **fiscal committee** in overseeing emergency spending, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
   - Representatives debated the balance between the governor’s executive power and legislative oversight, especially for long-term emergencies, and the challenges of tracking expenses during crises.

### **Organizational Changes (House Bill 533)**
1. **Division of Investigation and Compliance**:  
   - **Representative Patricia Lovejoy** introduced **HB 533**, which establishes a **Division of Investigation and Compliance** within the **Lottery Commission**.  
   - The division would handle background checks and investigations for gaming licenses, collaborating with the **Attorney General’s office** to expedite the licensing process.  
   - **John Conforti**, the Lottery Commission’s chief compliance officer, explained that the bill reorganizes existing staff rather than creating new positions, streamlining oversight of charitable gaming and sports betting.

### **Procedural Discussions and Future Agenda**
1. **Procedural Motions**:  
   - Several procedural motions were made, including motions to reconsider votes on amendments and to retain bills for further discussion.  
   - The committee decided to recess and continue discussions at a later date.  

2. **Future Agenda**:

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
