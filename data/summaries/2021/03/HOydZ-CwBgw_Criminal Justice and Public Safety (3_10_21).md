The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 10, 2021, focused on a wide range of criminal justice and public safety issues, with discussions and votes on several key bills. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **DUI and Impaired Driving**
1. **House Bill 179 (Tyler Shaw's Law)**:
   - This bill seeks to increase penalties for repeat DUI offenders, particularly in cases of negligent homicide. It proposes a minimum 10-year sentence for aggravated DUI resulting in death, up from the current 7-year penalty. Beth Shaw, the mother of Tyler Shaw, testified in support, sharing the tragic story of her son’s death caused by a drunk driver with prior DUI convictions. The bill aims to deter repeat offenders and ensure harsher penalties for habitual drunk drivers who cause fatalities.

2. **Interlock Devices**:
   - There was significant discussion about the effectiveness of ignition interlock devices in preventing drunk driving. Testimony highlighted issues with the system, including cases where repeat offenders bypassed or had their devices removed despite violations. The Department of Safety explained the process for reviewing interlock violations and extending device usage, acknowledging gaps in enforcement.

#### **Juvenile Sentencing**
1. **House Bill 632**:
   - This bill seeks to ban life sentences without the possibility of parole for juveniles convicted of crimes, including homicide. It aligns with U.S. Supreme Court rulings that emphasize juveniles’ developmental immaturity, susceptibility to external influences, and potential for rehabilitation. The bill allows for parole hearings after a reasonable period of incarceration, based on individual circumstances. Testimony from Moira O’Neill, the Child Advocate for New Hampshire, and Eric Alexander, a former juvenile offender, supported the bill, highlighting the importance of rehabilitation and the severe impacts of life sentences on young offenders.

#### **Public Safety and Child Protection**
1. **House Bill 612**:
   - This bill increases penalties for drivers who illegally pass a stopped school bus, aiming to enhance child safety. It increases the fine for a first-time offense from $150 to $250 and mandates a 30-day license suspension for repeat offenders. The bill received strong support, with testimony emphasizing the dangers of passing school buses and the need to deter dangerous driving behavior.

#### **Privacy and Law Enforcement**
1. **House Bill 539**:
   - This bill requires law enforcement to obtain a warrant for accessing communication records from service providers, aligning with the state's Constitutional Amendment Article 2B, which protects personal information. The bill aims to close a loophole that allows the government to access customer data without a warrant. Supporters argued it strengthens privacy rights, while opponents felt it needed more expert input. The bill passed with 13 Yays and 8 Nays.

#### **Victim Protection and Immunity**
1. **House Bill 123**:
   - This bill provides immunity from prostitution charges for individuals who report being victims of sexual assault. An amendment clarified that immunity is not contingent on cooperation with law enforcement. The bill passed with 17 Yays and 4 Nays, aiming to encourage victims to report crimes without fear of legal repercussions.

2. **House Bill 546**:
   - This bill extends immunity from drug possession charges to individuals who report violent crimes or overdoses. It builds on existing laws that protect those reporting overdoses from possession charges, aiming to encourage reporting and save lives. The bill passed with 16 Yays and 5 Nays and was placed on the consent calendar.

#### **Solitary Confinement**
1. **House Bill 557**:
   - This bill addresses the use of solitary confinement in correctional facilities, seeking to repeal outdated laws from the 1800s that allowed solitary confinement as punishment for refusing to work. Chelsea Manning, a former inmate and activist, testified about the long-term psychological effects of solitary confinement. The motion to declare the bill "inexpedient to legislate" passed with 11 Yays and 10 Nays, indicating the bill will not move forward.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the House’s efforts to balance public safety with the need for rehabilitation, particularly for young offenders, and the challenges of addressing substance abuse and impaired driving. Key themes included enhancing penalties for DUI offenses, protecting victims, ensuring privacy rights, and modernizing criminal justice laws to reflect current standards and scientific understanding. The committee’s discussions and votes reflected a commitment to creating a fairer and more effective criminal justice system.
