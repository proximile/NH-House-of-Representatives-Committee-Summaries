**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (March 19, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened virtually on March 19, 2021, due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on legislative corrections, energy transmission costs, renewable energy integration, grid reliability, and future planning for New Hampshire's energy landscape. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Legislative Business**
1. **House Bill 315 (HB 315)**: The committee addressed a typographical error in an amendment to HB 315, voting unanimously (18-0) to reconsider and correct the amendment by removing a strike-through of the word "provide."
2. **House Bill 106 (HB 106)**: The committee expressed disappointment over being unable to discuss HB 106 due to an administrative error that led to its retention. They plan to address similar issues in Senate Bill 109, which is expected to arrive soon.

### **Transmission Costs and Energy Market Dynamics**
1. **Overview of Transmission Costs**: Eric Johnson from ISO New England provided an overview of transmission costs in New England, explaining that costs are allocated based on network load. New Hampshire is responsible for 9.5% of regional transmission costs, which are billed to utilities (e.g., Eversource, United Illuminating, PSNH) rather than directly to states. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approves rates, and ISO New England handles settlement functions.
2. **Impact of Renewable Energy**: Distributed resources like rooftop solar reduce grid demand, potentially lowering transmission costs. However, seasonal variations in solar production and the retirement of nuclear plants (e.g., Vermont Yankee) have impacted grid dynamics.
3. **Future Trends**: Transmission costs are expected to stabilize as major reliability projects are completed. However, the electrification of transportation and heating may increase future electricity demand, reversing current flat consumption trends.

### **Renewable Energy Integration**
1. **Solar Energy**: The growth of solar energy in New England, particularly in Massachusetts, was highlighted. Solar installations on the customer side of the meter reduce grid demand, but their impact is difficult to isolate from other factors like weather.
2. **Battery Storage**: Over 3,000 megawatts of battery storage projects have been proposed in New England. Batteries can store excess renewable energy and discharge it when needed, improving grid stability and efficiency.
3. **Offshore Wind**: Planning for offshore wind projects and technological innovations in battery storage were emphasized as key components of future energy planning.

### **Grid Reliability and Cybersecurity**
1. **Grid Security**: ISO New England discussed its efforts to enhance grid security and resilience, including regular cybersecurity exercises and coordination with federal agencies like the FBI and Homeland Security.
2. **Reliability Measures**: ISO New England ensures grid reliability by studying interconnections for new projects (e.g., wind farms, solar arrays) and requiring upgrades if necessary. Small distributed resources, like rooftop solar, reduce grid load but do not directly connect to ISO’s system.

---

### **Energy Efficiency and Load Reduction**
1. **Energy Efficiency Investments**: States like Massachusetts and California lead in energy efficiency investments, which have reduced regional demand. However, ISO New England does not mandate energy efficiency policies, leaving that to federal and state governments.
2. **Rejected Energy**: The concept of "rejected energy" (energy that cannot be converted into useful purposes) was briefly discussed. More efficient technologies and storage solutions could minimize energy waste.

### **Policy Considerations and Future Planning**
1. **New Hampshire’s Unique Challenges**: New Hampshire’s increasing load and peak demand contrast with decreasing trends in other states, potentially raising its share of regional costs. The state’s energy policies will need to address these challenges while supporting the transition to renewable energy.
2. **Upcoming Sessions and Presentations**: The committee discussed the need for concise floor debates to manage the heavy workload of upcoming House sessions in April. They also expressed interest in additional presentations from ISO New England on topics like grid security, renewable energy integration, and financing renewable energy projects.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complex interplay between transmission costs, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and grid reliability, with a focus on New Hampshire’s unique challenges and regional dynamics. The committee emphasized the importance of planning for future energy needs, leveraging technological innovations, and addressing policy considerations to support a sustainable and resilient energy future.
