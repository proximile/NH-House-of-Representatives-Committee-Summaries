### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division II Meeting (February 8, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened on February 8, 2021, to discuss budgets, operations, and challenges across several state departments and agencies. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, covered key topics related to the New Hampshire Lottery, Fish and Game Department, Police Standards and Training Council, and other administrative matters. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **New Hampshire Lottery Commission**
1. **Revenue and Sales**:
   - The Lottery had a strong fiscal year, with increased sales driven by the pandemic. Keno, Powerball, and Mega Millions were significant contributors, with Keno generating over $1 million weekly, particularly in border towns and larger cities. 
   - Sports betting, introduced in New Hampshire, exceeded expectations, contributing $10.5 million in revenue during the fiscal year, with a notable portion coming from Massachusetts residents.

2. **Budget Adjustments**:
   - The state initially budgeted $682,000 for sports betting hosting expenses but saved costs as DraftKings handled operations. The budget for 2022 and 2023 was reduced to $402,500 and $405,500, respectively.
   - The Lottery’s net profitability has doubled over the past decade, with significant contributions to the education trust fund. However, expenses have increased due to growth, particularly in personal services.

3. **Expansion and Modernization**:
   - The Lottery is implementing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, costing approximately $733,000, to streamline operations and improve customer interactions.
   - Discussions included the potential expansion of Keno to more locations and oversight of charitable gaming, with historical horse racing under consideration for potential revenue generation.

### **New Hampshire Fish and Game Department**
1. **Budget and Staffing Challenges**:
   - The department has reduced its reliance on general funds by two-thirds, relying more on Fish and Game funds and other sources. However, it faces staffing shortages, with 10 unfunded positions, some vacant for several biennia.
   - Increased outdoor activity during the pandemic boosted revenue from licenses and registrations, but the department remains under financial strain.

2. **Wildlife and Habitat Management**:
   - The department is addressing wildlife issues, such as tick infestations affecting moose populations in the north and brainworm in southern moose. Moose tag allocations are being adjusted to aid population recovery.
   - Land acquisition and easements remain a priority, with several parcels under evaluation to protect habitats and provide public access for hunting and fishing.

3. **Public Access and Projects**:
   - Public boat access sites saw increased use during the pandemic, with funding from boat registrations and federal matching sources. Major projects, such as the Alton Bay site, are nearing completion, with smaller projects planned elsewhere.
   - The department benefits from grants and donations, including a $1 million annual donation for the Great Bay Sandy Point Research Center, which funds a new position.

4. **Dispatch Services**:
   - Dispatch services are transitioning to the state’s E911 system, but the department will retain a non-emergency wildlife-related phone line. Only one full-time dispatch position will remain post-transition.

### **New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council**
1. **Budget and Staffing Needs**:
   - The council requested additional full-time positions, including a training specialist and an instructional design specialist, to meet increased training mandates and workload.
   - Budget increases were highlighted for a new record management system ($1 million) and a Virtra training device, a 360-degree decision-making simulator requiring annual software subscriptions.

2. **Training Enhancements**:
   - The Leak Commission and Governor’s Executive Order 2020-1 mandated expanded training in ethics, de-escalation, and implicit bias. The council developed a new implicit bias and procedural justice class in collaboration with organizations like the ACLU and NAACP.
   - The academy is transitioning to more online training to make it accessible and cost-effective, especially for smaller departments. Scenario-based training and curriculum development are being expanded.

3. **COVID-19 Impact**:
   - The pandemic forced a shift to remote training, with plans to resume in-person training by April 1, 2021, pending vaccination rollouts. Costs related to COVID-19, such as cleaning supplies and Zoom subscriptions, were tracked for potential federal reimbursement.

4. **Recruitment and Program Effectiveness**:
   - Recruits are diverse, including military veterans, college graduates, and career changers, with an average age of 23-25. Instructors are experienced law enforcement officers aged 35-50.
   - New Hampshire is one of only two states offering active bystandership training, aimed at preventing misconduct and building community trust.

### **University System Consolidation**
