The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 4, 2021, focused on several key election law bills, addressing absentee voting, voter identification, and election integrity. The discussions highlighted the ongoing tension between ensuring election security and maintaining accessibility for all voters. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points and debates from the meeting:

### **Absentee Voting and Accessibility**

1. **House Bill 292**:  
   - This bill aims to address potential voter fraud by requiring additional verification for absentee ballots sent to addresses other than the one on the voter checklist. Verification options include submitting a photo ID, a notarized signature, or completing a challenged voter affidavit.  
   - Concerns were raised about the impact on vulnerable populations, such as individuals with disabilities (e.g., multiple sclerosis) who may struggle with signature verification, as well as snowbirds, college students, and nursing home residents.  
   - Opponents, including Michael O'Brien of America Votes, argued that the bill creates unnecessary barriers to voting, particularly for those with unique living situations or health challenges.  
   - The committee considered amendments to clarify the verification process and ensure it does not disenfranchise voters.

2. **House Bill 516 and House Bill 61**:  
   - Both bills propose allowing **no-excuse absentee voting**, enabling voters to cast absentee ballots without providing a specific reason.  
   - Supporters, including Representative Katherine Rogers and organizations like Open Democracy Action, argued that no-excuse absentee voting increases accessibility for voters with unpredictable schedules, disabilities, or transportation challenges. They cited the success of no-excuse absentee voting during the 2020 election, which saw record turnout without significant fraud.  
   - Opponents, including Deputy Secretary of State David Scanlan, raised constitutional concerns and potential risks of **ballot harvesting** by third parties.  
   - The bills also proposed **pre-processing of absentee ballots** before Election Day, which was supported by the New Hampshire Municipal Association as a way to reduce election day workload and identify issues earlier.

### **Voter Identification and Verification**

1. **House Bill 327**:  
   - This bill would require voters who drop off absentee ballots in person to show identification, aligning the process with in-person voting requirements.  
   - Supporters argued that this would increase voter confidence in election integrity without imposing significant burdens.  
   - Critics questioned the necessity of stricter ID requirements, given the lack of evidence of widespread fraud in New Hampshire elections.

2. **House Bill 291**:  
   - This bill focuses on transparency by making the list of where absentee ballots are mailed publicly available 60 days after an election.  
   - The goal is to allow the Secretary of State to investigate potential irregularities, such as multiple ballots being sent to the same out-of-state address.  
   - The sponsor emphasized that the bill is not about proving fraud but about increasing transparency and accountability.

### **Election Integrity and Transparency**

1. **House Bill 406**:  
   - Introduced by Representative O'Brien, this bill aims to allow the public to observe the pre-processing and counting of absentee ballots without obstruction, emphasizing transparency in elections.  
   - Concerns were raised about the practicality of certain provisions, such as the six-foot observation distance for absentee ballot processing.

2. **House Bill 372**:  
   - This bill seeks to improve the enforcement of election laws by allowing county attorneys and municipal prosecutors to handle violations, such as stolen campaign signs and voter fraud.  
   - Currently, such cases must go through the Attorney General's office, which is often too busy to address minor violations.  
   - Testimony from the NH Association of Counties highlighted concerns about the capacity of county attorneys to take on additional responsibilities, leading to discussions about amending the bill to focus on municipal prosecutors.

### **General Themes and Debates**

- **Election Security vs. Accessibility**:  
   The meeting underscored the ongoing debate between ensuring election security and maintaining accessibility for all voters. Supporters of stricter measures argued that they would increase voter confidence and prevent fraud, while opponents warned that they could disenfranchise vulnerable populations.  

- **Transparency and Privacy**:  
   Discussions also addressed the balance between transparency and privacy in election processes, particularly regarding the publication of voter addresses and the observation of absentee ballot processing.  

- **Constitutional Concerns**:  
   Several bills raised constitutional questions, particularly around no-excuse absentee voting, which is currently limited by the New Hampshire Constitution to cases of absence or disability.  

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the complexities of modernizing election laws to balance security, accessibility, and transparency. While there was broad support for measures like pre-processing absentee ballots to improve efficiency, debates over voter ID requirements, no-excuse absentee voting, and transparency measures revealed significant divisions. The committee aimed to address these concerns through amendments and further discussions, with the ultimate goal of ensuring fair, secure, and accessible elections for all New Hampshire voters.
