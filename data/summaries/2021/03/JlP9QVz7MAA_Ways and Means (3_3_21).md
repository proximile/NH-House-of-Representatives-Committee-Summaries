The transcript is from a New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting held on March 3, 2021. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Meeting Format and Accessibility**: The meeting was held via Zoom, with no physical location for public observation. Public access to the meeting was provided through Zoom or telephone, and all necessary access information was made available on the House calendar and the General Court website.

2. **Discussion of House Bills**: The committee discussed several bills, including **House Bill 10** (related to business profits tax and business enterprise tax rates) and **House Bill 15**. There was a motion to retain House Bill 10, which passed with a 23-0 vote. The committee also discussed an amendment to House Bill 15, which involved clarifying language related to travel agent commissions and their exclusion from gross rental receipts.

3. **Amendment Debate**: The committee debated the necessity of an amendment to House Bill 15, with some members arguing it was unnecessary and others supporting it for clarity. The Department of Revenueâ€™s assistant commissioner, Carolyn Lear, indicated that the bill was clear without the amendment and that any issues could be addressed through rule-making. However, the committee decided to postpone the vote on the amendment until the next meeting on March 10 to allow for further review.

4. **Committee Work on House Bill 2**: The committee also discussed House Bill 2, the state budget bill, and the need to analyze specific sections related to revenue. Members were encouraged to review the bill thoroughly, particularly sections identified by the Finance Committee.

5. **Other Business**: The committee briefly addressed House Bill 565, which establishes a committee to study charitable gaming. It was noted that the bill had been approved 24-0 but was not included in the previous consent calendar and would be included in the next one.

6. **Future Meetings and Caucuses**: The committee agreed to meet again on March 10 to finalize decisions on House Bill 15 and its amendment. Some members suggested holding caucuses to discuss the bill further before the next meeting.

Overall, the meeting focused on procedural discussions, amendments, and the review of key bills, with an emphasis on ensuring clarity and alignment with legislative intent.
