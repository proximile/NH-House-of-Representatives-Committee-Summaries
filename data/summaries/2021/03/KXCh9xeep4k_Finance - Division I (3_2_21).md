### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (3/2/21)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting held on March 2, 2021, focused on budget discussions and operational reviews for several state agencies, with a particular emphasis on the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC). The meeting, conducted electronically via Zoom due to COVID-19, addressed funding requests, staffing challenges, reorganization efforts, and the impact of budget constraints on agency operations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics discussed:

---

### **1. Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**

#### **Budget and Funding Requests**
- **Budget Overview**: The OPLC, a self-funded agency relying on licensing fees, requested approximately $11.9 million for FY22 and $12.2 million for FY23. Additional funds were sought for mechanical licensing and other operational needs.
- **Revenue and Expenses**: The agency projected increased revenue from licensing fees but highlighted significant expenses, including credit card processing fees (a $2.50 fee was proposed to offset these costs) and rent for non-state facilities due to a lack of available state space.
- **Funding Priorities**: Key allocations included positions, salaries, technology upgrades, and administrative support. Specific requests included funding for hearing examiners, program assistants, investigative paralegals, and document management systems.

#### **Reorganization and Efficiency Improvements**
- **Structural Changes**: The OPLC is undergoing a major reorganization, including the elimination of certain divisions (e.g., Division of Technical Professions) and the creation of new ones (e.g., Division of Licensing and Board Administration). This aims to centralize functions like mail intake and customer service, streamline licensing processes, and improve efficiency.
- **Technology Integration**: The agency is leveraging technology to move licensing and investigations online, reducing workforce barriers and enhancing transparency.
- **Audit Findings**: The OPLC is addressing performance audit findings, particularly related to the Real Estate Board, by improving supervision, updating licensing policies, and enhancing fiscal management.

#### **Staffing Challenges**
- **Increased Positions**: The agency has seen growth in permanent classified positions and is addressing the need for more board administrators, inspectors, and legal support. Part-time positions and staffing shortages across multiple boards remain a challenge.
- **Collaboration**: The OPLC works closely with other state agencies, such as the Department of Safety and Health and Human Services, to align regulatory and educational efforts.

#### **Future Goals**
- The OPLC aims to position New Hampshire as a leader in occupational licensing, focusing on public protection, innovative approaches, and supporting veterans entering the workforce.
