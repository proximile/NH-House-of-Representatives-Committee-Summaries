### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division II Meeting (March 15, 2021)

**Context and Meeting Setup**:  
The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee met electronically on March 15, 2021, due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on House Bill 2 (HB2), particularly the Governor’s student debt relief plan and proposed changes to the state’s 529 college savings plan (UNIQUE). Discussions centered on balancing direct scholarship funding, workforce development, and student debt relief to address the state’s economic and educational needs.

**Key Discussions and Proposals**:

1. **Governor’s Student Debt Relief Plan**:  
   - **Objective**: The plan seeks to reallocate funds from the Unique Endowment Program to provide student debt relief and workforce development, targeting critical fields like healthcare, biotechnology, and nursing.  
   - **Funding Allocation**: The proposal shifts the allocation of funds from the 529 plan:  
     - 60% to student debt relief and workforce development.  
     - 20% to direct scholarships.  
     - 20% to the Unique Endowment Program.  
   - **Program Mechanics**: Participants must commit to working in New Hampshire for five years to qualify for loan forgiveness. The program would be administered by the Business Finance Authority (BFA), with oversight from the fiscal committee.  
   - **Tax Implications**: Loan forgiveness under the program would be considered taxable income, consistent with federal loan forgiveness programs.  
   - **Concerns**: Committee members raised concerns about reducing funding for direct scholarships and endowments, the potential impact on scholarship recipients, and the enforceability of the five-year commitment clause.  

2. **529 College Savings Plan (UNIQUE) and Workforce Development**:  
   - **Background**: The UNIQUE program generates fees used exclusively for scholarships for New Hampshire students attending in-state institutions. Since its inception, it has awarded over 72,000 scholarships.  
   - **Proposed Changes**: The 529 Advisory Commission suggested reallocating incoming fees:  
     - From 80% to endowments and 20% to direct scholarships.  
     - To 70% direct scholarships and 30% endowments, aiming to provide more immediate support to students, particularly adult learners and those with financial need.  
   - **Workforce Focus**: The changes aim to address workforce shortages in critical sectors by focusing on adult learners and individuals with some college education but no degree.  
   - **Loan Forgiveness Program**: A proposed loan forgiveness program would divert 60% of 529 fees to student debt relief, targeting New Hampshire residents working for in-state companies. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on existing scholarships and the lack of a requirement for beneficiaries to have attended New Hampshire institutions.  

3. **Endowments and Future Scholarship Availability**:  
   - Endowments currently pay out at least 4% annually, providing ongoing scholarship support. However, changes in funding allocation could limit the growth of endowments, potentially reducing future scholarship availability.  

4. **Legislative Flexibility and Economic Impact**:  
   - There was consensus that funding percentages should not be codified in legislation but left to the discretion of the 529 Advisory Commission to allow flexibility in responding to changing needs.  
   - The program is seen as vital to New Hampshire’s economic development, with institutions playing a key role in research, teaching, and community service. The potential impact on both public and private institutions was considered, with concerns about reduced scholarship funds.  

**Concerns and Considerations**:  
- **Balancing Priorities**: The discussions highlighted the tension between supporting current students through scholarships and addressing workforce needs through debt relief.  
- **Urgency of Workforce Shortages**: Proponents argued that immediate action is necessary to address critical shortages, particularly in healthcare, while others called for further study to assess the impact of proposed changes.  
- **Economic Competitiveness**: Retaining and attracting a skilled workforce was emphasized as essential for maintaining New Hampshire’s economic competitiveness.  

**Next Steps**:  
The committee acknowledged the need for further discussion and consensus-building on the proposed changes. Plans were made to reconvene to address additional state financial challenges.  

**Conclusion**:  
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing scholarship funding, workforce development, and student debt relief. While the proposed changes aim to address urgent workforce needs and retain talent in New Hampshire, concerns about the impact on scholarships and endowments highlight the need for careful consideration and flexibility in program design.
