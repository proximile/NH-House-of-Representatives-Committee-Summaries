The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on March 25, 2021, to discuss several bills, with a primary focus on **Senate Bill 61 (SB 61)**, the "Right to Work" legislation. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, featured extensive testimony from union members, labor leaders, business representatives, and other stakeholders. The debate over SB 61 reflected a deep ideological divide, with proponents framing the bill as a protection of individual freedom and economic growth, while opponents argued it would weaken unions, harm workers’ rights, and negatively impact New Hampshire’s economy.

### **Overview of Senate Bill 61 (Right to Work)**
SB 61 would prohibit unions from requiring workers to pay dues or fees as a condition of employment in unionized workplaces. Supporters argue it protects workers’ freedom to choose whether to financially support a union, while opponents contend it undermines collective bargaining, reduces union resources, and harms workers’ wages, benefits, and safety.

### **Support for SB 61**
1. **Individual Freedom**: Supporters, including business associations and some legislators, framed the bill as a protection of workers’ rights to choose whether to join or financially support a union. They argued it aligns with principles of individual liberty and freedom of association.
2. **Economic Growth**: Proponents, such as the Business and Industry Association (BIA) and Americans for Prosperity, claimed that Right to Work states attract more businesses and experience higher economic growth. They cited examples like Indiana and Michigan, which saw economic benefits after adopting Right to Work laws.
3. **Union Accountability**: Supporters argued that unions should earn membership through good service rather than relying on mandatory dues. They likened the bill to the removal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, framing it as a pro-freedom measure.
4. **Business Attraction**: Proponents emphasized that New Hampshire would be the only Right to Work state in the Northeast, making it more competitive for business relocation and expansion.

### **Opposition to SB 61**
1. **Worker Protections**: Opponents, including union members, labor leaders, and faith leaders, argued that unions provide critical benefits such as fair wages, workplace safety, health care, and job security. They warned that SB 61 would undermine these protections and harm workers’ quality of life.
2. **Economic Harm**: Testifiers cited data showing that Right to Work states have lower wages, higher poverty rates, and higher workplace fatalities. They argued that the bill would not attract quality businesses but instead incentivize low-wage, low-benefit employers.
3. **Union Strength**: Opponents viewed the bill as an attempt to weaken unions, which have historically fought for labor rights, including weekends, child labor laws, and safety standards. They emphasized that unions are essential for reducing income inequality and racial wage gaps.
4. **Fair Share Argument**: Union representatives highlighted that non-members still benefit from union-negotiated contracts, creating resentment and financial strain on unions. They argued that mandatory dues are necessary to maintain unions’ ability to advocate for workers.
5. **Training and Safety**: Unions fund apprenticeship and training programs, which could be jeopardized if unions lose financial support. Testifiers also noted that unionized workplaces have lower accident rates and better safety protocols.
6. **Historical and Moral Concerns**: Opponents criticized the bill’s origins in efforts to divide workers, particularly along racial lines in the 1940s. They also called the bill’s title misleading, as it does not guarantee work or rights but instead weakens collective bargaining.

### **Key Testimonies**
1. **Union Members and Leaders**: Testifiers shared personal stories about how union membership improved their lives, providing stability, healthcare, and training. They emphasized the importance of unions in building the middle class and improving wages and working conditions.
2. **Economic Experts**: Dr. Lisa Shapiro, Chief Economist at Gallagher Callahan & Gartrell, testified on behalf of the AFL-CIO, arguing that Right to Work states underperform economically compared to non-Right to Work states. She cited lower wages, fewer benefits, and reduced worker safety.
3. **Business Representatives**: Dave Juvet of the BIA and Greg Moore of Americans for Prosperity argued that Right to Work would attract businesses to New Hampshire and protect workers’ freedom to choose whether to join a union.
4. **Faith Leaders**: Reverend John Gregory Davis and Reverend Dr. Gail Kenny criticized the bill as immoral and deceptive, emphasizing the importance of workers’ rights and dignity.
5. **Historical Context**: Professor Mark Dixon’s statement, read by Arie Alpert, explained that Right to Work laws originated in the 1940s as a tool to weaken unions and divide workers along racial lines.

### **Political and Economic Implications**
1. **Partisan Divide**: The debate highlighted a partisan split, with Republicans generally supporting the bill and Democrats opposing it. However, some Republicans, including Dennis O’Brien and Patrick Burns, opposed SB 61, arguing it goes against conservative principles of limited government and individual freedom.
2. **Economic Data**: Opponents cited studies showing that Right to Work states have lower wages, higher poverty rates, and less investment in public education. Supporters claimed the bill would boost job and income growth.
3. **Out-of-State Influence**: Many speakers criticized the bill as being driven by out-of-state special interest groups, such as the National Right to Work Committee, rather than the needs of New Hampshire residents.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the deep divide over SB 61, with proponents framing it as a protection of individual rights and economic growth, while opponents viewed it as a threat to workers’ rights, safety, and economic well-being. The committee heard overwhelmingly negative testimony from union members and leaders, who urged lawmakers to reject the bill. The committee planned to hold an executive session to discuss the bill further, with its potential impact on New Hampshire’s labor market and political landscape remaining a central point of contention.
