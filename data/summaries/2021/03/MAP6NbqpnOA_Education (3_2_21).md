The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on March 2, 2021, addressed a wide range of education-related bills, focusing on student welfare, civic engagement, special education, and infrastructure improvements. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Student Welfare and Equity**
1. **School Lunch Policies (HB 202)**:
   - Representative Sue Mullen introduced HB 202 to prevent the stigmatization of students unable to pay for school lunches. The bill mandates that students not be given alternative meals that single them out and ensures communication about unpaid balances occurs between school personnel and parents, not students. It also prohibits requiring students to work off lunch debt. The Department of Education noted that similar regulations already exist, potentially making the bill redundant.

2. **Indoor Air Quality in Schools (HB 339)**:
   - Representative Brian Sullivan introduced HB 339 to establish a committee to study indoor air quality in schools, a concern exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Testimony highlighted the prevalence of poor air quality in older school buildings, its impact on student health and learning, and the need for state intervention. Federal funds (e.g., ESSER funds) are available for improvements, but schools need guidance on effective resource allocation.

3. **Special Education Burden of Proof (HB 581)**:
   - HB 581 proposes shifting the burden of proof in special education due process hearings from parents to school districts. Advocates argued that the current system disadvantages parents, particularly those with limited resources, and delays access to appropriate services for children with disabilities. Opponents raised concerns about increased costs for school districts and the potential for more litigation. Testimonies highlighted the emotional and financial toll on families and the need for systemic reform.

### **Civic Engagement and Education**
1. **Civics Education in High Schools (HB 422)**:
   - Representative John Janigian introduced HB 422, which requires a standalone half-credit Civics course for high school students in grades 10-12. The bill aims to address the lack of civic knowledge among young people by ensuring Civics is taught as a distinct subject. Educator Bernard Campbell supported the bill, suggesting the course be offered in the senior year for maximum impact.

2. **Civics Test for College Students (HB 319)**:
   - Representative Mike Moffett introduced HB 319, requiring students in the University and Community College systems of New Hampshire to pass the USCIS civics naturalization test with a score of 70% or higher. The bill aims to ensure graduates have a basic understanding of civics and government. Concerns were raised about administrative burden, test accessibility, and its impact on non-traditional students. The University and Community College systems expressed neutrality but highlighted logistical challenges.

### **Infrastructure and Learning Environments**
1. **Construction Standards for Schools (HB 267)**:
   - HB 267 addresses noise from outdated HVAC systems in schools, which negatively impacts learning, particularly for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The bill proposes compliance with federal standards for acoustics and air quality by 2026. Testimony emphasized the need for improved learning environments, but concerns were raised about feasibility and costs, especially for older schools.

2. **Indoor Air Quality in Schools (HB 339)**:
   - As previously discussed, HB 339 focuses on improving air quality in schools, with testimony highlighting the challenges of outdated HVAC systems and the need for state intervention to ensure safe learning environments.

### **Human Rights and National Motto in Schools**
1. **Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Schools (HB 441)**:
   - HB 441 proposes displaying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in schools to promote awareness of human rights. Supporters argued it aligns with educational goals, while opponents raised concerns about specific articles conflicting with U.S. values like homeschooling and individual rights.

2. **Display of the National Motto in Schools (HB 69)**:
   - HB 69 allows schools to display the national motto, "In God We Trust," and protects them from lawsuits related to its display. Supporters argued it promotes patriotism, while opponents viewed it as inherently religious and potentially alienating to non-religious students.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Fairness and Equity**: Discussions on school lunch policies, special education, and air quality highlighted concerns about fairness and equity for students and families, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
2. **Civic Engagement**: Bills focused on Civics education aimed to address gaps in civic knowledge among students and college graduates, emphasizing the importance of understanding government and civic responsibilities.
3. **Infrastructure Improvements**: Proposals to improve school infrastructure, including air quality and acoustics, underscored the need for safe and conducive learning environments, especially in older school buildings.
4. **Human Rights and Ideology**: Debates on displaying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the national motto reflected broader ideological divides over the role of religion and human rights in public education.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to improve educational policies in New Hampshire, with a focus on student welfare, civic engagement, and infrastructure. While many bills garnered support, concerns about implementation, costs, and ideological implications shaped the discussions. The committee’s deliberations will continue as they work to address these issues and ensure equitable and effective educational outcomes for all students.
