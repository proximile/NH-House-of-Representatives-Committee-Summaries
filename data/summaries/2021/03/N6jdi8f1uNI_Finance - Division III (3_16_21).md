**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division III Meeting (March 16, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on March 16, 2021, focused on critical discussions surrounding the state budget process, juvenile justice reform, and funding for newborn screening tests. The meeting highlighted the complexities of aligning fiscal priorities with public needs, emphasizing transparency, collaboration, and the challenges of transitioning to more effective and cost-efficient systems.

### **State Budget Process**
1. **Budget Challenges and Approach**:
   - The committee addressed the complexities of crafting the state budget, particularly the gap between the governor’s higher revenue estimates and the House’s more conservative projections. This discrepancy made it impossible to fully fund the governor’s proposed initiatives.
   - The committee decided to use the FY21 budget, enhanced by HB4 items, as a baseline rather than starting from the governor’s proposed budget. This approach was chosen to align with the House’s lower revenue estimates and ensure fiscal responsibility.

2. **Transparency and Collaboration**:
   - Concerns were raised about the need for transparency in the budget process, especially with the introduction of a new working document. Members emphasized the importance of making the document public to allow stakeholders to provide informed feedback.
   - The committee committed to a collaborative and collegial process, avoiding last-minute surprises and ensuring all members could contribute meaningfully to budget decisions.

3. **Timeline and Next Steps**:
   - The committee aimed to finalize budget recommendations within eight days, with further reviews and public input expected as the budget progressed through the full finance committee, the House, and the Senate.

### **Juvenile Justice Reform (HB 254)**
1. **HB 254 Overview**:
   - The bill seeks to reduce reliance on the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC) for juvenile detention and commitment, focusing instead on community-based treatment for minor offenders. It emphasizes evidence-based interventions that are more effective and less costly than institutional care.

2. **Data and Fiscal Impact**:
   - Testimony revealed that 92% of SYSC petitions would no longer result in commitment if HB 254 passes, with only 8% remaining eligible for secure detention. This would significantly reduce the number of juveniles committed to SYSC.
   - While no fiscal note was attached, discussions highlighted the potential cost savings of community-based treatments compared to the high expenses of SYSC. However, concerns were raised about the readiness of the community-based system to handle the transition.

3. **Challenges and Alternatives**:
   - New Hampshire’s historical reliance on institutional care due to a lack of community treatment options was acknowledged. The committee discussed the need to build out the System of Care and leverage federal Family First legislation to support alternatives like mobile crisis intervention, intensive in-home therapy, and foster care.
   - Public safety and recidivism concerns were addressed, with evidence showing that community-based treatments are more effective in reducing recidivism and preparing juveniles for reintegration into society.

4. **Outcome**:
   - The committee scheduled an executive session for March 22 to further discuss HB 254 and consider potential amendments, such as delaying the effective date to 2023 to allow more time for system readiness.

### **Newborn Screening Funding (HB 600)**
1. **HB 600 Overview**:
   - The bill aims to restructure how hospitals are reimbursed for newborn screening tests, shifting from billing for filter paper to billing for the screening panel itself. This change addresses the unsustainable cost increases faced by hospitals due to additional tests being added to the screening panel.

2. **Discussion and Concerns**:
   - Hospitals argued that the current system, which charges $146 per filter paper, is financially burdensome. Restructuring the billing process would allow hospitals to recover costs from insurers and maintain access to essential screening services.
   - The committee discussed the potential impact on Medicaid and the state budget, with some suggesting the bill could be cost-neutral if implemented correctly.
   - Broader concerns about the declining number of birthing centers in New Hampshire were raised, with the bill seen as a step toward maintaining access to care.

3. **Outcome**:
   - The committee considered adjusting the effective date from 60 to 90 days to allow the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) time to implement the changes. An executive session was scheduled for March 22.

### **Key Themes**
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: The committee emphasized the need to balance fiscal constraints with funding essential state priorities, whether in the state budget, juvenile justice reform, or healthcare services.
- **Transparency and Collaboration**: Throughout the discussions, there was a strong focus on ensuring transparency, public input, and collaborative decision-making.
- **Systemic Reform**: Both HB 254 and HB 600 highlighted the challenges of transitioning from outdated or unsustainable systems (e.g., SYSC, current newborn screening billing) to more effective and cost-efficient alternatives, while ensuring readiness and avoiding unintended consequences.

Overall, the meeting underscored the interconnectedness of policy, funding, and public service delivery, with a commitment to thoughtful and strategic decision-making to address New Hampshire’s pressing needs.
