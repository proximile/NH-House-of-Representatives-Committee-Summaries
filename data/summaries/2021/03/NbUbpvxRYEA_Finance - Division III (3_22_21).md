**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Division III Meeting (March 22, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee Division III meeting on March 22, 2021, focused on budget adjustments, amendments, and planning for the upcoming fiscal year, with particular emphasis on Health and Human Services (HHS), family planning services, and broader fiscal challenges. The meeting, conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, addressed a wide range of topics, including budget reductions, funding allocations, and legislative processes. Here are the key points:

---

### **Budget Adjustments and Revenue Considerations**
1. **Revenue Enhancements and Contingency Planning**:  
   - The committee identified $12 million in additional revenue from enhanced federal Medicaid matching funds (FMAP) and discussed the possibility of $127 million in further revenue. These funds were considered for restoring cuts to municipal aid, state grants, and education funding.  
   - Contingency planning was emphasized to prepare for potential changes in revenue numbers and ensure clarity in the budget process.

2. **Back-of-the-Budget Cuts**:  
   - A $50 million department-wide reduction was proposed, with exemptions for critical programs like developmental services, childrenâ€™s health insurance, and long-term care. Concerns were raised about the lack of specific guidance for implementing these cuts, particularly in large agencies like HHS.

3. **Personnel Reductions**:  
   - The committee debated reducing personnel costs by 226 positions, up from an initial proposal of 180. While this reduction would still allow for departmental growth, concerns were raised about its impact on services for vulnerable populations.

### **Health and Human Services (HHS)**
1. **Family Planning and Abortion Services**:  
   - A heated debate centered on amendments requiring physical and financial segregation of family planning programs from reproductive health facilities. Proponents argued this would eliminate financial incentives in counseling, while opponents warned it could burden clinics and limit access to essential services.  
   - Discussions also addressed the allocation of state and federal funds for family planning, including whether the state should fill gaps left by changes in federal policy.

2. **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)**:  
   - The committee allocated $2.65 million for SYSC transition costs, with a suggestion to make the funding non-lapsing to allow carryover into the next fiscal year. An additional $12.3 million in savings was projected for FY23.

3. **Developmental Disabilities (DD) Redesign**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the removal of funding for the DD redesign, particularly its impact on 38 individuals receiving costly out-of-state services. Members debated the need to bring these individuals back to New Hampshire and build local support networks.

4. **Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)**:  
   - Legacy system maintenance costs were proposed to be moved from the operating budget to HB2, treating them as one-time expenses rather than ongoing operational costs.

### **Legislative Process and Transparency**
1. **Amendments and Voting**:  
   - The committee reviewed and voted on amendments to HB 600, which passed unanimously. Discussions highlighted the need for additional amendments, particularly related to SYSC and personnel reductions.  
   - The incarceration standards from HB254 were considered for inclusion in HB2, with HB254 potentially retained for further work in the fall.

2. **Civility and Threats**:  
   - A representative read an email containing threats against lawmakers, prompting a broader discussion on the importance of civility and the rule of law in political discourse.

3. **Future Meetings and Deadlines**:  
   - The committee planned additional meetings to finalize amendments and discuss further adjustments, including a potential contingency budget based on updated revenue estimates. A briefing for the full House on the budget was also scheduled.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Balancing Budget Cuts and Essential Services**: The committee grappled with the challenge of reducing costs while maintaining critical services, particularly for vulnerable populations. Discussions highlighted the need for clear guidance to departments on implementing cuts and prioritizing programs with statutory requirements.  
- **Focus on Health and Human Services**: Significant attention was given to HHS, with debates on family planning, SYSC, DD redesign, and MMIS costs. The committee aimed to balance fiscal responsibility with the need to support essential health services.  
- **Legislative Transparency and Collaboration**: Throughout the meeting, there was an emphasis on transparency, clear communication, and collaboration to ensure informed decision-making.
