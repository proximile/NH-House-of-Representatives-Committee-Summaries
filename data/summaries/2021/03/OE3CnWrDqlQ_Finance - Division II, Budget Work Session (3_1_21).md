On March 1, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened a budget work session to review and discuss the state’s budget for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The session focused on key areas, including the **Education Trust Fund**, the **Highway Fund**, education funding, the proposed merger of the state’s university and community college systems, and the use of federal COVID-19 relief funds. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points:

### **Education Trust Fund**
1. **Starting Balance**: FY2021 began with a $3.2 million deficit.
2. **Revenues**: The House Ways and Means Committee projected revenues $50 million lower than the governor’s estimates. Base revenues for FY21 were $1.1 billion, including a $62.5 million one-time allocation from a prior surplus.
3. **Expenditures**: Appropriations included adequacy grants, charter schools, and other state aid programs. A $16.4 million lapse (unspent funds) was anticipated due to enrollment changes.
4. **Ending Balance**: FY21 ended with a $98,000 deficit, requiring a transfer from the General Fund. For FY22 and FY23, the fund is projected to need additional General Fund transfers ($2.6 million and $16 million, respectively), totaling $18.5 million over the biennium.
