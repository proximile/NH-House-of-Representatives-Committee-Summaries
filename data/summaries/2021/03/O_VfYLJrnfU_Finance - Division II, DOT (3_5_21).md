**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Division II Meeting on March 5, 2021 – Department of Transportation (DOT) Budget Discussion**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee Division II convened electronically on March 5, 2021, to discuss the Department of Transportation (DOT) budget. The meeting, conducted via Zoom and telephone due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on the DOT’s financial challenges, revenue sources, equipment and fleet maintenance needs, and strategic planning for future funding. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **1. DOT Budget Overview and Revenue Challenges**
Commissioner Victoria Sheehan and Director of Finance Marie Mullen presented a detailed breakdown of the DOT budget, emphasizing the Highway Fund and its primary revenue sources, including the gas tax (road toll) and motor vehicle fees. Key points included:
- **Revenue Allocation**: Gas tax revenue is distributed to block grants for municipalities, betterment projects (paving and bridge repairs), and DOT operations. Senate Bill 367, which increased the gas tax by 4.2 cents, has supported debt service for the I-93 expansion and state aid for municipal bridges.
- **Financial Pressures**: The DOT faces declining revenue due to reduced driving during the pandemic and the long-term impact of fuel-efficient vehicles on gas tax collections. Federal stimulus funding was highlighted as critical to sustaining transportation projects.
- **Future Projections**: Preliminary revenue forecasts indicate potential declines, particularly for municipal bridge projects. The DOT stressed the need to refine projections as post-pandemic traffic patterns stabilize.

### **2. Equipment and Fleet Maintenance**
The DOT addressed significant challenges in maintaining and replacing aging vehicles and equipment, underscoring the need for consistent funding:
- **Backlog and Costs**: The fleet’s replacement value is $102 million, with $33 million needed to replace vehicles beyond their useful life. An annual funding of $8.9 million is required to achieve sustainability, but current budgets fall short, leading to increased maintenance costs and inefficiencies.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Pandemic-related delays in equipment purchases and maintenance work resulted in lapsed funds. However, recent revenue trends allowed the DOT to allocate an additional $4 million, reducing the backlog from $16 million to $12 million.
- **Safety and Efficiency**: Discussions included the potential shift to four-wheel drive vehicles for safety, though this would significantly increase costs. The DOT is evaluating trade-offs between safety, cost, and fleet management.

### **3. Long-Term Financial Planning**
The DOT emphasized the need for sustainable revenue streams and strategic planning to address future funding uncertainties:
- **Revenue Sunset**: The Revenue Stabilization Account (RSA) sunsets in 2035, raising concerns about a potential funding cliff for infrastructure projects.
- **Capital Funding and Debt Service**: The DOT has utilized capital funds and federal programs (e.g., VW settlement funds, DIRA) for equipment needs, but debt service payments from the Highway Fund create long-term financial pressures.
- **Conway Bypass Project**: This delayed project requires a $2 million annual payback to the federal government, with the DOT working to sell surplus property to cover costs.

### **4. Funding Requests and Budget Adjustments**
The DOT made several funding requests and proposed adjustments to address immediate and long-term needs:
- **Funding Requests**: The DOT requested $12 million to address the previous biennium’s backlog and an additional $8 million annually for future needs, totaling $24 million. Restoring the operating budget to $9 million annually was also proposed to prevent further backlogs.
- **Budget Adjustments**: Minor adjustments included a $100,000 grant for a transit project, federal coronavirus relief funds for transit agencies, and revenue from lease agreements in Alton Bay.
- **Flexibility for Lapse Funds**: The DOT sought authority to use any additional lapse funds, particularly from a mild winter, for fleet purchases to address equipment challenges.

### **5. HB2 Items and Administrative Efficiency**
The DOT proposed several items for inclusion in House Bill 2 (HB2) to improve operational efficiency and address emerging needs:
- **Statutory Updates**: Proposals included allowing reasonable estimates for highway damage claims, repealing a 1959 law providing additional winter maintenance funds, and clarifying statutes related to unmanned aircraft (drones).
- **Federal Real Estate Disposal**: Language was proposed to allow the disposal of federal real estate and restrict proceeds to federal projects.
- **Hiring Flexibility**: The DOT requested streamlined authority to hire and reclassify positions, similar to other departments.

### **6. Committee Actions**
The committee unanimously approved two motions:
- Allocating $3.1 million in federal funds for transit.
- Using $63,000 from agency income for right-of-way bureau expenses.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the DOT’s critical financial challenges, including declining revenue, aging equipment, and the need for sustainable funding streams. The committee emphasized the importance of strategic planning, federal support, and administrative flexibility to maintain New Hampshire’s transportation infrastructure. Future meetings will continue to review the DOT budget line by line and address additional details.
