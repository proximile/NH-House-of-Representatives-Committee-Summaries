The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee on March 30, 2021. The committee discussed **Senate Bill 61 (SB 61)**, a "right-to-work" bill that would prohibit mandatory union membership or fees as a condition of employment. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Opening Procedures**:
   - The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and procedural announcements, including confirmation that the meeting complied with House rules and emergency orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - The committee confirmed that all members could participate via Zoom and that the public could listen in or participate electronically.

2. **Amendment Discussion**:
   - An amendment to SB 61 was proposed by Representative Seaworth, aiming to address concerns about duplicative investigations and prosecutions by county attorneys in labor law cases. The amendment would allow the Attorney General or their designee to handle such cases, avoiding potential double jeopardy issues.
   - The amendment passed with a roll call vote of 10-9.

3. **Debate on SB 61**:
   - **Support for SB 61**: Some representatives argued that the bill promotes freedom of choice, prevents forced union membership, and could attract businesses to New Hampshire. They emphasized that unions could still negotiate contracts but would need to demonstrate value to retain members.
   - **Opposition to SB 61**: Many representatives and constituents testified against the bill, arguing that it would weaken unions, harm workers' rights, and negatively impact New Hampshire's economy. They highlighted the benefits unions provide, such as higher wages, better benefits, and stronger communities. Opponents also criticized the bill as union-busting legislation driven by out-of-state interests.

4. **Concerns Raised**:
   - Opponents raised concerns about the lack of evidence that SB 61 would benefit New Hampshire's economy. They also pointed out that similar laws in other states have led to lower wages and weaker unions.
   - Supporters countered that the bill would not harm unions if they provided value to their members and argued that it would enhance New Hampshire's competitive advantage.

5. **Voting and Outcome**:
   - The committee voted on whether to recommend SB 61 with the amendment. The motion to pass the bill with the amendment narrowly passed with a roll call vote of 10-9.

6. **Closing Remarks**:
   - Representatives reflected on the emotional and polarizing nature of the debate, with some expressing concern about the fear and anger the bill had generated among constituents. Others reiterated their belief that the bill would benefit New Hampshireâ€™s workforce and economy.

The meeting concluded with procedural announcements and plans for further discussions on other bills. The committee remained divided on the issue, with strong arguments on both sides.
