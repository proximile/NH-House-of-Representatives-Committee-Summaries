The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division III meeting on March 15, 2021, focused on a wide range of budget and policy discussions, primarily centered on public health, emergency preparedness, mental health infrastructure, and veterans' services. Here’s a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key points from all segments:

### **Public Health and Emergency Preparedness**
1. **HIV Services and Prevention**:
   - The committee reviewed funding for HIV services, including medical care, prescriptions, and housing assistance, which serves as a payer of last resort for uninsured individuals. Despite prevention efforts, HIV transmission rates have plateaued. New tools like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) were highlighted as critical for reducing transmission among high-risk groups.
   - The Ryan White Part B program, supporting individuals living with HIV/AIDS, was discussed, with stable annual case numbers noted.

2. **Tobacco Cessation and Prevention**:
   - Funding for tobacco prevention programs has decreased, raising concerns about their future despite their success. Questions were raised about why some authorized funds were not fully spent, with delays in contracting and staffing issues cited as reasons.
   - E-cigarette prevention among adolescents was identified as a prioritized need.

3. **Emergency Preparedness and Laboratory Modernization**:
   - The Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program, crucial for responding to outbreaks like COVID-19, was discussed. It funds epidemiology, laboratory testing, and emergency planning.
   - Aging lab equipment and the need for modernization were emphasized, with support required for adopting new testing methods and maintaining infrastructure.

4. **Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)**:
   - The PDMP, aimed at reducing overdose deaths and preventing addiction, was discussed in the context of its potential transfer to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The program is funded through federal grants and agency income.

### **Budget Discussions and Funding Allocation**
1. **Baseline Budget Approach**:
   - Representative Erf presented a baseline budget derived by comparing the FY 21 adjusted authorized budget with the governor’s proposed budget, using the lower number for each line item unless the governor’s number was within $200,000 of an increase. This approach established a foundation for potential add-backs.
   - The committee discussed reducing the budget to align with lower revenue estimates from the Ways and Means Committee, with Division III handling a significant portion of these reductions.

2. **Federal vs. General Funds**:
   - Many programs are funded entirely by federal funds, while others require a mix of federal and state (general) funds. The committee agreed to accept accounts funded solely by federal funds without further discussion.

3. **Lapse Targets and Prioritized Needs**:
   - The committee considered lapse targets (unspent funds from previous budgets) when determining where to make cuts. Priority requests from various departments, not included in the governor’s budget, were acknowledged for potential add-backs.

### **New Hampshire Veterans Home (NHVH)**
1. **Staffing and Census Challenges**:
   - Commandant Margaret LaBrecque presented the NHVH budget, highlighting staffing shortages in nursing, dietary, and maintenance roles. The NHVH has vacancies across shifts, competing with regional nursing homes for staff.
   - The budget is based on a projected census of 225 residents, but current staffing allows for only 175-180 residents. Admissions were halted during the pandemic, impacting census numbers and revenue.

2. **COVID-19 Impact and Telemedicine**:
   - The NHVH faced challenges during the pandemic, including deaths from COVID-19 and halted admissions. Remediation efforts were implemented, and admissions resumed on March 30, 2021.
   - Telemedicine services were introduced in late 2020, reducing some staffing pressure, though permanent positions are still needed. Wi-Fi access for residents is limited due to infrastructure and HIPAA compliance concerns.

3. **Equipment and Future Needs**:
   - The NHVH requires new and replacement equipment, such as beds and overhead lifts, to address the increasing care needs of veterans, including those with dementia and bariatric care requirements.

### **Mental Health Infrastructure and HB2**
1. **Forensic Mental Health Hospital**:
   - Section 39 of HB2 proposed expanding the forensic mental health hospital from 25 to 60 beds. Concerns were raised about funding, staffing, and the need for community-based mental health alternatives.
   - The committee debated whether federal stimulus funds or bonding could be used for the project, with plans to remove Section 39 temporarily and hold a public hearing on April 12 for further review.

2. **Community Support and Discharge Planning**:
   - Testimony from the Disability Rights Center emphasized that increasing bed capacity alone would not solve the mental health crisis without addressing discharge planning and community support systems.

3. **Repeal of RSA Sections**:
   - The committee voted to repeal several sections of the Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA) related to congregate housing and grandparent foster programs, with some members advocating for suspension instead of repeal.

### **Committee Dynamics and Future Plans**
- The meeting was conducted electronically via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with no physical location for public observation.
- Committee members engaged in detailed discussions about budget allocations, program effectiveness, and the practical challenges of budget implementation. They emphasized the importance of thorough policy review, public input, and coordination with stakeholders.
- Future meetings were planned to continue discussions on specific line items, potential add-backs, and priority requests, with a GOP caucus scheduled for further budget deliberation.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a comprehensive examination of public health funding, veterans' services, and mental health infrastructure. Committee members sought clarity on program effectiveness, funding sources, and the long-term impact of budget decisions, with a focus on ensuring adequate support for critical services while addressing fiscal constraints.
