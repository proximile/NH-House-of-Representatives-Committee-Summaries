**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee Meeting (March 4, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on March 4, 2021, to discuss several bills and issues related to labor, wages, and workers' compensation. The meeting highlighted the complexities of legislative drafting, the importance of clear language, and the need to balance worker protections with business concerns.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes:**

1. **House Bill 589: Workers' Compensation for Prophylactic Treatment**
   - The bill mandates workers' compensation to cover prophylactic treatment for critical exposure, particularly for first responders. However, confusion arose regarding its scope, with some committee members believing it applied broadly to all employees, while others argued it was intended solely for first responders.
   - **Retention Motion**: Due to the ambiguity, the committee moved to retain the bill for further clarification and potential amendments. Proposed amendments aim to clarify the bill’s scope and address concerns about its financial impact on municipalities and businesses.
   - **Historical Context**: The bill was initially proposed in response to an incident involving a first responder in Lebanon, NH, and its intent was to address workers' compensation for first responders exposed to critical risks.
   - **Next Steps**: The committee plans to hold a work session to resolve ambiguities and draft an amendment, potentially reconsidering the bill later in the session.

2. **Medical Marijuana and Workers' Compensation**
   - It was noted that a second court in New Hampshire ruled medical marijuana permissible for workers' compensation claims, suggesting potential future legislation on this issue.

3. **House Bill 501: Salary Reporting for Faculty**
   - HB 501 requires institutions to report salaries of full-time and adjunct faculty annually. Representative Cahill introduced amendments to ease compliance and ensure transparency in adjunct faculty compensation, shifting the reporting deadline to March 1st to align with W-2 deadlines.
   - **Opposition**: Representatives from the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the Community College System (CCSNH) opposed the amendment, arguing that existing transparency measures (e.g., salary books) already provide sufficient information and that the amendment would impose an administrative burden.
   - **Commitment to Transparency**: USNH and CCSNH committed to improving transparency voluntarily, such as posting adjunct pay ranges in job postings, without legislative mandates.

4. **House Bill 113: Earned Vacation Pay**
   - HB 113 addresses concerns about employers withholding vacation pay even when employees leave in good standing. Representative Cahill proposed an amendment emphasizing that vacation pay is earned compensation and should not be forfeited.
   - **Debate**: Some committee members argued the bill is unnecessary and could impose a one-size-fits-all approach, while others stressed the importance of protecting workers' earned benefits.
   - **Clarification**: The bill would only apply to employers with specific vacation policies in place.

5. **House Bill 261: Apprenticeship Program Updates**
   - HB 261 updates state laws regarding apprenticeship programs to align with federal standards in place since 2007. The bill faced initial opposition from some trade groups but was later deemed uncontroversial and passed as a housekeeping measure.
   - **Support**: The New Hampshire Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Labor support the bill to ensure uniformity in apprenticeship standards across states.

6. **House Bill 517: Minimum Wage Increase**
   - HB 517 proposes raising the minimum wage in New Hampshire. Supporters argued that raising the minimum wage is essential for providing a living wage, reducing reliance on state assistance, and improving worker morale and productivity.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents expressed concerns about the potential impact on businesses, particularly small businesses recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and opposed automatic increases tied to the Consumer Price Index.
   - **Outcome**: The committee decided to retain the bill for further review, citing the need to monitor federal developments and address specific concerns raised during the discussion.

### **Other Discussions:**
- **Pledge of Allegiance Tradition**: The committee discussed the tradition of reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in committee meetings, emphasizing its historical significance and connection to honoring workers.
- **Executive Session**: The committee moved into an executive session to review and vote on several bills, including HB 113, HB 261, HB 517, and HB 589.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting underscored the challenges of crafting legislation that balances worker protections with business concerns. The committee emphasized the importance of clear language, collaboration, and careful review to ensure bills achieve their intended purposes. Key outcomes included retaining HB 589 and HB 517 for further consideration, passing HB 261 as a non-controversial update, and addressing transparency and fairness in employment practices through discussions on HB 501 and HB 113. The committee’s approach reflects a commitment to thoughtful deliberation and responsiveness to stakeholder concerns.
