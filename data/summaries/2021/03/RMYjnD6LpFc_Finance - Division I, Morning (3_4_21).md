**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division I Meeting (March 4, 2021)**

The NH House of Representatives Finance - Division I meeting on March 4, 2021, covered a wide range of topics related to state agency operations, budgeting, financial management, and legislative proposals. The discussions highlighted efforts to modernize systems, address staffing challenges, and ensure efficient resource allocation across various state departments. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points from all four segments:

---

### **1. Modernization and System Upgrades**
- **Financial Systems Upgrade**: The state is transitioning its enterprise software to the cloud, a major project impacting all agencies. Three new positions are being added to support this upgrade, with an emphasis on ongoing maintenance to prevent obsolescence.
- **Division of Personnel**: Efforts are underway to modernize the personnel system, focusing on flexibility and speed. The bureau of education and training has shifted to a tuition-based model, and a compensation study (required by House Bill 4) is nearing completion to compare state compensation with private and public sectors.
- **Financial Data Management (FDM)**: FDM oversees New Hampshire’s business enterprise system, managing HR, payroll, and financial reporting. A proposal to move this system to the cloud aims to improve efficiency, with funding allocated for PC replacements and overtime for staff involved in the transition.

### **2. Budget and Financial Management**
- **Banking Department**: The department is entirely self-funded through fees and fines, with a proposed budget of $6,646,153 for the 2022-2023 biennium. The Public Deposit Investment Pool (PDIP), managed by the department, aggregates and invests funds from municipalities and school districts. A conflict of interest arises as the department competes with the banks it regulates to maximize returns. The Commissioner proposed separating the PDIP from the banking department to eliminate this conflict.
- **Treasury Budget**: The State Treasurer highlighted debt service, distributions to municipalities, and the Unique scholarship program. House Bill 2 proposes reallocating 60% of the scholarship funds to a new student loan relief program managed by the Business Finance Authority. Additionally, a proposal to increase the contingent debt limit by $135 million for manufacturing and biotechnology projects was discussed.
- **Graphic Services Revolving Fund**: A proposal to establish a non-lapsing revolving fund for graphic services would allow leftover funds to remain within the department for future use rather than returning to the general fund.

### **3. Staffing and Operational Efficiency**
- **Staffing Challenges**: Several divisions, including Personnel, Procurement, and Risk and Benefits, are facing staffing shortages due to retirements and turnover. Cross-training employees has been emphasized to ensure operational resilience, with multiple staff capable of handling essential tasks like payroll and procurement.
- **Procurement and P-Card Program**: The state’s procurement card (P-Card) program, which has grown significantly, was discussed. Proposals included integrating the program into the state’s budgeting process rather than keeping it as a separate off-budget item. The program generates rebate revenue that offsets general fund expenses.
- **Division of Risk and Benefits**: This division manages employee and retiree health benefits, workers' compensation, and property/casualty insurance. The successful transition of Medicare retirees to a Medicare Advantage plan resulted in significant cost savings, with an estimated $77 million lapse in general funds for fiscal year 2021.

### **4. Infrastructure and Maintenance**
- **Plant and Property**: The state manages a vast portfolio of office space and buildings, with a focus on addressing deferred maintenance and prioritizing critical repairs. The budget for plant and property is flat-funded, but there is a significant backlog of deferred maintenance. Projects include converting steam heating systems to modern solutions and rehabilitating the Gallion Office Park, which involves preserving historic buildings and addressing safety issues.
- **Public Works and Capital Projects**: The Division of Public Works oversees construction and infrastructure projects, ensuring quality control through clerks of the works. The division also handles billing for non-general fund projects, ensuring agencies cover their costs.

---

### **5. Legislative Proposals and Amendments**
- **House Bill 2 (HB2)**: Detailed discussions focused on various sections of HB2, including the consolidation of HR functions, medical subsidies, and the suspension of certain performance metrics due to staffing shortages. Amendments were proposed to address these issues and ensure efficient departmental operations.
- **Sheriff Custody Reimbursements**: A new formula based on population is being proposed to distribute reimbursements more equitably, as the current system often falls short of actual costs.

---

### **6. Strategic Financial Initiatives**
- **Cyber Insurance**: Cyber insurance, which covers the entire state government, was discussed. While currently funded through the general fund, there was consideration of reallocating this expense to IT costs for more efficient budgeting.
- **Retiree Health Benefits**: The transition to a Medicare Advantage plan for retirees has yielded substantial savings, with competitive rates secured through the procurement process.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the state’s commitment to modernizing systems, addressing staffing and maintenance challenges, and ensuring efficient financial management. Key initiatives included transitioning to cloud-based systems, cross-training employees, and optimizing budget allocations. Legislative proposals, such as amendments to HB2 and the reallocation of scholarship funds, aimed to enhance operational efficiency and address emerging needs. The discussions reflected a strategic approach to managing state resources while navigating challenges posed by staffing shortages and deferred maintenance.
