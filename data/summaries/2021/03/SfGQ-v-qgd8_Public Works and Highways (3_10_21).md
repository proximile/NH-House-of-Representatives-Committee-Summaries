### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (March 10, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on March 10, 2021, focused on a wide range of topics related to public works, highways, and capital budget requests. The meeting, conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, included detailed discussions on fleet management, capital projects, funding requests, and infrastructure improvements. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points across all segments:

---

#### **1. Department of Transportation (DOT) Priorities and Projects**
The DOT presented several critical initiatives and funding requests aimed at modernizing infrastructure, improving safety, and addressing rising costs:
- **Fleet Management and Alternative Fuel Vehicles**: The DOT is exploring the integration of alternative fuel vehicles into its fleet, particularly electric vehicles. However, challenges such as range limitations and charging infrastructure have delayed widespread adoption. The DOT is monitoring advancements in battery technology and will transition when it is cost-effective and efficient.
- **Capital Projects and Budget Adjustments**: Several capital projects, including the Manchester Patrol Shed, Lancaster District Office, and Dixville Patrol Shed, have experienced cost overruns due to COVID-19 and rising construction costs. The DOT requested an additional $2.15 million to cover these increases.
- **Fuel Management System**: The budget for a new fuel management system was reduced from $5 million to $4 million, with the DOT confident in completing the project within the revised budget.
- **Underground Fuel Tank Replacements**: The DOT highlighted the need for $500,000 to replace aging underground fuel tanks, addressing environmental risks and ensuring compliance with regulations.
- **Salt Shed Replacements**: The DOT is prioritizing the replacement of aging salt sheds across the state, aiming to replace two to three sheds per biennium to improve snow removal efficiency and public safety.

#### **2. General and Highway Fund Requests**
The DOT outlined its funding priorities, emphasizing the importance of leveraging federal funds and addressing critical infrastructure needs:
- **General Fund Requests**: Three projects totaling $1.72 million were highlighted, including airport improvements, public transit bus capital programs, and a new aircraft registration software system.
- **Highway Fund Requests**: Five priorities totaling $14.8 million were approved by the governor, including upgrades to the fuel management system, construction of a new patrol shed in Londonderry, and storage building replacements.
- **Public Transit and Human Services**: Funding will support public transit for seniors and individuals with disabilities, including vehicle replacements and infrastructure improvements like bike racks and shelters.

#### **3. University System of New Hampshire (USNH) Capital Budget**
The USNH presented its capital budget request for fiscal years 2022-23, focusing on academic and infrastructure upgrades:
- **Biological Sciences Initiative**: A $95.5 million project at UNH includes a new 50,000-square-foot addition and renovations to Spaulding Hall. Despite a $9.5 million budget increase due to COVID-related delays and rising costs, USNH will cover the additional costs without requesting further state funds.
- **Health Sciences Simulation Center**: A $9 million project funded through operating appropriations will provide instructional space for nursing and health sciences programs.
- **Future Projects**: Plans include the Smith-Nesmith Health Sciences Center in FY 2026-27, addressing growth in health sciences programs and deferred maintenance.
- **Merger with Community College System**: Chancellor Cathy Provencher discussed ongoing discussions about a potential merger with the New Hampshire Community College System to address demographic challenges and transform higher education.

#### **4. Funding Repurposing and Coordination**
The committee reviewed requests for repurposing funds and ensuring coordination between projects:
- **Department of Safety Request**: The Department of Safety sought repurposing of highway and general funds for an aviation hangar project.
- **Community College System**: The committee supported a $2.55 million request for engineering technology renovations but deferred discussions on additional requests.
- **Environmental Services**: The committee acknowledged the importance of funding environmental services to avoid potential fines and tentatively agreed to a $27 million obligation.
- **IT Projects**: Significant discussion focused on IT projects, including the "one-stop" system upgrade, with some members suggesting reallocating funds to other priorities like coastal flooding modeling.

#### **5. Piscataqua River Turning Basin Expansion**
A major focus of the meeting was the expansion of the turning basin in the Piscataqua River to improve navigation safety and accommodate larger ships:
- **Project Overview**: The $24 million project involves expanding the basin from 800 feet to 1,200 feet, with the state’s share being $8 million. The project is time-sensitive, as delays could result in funds being diverted to other harbors.
- **Economic Impact**: The project supports marine transportation, with 90% of the economic benefits staying within New Hampshire. It is critical for transporting essential products like home heating oil, asphalt, and road salt.
- **Environmental Benefits**: Dredged material will be used for beach nourishment along the seacoast, including Salisbury Beach and Plum Island.

#### **6. Broader Capital Budget Discussions**
The committee addressed various capital budget items, including funding for the Department of Agriculture, Fish and Game, Judicial Branch (e-court), Liquor Commission, Police Standards and Training, Veterans Home, and the University System. Members emphasized the need for additional bonding authority and unrestricted revenue to address deferred maintenance and infrastructure needs.

#### **7. Future Steps**
The committee scheduled a public hearing for March 16 and a work session to finalize the budget amendment by March 25, with a fallback date of March 29 if necessary. Members aimed to streamline discussions by reaching consensus on less contentious projects first.

### **Key Themes**
- **Infrastructure Modernization**: Emphasis on upgrading aging facilities, improving safety, and addressing deferred maintenance.
- **Cost Management**: Discussions on rising construction costs, budget overruns, and strategies to stay within funding limits.
- **Environmental Compliance**: Focus on replacing underground fuel tanks, using dredged material beneficially, and exploring alternative fuel vehicles.
