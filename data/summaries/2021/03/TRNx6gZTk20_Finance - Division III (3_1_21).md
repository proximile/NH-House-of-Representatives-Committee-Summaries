The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division III meeting on March 1, 2021, centered on critical issues in the state’s mental health, behavioral health, and healthcare systems, with a focus on funding, staffing, service delivery, and systemic challenges. The discussions highlighted innovative programs, ongoing struggles, and future plans to improve care across various state-operated facilities and services.

### Key Themes and Highlights:

#### **Innovative Programs and Models**
- **PATH Center**: The Psychiatric and Transitional Housing (PATH) Center, a 16-bed facility for patients transitioning from New Hampshire Hospital, was highlighted as a cost-effective and successful model. It provides intensive case management, discharge planning, and therapeutic services, reducing the daily cost of care compared to inpatient hospitalization. The program has shown promise in streamlining discharges, though long-term effectiveness requires further evaluation. There is interest in replicating this model in other regions like the Lakes Region and North Country.
- **System of Care for Children’s Behavioral Health**: The state is developing a system of care for children’s behavioral health, modeled after successful programs in Wisconsin and New Jersey. This approach emphasizes community-based services, early intervention, and reducing institutional care. The state is also expanding services for infants and young children, including diagnostic tools and parent-child bonding interventions.

#### **Funding and Budget Challenges**
- **New Hampshire Hospital**: The hospital faces significant funding challenges, particularly with the integration of wage enhancements for mental health workers and RNs. These enhancements, while necessary for recruitment and retention, have created a financial burden. The hospital also relies heavily on federal funds, including disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments, and is concerned about potential reductions in funding.
- **Glencliff Home**: The state-operated nursing home, which specializes in caring for individuals with psychiatric and developmental disabilities, is primarily funded through Medicaid. The facility faces budget constraints, particularly for payroll and direct care staff, and has had to freeze admissions intermittently due to staffing shortages.
- **Behavioral Health and Substance Misuse Services**: The state has received substantial federal funding, including $28 million from the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant, but there is uncertainty about the continuity of these funds. The state is also working to implement a statewide mobile crisis response system, though delays have occurred due to the pandemic and workforce shortages.

#### **Staffing and Workforce Issues**
- **Staffing Shortages**: Both New Hampshire Hospital and Glencliff Home are grappling with severe staffing shortages, particularly among nurses, LNAs, and mental health workers. Vacancy rates are high, and facilities have implemented strategies like temporary-to-permanent staffing contracts, overtime, and on-call duties to address these gaps. The pandemic has exacerbated burnout and recruitment challenges.
- **Wage Enhancements**: A 20% wage enhancement for mental health workers at New Hampshire Hospital has improved recruitment but created significant financial strain. Glencliff Home has also prioritized payroll-related needs, but these remain unfunded.

#### **Operational Challenges and Pandemic Impact**
- **Emergency Room Boarding**: New Hampshire Hospital is working to reduce the boarding of patients in emergency rooms while awaiting admission. This issue has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the inability to discharge patients due to limited community resources.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has significantly affected operations across facilities, including reduced admissions, increased staff workloads, and challenges in maintaining infection control. Glencliff Home remained COVID-free throughout the pandemic, with a high vaccination rate among residents and staff.

#### **Future Plans and Strategic Initiatives**
- **Expanding Services**: There is a focus on expanding community-based services, including recovery housing and peer recovery support programs. Glencliff Home plans to build a 26-bed dementia unit to address the growing need for specialized care.
- **Mobile Crisis Response**: The state is working to establish a statewide mobile crisis response system to reduce reliance on emergency departments and inpatient care.
- **988 Suicide Prevention Hotline**: The implementation of the 988 crisis number by July 2022 was highlighted as a potential funding mechanism for crisis response services.

#### **Questions and Concerns**
- Representatives raised concerns about the sustainability of funding, the feasibility of expanding services, and the long-term impacts of the pandemic on mental health services. There were also discussions about the need for additional community housing and support systems to facilitate discharges from facilities like Glencliff Home.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the state’s efforts to address systemic issues in mental health, behavioral health, and healthcare services, while navigating significant funding and staffing challenges. Innovative programs like the PATH Center and the system of care for children’s behavioral health offer promising solutions, but sustained investment and collaboration are needed to ensure long-term success. The state is focused on expanding community-based services, improving crisis response systems, and addressing the growing demand for specialized care, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
