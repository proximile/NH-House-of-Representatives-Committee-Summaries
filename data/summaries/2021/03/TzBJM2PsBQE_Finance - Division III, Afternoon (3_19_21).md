**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance - Division III Meeting (March 19, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division III, convened on March 19, 2021, to discuss and vote on budget amendments related to House Bills 1 (HB1) and 2 (HB2). The meeting focused on balancing state and federal funding, addressing immediate and long-term needs, and ensuring transparency in budget allocations. Here are the key points from the discussions:

### **Budget Amendments and Funding Adjustments**
1. **County Cap Adjustment for Nursing Homes**:
   - The committee unanimously passed an amendment to Section 24 of HB2, increasing the county cap for nursing home funding by 2% annually. This adjustment reorders funding streams to benefit the state and incorporates ongoing increases, addressing rising costs in county nursing homes.

2. **Section 37 and 38 Deletions**:
   - **Section 37**: The committee voted to delete a $1.5 million appropriation aimed at combating senior social isolation, citing concerns about administrative costs and equitable distribution. Alternatives through federal programs like the CARES Act were considered.
   - **Section 38**: A $200,000 appropriation for an admissions, discharges, and transfers (ADT) messaging program was deleted, with plans to move the funding to HB1. The program, expected to leverage a federal match for a total of $800,000, was postponed for further review.

3. **Enhanced FMAP and Medicaid Funding**:
   - Changes to the Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) were reviewed, freeing up approximately $12.1 million in general funds by reallocating federal Medicaid funds. The committee accepted these adjustments, which will be reflected in the budget.

4. **TANF Amendment**:
   - A minor amendment to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) language clarified the use of federal funds for employment-related child care, which the committee agreed to include in the final budget.

### **Revenue and Spending Priorities**
1. **Revenue Update**:
   - Representative Weiler reported an additional $127 million in revenue over the governor’s initial estimates for the biennium, driven by tax cuts and new revenue streams.

2. **Forensic Hospital Proposal**:
   - Discussions included plans for a new forensic hospital, capped at 60 beds, with considerations for operational costs and infrastructure coordination with local municipalities.

3. **Transitional Housing and Property Tax Relief**:
   - The committee explored allocating new revenue to property tax relief and funding for transitional housing for individuals exiting drug treatment, behavioral health facilities, or prison. Repurposing shuttered shopping centers for such housing was also discussed.

### **Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities**
1. **Mental Health Funding**:
   - A $14.5 million general fund increase for FY22 was allocated to mental health services, with discussions on how Enhanced FMAP impacts funding for nursing facilities and Medicaid.

2. **Developmental Disability (DD) Redesign**:
   - The committee reviewed a proposal to redesign services for individuals with developmental disabilities, including the creation of group homes. Concerns were raised about sustainability, state involvement in determining locations, and the need for stakeholder input. Representative Rogers proposed revising the amendment for further discussion.

### **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC) Closure**
1. **Closure Timeline and Logistics**:
   - Representatives debated the closure of the SYSC, with potential savings of $10 million if completed within the biennium. Discussions included relocating youth to alternative facilities, such as county jails or secure environments, and repurposing the SYSC property to generate revenue.

2. **Personnel Cost Reductions**:
   - The committee considered cutting $10 million from the HHS and veterans' home budgets by eliminating 100 full-time positions, with an emphasis on departmental transparency in reporting how these reductions would be achieved.

### **Process and Collaboration**
1. **Bipartisan Concerns**:
   - Some representatives expressed concerns about the lack of bipartisan collaboration in drafting budget amendments, contrasting it with past practices where both parties worked together line by line.

2. **Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) Constraints**:
   - The committee acknowledged the LBA’s limited bandwidth and prioritized amendments to meet tight deadlines, particularly for long-term projects like the DD redesign.

### **Future Plans**
- The committee outlined its agenda for the following week, including further discussions on HB1 and HB2 amendments. A full committee executive session was scheduled for March 25, 2021, with the goal of finalizing budget adjustments and ensuring transparency and collaboration.

**Conclusion**:
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing immediate needs with long-term sustainability, leveraging federal funds, and ensuring equitable and transparent budget allocations. Discussions underscored the complexities of budget planning, particularly in addressing mental health, developmental disabilities, and the closure of the SYSC while managing state and federal funding effectively.
