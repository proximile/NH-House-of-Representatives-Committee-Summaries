**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (February 23, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division III, convened on February 23, 2021, to discuss critical issues related to the state’s budget, with a focus on child care, housing, homelessness, and economic support programs. The meeting, held remotely due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, emphasized the importance of addressing systemic challenges, ensuring efficient use of state and federal funds, and supporting vulnerable populations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Focus Areas**

1. **Child Care and Family Support**  
   - Concerns were raised about declining numbers of children receiving child care scholarships, attributed to low unemployment and the "cliff effect," where families lose benefits as their income increases slightly.  
   - The committee emphasized the need for preventative supports to strengthen families and address workforce challenges in the child care sector, such as low wages and long hours.  
   - Budget requests were discussed, with a focus on making them more specific and measurable to ensure accountability and effective use of funds.  
   - Post-pandemic child care needs were highlighted, including potential waiting lists and the necessity for additional funding to meet demand.  

2. **Housing and Homelessness**  
   - The Bureau of Housing Supports aims to end homelessness in New Hampshire through collaborative efforts, including rental assistance, shelter services, and case management.  
   - The annual Point in Time count revealed a significant increase in homelessness, with 1,675 individuals experiencing homelessness in January 2020, including 348 unsheltered individuals.  
   - Programs like the Continuum of Care (CoC), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) were highlighted as key initiatives to address housing instability.  
   - Challenges include a severe shortage of affordable housing, with a vacancy rate of 1.8% and median rent of $1,300/month, as well as restrictive federal funding and the need for increased housing stock.  

3. **Economic and Employment Support**  
   - The Bureau of Family Assistance (BFA) provides access to programs like SNAP, TANF, and child care scholarships, supporting families' economic and social well-being.  
   - TANF caseloads decreased due to higher unemployment benefits and federal stimulus payments during the pandemic, while SNAP caseloads remained stable despite increased benefits.  
   - The Bureau of Employment Supports focuses on helping TANF and SNAP recipients gain employment through training, career guidance, and barrier reduction services like transportation and child care.  
   - The "cliff effect" was identified as a significant issue, where individuals lose benefits as their income increases, potentially leaving them worse off. Policy changes were discussed to encourage work without penalizing families.  

4. **Child Support Services**  
   - The Bureau of Child Support ensures financial and medical support for children in single-parent households, serving approximately one in six children in New Hampshire.  
   - The program disburses around $83 million annually and reduces the need for public assistance. It has exceeded national performance benchmarks, earning financial incentives reinvested into the program.  
   - Challenges include economic conditions affecting child support payments, improving customer experience, and leveraging technology for better service delivery.  

5. **Division of Economic and Housing Stability (DEHS)**  
   - DEHS, formed in 2018, focuses on strengthening families and promoting upward economic mobility through programs like comprehensive family support, community service block grants, and the Whole Families Approach to Jobs.  
   - The division emphasizes the importance of social determinants of health, such as housing stability, employment, and access to healthcare.  
   - Challenges include siloed funding streams, workforce limitations, and the lack of interoperable data systems, which hinder efficient service delivery.

### **Budget and Funding**  
- The majority of funding for housing, child care, and support services comes from federal sources, with state general funds supplementing these programs.  
- The committee reviewed budget allocations, noting reductions in general funds and increases in federal funds.  
- Discussions included the impact of the pandemic on program implementation, the need for detailed fiscal notes to understand budget changes, and the importance of accurate budgeting to avoid federal audit issues.

### **Workforce Challenges**  
- Workforce shortages in child care and direct care sectors were discussed, with low wages and long hours cited as barriers to attracting and retaining workers.  
- The committee explored partnerships with businesses and state agencies to address workforce challenges and improve access to child care.  
- Vacancies in entry-level positions and the need for specialized training, particularly for staff handling complex programs like Medicaid and SNAP, were highlighted.

### **Accomplishments and Future Goals**  
- DEHS and other divisions have been agile in responding to the pandemic, leading collaborative efforts across the state and New England.  
- Accomplishments include reducing the need for child protective services, assisting individuals in obtaining employment and education, and implementing pandemic-related programs like Pandemic EBT and online SNAP purchasing.  
- Future goals include enhancing the New Heights system, which integrates eligibility for various services, and continuing work with the New Hampshire Children’s Trust to support family resource centers.

### **Committee Questions and Concerns**  
- Legislators raised questions about the mission and scope of DEHS, potential "scope creep" into areas managed by other departments, and the impact of the hiring freeze on staffing levels.  
- Inquiries were made about TANF and SNAP funding, refugee assistance, and the potential for reducing office space due to remote work.  
- The committee emphasized the need for improved technology to support staff and enhance customer service, as well as addressing staff vacancies and turnover.
