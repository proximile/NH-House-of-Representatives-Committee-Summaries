### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Finance - Division II, DOE, Part II (3/3/21)

On March 3, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss critical issues related to education funding, focusing on the Department of Education's budget, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the equitable distribution of resources to public and charter schools. The meeting addressed a range of topics, including the adequacy funding formula, public school infrastructure, charter school support, and the challenges posed by fluctuating enrollments and federal aid utilization. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

#### **1. Education Funding and Adequacy Formula**
   - **Adequacy Funding**: The adequacy funding formula provides base aid and differentiated support for students eligible for free and reduced-price meals (FNR), English language learners, special education students, and third graders below reading proficiency. Charter schools receive an additional $3,479.22 per pupil. In 2021, a one-time $60 million adequacy aid was distributed to address fiscal capacity disparities and support schools with high percentages of FNR-eligible students.
   - **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)**: SWEPT funds education, with some communities retaining "excess swept" funds when the tax generates more than needed for adequacy. Charter schools do not receive these excess funds, creating disparities in funding calculations.
   - **COVID-19 Impact on Enrollment**: The pandemic led to a 4% decline in public school enrollments, particularly in preschool and FNR-eligible students. To mitigate this, the governor’s budget proposal adjusted FNR calculations using pre-pandemic ratios and held schools harmless for enrollment drops.

#### **2. Charter School Funding and Support**
   - **Charter School Lease Aid**: The lease aid program covers 30% of annual lease costs, up to $30,000 per school. In fiscal year 2021, $500,000 was allocated, fully funding eligible schools. With two new charter schools opening in fall 2021, a proposed bill seeks to increase the cap to $50,000.
   - **Federal and State Aid**: Charter schools, like public schools, received federal aid through programs such as the CARES Act and ESSER funds. However, the use of ESSER funds for lease aid remains unclear, and some communities with "excess swept" funds were ineligible for state stabilization grants.

#### **3. Public School Infrastructure Fund**
   - **Infrastructure Projects**: Established in 2017 with $28 million, the Public School Infrastructure Fund reimbursed schools for E-rate state match (fiber connections), life safety improvements, and security enhancements. By December 2020, all funds had been awarded, with $32 million distributed. Approximately 95-98% of school districts received funding, with $24 million allocated for security improvements like cameras, door locks, and vestibules.
   - **Future Considerations**: The committee discussed the possibility of extending the fund and increasing support for infrastructure projects in the upcoming biennium.

#### **4. Pandemic-Related Challenges and Federal Aid**
   - **Enrollment Fluctuations**: Homeschooling and private school enrollments saw significant changes during the pandemic, with homeschooling numbers increasing sharply. Reporting inconsistencies for homeschool students have complicated data collection.
   - **Federal Funding Utilization**: Schools received substantial one-time federal aid to address COVID-19-related expenses, including HVAC improvements. However, challenges remain in applying these funds to specific needs, such as charter school lease aid.

---

#### **5. Budgeting and Future Planning**
   - **Budget Uncertainties**: The committee acknowledged the difficulty of budgeting for future years due to uncertainties around COVID-19 and enrollment trends. The governor’s budget proposal aims to address these issues by adjusting FNR calculations and providing stability for schools.
   - **Public Hearings and Meetings**: Additional meetings were scheduled to discuss department budgets and programs, emphasizing the need for thorough understanding of funding needs before making budget decisions.

---

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of education funding during the pandemic, with a focus on ensuring adequacy for all schools, addressing enrollment declines, and leveraging federal aid. Discussions highlighted the need for equitable distribution of resources, continued support for public and charter school infrastructure, and proactive planning to navigate ongoing challenges. The committee’s deliberations reflected a commitment to maintaining educational quality and accessibility across New Hampshire.
