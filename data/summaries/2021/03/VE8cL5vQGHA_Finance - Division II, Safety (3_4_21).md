**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II - Safety Meeting (March 4, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened on March 4, 2021, to discuss safety-related budget and operational priorities for the 2022-2023 biennium. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on the Department of Safety’s efforts to balance budget constraints with the need to maintain essential public safety services. Key discussions and highlights included:

### **Meeting Logistics and Public Access**
The meeting was held virtually, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone. Roll call attendance was taken, with members stating their locations and whether others were present.

### **Facility Management and Operations**
The Department of Safety oversees a mix of owned, leased, and rented facilities across the state, primarily used by the State Police and the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Maintenance and operational costs for these facilities are funded by the department. The Homeland Security building was highlighted as a critical hub for emergency operations, housing 911 call centers, the fire marshal’s office, and other public safety functions.

### **Staffing and Budget Challenges**
The department faces significant staffing challenges, with 23 unfilled trooper positions from previous budgets and 50 newly unfunded positions for the 2022-2023 biennium. To address these gaps, the department prioritizes positions based on public safety needs and explores reallocating funds across general, highway, federal, and other sources to minimize service delivery impacts. Key prioritized positions include:
- Criminalists in toxicology and digital evidence for the state forensic lab.
- An attorney for the hearings bureau to manage adjudicative hearings.
- A full-time program assistant for the DMV’s ignition interlock program.
- Licensing examiners for driver testing.
- A human resources technician for risk management.

### **DMV Services and Modernization**
The DMV has adapted to the pandemic by expanding online services, such as license renewals and ticket payments, and transitioning to appointment-based in-person services for eye exams and driving tests. These changes have been well-received and may continue post-pandemic. The DMV’s broad reach across the state and its importance to residents with driver’s licenses or vehicles were emphasized.

### **Forensic Lab and Critical Services**
The committee discussed unfunded positions in the forensic lab, particularly in toxicology, digital evidence, and pattern evidence. Prioritizing high-risk services and minimizing delays in processing evidence were identified as critical needs.

### **Body Camera Fund**
A new section in HB2 proposes a $1 million fund to provide grants to local police departments for implementing body cameras. The committee highlighted the administrative challenges of managing the program and the need for a dedicated program specialist to oversee it.

### **Radio Interoperability Infrastructure**
The state’s radio interoperability system was addressed, with a focus on the need for a centralized, efficient approach to avoid redundancy and ensure seamless communication across agencies. Past performance audits and ongoing efforts to improve the system were discussed.

### **Transfer Authority and Unfunded Positions**
The committee considered granting the Department of Safety authority to reallocate funds to fill unfunded positions, similar to authority granted to other departments like Health and Human Services.

### **Mechanical Licensing Board Transfer**
A proposal to move the Mechanical Licensing Board to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) was discussed as a logical reorganization.

### **Next Steps**
The committee concluded with plans to review the Department of Safety’s budget line-by-line in a subsequent session and to address technical corrections and funding adjustments. Discussions with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regarding safety positions and funding were also planned.

The meeting underscored the department’s commitment to maintaining essential public safety services while navigating budget constraints and adapting to evolving challenges.
