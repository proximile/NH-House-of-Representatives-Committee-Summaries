The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on March 10, 2021, conducted remotely via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed a wide range of bills and amendments, with a focus on civil liberties, housing issues, government transparency, and emergency powers. The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing individual rights, public health, and effective governance during a state of emergency. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Civil Liberties and Religious Freedoms**
- **Representative Sylvia's Amendment (0486h) to House Bill 440**: This amendment shifted the focus from religious liberties to broader civil liberties during states of emergency, allowing constitutional arguments against restrictions on civil liberties. While some representatives supported it as a safeguard for civil rights, others argued it was unnecessary and could set a dangerous precedent.
- **House Bill 542**: This bill ensured religious organizations are treated no worse than other essential services during emergencies. An amendment (0623h) clarified that religious organizations should operate under the same conditions as essential services. The amendment passed 11-10, but the bill sparked debate over balancing religious freedoms with public health.

### **Housing and Rent Issues**
- **House Bill 550**: Proposed a 30-day extension for non-payment of rent cases during the pandemic, allowing tenants more time to apply for rental assistance. Supporters argued it would help utilize federal relief funds efficiently, while opponents expressed concerns about the impact on landlords and rising rents.
- **House Bill 288**: Aimed to eliminate the Housing Appeal Board, but the committee voted 15-6 to recommend it as "inexpedient to legislate," with some members arguing the board is still new and needs time to prove its effectiveness.

### **Government Transparency and Remote Meetings**
- **House Bill 216**: Addressed public notice of access to meetings, with significant debate over remote meeting options. The committee voted 11-10 to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate," with a minority report filed to support it. Representative Simpson proposed an amendment to clarify the use of remote meetings.
- **House Bill 630**: Allowed remote participation in public board meetings, with an amendment to remove a section related to remote meetings under RSA 91-A. The amendment passed, and the bill was recommended for passage.
- **House Bill 232**: Aimed to increase transparency in non-public sessions under the Right-to-Know Law. The committee voted 15-6 to recommend it as "inexpedient to legislate," with a minority report filed.

### **Emergency Powers and Property Rights**
- **House Bill 402**: Required a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate to approve property takings during emergencies. The committee narrowly voted 11-10 to recommend the bill as "ought to pass," with a minority report filed.
- **House Bill 149**: Addressed civil immunities during public health emergencies. The committee voted unanimously (21-0) to retain the bill for further work, citing unresolved concerns from the legal community.

### **Other Key Bills and Discussions**
- **House Bill 540**: Focused on supportive decision-making as an alternative to guardianship, aiming to protect the rights and dignity of individuals needing assistance. It passed unanimously with an amendment (0565h) that clarified language and addressed concerns.
- **House Bill 561**: Aimed to clean up voter rolls to prevent duplicate voting and streamline jury duty lists. Some members argued it was more about voter integrity than jury duty.
- **House Bill 566**: Required regular review of sealed minutes from non-public sessions to increase transparency. Supporters emphasized accountability, while opponents argued it placed an unnecessary burden on public bodies.
- **House Bill 578**: Directed the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to develop standards for mental health courts. Some members felt it was unnecessary, while others highlighted the lack of national standards and the need for consistency.
- **House Bill 379**: Addressed electronic notice and was retained for further consideration.
- **House Bill 418**: Focused on Supreme Court reporting and was unanimously retained for further work due to concerns about timing and record-keeping.

- Despite disagreements on certain issues, members acknowledged the efficient and respectful handling of business.

### **General Themes**
