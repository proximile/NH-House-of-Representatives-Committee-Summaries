**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division II Meeting (March 16, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division II meeting on March 16, 2021, focused on critical issues related to education funding, specifically **school building aid** and **special education funding**. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, addressed two key bills: **House Bill 594 (HB 594)** and **House Bill 613 (HB 613)**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. School Building Aid (HB 594)**
HB 594 aimed to address the backlog of school building projects and restore funding for the **School Building Aid Program**, which has been largely unfunded since 2010. Key points included:

- **10-Year Plan**: The bill proposed a 10-year plan to manage state and school district needs, providing predictability and better budgeting for long-term projects. However, concerns were raised about the state potentially influencing local decisions by ranking projects, which could pressure voters to approve projects they might not otherwise support.
  
- **Retroactive Funding**: Representative Cahill advocated for retroactive funding for projects completed during the moratorium, suggesting a 50% reimbursement for affected communities spread over several years. The total cost of these projects was estimated at **$537 million**, with the state’s share being **$186 million**.

- **Funding Model**: The **80-20 funding model** (80% upfront, 20% later) was discussed, with concerns that high upfront costs might limit the number of projects that could be funded.

- **Local Control and Equity**: Representative Hill, chair of the School Building Authority, noted that many projects on the waiting list had not yet been approved by local voters, leading to wasted effort and resources. Some wealthier districts are moving forward with projects **without state funding**, raising questions about the fairness of providing aid to districts that may not need it.

- **Funding Source**: The bill proposed moving building aid from the **Education Trust Fund** back to the **General Fund**, which some members opposed due to the General Fund’s current financial struggles. The Education Trust Fund was seen as a more stable source for building aid.

- **Demographic Challenges**: New Hampshire’s declining student population and aging demographics were discussed, with some members questioning whether building new schools is the best use of resources. Alternatives, such as lowering the **statewide property tax** or increasing the **adequate education grant**, were suggested.

**Outcome**: A motion to **retain HB 594** was made and seconded, allowing further review of the bill. The motion passed unanimously (7-0).

### **2. Special Education Funding (HB 613)**
HB 613 focused on addressing the financial burden of high-cost special education students by allowing districts to form **municipal risk pools** to share costs. Key points included:

- **Cost Predictor Tool**: A **cost predictor tool** was discussed, which helps districts estimate their special education expenses and plan accordingly. Representatives noted that while special education costs are unpredictable and vary widely across districts, statewide trends show some predictability.

- **Risk Pool Concept**: Concerns were raised about the lack of public input on the risk pool concept, but it was clarified that the bill is enabling legislation, not a mandate. The risk pools would provide a mechanism for districts to share the financial burden of high-cost special education students.

**Outcome**: A motion to **retain HB 613** was made and seconded, allowing further review of the bill. The motion passed unanimously (7-0).

### **Key Arguments and Tensions**
- **Support for HB 594**: Proponents argued that the bill is necessary to address the deteriorating state of school buildings, support local taxpayers, and ensure New Hampshire remains attractive to young families and businesses.
  
- **Opposition to HB 594**: Critics raised concerns about the cost, the potential for overbuilding, and the impact on the General Fund. They also questioned whether the state should prioritize building aid over other educational needs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the urgent need to address school infrastructure and special education funding in New Hampshire. The discussions emphasized the importance of a **10-year plan** for school building aid, **retroactive funding** for past projects, and careful consideration of funding sources. The debate underscored the tension between addressing immediate infrastructure needs and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The committee plans to continue reviewing both bills to ensure a balanced approach that supports the state’s education system while safeguarding taxpayer interests.

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene later in the day for a full finance committee session, including a public hearing on **HB1** and **HB2**, which had already generated significant public interest and testimony.
