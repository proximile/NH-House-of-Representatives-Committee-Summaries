### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Municipal and County Government (March 8, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 8, 2021, to discuss several bills related to municipal and county government. The meeting, conducted virtually via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed a wide range of issues, including budget committee responsibilities, housing affordability, immigration enforcement, and local governance. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Budget Committee Responsibilities (HB 484 and HB 512)**
- **HB 484**: This bill sought to clarify that budget committees should focus solely on fiscal appropriations and avoid involvement in governance or policy matters, such as school board composition or curriculum changes. Supporters argued that budget committees should adhere to their fiduciary role under RSA 32, while opponents contended that they should be able to comment on non-monetary issues with potential financial impacts.
- **HB 512**: This bill addressed emergency housing assistance, prohibiting towns from conditioning aid on building inspections. An amendment aligned the bill with RSA 165, which mandates emergency assistance for indigent persons. The bill and amendment passed after debate.

#### **2. Housing Affordability and "Missing Middle" Housing (HB 341 and HB 588)**
- **HB 341**: Aimed at addressing New Hampshire’s housing crisis, this bill sought to legalize "missing middle" housing—multi-family units (up to four units) in residential zones with municipal water and sewer systems. Supporters highlighted its potential to increase affordability, support aging in place, and leverage existing infrastructure. Opponents raised concerns about infrastructure strain, loss of local zoning control, and ambiguous language. The bill ultimately failed, with a motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) approved.
- **HB 588**: Focused on building codes for tiny houses, this bill removed references to tiny homes on wheels. Despite support for addressing affordable housing, it was moved to ITL, with members arguing that such decisions should remain at the local level.

#### **3. Residency Requirements for Local Land Use Boards (HB 392)**
- This bill required all voting members of local land use boards, including ex-officio members, to be residents of the municipality they serve. The bill arose from a case in Portsmouth where non-resident ex-officio members influenced a planning board decision. Opponents, including the NH Municipal Association, argued that existing law already addressed residency requirements, while supporters emphasized the importance of local representation.

#### **4. SB2 Adoption Process (HB 374)**
- This bill sought to revert the process of adopting SB2 (Official Ballot Referendum form of town meeting) to the official ballot, rather than requiring a vote at a town meeting. Supporters argued it would increase voter participation, particularly for those unable to attend traditional meetings. Opponents contended that adopting SB2 is a significant decision that should be debated at town meetings. The bill passed narrowly (10-9).

#### **5. Immigration Enforcement and Sanctuary Policies (HB 266)**
- **HB 266**: This controversial bill aimed to prohibit sanctuary policies and enforce federal immigration laws at the state and local level. Supporters, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), argued it was necessary for public safety, citing cases of criminal activity by undocumented immigrants. Opponents raised constitutional concerns (e.g., Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments), potential racial profiling, and the erosion of trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Despite strong opposition, the bill passed.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

1. **Clarity in Governance**: Several bills, such as HB 484 and HB 392, aimed to clarify roles and responsibilities in local governance. While some passed, others faced opposition over concerns about redundancy or unintended consequences.

2. **Housing Crisis**: The discussion of HB 341 and HB 588 highlighted the urgent need for affordable housing in New Hampshire. While there was broad recognition of the crisis, disagreements over state vs. local control and infrastructure impacts led to the failure of key housing bills.

3. **Immigration Enforcement**: HB 266 sparked intense debate over the role of state and local governments in enforcing federal immigration laws. Supporters emphasized public safety, while opponents raised constitutional, ethical, and practical concerns.

4. **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Many discussions, particularly around housing and SB2 adoption, centered on the balance between local autonomy and state intervention. Opponents of state mandates argued for preserving local decision-making, while supporters highlighted the need for statewide solutions to pressing issues.

5. **Procedural and Technical Challenges**: The virtual format of the meeting led to technical difficulties, including Zoom connectivity issues, muting problems, and delays in recognizing speakers. These challenges underscored the complexities of conducting legislative business remotely.
