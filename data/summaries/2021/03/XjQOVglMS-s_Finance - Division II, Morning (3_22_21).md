### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Committee (Division II) Meeting - March 22, 2021

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee (Division II) convened electronically on March 22, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone. The meeting focused on the Department of Education’s budget, addressing critical funding issues, federal stimulus allocations, and infrastructure needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions across all segments:

---

#### **1. Education Funding Challenges**
   - **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**:
     - The current budget allocates $9 million annually for CTE tuition and transportation, consistent with previous years. Fully funding CTE would require an additional $5.1 million, totaling $14 million annually.
     - Increasing funding would raise the state’s maintenance of effort (MOE) level, making future reductions difficult and increasing dependency on federal Perkins grants.
   - **Special Education Aid**:
     - The catastrophic special education aid program reimburses school districts for costs exceeding 3.5 times the average per-pupil expenditure. Pending legislation proposes lowering the threshold to 2.5 times, increasing costs by $10 million annually.
     - The number of eligible students has declined to 742 in FY21, partly due to the pandemic. Reimbursements are prorated if funding is insufficient, impacting local taxpayers.
   - **Court-Ordered Placements**:
     - Funding for court-ordered placements has increased in recent years, and the state is required to cover these costs even if they exceed the budget.

#### **2. Adequacy Funding and Building Aid**
   - **Adequacy Funding**:
     - The committee discussed proposals to address funding shortfalls caused by a decline in free/reduced lunch applications during the pandemic. Using 2020 data to maintain funding levels would cost an additional $28 million.
   - **Building Aid**:
     - The state’s school building aid program faces a backlog of approved projects, with $26 million in "tail money" owed to districts. Early payment of some obligations was proposed to free up future funding.
   - **Public School Infrastructure Fund**:
     - The governor proposed allocating $30 million for school infrastructure projects, including safety and e-rate initiatives. However, a $1.2 million waitlist exists, and no funds are available without new appropriations.

#### **3. Federal Stimulus Funds**
   - **Allocation and Expenditure**:
     - Federal stimulus packages (CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act) provided significant funding to New Hampshire schools. Funds are allocated based on Title I formulas, with flexibility for COVID-related expenses.
     - Concerns were raised about slow spending of allocated funds, with only $9 million of $34 million reimbursed and $140 million not yet requested by districts.
   - **Reimbursement Process**:
     - School districts must spend funds before being reimbursed by the state. The Department of Education ensures compliance with federal requirements and processes reimbursements quickly to avoid financial strain on districts.
   - **Flexibility for Construction**:
     - New federal stimulus money offers rare flexibility for construction projects, though compliance restrictions apply.

#### **4. Modernizing Education Systems**
   - **Student Information System Upgrade**:
     - The Department of Education requested $1.5 million annually to upgrade its outdated student information system, which is critical for data collection and reporting.
     - The new system would automate data validation, reduce manual work, and improve efficiency. It would interface with existing district systems (e.g., PowerSchool, Alma) without requiring vendor changes.
   - **Privacy and Data Collection**:
     - The system would adhere to FERPA regulations, collecting only data required for state and federal reporting.
   - **Federal Grant Utilization**:
     - Federal grants have funded the initial purchase of the new system, but ongoing operating costs require state funding.
   - **Efficiency and Cost Savings**:
     - The new system is expected to save significant time for school districts, potentially reducing the need for full-time staff dedicated to data entry. The department hopes to negotiate discounts for districts using the state-selected vendor.

---

#### **5. Maintenance of Effort (MOE) and Future Considerations**
   - The committee emphasized the implications of increasing funding for CTE and special education, as it would raise the MOE, making future reductions challenging and potentially impacting federal funding.
   - Upcoming legislative briefings, budget presentations, and voting were outlined, highlighting the importance of informed decision-making given the influx of federal funds and tight timelines.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of managing education funding, balancing state and local financial responsibilities, and addressing backlogs in building aid and infrastructure projects. The discussions highlighted the need for modernized systems, efficient use of federal stimulus funds, and strategic planning to ensure adequate funding for schools while navigating federal requirements and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
