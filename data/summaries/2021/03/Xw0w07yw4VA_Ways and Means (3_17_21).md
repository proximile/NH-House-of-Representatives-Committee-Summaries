### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on March 17, 2021

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on March 17, 2021, to discuss a range of fiscal and tax-related issues, focusing on revenue projections, tax policies, and the impact of federal stimulus measures. The meeting also addressed the growing issue of **credit carry forward (CCO)** in the state’s tax system, with significant implications for the state’s financial health and budget planning. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Revenue Projections and Economic Recovery**
The committee reviewed and revised revenue estimates for fiscal years (FY) 2022 and 2023, considering the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of federal stimulus packages, including the **American Rescue Plan**.

- **Initial Revenue Estimates**: Growth estimates of **1-3% for FY22** and **4-6% for FY23** were questioned, with suggestions to increase these projections due to optimistic economic trends.
- **Business Taxes**: Discussions focused on adjusting business tax growth rates to **2-4% for FY22** and **4-5% for FY23**, reflecting higher-than-expected revenue collections in February 2021.
- **Meals and Rooms Tax**: February revenues exceeded expectations, with optimism about increased tourism and restaurant activity as vaccination rates rise and the economy reopens.
- **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: The strong real estate market was highlighted, with rising home prices and increased demand. However, concerns were raised about the sustainability of this trend and the potential for a housing bubble.
- **Federal Stimulus Impact**: The committee discussed how federal stimulus funds could boost economic activity, particularly in sectors like tourism, hospitality, and small businesses.
- **State of Emergency**: The potential lifting of the state of emergency was noted as a factor that could further influence economic recovery and revenue projections.
- **Housing Crisis**: The ongoing housing shortage in New Hampshire was emphasized, with members noting its impact on economic growth and the need for more workforce and affordable housing.

### **2. Business Tax Credit Carry Forward (CCO) Issue**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on the growing issue of businesses accumulating large amounts of **credit carry forward (CCO)** on their tax accounts, which impacts state revenue and budget planning.

- **Current Situation**: The state holds over **$270 million in CCOs**, representing overpayments by taxpayers that can be carried forward to future tax years. Some businesses have CCO balances exceeding **200-300% of their expected tax liabilities**, leading to inflated revenue projections.
- **Concerns**:
  - **Liquidity**: CCOs are cash reserves held by the state, and limiting them could require refunds, impacting the state’s cash flow.
  - **Accounting Practices**: The state has not recorded CCOs as liabilities on its financial statements, raising audit concerns. Auditors have flagged the issue but have not required adjustments, as the estimated liability (around **$60 million**) is not material to the state’s overall financial position.
  - **Taxpayer Behavior**: Uncertainty exists about how taxpayers will respond—whether they’ll reduce estimated payments or request refunds, which could spread the fiscal impact over several years.
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - **Capping CCOs**: **House Bill 2 (HB2)** proposes capping CCOs at **50% of a taxpayer’s liability**, but alternative options were discussed, such as capping at **100% or 200%** and phasing in the reduction over multiple years to mitigate the fiscal impact.
  - **Phased Approach**: A gradual reduction (e.g., 200% in year one, 100% in year two) could spread the financial impact over 3-5 years, reducing immediate strain on the budget.
- **Stakeholder Input**:
  - **State Treasurer Monica Mizapelli**: Highlighted the uncertainty around taxpayer behavior and the need to work closely with the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) to manage the transition.
  - **DRA Representative Carolyn Lear**: Explained that the CCOs are all cash and that refunds could be issued directly or through reduced future revenues, depending on taxpayer actions.
  - **Comptroller Dana Call**: Emphasized the accounting challenges and auditors’ concerns, noting that while the issue is significant, it has not yet been deemed material enough to require changes to the state’s financial statements.

### **3. Legislative Changes in House Bill 2 (HB2)**
The committee discussed several tax-related provisions in **HB2**, including:

- **Meals and Rooms Tax Reduction**: Reducing the tax from **9% to 8.5%**, which would decrease revenue by approximately **$11.4 million in FY22** and **$11.9 million in FY23**.
- **Business Enterprise Tax (BET) Threshold**: Increasing the threshold to **$250,000**, with no immediate revenue impact in FY22 but a projected **$3.1 million decrease in FY23**.
- **Interest and Dividends Tax**: Phasing out the tax over five years, with significant revenue losses projected in future years.
- **Liquor License Fees and Gaming Revenue**: The committee considered the fiscal impact of proposed changes to liquor license fees and historic horse racing gaming revenue, including the state’s share of gaming proceeds.

### **4. Next Steps**
The committee planned to finalize revenue estimates for FY 2022 and FY 2023 to provide updated figures to the Finance Committee. Members emphasized the importance of addressing the CCO issue to ensure accurate revenue projections and budget planning. Additional documentation, including the annual analysis of CCOs and the auditors’ findings, was requested to better understand the issue and determine the appropriate cap level (50%, 100%, or 200%) and implementation timeline.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Cautious Optimism**: The meeting reflected cautious optimism about economic recovery, with adjustments to revenue estimates to reflect changing economic conditions and federal stimulus impacts.
- **Complex Balancing Act**: The committee grappled with balancing fiscal responsibility with the need to support businesses, particularly during economic uncertainty.
- **Focus on CCOs**: Addressing the growing CCO issue emerged as a critical priority, with a focus on minimizing fiscal disruption while ensuring compliance with accounting standards.
- **Collaborative Approach**: Stakeholders, including the DRA, State Treasurer, and Comptroller, emphasized the need for close collaboration to manage the transition and mitigate potential fiscal impacts.

In summary, the meeting highlighted the complexity of fiscal planning in a rapidly changing economic environment, with a focus on accurate revenue projections, responsible tax policy, and addressing long-term financial challenges like the CCO issue.
