The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on March 18, 2021, focused on detailed discussions and decisions regarding revenue estimates, fiscal planning, and legislative changes for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, addressed a wide range of topics, including revenue adjustments, tourism, gaming, and the management of business tax credit carryovers. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points:

### **Revenue Estimates and Fiscal Planning**
1. **Revenue Adjustments and Forecasting Challenges**:
   - The committee discussed revenue adjustments, noting that certain legislative suspensions reduced funding but did not eliminate it, leaving agencies with fewer resources.
   - The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) highlighted difficulties in providing specific revenue figures due to pandemic-related uncertainties but indicated updates would follow as recovery progressed.

2. **Business Tax Revenue**:
   - A significant portion of the meeting focused on business tax revenue estimates for FY21. After debate, the committee compromised at $837 million, which was unanimously approved.
   - For FY22 and FY23, the committee settled on a 2.5% growth rate for business taxes, resulting in projections of $847.7 million and $870 million, respectively.

3. **Other Revenue Sources**:
   - **Insurance Tax Revenue**: Exceeded projections, with estimates for FY22 and FY23 ranging from $127 million to $135 million.
   - **Liquor Commission Revenue**: Projected $129 million for FY21 and $138.3 million for FY22, with transfers to the general fund based on statutory requirements.
   - **Lottery Revenue**: Updated estimates reflected higher-than-expected performance, with FY21 expected to exceed initial projections. Historic horse racing gaming was projected to generate $12.8 million in FY23.
   - **Meals and Rooms Tax**: Estimates were set at $311 million (FY21), $341 million (FY22), and $360 million (FY23).
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Estimates were $194 million (FY21), $182 million (FY22), and $171 million (FY23).

### **Legislative Changes and Revenue Impacts**
1. **Tax Rate Changes**:
   - A decrease in the meals and rooms tax rate from 9% to 8.5% would reduce revenues by $1.4 million in FY22 and $19 million in FY23.
   - A decrease in the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) rate from 0.6% to 0.55% would reduce revenues by $4.7 million in FY22 and $13.3 million in FY23.
   - The phase-out of the Interest and Dividends (IND) tax would reduce revenues by $6 million in FY22 and $12 million in FY23.

2. **Single Sales Factor Implementation**:
   - The delay in implementing the single sales factor would restore $20 million in revenues.

### **Tourism and Gaming**
1. **Tourism**:
   - The Division of Travel and Tourism highlighted the severe impact of COVID-19 on the industry, with over 40,000 layoffs. Marketing efforts were emphasized as crucial for recovery, with a strong return on investment of $3 in tax revenue for every $1 spent on marketing.
   - Concerns were raised about the suspension of tourism marketing funding for two years under HB2, though the travel and tourism fund would still receive approximately $17 million.

2. **Gaming**:
   - Discussions on historic horse racing gaming projected $12.8 million in FY23. The 12% takeout rate was defended as conservative, with potential for increased activity at lower rates.
   - Sports betting and lottery revenues were also discussed, with optimism about future growth.

### **Business Profits Tax Credit Carryforward**
1. **Phase-In Model**:
   - The committee adopted a phase-in model to limit the business profits tax credit carryforward, capping it at 500% of tax liability in 2022, reducing it to 250% in 2025, and further reducing it to 100% in 2027.

2. **Establishment of a Commission**:
   - A commission was established to study the issue further, including members from the DRA, the Controller's Office, the Treasurer's Office, the accounting industry, and legislative members. The commission’s findings, due by November 1, 2021, would inform future adjustments.

3. **Fiscal Impact**:
   - The fiscal impact of the amendment was estimated at $4 million in FY 2022 and $11 million in FY 2023, reducing the potential negative revenue impact compared to existing provisions in HB2.

### **Process and Compromise**
- The committee emphasized the importance of compromise, averaging Democrat and Republican proposals to reach consensus on revenue estimates. All motions passed unanimously (24-0), reflecting a collaborative approach to fiscal planning.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a focus on aligning revenue projections with fiscal planning, ensuring transparency, and preparing for upcoming budget discussions. The committee’s decisions aimed to balance immediate fiscal measures with a structured, long-term approach to managing the state’s financial health, particularly in light of pandemic-related challenges.
