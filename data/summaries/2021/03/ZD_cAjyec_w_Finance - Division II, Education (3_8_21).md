The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division II, Education meeting on March 8, 2021, conducted electronically due to the governor's emergency order, focused on detailed discussions about the state's budget, education funding, and various programs. The meeting highlighted key areas of concern, adjustments, and initiatives aimed at addressing the state's educational needs and challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all three segments:

---

### **Budget and Funding Overview**
The state faces significant budgetary challenges, including a $6 million shortfall in the education fund. Representatives emphasized the need to prioritize programs and make difficult decisions about resource allocation. The Department of Education (DOE) requested several budget adjustments, including funding for new positions and program modifications. Key funding discussions included:

- **Federal Relief Funds**: The state expects up to $300 million in additional federal education funds, expected to be allocated by September 2022 and spent by 2023. These funds will focus on addressing learning loss, summer programming, and other educational needs.
- **Grant Funds**: Delays in distributing school funds were attributed to necessary modifications to the grant management system. A programmer has been hired to implement these changes, and preliminary allocation estimates have been provided to schools.
- **CARES Act Funds**: Federal funds allocated under the CARES Act are distributed based on Title I formulas, with efforts to ensure districts can access and utilize these resources effectively.

### **Programs and Initiatives**
Several educational programs were discussed, with a focus on their effectiveness, funding needs, and potential changes:

1. **Dropout Prevention Program**: Initiated in 2008-2009, this program has successfully reduced dropout rates. However, its elimination is being considered due to other policy decisions (e.g., increased compulsory education age) and programs (e.g., adult education) that have contributed to lower dropout rates.
2. **Adult Education**: This program, which includes workforce development and adult diploma programs, has seen increased enrollment since the pandemic. It serves a significant number of students, including English language learners, and has been effective in helping students earn high school diplomas or equivalencies.
3. **Vocational Rehabilitation**: The program assists individuals with disabilities or injuries in returning to the workforce, with the state providing matching funds for federal support.
4. **Dual Enrollment Program**: Concerns were raised about the potential discontinuation of this program, which benefits approximately 6,000 students annually. The DOE suggested that the community college system might be better suited to manage it.
5. **Student Wellness Program**: A new accounting unit for student wellness was discussed, involving the reallocation of existing positions to better align with program needs.
6. **Preschool Development Grant**: A new $33 million grant, in collaboration with the University of New Hampshire and the Department of Health and Human Services, aims to support preschool development initiatives.

### **Charter Schools and Oversight**
The committee discussed the implications of grant-funded positions, particularly those related to charter schools. If grants were to disappear, so would the positions. With the increase in charter schools, the DOE has implemented monitoring processes and compliance checks to ensure adherence to state and federal regulations. Charter schools are required to take the same assessments as traditional public schools, transitioning from the NECAP to the Smarter Balance Assessment and now to the New Hampshire SAS.

### **Technology and Infrastructure**
The DOE highlighted the need for a new student information system to replace the outdated i4c system developed in 2001. While federal funds have been secured for the initial purchase, ongoing operational costs of approximately $1.5 million annually would need to be covered by the state. The new system would improve data collection, security, and efficiency for school districts.

### **Legislative and Operational Adjustments**
Several legislative and operational adjustments were discussed:

- **Bus Driver Credentialing**: New legislation requiring background checks for school bus drivers necessitated the creation of a new position in the Bureau of Credentialing.
- **Court-Ordered Placements**: The committee inquired about the costs and reasons behind court-ordered placements for students, including out-of-district educational placements. The DOE committed to providing more detailed information.
- **National Forest Land Grant**: Funds from this grant are distributed to communities with national forests based on a federal formula.
- **Advanced Placement (AP) Fees**: The budget for AP test fees was reduced to $50,000 for 2021, down from $100,000 in the previous year, due to disruptions caused by the pandemic.

---

### **Federal and State Collaboration**
The commissioner expressed support for the governor's proposal to create a combined oversight board for the community college and university systems, which would help create seamless pathways for students. Additionally, the DOE received two grants after the budgeting process: the Promising Future Grants and the Purple Star Grant program, both requiring additional funding.

### **Public Health Announcement**
A representative shared a public service announcement about ensuring the correct COVID-19 vaccine is administered, highlighting an incident where a neighbor received the wrong vaccine.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on the budget, including potential changes to House Bill 2 and further examination of education funding issues. The committee sought clarity on budget adjustments, program implementations, and the distribution of federal funds to support New Hampshire's education system. The DOE emphasized transparency, accountability, and the efficient use of resources to address the state's educational needs.
