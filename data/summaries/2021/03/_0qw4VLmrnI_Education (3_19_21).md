The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Education Committee held a series of meetings on March 19, 2021, to discuss the potential merger of the state’s community college system and university system. The discussions were comprehensive, reflecting the complexity and significance of such a merger. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and considerations from all segments:

### **Purpose and Scope of the Merger**
The primary goal of the merger is to create a unified higher education structure that maximizes resources, improves efficiency, and addresses declining enrollment and financial challenges. The committee emphasized the need for a strategic, student-centered approach that aligns with regional and statewide economic needs. The merger is seen as an opportunity to enhance educational quality, affordability, and accessibility while maintaining the unique missions of both systems.

### **Key Considerations and Challenges**
1. **Governance and Accreditation**:  
   - The merger would require careful attention to governance structures, particularly the roles of the chancellor, board members, and institutional presidents.  
   - Accreditation issues were a major concern, as the merger would likely be considered a substantive change requiring approval from accrediting bodies. Maintaining program integrity and transferability of credits was also highlighted.  

2. **Financial and Administrative Implications**:  
   - Potential cost savings through consolidation, such as reducing administrative redundancies and eliminating duplicate programs, were discussed. However, concerns were raised about the feasibility of realizing these savings and the need for transitional funding.  
   - The sustainability of current funding levels for both systems was questioned, especially given declining enrollment and rising costs.  

3. **Student Impact**:  
   - Ensuring affordability and accessibility for students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, Pell Grant recipients, and non-traditional students, was a top priority.  
   - The committee discussed how the merger could improve credit transferability, reduce student debt, and better align programs with workforce demands.  

4. **Regional and Institutional Identity**:  
   - Members stressed the importance of maintaining the regional identity and autonomy of individual campuses, particularly community colleges, which play a critical role in serving local communities and businesses.  

5. **Union Contracts and Workforce**:  
   - The complexity of merging multiple union contracts was acknowledged as a significant challenge, with potential disruptions to the merger process.  

### **Proposed Solutions and Models**
1. **Coordinating Council and Independent Commission**:  
   - The committee proposed creating a coordinating council or an independent, nonpartisan commission (similar to the BRAC model) to oversee the merger process. This body would include representatives from both systems, external experts, and stakeholders to ensure transparency and inclusivity.  

2. **Strategic Planning and Benchmarking**:  
   - Members emphasized the need for a long-term strategic plan that includes benchmarking and performance measures to assess progress and ensure accountability.  
   - The committee suggested taking a phased approach, possibly over a year, to design and implement the new system.  

3. **Chancellor and Leadership Support**:  
   - The chancellor’s role was identified as critical, with recommendations to provide sufficient support, including vice chancellors with expertise in specific areas like community colleges and university systems.  

### **Legislative and Public Involvement**
The committee acknowledged the importance of legislative oversight and public involvement in the merger process. They discussed the role of the higher education study committee in identifying potential board members and ensuring alignment with statutory goals. Public engagement with stakeholders, including current systems, institutions, alumni groups, and community members, was deemed essential for a successful transition.

### **Next Steps**
The committee plans to summarize its findings and develop a report for further review by relevant legislative bodies. They stressed the need for careful planning, collaboration, and transparency to ensure the merger benefits students, institutions, and the state as a whole. The process will involve addressing accreditation, governance, financial, and logistical challenges while maintaining a focus on student needs and regional economic development.

### **Conclusion**
The discussions highlighted the complexity of merging two distinct higher education systems, with a focus on preserving quality, accessibility, and institutional integrity. While the potential benefits of the merger are significant, the committee emphasized the need for a deliberate, inclusive, and well-planned approach to navigate the challenges and ensure a successful outcome for New Hampshire’s higher education system.
