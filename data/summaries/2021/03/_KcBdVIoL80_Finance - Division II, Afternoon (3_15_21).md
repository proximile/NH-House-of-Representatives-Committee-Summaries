The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division II meeting on March 15, 2021, focused on discussions surrounding the creation of an **independent oversight body** to address **law enforcement misconduct**, as outlined in **Section 148 of HB2**. This initiative builds on the work of the **Lee Act Commission** (2020), which produced 48 unanimous recommendations, including the need for a standardized, statewide entity to handle complaints against law enforcement officers. The discussions centered on the purpose, structure, funding, and operational details of the proposed oversight mechanism, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and cost-effectiveness.

### Key Points from the Meeting:

1. **Purpose and Scope of the Oversight Body**:
   - The primary role of the oversight body is to address issues of **misconduct transparency** and **accountability** within law enforcement.
   - It would determine whether findings of misconduct are sustained and added to an officer's record but would not interfere with the disciplinary authority of law enforcement agencies.
   - A key challenge is defining **misconduct**, as minor infractions may be treated differently across jurisdictions. The goal is to establish a **universal standard** focusing on actions that negatively reflect an officer's trustworthiness or credibility.

2. **Proposed Structure and Model**:
   - The oversight body is modeled after the **Human Rights Commission**, with a small permanent staff and oversight by commission members.
   - It includes **non-law enforcement members** to ensure transparency and public accountability.
   - The body is intended to provide a **neutral, independent review** of complaints, balancing transparency with due process for officers.

3. **Study Commission**:
   - A **temporary study commission** is proposed to determine the best structure for the oversight body. This commission would operate until November 1, 2021, with the sole purpose of drafting legislation to codify its duties.
   - If the legislature enacts its recommendations, the new entity would begin operations in the second year of the biennium (FY2023).

4. **Funding and Budget**:
   - The proposed budget allocates $517,000 for FY2023 to staff and operate the new entity, contingent on the study commission's recommendations and legislative approval.
   - The budget includes funding for positions such as an unclassified director, associate director, attorney, paralegal, and clerk.
   - There is no provision requiring officers to pay for the process, though concerns were raised about potential financial burdens on officers facing multiple hearings or litigation.

5. **Current Issues and Need for Reform**:
   - Currently, there is no centralized system for handling complaints against law enforcement. Complaints are managed internally by the agencies involved, leading to inconsistencies and a lack of transparency.
   - While the **Police Standards and Training Council** exists, it lacks resources, standardized definitions, and transparency. The new entity would build on this foundation but address its shortcomings.

6. **Transparency and Public Involvement**:
   - The oversight body aims to ensure **public accountability** by including non-law enforcement members and providing a neutral review process.
   - The system is designed to reduce subjectivity and ensure fair treatment for both officers and complainants.

7. **Operational Timeline**:
   - If the budget is approved by July 1, 2021, the study commission would work through November 2021 to finalize recommendations.
   - Legislation would then be introduced in 2022, with the entity potentially operational by FY2023.

8. **Legislative Process and Amendments**:
   - The commission's recommendations will be brought to the legislature for consideration, and its authority will cease once its work is complete.
   - Clarifications and amendments are needed, particularly regarding the appointment process for commission members and the co-mingling of the commission and body cam/dash cam fund sections in the bill.

9. **Future Steps**:
   - The committee plans to address funding details and other unresolved issues in subsequent meetings, with the goal of finalizing the oversight body's structure and responsibilities.

### Conclusion:
The discussions highlight the committee's efforts to create a **standardized, transparent, and fair system** for addressing law enforcement misconduct in New Hampshire. The proposed oversight body aims to balance accountability with due process, ensuring that both officers and complainants are treated fairly. The temporary study commission will play a critical role in shaping the structure and legislation for this new entity, with the goal of implementation by FY2023. The initiative reflects a commitment to improving transparency and public trust in law enforcement while addressing the challenges and financial implications of such a system.
