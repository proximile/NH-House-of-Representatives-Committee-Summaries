- **Purpose**: To prohibit the teaching of "divisive concepts," often associated with critical race theory (CRT).
- **Debate**: The bill sparked intense debate, with proponents arguing it prevents mandatory indoctrination and protects free speech, while opponents called it unconstitutional, overly broad, and a barrier to addressing systemic racism. Critics, including Representative Judy, emphasized the bill’s potential harm to marginalized communities and urged for more education on racism.

- **Arguments Against**: Opponents raised concerns about public health and safety, particularly with the use of chemicals in hair treatments. They argued that removing licensing requirements could harm consumers and undermine the cosmetology industry.
