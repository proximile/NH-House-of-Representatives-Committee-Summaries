### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (March 10, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on March 10, 2021, covered a wide range of financial, administrative, and policy issues. The discussions were divided into multiple segments, focusing on bills related to renewable energy, drug policy, animal records, and taxation, as well as broader funding and staffing challenges. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **1. Renewable Portfolio Standard Exemption (House Bill 614-FN)**
The committee discussed **House Bill 614-FN**, which proposes exempting political subdivisions (e.g., towns, cities) from paying the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) fees on their energy service rates. Key points included:
- **Impact on Renewable Energy Fund**: The bill would reduce funding to the Renewable Energy Fund, which primarily relies on alternative compliance payments. However, the impact is expected to be minimal due to sufficient Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in the market.
- **Federal Funding Concerns**: Questions were raised about whether reducing the fund could affect New Hampshire’s eligibility for federal renewable energy grants. The sponsor clarified there is no direct link between the RPS program and federal funding.
- **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Towns can opt out of the RPS program but must opt back in to access grants from the Renewable Energy Fund. Opponents argued this could disadvantage towns that unknowingly opt out.
- **Complexity**: The bill’s details and potential impacts were deemed complex, prompting further review in a work session.

### **2. Drug Policy Reforms (House Bill 615-FN)**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 615-FN**, which aims to reduce penalties for first-time, non-violent drug possession offenses while strengthening penalties for fentanyl possession. Key points included:
- **Penalty Reductions**: The bill reduces maximum prison sentences and fines for first-time drug possession offenses and eliminates mandatory minimum sentences.
- **Fentanyl Provisions**: The threshold for felony charges for fentanyl possession is lowered from 5 grams to 0.5 grams, reflecting its lethality. Opponents raised concerns about decriminalizing any amount of fentanyl.
- **Impact on Justice System**: The bill is expected to reduce prosecution costs by shifting some cases from Superior Court to District Court. It does not affect drug trafficking or distribution charges.
- **Support for Reform**: Advocates emphasized the need to avoid criminalizing individuals with substance use disorders and align penalties with current court practices.

### **3. Animal Records Database (House Bill 532)**
A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to **House Bill 532**, which proposes the creation of an **animal records database** to modernize the state’s record-keeping system for animal health certificates. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The database would replace the current manual, paper-based system, which is inefficient and unsustainable given the approximately 80,000 health certificates issued annually.
- **Amendments**: The bill originally included a $2 fee on health certificates and rabies certificates to fund the database, but these fees were removed by the Environment and Agriculture Committee. Instead, the bill relies on a **$250,000 appropriation** and the transfer of funds from existing agricultural funds (e.g., the Agricultural Product and Scale Testing Fund and the Integrated Pest Management Fund).
- **IT Position**: A full-time IT position within the Department of Agriculture was added to support the database, estimated to cost around $100,000 annually.
- **Funding Concerns**: Questions were raised about the long-term sustainability of funding, as the agricultural funds are not sufficient to cover ongoing costs. Commissioner Sean Jasper suggested a **$4.50 fee** on health certificates to make the program revenue-neutral, but this was not included in the current bill.
- **Timeline**: The database is expected to take several years to develop, with the earliest implementation likely in the second year of the biennium.

### **4. Drug Policy and Declaratory Ruling Fees**
The committee also discussed broader drug policy issues and fees for declaratory rulings. Key points included:
- **Drug Policy**: Advocates argued for shifting from a criminal model to a public health model for low-level drug offenses, emphasizing the financial burden of incarceration and the benefits of investing in treatment and recovery programs.
- **Declaratory Ruling Fees**: The bill proposes reducing the fee for filing a petition for a declaratory ruling from $10,500 to $250 to increase accessibility and transparency. Concerns were raised about the potential increased workload for the site evaluation committee if more petitions are filed due to the lower fee.

### **5. Committee Staffing, Funding, and Taxation**
The committee addressed internal staffing and funding challenges, as well as specific taxation issues. Key points included:
- **Staffing and Funding**: The committee is understaffed, with only one staff member handling operations. Funding challenges include a hiring freeze and reliance on fees, with a recent allocation of $95,000 for the fiscal year to cover operational expenses.
- **Amendment to House Bill 15**: The committee reviewed an amendment to **House Bill 15**, which addresses the taxation of internet transactions related to motor vehicle rentals and room bookings. The amendment aimed to clarify that travel agents would not be taxed for their services. While the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) felt the amendment was unnecessary, stakeholders and some committee members supported it to ensure clarity and avoid unintended taxation.
- **Wayfair Decision**: The committee briefly discussed the implications of the Wayfair decision for remote sellers facilitating transactions in New Hampshire, particularly for meals and rooms tax.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing financial considerations, policy reforms, and administrative efficiency. Key themes included:
- **Renewable Energy**: Concerns about the impact of RPS exemptions on renewable energy funding and federal grants.
- **Drug Policy**: A shift toward reducing penalties for non-violent drug offenses while addressing the lethality of fentanyl.
- **Animal Records**: The need to modernize animal health record-keeping while addressing funding challenges.
- **Taxation and Fees**: Ensuring clarity and fairness in taxation for specific groups like travel agents and addressing internal funding and staffing challenges.
