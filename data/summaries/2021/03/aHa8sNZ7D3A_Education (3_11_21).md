The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on March 11, 2021, focusing on a wide range of education-related bills. The discussions reflected ongoing efforts to address critical issues in the state’s education system, including bullying prevention, civics education, school infrastructure, special education, and school choice. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **Bullying Prevention and Student Safety**
- **Chapter 193-F**: The purpose of Chapter 193-F, which addresses bullying and protects students from physical, emotional, and psychological harm, was reiterated. Concerns were raised about the bill’s clarity and potential unintended consequences, but its importance in safeguarding students was emphasized.
- **HB 140**: This bill allows parents or guardians to take legal action against school districts or charter schools for failing to address bullying, repealing a 2010 provision that barred such lawsuits. Supporters argued it holds schools accountable, particularly in severe cases of negligence, while opponents worried about increased litigation. The bill was moved forward after clarifying that it requires proof of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

### **Civics Education**
- **HB 422**: A half-credit required course in U.S. government and civics for high school students was proposed. While many districts already offer civics education, concerns about scheduling and program impacts led to the bill being retained for further study.
- **HB 319**: This bill requires students in the University and Community College systems of New Hampshire to pass the U.S. citizenship and immigration services civics naturalization test. Amendments exempted certificate programs and graduate students and delayed implementation to January 1, 2023. Supporters argued it would increase civic awareness, while critics questioned its effectiveness. The bill passed as amended.

### **School Infrastructure**
- **HB 267**: The bill addressed construction standards for schools, focusing on acoustical properties, air quality, and HVAC systems. It was retained for further study to improve school infrastructure.
- **HB 339**: A committee was proposed to study air quality in school buildings, particularly in older facilities. The motion to retain the bill passed unanimously, highlighting the importance of addressing long-standing air quality issues.

### **Special Education**
- **HB 581**: This bill shifts the burden of proof in special education due process hearings from parents to school districts, requiring schools to demonstrate they have fulfilled their obligations under Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Concerns were raised about parents’ challenges in advocating for their children, and there was strong support for forming a study committee to examine broader issues in the special education process. The committee decided to recess and revisit the bill the following week to craft an amendment incorporating both the burden of proof change and the study committee.

### **School Choice and Open Enrollment**
- **HB 455**: The bill explores school choice and open enrollment policies. The committee voted to retain it for further study, allowing time to examine policies in other states like Massachusetts and Michigan. Concerns were raised about the impact on local school districts, including funding and capacity issues.

### **Other Bills**
- **HB 441**: The bill, which would require public schools to display the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was indefinitely postponed. Opponents argued it was unnecessary and could impose maintenance costs, while supporters saw it as a valuable educational tool.
- **HB 69**: This bill allows schools to display the national motto, "In God We Trust," and provides legal defense if challenged. It passed with a motion to recommend it for further consideration, with supporters arguing it promotes unity and opponents expressing concerns about alienating non-Christian students and families.
- **HB 323**: The bill requires schools to send student assessment results to parents by June 30th. It was retained to monitor the progress of a related bill (HB 194) that directs testing agencies to send results directly to parents. Concerns were raised about balancing state mandates with local control, as some districts delay sharing results until the fall for academic goal-setting.

### **General Observations**
- The meeting highlighted tensions between local control and state mandates, with significant debate on how to balance accountability, resource allocation, and the rights of students and communities.
- Collaboration and thorough study were emphasized as essential to addressing complex issues in education, particularly in areas like special education, school infrastructure, and civics education.
- The committee’s decisions reflected a mix of support and opposition, with some bills moving forward, others being tabled or postponed, and several retained for further study.

The meeting underscored the House of Representatives’ commitment to improving New Hampshire’s education system while addressing practical concerns and ensuring inclusivity and accountability.
