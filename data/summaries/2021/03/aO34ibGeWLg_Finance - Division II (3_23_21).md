**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II Meeting (March 23, 2021)**

The March 23, 2021, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, focused on proposed amendments to HB2, which addresses the merger of the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH). The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, highlighted the complexity of merging the two higher education systems and the need for careful consideration of various factors. Key points from the discussion include:

### **Amendment Proposals and Key Discussions**
1. **Amendment Introductions**:
   - **Representative Turcotte’s Amendment**: This proposal aimed to address the merger, with input from stakeholders including Democrats, Republicans, CCSNH, USNH, and the Governor’s office. It initially set a deadline of April 1, 2022, for the commission to report its findings, though a misprint suggested August 31, 2022. Later revisions proposed moving the deadline to January 1, 2022.
   - **Representative Heath’s Amendment**: This amendment suggested forming a study committee rather than a merger committee, emphasizing the need for thorough due diligence and public hearings.

2. **Timeline Concerns**:
   - Representatives debated the feasibility of the proposed timelines, with some arguing that the complexity of issues like union mergers, accreditation, and financial considerations necessitated a slower, more deliberate process.

3. **Commission Structure**:
   - The amendments proposed an 11-member commission to oversee the merger or study process. There was debate over whether this number was appropriate and whether the chief executives of both systems should be included.

4. **Union and Accreditation Issues**:
   - The complexities of merging multiple unions and ensuring the merged system meets educational standards were highlighted. Representatives stressed the importance of involving accreditors in the process.

5. **Financial Considerations**:
   - Concerns were raised about maintaining separate budgets for both systems during the transition and ensuring adequate funding to support the merger process.

6. **Public and Stakeholder Input**:
   - The amendments aimed to incorporate input from stakeholders, including the 65 by 25 group (focused on workforce development) and accrediting bodies, to ensure a comprehensive approach.

7. **Chancellor Selection**:
   - The amendments proposed that the commission would serve as a search committee for selecting a new chancellor. Some representatives felt this was an overreach, while others saw it as necessary for integration.

### **Overarching Themes and Concerns**
1. **Need for Thorough Due Diligence**:
   - Representatives emphasized the importance of slowing down the process to thoroughly investigate the implications of the merger. They stressed the need for public hearings and careful review of documents to ensure thoughtful decision-making.

2. **Study Committee vs. Merger Committee**:
   - The distinction between a study committee and a merger committee was a key point of discussion. Representative Heath’s amendment advocated for a study committee to carefully consider all aspects of the integration.

3. **Concerns About Speed and Responsibility**:
   - Several representatives expressed concerns about the rapid pace of the process and the importance of ensuring that those involved take responsibility for the outcomes.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee planned to refine the amendments and potentially vote on them the following day. They also discussed preparing for upcoming budget presentations and hearings, including funding for dual and concurrent enrollment programs and Senate Bill 82, which addresses kindergarten program funding.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of merging two higher education systems and the need for careful consideration of timelines, commission structure, financial implications, and stakeholder input. While there was a sense of urgency to act, representatives emphasized the importance of thorough due diligence and public engagement to ensure a successful integration process. The discussions highlighted the need for collaboration among stakeholders and a balanced approach to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the proposed merger.
