The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division III, held a budget briefing on January 28, 2021, focusing on key aspects of the state budget, particularly within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The meeting, conducted electronically due to COVID-19, covered a wide range of topics, from nursing home funding to Medicaid, behavioral health, and developmental services. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Meeting Logistics and Introductions**
- The meeting was held virtually in compliance with COVID-19 emergency orders, with public access provided via Zoom and telephone.
- Committee members introduced themselves, highlighting their backgrounds and roles in finance and health-related committees.

### **Budget Process Overview**
- Kevin Ripple, Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA), provided an overview of the state budget process. He explained the timeline from the governor’s budget proposal to the committee of conference phase, detailing the roles of House Bill 1 (the budget) and House Bill 2 (the trailer bill), which includes policy changes related to the budget.

### **Health and Human Services (HHS) Budget**
The HHS budget, which constitutes nearly half of the state’s general fund, was the primary focus of the meeting. Key areas discussed included:

1. **Medicaid**:
   - Medicaid is the largest component of the HHS budget, with discussions on managed care, the expanded Medicaid program (Granite Advantage Health Care Program), and the Medicaid Enhancement Tax (MET), which funds uncompensated care for hospitals.
   - The state ensures budget neutrality in Medicaid payments to nursing facilities by adjusting rates if costs exceed appropriations.

2. **Nursing Home Funding**:
   - Concerns were raised about funding for nursing homes, particularly how state funds are matched with federal dollars. The process of moving funds between accounts is designed to maximize federal matching, benefiting nursing homes.

3. **Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse Services**:
   - The Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Services oversees regional public health networks and contracts with providers for programs like impaired driver rehabilitation.
   - The Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention receives 5% of liquor profits, reinstated in 2018 to fund the expanded Medicaid program.

4. **Mental Health Services**:
   - The CMH Program Support Account funds 10 community mental health centers across the state.
   - New Hampshire Hospital and Glencliff Home for the Elderly received funding for new facilities, though progress on these projects remains unclear.

5. **Developmental Services**:
   - The state is required to fully fund services for individuals with developmental disabilities and acquired brain disorders.
   - The operating budget for these services increased from $173 million in FY 2020 to $183 million in FY 2021, with further increases requested for future years.

6. **Veterans Home Funding**:
   - The Veterans Home’s budget request is relatively flat, with a slight increase requested for the upcoming budget. A comparison of per-patient costs at the Veterans Home versus typical county nursing homes was requested.

7. **Child Development and Family Services**:
   - Programs like child care scholarships and child protective services were highlighted, with significant state funding allocated to address caseloads and staffing needs.

8. **Sununu Youth Services Center**:
   - Concerns were raised about the declining population at the center and the associated maintenance and staffing costs for a facility operating well below capacity.

9. **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)**:
   - TANF provides cash assistance to families in need, with federal funding contingent on state matching funds. The discussion also touched on the TANF reserve fund and its declining balance.

10. **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)**:
    - SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is primarily federally funded, with the state covering administrative costs.

11. **Elderly and Adult Services**:
    - The state and counties share costs for long-term care services, with the state leveraging federal funds through programs like the Medicaid Quality Incentive Program (MQIP) and Pro-Share.
