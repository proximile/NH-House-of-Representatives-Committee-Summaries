The NH House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division III, convened on March 17, 2021, to discuss critical budgetary and financial matters, primarily centered around House Bill 2 (HB2). The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 emergency, emphasized transparency, fiscal responsibility, and the need to balance competing priorities within limited resources. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Revenue Estimates and Budget Adjustments**
The committee addressed discrepancies between the governor's revenue estimates and the House's independent projections, noting a $59 million difference. Members emphasized the importance of using the Ways and Means revenue estimate to guide budget allocations. They proposed adding back $100 million to the FY21 base to address funding shortfalls and ensure fiscal stability.

### **2. Medicaid and Health Services Funding**
Medicaid funding was a central focus of the discussions, particularly the impact of the enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The committee debated the governor's budget proposals for Medicaid-related programs, including developmental disabilities and long-term care services. They also discussed the transfer of funds between Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to improve transparency and compliance with federal audits. The committee prioritized fully funding Medicaid and CHIP, recognizing their critical role in ensuring healthcare access for vulnerable populations.

### **3. Personnel Costs and Growth**
Concerns were raised about the unsustainable growth in personnel costs, especially in light of the economic challenges posed by the pandemic. The committee explored strategies to rein in personnel growth without compromising essential services or harming current employees. Suggestions included implementing a personnel ceiling or reducing the number of positions.

### **4. Legislative Decision-Making and Flexibility**
A key theme throughout the meeting was the importance of maintaining flexibility in governance. Members emphasized that no single legislature should bind future legislatures' decisions, particularly in the context of budget allocations and funding priorities.

### **5. Veterans Home Funding**
The committee reviewed funding for the Veterans Home, focusing on line items in HB2 that provide flexibility for personnel and financial management. They considered streamlining budget sections by removing redundant language to improve clarity and efficiency.

### **6. Lapse Funds and Add-Back Allocations**
The concept of "lapse funds" (unspent appropriations used to balance the budget) was discussed, with the committee noting their historical use as a common budgeting practice. Additionally, the committee evaluated how to allocate approximately $100 million in available funds for "add-backs" to various programs, prioritizing Medicaid and CHIP.

---

### **7. Federal Funds and Recovery Act**
The committee examined the distribution of federal funds from the Recovery Act, noting that some funds would bypass the state and go directly to counties, cities, and municipalities. There was uncertainty about the timing and rules for spending these funds, highlighting the need for careful planning and coordination.

### **8. Discussion of HB2 Sections**
The committee reviewed specific sections of HB2, including:
- **Section 21**: Allows unfunded positions to be funded based on available money. The committee accepted it as similar to previous budget practices.
- **Section 23**: Addresses cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to maintain eligibility levels for certain programs. The committee agreed to keep it to comply with federal law.
- **Section 25**: Extends a 2011 provision allowing community mental health centers to prioritize services based on clinical needs. The discussion was postponed to review proposed language.
- **Sections 28 and 29**: Establish a revolving fund for emergency services for children. While the committee recognized the transparency and control benefits, concerns were raised about the inclusion of public funds and its long-term budgetary impact.

### **9. Public Access and Transparency**
The committee emphasized the importance of transparency in financial processes and public access to meeting documents. They decided to post a working document of HB2 with clear disclaimers to avoid confusion and ensure accountability.

### **10. Future Discussions**
