The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee meeting on March 4, 2021, conducted electronically due to COVID-19, focused on several bills aimed at addressing issues in family law, child welfare, and constitutional rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 494: Constitutional Rights in Divorce Proceedings**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to ensure that courts do not infringe on constitutional rights in divorce proceedings unless there is no less restrictive means to achieve a compelling government interest. It specifically addresses concerns about temporary and permanent restraining orders.
- **Support**: 
  - Representative Deborah Desimone introduced the bill, emphasizing the need to protect constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech and Second Amendment rights, in family law cases.
  - Attorney J. Markell testified in favor, arguing that courts often disregard constitutional rights in restraining orders and divorce cases. He highlighted examples of prior restraint on speech and Eighth Amendment violations in alimony cases.
- **Opposition**: 
  - Aaron Justina from the Domestic Violence Advocacy Project opposed the bill, calling it overly technical and unnecessary. She argued that existing restraining orders under marital and parental rights statutes are less restrictive and effective in high-conflict cases.
- **Debate**: Committee members questioned the bill’s application, particularly regarding privacy rights and the Second Amendment. Legal experts, including Richard Head from the Judicial Branch, argued that the bill misapplies constitutional scrutiny standards, as judges are already bound by constitutional protections.

### **House Bill 120: Psychotropic Medications for Foster Children**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to regulate the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care, ensuring they are prescribed only with a clinical diagnosis and proper oversight.
- **Support**: 
  - Representative William Marsh introduced the bill, citing a 2018 U.S. Inspector General report that found significant lapses in treatment planning and medication monitoring in New Hampshire. He referenced California’s success in reducing antipsychotic prescriptions by 45% through similar legislation.
  - Moira O’Neil, the State Child Advocate, supported the bill and suggested amendments to strengthen it. She emphasized the need for comprehensive assessments and consistent oversight by DCYF nurses.
- **Key Provisions**: The bill defines "medication restraint" as the use of psychotropic drugs without a diagnosis and aligns with existing laws (RSA 126U). It also includes amendments to address concerns from the New Hampshire Psychiatric Society.

### **House Bill 293: Streamlining the Adoption Process**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to expedite the adoption process for families providing stable homes, reducing the required residency period from three to two consecutive years and streamlining assessments for adoptive parents.
- **Support**: 
  - Representative Cody Belanger, the bill’s sponsor, shared a personal story about adopting his nephew, highlighting the emotional toll on children waiting for adoption. He emphasized the importance of stability and permanency for children.
  - The bill includes amendments to clarify conditions for waiving assessments and broadening parental status scenarios, such as cases where parents are deceased or have surrendered their rights.
- **Concerns**: 
  - Testimony from John DeJoy (Waypoint) raised concerns about unofficial placements where family members take in children without formal assessments. He suggested amending the bill to ensure at least one assessment occurs in such cases.
  - Rebecca Ross (DCYF) clarified that DCYF is not involved in private adoptions, which are overseen by the judicial branch.

### **House Bill 562: Exempting Human Trafficking Victims from CHINS Proceedings**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to exempt victims of human trafficking from participating in Children in Need of Services (CHINS) proceedings.
- **Support**: 
  - Representative Massimilia requested the bill be retained for further work, citing ongoing discussions with stakeholders to address concerns and improve the legislation.
- **Opposition**: 
  - Rebecca Ross (DCYF) and Joey Smith (NH Coalition Against Domestic Violence) opposed the bill, arguing that CHINS proceedings are non-punitive and essential for connecting trafficking victims to trauma-informed care and resources.
- **Outcome**: The committee agreed to retain the bill for further refinement, with stakeholders committed to collaborating on a more effective solution.

### **Key Themes**
- **Rights and Protections**: The meeting highlighted the balance between protecting constitutional rights (HB 494) and ensuring the welfare of vulnerable children (HB 120, HB 293, HB 562).
- **Streamlining Processes**: Both HB 293 and HB 120 aimed to address systemic inefficiencies, whether in the adoption process or the oversight of psychotropic medications for foster children.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The discussions underscored the importance of collaboration among legislators, legal experts, and child welfare advocates to refine legislation and address unintended consequences.

The meeting concluded with a focus on improving family law and child welfare systems while safeguarding the rights and well-being of individuals involved.
