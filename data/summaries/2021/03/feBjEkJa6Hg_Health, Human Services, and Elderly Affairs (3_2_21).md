The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened electronically on March 2, 2021, to discuss several key bills addressing health, human services, and elderly affairs. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting, organized by the primary bills discussed:

---

### **House Bill 295 (HB 295): Gender Marker Changes on Birth Certificates**
- **Purpose**: HB 295 seeks to streamline the process for transgender individuals to update gender markers on birth records by removing the requirement for a court order and creating a standardized form for gender transition attestation by licensed medical professionals.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Updates **RSA 5-C:87** to clarify procedures for amending birth records post-gender transition.
  - Introduces a notarized form to prevent fraud and adds a marginal note to amended birth certificates linking back to the original record.
- **Support**: Advocates, including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and the ACLU, argued the current process is burdensome and traumatic. They emphasized the importance of accurate identification for mental health and safety.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised issues about the necessity of marginal notes, the burden of notarization, and potential confusion between “sex” and “gender” terminology. Some expressed concerns about erasing biological data and the inclusion of minors.
- **Discussion**: The committee explored amendments to address privacy concerns, streamline the notarization process, and ensure consistency across state IDs.

### **House Bill 381 (HB 381): Direct Access Testing (DAT)**
- **Purpose**: HB 381 would allow adults to order diagnostic lab tests directly from certified labs without a physician’s order, with patients paying out-of-pocket.
- **Support**: Proponents argued it promotes medical freedom and efficiency, particularly for uninsured individuals or those between providers.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including the New Hampshire Medical Society and Academy of Family Physicians, warned of misdiagnosis, overtesting, increased healthcare costs, and ethical concerns about provider liability.
- **Discussion**: Suggestions included limiting the bill to specific tests (e.g., A1C for diabetes) and addressing equity issues to ensure affordability. The bill’s future remains uncertain pending further deliberation.

### **House Bill 502 (HB 502): Youth Tobacco Prevention**
- **Purpose**: HB 502 proposed a study committee to evaluate whether tobacco settlement funds are adequately allocated to youth prevention programs.
- **Discussion**: The committee highlighted the rise in youth vaping and the state’s low funding for prevention (0.8% of CDC recommendations). Programs like "Save Your Breath NH" and "My Life My Quit" were discussed.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **21-0** to recommend **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**, suggesting the issue be addressed through existing oversight mechanisms rather than creating a new committee.

### **House Bill 503 (HB 503): Homelessness Commission**
- **Purpose**: HB 503 aims to establish a commission on homelessness to assess and address homelessness in New Hampshire, focusing on mental health and substance use disorders.
- **Support**: Advocates emphasized the need for expertise in mental health, substance use, and job training to address underlying causes of homelessness.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including the Department of Health and Human Services, argued the bill duplicates the work of the existing Council on Housing Stability.
- **Outcome**: The committee delayed action for a week to review potential overlaps and consider amendments, including merging the proposed commission with the existing council.

---

### **House Bill 131 (HB 131): Reporting Healthcare-Associated Infections**
- **Purpose**: HB 131 focuses on reporting healthcare-associated infections and vaccination levels in healthcare facilities.
- **Discussion**: Representatives clarified that the bill aligns with federal guidelines and does not mandate vaccinations but tracks vaccination levels to prevent outbreaks.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with 17 affirmative votes, 3 negative votes, and 1 absence.

---

### **House Bill 605 (HB 605): Therapeutic Cannabis**
- **Purpose**: HB 605 addresses therapeutic cannabis, including provisions for opioid use disorder (OUD) and access for out-of-state and international patients.
- **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about including OUD as a qualifying condition and allowing international access. An amendment was proposed to limit access to states with reciprocal agreements.
- **Outcome**: The committee agreed to revisit the bill after further input from the Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board and DHHS.

### **Other Bills and Actions**:
- **House Bill 572**: Focused on medical freedom and bodily autonomy, explicitly stating individuals’ rights to control medical interventions. Passed with amendments.
- **House Bill 220**: Addressed vaccination mandates and employment, with amendments to ensure compliance with federal law. Passed with broad support.
- **House Bill 492**: Required maintenance of the COVID-19 dashboard. Concerns about data privacy led to a motion to ITL.
