**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting on March 23, 2021**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened electronically on March 23, 2021, due to COVID-19 restrictions. The meeting focused on reviewing multiple bills, updating revenue information, and addressing fiscal and policy considerations. Key discussions and decisions included:  

### **Legislative Bills and Discussions**  
1. **House Bill 32 (Animal Records Database):**  
   The committee agreed to recommend the bill for passage, which involves transferring funds from dedicated accounts to support the creation of an animal records database.  

2. **House Bill 610 (Licensing and Reporting Functions):**  
   Members reviewed a proposed increase in filing fees for certain licensing functions. The bill, returned from the previous session, was supported by the committee for its fee adjustment.  

3. **House Bill 614 (Renewable Portfolio Standards):**  
   A discrepancy in the bill’s amendment led to debate over whether to retain it for further review or recommend passage. Concerns about alignment with the intended amendment resulted in a recommendation to retain the bill for correction.  

4. **House Bill 615 (Reducing Penalties for Drug Possession):**  
   The committee discussed reducing fines for first-time drug offenses. While some members supported the bill as a policy matter, others raised concerns about its fiscal impact and implications for drug enforcement. The bill was considered for further analysis.  

5. **House Bill 624 (Reducing Fees for Declaratory Rulings):**  
   A significant reduction in fees for filing petitions for declaratory rulings with the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) was debated. Concerns about potential flooding of petitions and constitutional implications of high fees led some members to support retaining the bill for reassessment.  

### **Constitutional and Regulatory Issues**  
- **Constitutional Amendment and Taxpayer Standing:**  
  A representative discussed the implications of a recent constitutional amendment that reversed rulings making it harder for taxpayers to gain standing in court. The discussion also touched on the potential impact on individuals accessing regulatory agencies.  

- **SEC Budget and Fees:**  
  The committee noted that general funding for the SEC had been removed, requiring the SEC to raise its own money through fees. A provision allowing the SEC to request additional funds from the fiscal committee was also mentioned.  

### **Lottery, Gaming, and Tax Policies**  
- **Lottery and Gaming Bills:**  
  Several bills related to the lottery and gaming were debated, including changes to ticket prices, deal sizes, and the elimination of paper tickets from machines. The committee also discussed combining bills and the potential for controversial elements in otherwise non-controversial bills.  

- **Credit Carryover Issue:**  
  The committee addressed the issue of businesses carrying over tax credits from year to year. A commission was formed to study the issue, and its potential financial impact on the state budget was discussed.  

- **PPP Bill:**  
  The committee anticipated the arrival of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) bill from the Senate and emphasized the urgency of understanding its ramifications before the budget passes.  

### **Revenue and Budget Considerations**  
- **Revenue Comparisons:**  
  The committee reviewed revenue comparisons between the House Ways and Means proposals and the governor’s proposals, noting differences in projected revenues and the impact of various tax changes.  

### **Procedural and Logistical Matters**  
- **Upcoming Meetings and Caucuses:**  
  The committee scheduled caucuses and discussed the logistics of upcoming meetings, including the need to accommodate members’ schedules and the potential for additional work sessions.  

- **Other Bills:**  
  The committee briefly touched on bills related to emergency situations, sports betting, and housekeeping measures from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA).  

### **Key Themes**  
Throughout the meeting, the committee emphasized balancing fiscal responsibility with policy goals. Procedural issues, fiscal impacts, and alignment with constitutional and regulatory frameworks were central to the discussions. The committee often deferred to the expertise of policy committees while ensuring proper oversight of financial implications.  

The meeting highlighted the complexity of legislative decision-making, particularly in the context of revenue generation, tax policies, and regulatory adjustments. Further analysis and potential amendments to several bills were identified as necessary steps moving forward.
