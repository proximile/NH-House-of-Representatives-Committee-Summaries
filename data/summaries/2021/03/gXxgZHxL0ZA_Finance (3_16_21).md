**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting (March 16, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on March 16, 2021, featured extensive testimonies from stakeholders advocating for funding across a wide range of critical social services, economic policies, and public health initiatives. The meeting underscored the urgent need for a people-centered budget that addresses the diverse needs of New Hampshire’s residents, particularly vulnerable populations, while balancing fiscal constraints. Key themes and testimonies included:

### **1. Crisis Centers and Domestic Violence Services**
Multiple speakers, including Representative Amanda Toll, emphasized the life-saving role of New Hampshire’s 13 crisis centers in addressing sexual assault and domestic violence. Testifiers highlighted a 40% increase in emergency calls during the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 100,000 calls in 2020. They urged sustained funding for domestic violence prevention programs and crisis centers to support survivors in escaping abusive situations and rebuilding their lives.

### **2. Child Care Assistance**
Advocates and parents, including Erica Breaux and Christina Darling, stressed the importance of fully funding child care scholarships and assistance programs. Testimonies highlighted how these programs enable working families, particularly low-income and single-parent households, to maintain employment while providing children access to high-quality early learning programs. Speakers warned that cuts or waitlists would hinder workforce participation and economic recovery.

### **3. Affordable Housing**
Alyssa Margolin of Housing Action NH addressed the state’s severe housing shortage, particularly in the rental market. She urged the committee to allocate funding to the Affordable Housing Fund, homeless shelter operations, and the Housing Appeals Board to mitigate the housing crisis and its economic impacts on families and communities.

### **4. Mental Health Services**
The mental health crisis in New Hampshire was a recurring theme. Susan Stearns, Kenneth Norton, and others highlighted the lack of accessible mental health resources, including practitioners, hospital beds, and community-based services. Testifiers shared personal stories of individuals boarding in emergency departments due to inadequate care and called for full funding of mental health services to address workforce shortages and improve accessibility.

### **5. Developmental Disabilities and Home-Based Care**
Advocates like Bonnie Dunham emphasized the importance of fully funding developmental disability services, including in-home support waivers, early intervention programs, and Medicaid adult dental benefits. They stressed that these services enable individuals with disabilities to live independently and contribute to their communities. Additional testimonies called for increased funding for home and community-based care programs, such as the Choices for Independence (CFI) waiver, to prevent institutionalization.

### **6. Paid Family Leave**
Concerns were raised about the inadequacy of the governor’s proposed paid family leave plan. Critics, including Deborah Nelson, argued that the plan maintains the status quo, lacks funding, and fails to protect workers, particularly those in low-income and caregiving roles. Speakers urged the committee to prioritize a more comprehensive and equitable approach to paid leave.

### **7. Education Funding**
Education advocates, including Leslie Want (Manchester School Board) and Mayor James Donchess of Nashua, highlighted budget shortfalls exacerbated by the pandemic. They opposed proposed cuts to education funding, which would disproportionately harm districts with high numbers of students in need. Testifiers also advocated for restoring funding for educational programs within the Department of Corrections to support rehabilitation and reduce recidivism.

### **8. Public Health and Workforce Development**
Michelle Merritt of New Futures outlined a five-point plan for a healthy budget, emphasizing the need to support public health programs, healthcare workforce development, behavioral health services, and efforts to mitigate childhood trauma. Other speakers urged investments in COVID-19 recovery, harm reduction strategies for substance use disorder, and programs that address aging and elder care needs.

### **9. Economic Security and Tax Policy**
Stephen Gardu supported the governor’s budget, praising proposed tax cuts and the absence of new taxes. He argued that a strong economy, rather than increased social spending, should be the state’s priority. Conversely, other speakers called for investments in economic security, affordable housing, and support for low-income and undocumented families.

### **10. Law Enforcement and Corrections**
Sheriff Dominic Ricciardi opposed a proposed reduction in sheriff reimbursements, warning it would undermine court security and increase costs for taxpayers. Joseph Laskas of the ACLU NH advocated for restoring funding for education and transitional housing for incarcerated individuals, emphasizing their importance in rehabilitation and successful reentry.

### **11. Time Management and Committee Response**
The chair enforced strict time limits for testimonies (3 minutes) and signaled remaining time to ensure efficiency. Committee members acknowledged the testimonies and highlighted ongoing efforts to address funding gaps, including potential federal aid from the CARES Act. The chair reiterated the committee’s commitment to balancing the budget within the constraints provided by the Ways and Means Committee.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the interconnectedness of social services, public health, education, and economic policies in addressing New Hampshire’s most pressing challenges. Speakers called for a budget that prioritizes equity, accessibility, and long-term investment in the well-being of the state’s residents, particularly those most vulnerable. The testimonies underscored the critical role of sustained funding in fostering economic recovery, improving public health outcomes, and ensuring a brighter future for all New Hampshire communities.
