The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened electronically on March 17, 2021, to address a range of budget-related issues and legislative amendments. The meeting was authorized under House Rule 67 and the governor’s emergency orders, allowing for virtual participation due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Key discussions and decisions from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Budget Discussions**
1. **Department of Safety**: The committee reviewed prioritized needs from the Department of Safety, totaling approximately $10-11 million. Requests included funding for forensic positions and facility maintenance.
2. **Education Funding**: Discussions centered on funding for the community college and university systems, including a $2 million request for a student information data system and a $108,000 proposal to shift a position from federal to general funds.
3. **Transportation**: The Department of Transportation sought additional funding for equipment and maintenance. The committee explored balancing the highway fund, potentially by reducing winter maintenance appropriations.
4. **Fish and Game**: The committee approved a request to unfund a hatchery manager position, opting to use federal and Fish and Game funds instead of general funds.

### **House Bill 2 (HB2) Amendments**
1. **Lottery Commission**: The committee accepted boilerplate language granting the Lottery Commission authority to purchase ticket stock.
2. **Education Trust Fund**: A technical amendment clarified the allocation of tobacco settlement funds to the Education Trust Fund, ensuring its use for school building aid, tuition, transportation, and special education aid. The committee voted 7-0 to codify this allocation in perpetuity (Amendment 0693h).
3. **Crisis Intervention Training**: Duplicate funding in HB2 was removed and consolidated into HB1, with a clarifying footnote. The motion passed unanimously.
4. **Bear Damage Compensation**: Sections 111-113 of HB2 addressed compensation for bear damage to crops. Proposed changes would limit payments to commercial farmers and require them to allow hunting on their property. Concerns were raised about the lack of a public hearing, prompting the committee to seek further clarification from the Fish and Game Department.
5. **Road Maintenance Repeal**: Section 134, which repealed the state’s responsibility for maintaining two roads in Sandwich and Thornton, was approved without opposition.

### **Study Commission and New State Agency**
1. **Study Commission Funding**: The committee debated allocating $500,000 for a study commission to determine the structure and necessity of a new state agency to handle misconduct complaints. Suggestions were made to reduce initial funding to $100,000, with the option to request additional funds later.
2. **New State Agency**: The study commission’s recommendations could lead to the creation of an independent agency, with $500,000 proposed for its operational costs in fiscal year 2023.
3. **Appointment of Members**: Discussions included whether the Attorney General or the governor should appoint additional commission members.

### **Law Enforcement Study Commission**
The committee discussed the establishment of a commission (sections 145-147) to address unresolved issues from a previous law enforcement study. Concerns were raised about the Attorney General’s role in appointing members, but no final decision was made.

### **Roll Call Votes and Future Plans**
The committee conducted several roll call votes, all of which passed unanimously (7-0). The meeting concluded with plans to continue reviewing budget documents and amendments in future work sessions, including further discussions on the university and community college systems.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting emphasized efficient use of state resources, addressing specific needs in education, transportation, and law enforcement, and ensuring clarity in legislative amendments. The committee prioritized balancing budget requests with fiscal responsibility while addressing emerging issues such as bear damage compensation and misconduct complaint handling. Future sessions were scheduled to resolve outstanding matters and finalize budget-related decisions.
