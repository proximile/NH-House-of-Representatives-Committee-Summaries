**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (March 17, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened electronically on March 17, 2021, due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting addressed several key bills and procedural matters, with a focus on juvenile justice, drug enforcement, and criminal justice reform. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Meeting Logistics and Procedures**
The committee chair outlined the logistics for the electronic meeting, including public access and participation via Zoom or phone. Roll call attendance was conducted, and members confirmed their presence and whether they were accompanied by others in the room. Technical issues with audio, particularly for remote participants, were noted and addressed to ensure clarity and participation.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**
1. **House Bill 408**:  
   The committee revisited HB 408, which had previously been voted on. A motion for reconsideration was made to address concerns about the bill’s language, specifically the term "repeat interaction with a minor." Members emphasized the need for clarity to avoid unintended consequences for employers and individuals with past convictions. The motion for reconsideration passed, and further discussion was scheduled.

2. **Senate Bill 34**:  
   The committee heard testimony on SB 34, which seeks to update the definition of controlled drug analogs and prohibit the sale and possession of synthetic urine. Supporters, including the New Hampshire Department of Safety and the Department of Corrections, argued that the bill would provide law enforcement with better tools to combat synthetic drugs. Concerns were raised about the legitimate uses of synthetic urine, but proponents clarified that the bill is focused on preventing drug test cheating.

3. **House Bill 632**:  
   HB 632, addressing juvenile sentencing and life imprisonment without parole, was a central focus of the meeting. Key points from the discussion included:
   - **Opposition to Life Sentences for Juveniles**: Representatives argued against sentencing juveniles to life without parole, citing scientific evidence that the brain continues developing until the mid-20s. They emphasized the importance of rehabilitation and the potential for young individuals to change.
   - **Testimony and Examples**: Stories of rehabilitated individuals who were incarcerated as juveniles were shared, highlighting the cruelty and ineffectiveness of life sentences for young offenders.
   - **Retention Motion**: The committee debated whether to retain the bill for further review or move it forward. Some members advocated for retention to address constitutional inconsistencies and ensure alignment with the **Miller v. Alabama** Supreme Court ruling, which prohibits mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles.
   - **Support for Rehabilitation**: Many representatives stressed the importance of rehabilitation and giving juveniles a second chance, noting that most states have abolished life sentences without parole for minors.
   - **Retention Vote**: The committee voted **17-4** to retain the bill, allowing for further amendments and review. Members expressed a commitment to revisiting the bill in the fall or next session to ensure it aligns with legal standards and scientific understanding of juvenile brain development.

### **Procedural Issues**
The meeting also addressed procedural errors related to **House Bill 576**, a retained bill that was mistakenly reconsidered and voted on improperly. The clerk clarified that retained bills remain with the committee for further work and cannot be reconsidered once transmitted to the clerk.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting reflected a strong commitment to **juvenile justice reform**, **rehabilitation principles**, and ensuring New Hampshire’s laws align with legal precedents and scientific understanding. Discussions emphasized the need for clarity in legislative language, the importance of addressing unintended consequences, and the value of giving individuals—especially juveniles—a second chance.

The committee’s work demonstrated a thoughtful and collaborative approach to addressing complex criminal justice issues, with a focus on fairness, rehabilitation, and public safety.
