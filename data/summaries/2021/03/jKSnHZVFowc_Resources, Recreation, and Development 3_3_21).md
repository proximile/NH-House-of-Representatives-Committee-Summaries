**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Resources, Recreation, and Development (March 3, 2021)**

The March 3, 2021, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee addressed a range of bills and issues related to environmental protection, recreational activities, and land use. The discussions emphasized balancing ecological concerns with recreational access, landowner rights, and economic considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Personal Watercraft in Marshlands (House Bill 184)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to restrict the use of personal watercraft (PWCs) in environmentally sensitive marshlands, particularly in the back channel between Rye and Newcastle, to prevent erosion, turbidity, and wildlife disturbance.
- **Support**: Testimony highlighted the ecological damage caused by PWCs in shallow waters, especially during low tides. Studies and reports were cited to emphasize the need for protection.
- **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about restricting homeowners’ access to moored boats and the potential negative message to PWC users. Some argued that PWCs, when operated lawfully, cause less harm than traditional boats.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously, with a focus on protecting marshlands and adhering to industry recommendations to avoid sensitive areas.

### **2. Definition of Wake Boats (House Bill 229)**
- **Purpose**: The bill sought to define wake boats, which use ballast systems to enhance wakes for water sports, as a precursor to potential future regulation.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that defining wake boats was necessary to address their environmental impact, particularly as ballast systems grow larger.
- **Opposition**: Critics contended the definition was too broad, potentially including other boats with added weight (e.g., coolers), and lacked evidence of widespread issues in New Hampshire.
- **Outcome**: The motion to kill the bill (ITL) passed, with representatives suggesting that education and existing regulations were sufficient for now.

### **3. Shoreline Permit Fee Exemptions**
- **Purpose**: The bill sought to reinstate fee exemptions for shoreline permits for projects funded by municipal, county, state, or federal entities, which had expired two years prior.
- **Amendment**: Representative Pearl proposed capping fees at $3,750 instead of full exemptions to mitigate the financial impact on the Department of Environmental Services (DES).
- **Debate**: Concerns were raised about the revenue loss to DES, which relies on fees for staffing and operations. Federal projects were also discussed, with some advocating for their inclusion in the exemption.
- **Outcome**: The committee supported capping fees at $3,750 and retaining federal projects within the exemption, with plans for further drafting and fiscal impact assessment.

### **4. Off-Highway Recreational Vehicles (OHRVs) on Class 5 and 6 Roads (House Bill 446)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposed forming a committee to study the impact of OHRVs on public roads, focusing on noise, dust, erosion, and property rights.
- **Support**: Testimony highlighted the negative effects of OHRVs on residents’ quality of life, road damage, and environmental concerns.
- **Opposition**: OHRV enthusiasts argued that the current system works and that OHRVs contribute to the economy. They noted efforts to mitigate issues through education and trail maintenance.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to retain the bill for further study, recognizing the need to balance OHRV use with residents’ rights and environmental protection.

### **5. Prime Wetlands and Groundwater Withdrawals**
- **Prime Wetlands (HB 158)**: The bill, previously vetoed, allows communities to map and regulate prime wetlands to protect water quality, flood storage, and wildlife habitats. Concerns were raised about impacts on landowners, but supporters emphasized existing wetland restrictions. The bill passed with bipartisan support.
- **Groundwater Withdrawals (HB 235)**: The bill, reintroduced after dying in the Senate due to COVID-19, included amendments to clarify scientific standards for regulating PFAS in drinking water. It also passed with broad support.

### **6. Shoreland Act Amendments and Public Roads**
- **Shoreland Act**: Amendments focused on fee structures and exemptions for public utility lines, with concerns about the financial impact on DES and large projects like the Northern Pass.
- **Public Roads (HB 397)**: The bill, reintroduced with amendments, proposed capping fees for public projects funded by municipal, county, state, or federal entities. It aimed to address concerns about fee structures and clarity for water districts.

### **7. Other Bills and Discussions**
- **House Bill 426**: Retained for further investigation due to complications around septic system inspections.
- **House Bill 447**: Voted inexpedient to legislate, as mandating safety equipment for scuba diving was deemed impractical.
- **House Bill 534**: Voted inexpedient to legislate, as it faced opposition from multiple stakeholders, including Fish and Game and the Snowmobile Association.
- **House Bill 571**: Retained for further study on the impact of OHV travel on Hoyt Road Marsh, balancing recreation and wildlife concerns.
- **House Bill 611**: Retained for further discussion on abolishing fluoridation in water, as it was considered a polarizing issue requiring more information.
