#### **2. Small Business Development Center (SBDC)**

The commissioner acknowledged the program's value but noted the need to meet budget reduction targets.

---

#### **3. Workforce Development and Rest Areas**

- **Rest Areas and Staffing Challenges**: The committee discussed the **closure of rest areas**, particularly on Route 2, and staffing difficulties due to low pay and safety concerns. The commissioner highlighted the challenges of maintaining these facilities, especially during the pandemic.
