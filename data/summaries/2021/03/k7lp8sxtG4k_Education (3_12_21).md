**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (3/12/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on March 12, 2021, to discuss the potential merger of the state’s community college system with the university system, as outlined in **House Bill 2 (HB2)**. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, involved extensive deliberations on the implications, challenges, and opportunities of the proposed merger. Key themes and discussions included:

---

### **1. Purpose and Context of the Merger**
The meeting aimed to evaluate the creation of a new "superboard" to oversee both the community college and university systems. The merger proposal sought to streamline governance, improve efficiency, and enhance student access and affordability. However, the discussion revealed significant skepticism about the merger’s necessity and potential benefits.

### **2. Challenges and Concerns**
- **Distinct Missions and Institutional Identity**: Legislators and experts emphasized the importance of preserving the unique missions of community colleges and universities. Community colleges focus on workforce training, certification programs, and remedial education, while universities prioritize research and four-year degrees. There was concern that merging the systems could blur these distinctions and dilute institutional identities.
- **Accreditation and Academic Alignment**: Questions were raised about the feasibility of aligning accreditation standards, course credits, and learning outcomes between two-year and four-year institutions. Programs like engineering and math were highlighted as particularly challenging to harmonize.
- **Unintended Consequences**: Potential risks included disruptions to labor contracts, faculty compensation, and pension systems, as well as the loss of focus on local workforce needs. The complexity of merging multiple union agreements was noted.
- **Financial and Governance Issues**: Doubts were expressed about whether the merger would yield significant cost savings, given the already low administrative costs of both systems. Concerns were also raised about the proposed 23-member superboard, which would be entirely appointed through a political process, potentially undermining governance effectiveness.

### **3. Opportunities for Collaboration**
- **Transferability of Credits**: The need for a unified approach to ensure seamless credit transfer between institutions was emphasized. The **Synergies Group**, a collaborative effort between the two systems, was highlighted as a model for addressing transfer issues.
- **Regional and Online Education**: The New England Board of Higher Education’s regional tuition program was cited as a way to offer programs not available in New Hampshire, such as pharmacy, through reciprocity with other states. Online education and program sharing were also proposed as strategies to address declining K-12 enrollment and competition from out-of-state institutions.
- **Financial Aid and Affordability**: The **Granite Guarantee** program, which provides last-dollar tuition support for eligible students at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), was discussed as a model for expanding affordability initiatives. There was a call to create pathways for students to earn degrees with minimal debt.

### **4. Governance and Leadership**
- **Role of the Chancellor**: The need for a strong, CEO-style chancellor to oversee the merged system was emphasized. This individual would ensure that presidents of individual institutions report to a central authority rather than directly to the legislature.
- **Public Higher Education Oversight Committee**: The committee’s role in overseeing the organization and financing of public higher education was highlighted, with suggestions to involve them in the merger process.

---

### **5. Lessons from Other States**
Legislators discussed the experiences of other states, such as Connecticut and Minnesota, that have undergone similar mergers. These examples underscored the potential challenges and the importance of careful planning and stakeholder engagement.

---

### **6. Student Success and Workforce Needs**
- **Remedial Education**: Community colleges were praised for their role in providing remedial education, particularly in math, for students unprepared for college-level work. Concerns were raised that losing this focus could negatively impact student success and degree attainment.
- **Workforce Training**: The importance of maintaining certification programs and two-year degrees offered by community colleges was stressed, as these are vital for meeting regional business needs.

---

### **7. Next Steps**
The committee emphasized the need for a cautious, data-driven approach to evaluating the merger proposal. Key next steps included:
- Clearly defining the issues, desired outcomes, and metrics for success.
- Conducting a thorough study by the Synergies Group or a similar entity to analyze the merger’s potential impact.
- Engaging practitioners, experts, and stakeholders, including former chancellors and presidents, to gather insights and address key questions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of the proposed merger, with significant concerns raised about its potential impact on governance, institutional missions, and cost-effectiveness. While opportunities for collaboration and improved student access were acknowledged, the committee appeared to favor a careful, evidence-based approach to evaluating the proposal. The discussions highlighted the need to balance efficiency with the distinct roles of community colleges and universities in serving New Hampshire’s students and workforce.
