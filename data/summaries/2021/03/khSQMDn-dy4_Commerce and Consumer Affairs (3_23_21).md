The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee held an electronic meeting on March 23, 2021, to discuss several bills related to alcohol licensing, consumer affairs, and COVID-19 relief for businesses. The meeting focused on balancing economic opportunities for small businesses with regulatory concerns and public health considerations. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and bills addressed:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **Senate Bill 18 (SB 18)**  
Sponsored by Senator Regina Birdsell, SB 18 allows small, in-state distilleries producing fewer than 10,000 bottles annually to offer tastings at farmers' markets, similar to breweries and wineries. Tastings are limited to half an ounce per label per person. The bill aims to support small, incubator distilleries and has the backing of the New Hampshire Liquor Commission. Representatives from local distilleries, including Dory Distilling and Cathedral Ledge Distillery, testified in favor of the bill, highlighting its importance for small businesses and their commitment to responsible alcohol service.

#### **Senate Bill 14 (SB 14)**  
Sponsored by Senator Lou D'Alessandro, SB 14 authorizes the New Hampshire Liquor Commission to register trade names and operate as a direct shipper of liquor and wine within and outside the state. The bill seeks to enhance the commission’s competitiveness and revenue generation.  

Key discussions included:  
- **Amendment by Representative Lang**: Proposed extending direct shipping privileges to in-state beverage manufacturers, wineries, and distilleries to ensure parity with out-of-state businesses.  
- **Concerns**: Ambiguities in definitions, eligibility criteria, and fees for direct shipping licenses were raised. There were also concerns about potential overlaps with **Senate Bill 125**, which also addresses direct shipping.  
- **Broader Issues**: Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Grocers Association, expressed worries about the impact on the state’s three-tiered alcohol distribution system and the potential for illegal shipments.

#### **Senate Bill 17 (SB 17)**  
SB 17, sponsored by Senator Regina Birdsell, allows brew pubs to permit customers to bring dogs to outdoor areas and enables nano breweries and brew pubs to engage in contract brewing.  

Key points included:  
- **Contract Brewing Amendment**: Introduced by Senator Tom Sherman, this amendment allows brew pubs and nano breweries to expand production without significant capital investment by partnering with contract brewers. Wim Craft Pub and Brewery supported this provision, citing the high costs of expanding brewing capacity.  
- **Public Safety Concerns**: Questions were raised about sanitary issues and potential disruptions to the alcohol distribution system.  
- **Expansion to Restaurants**: The New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association advocated for extending the bill to include all restaurants, not just brew pubs.

#### **Senate Bill 66 (SB 66)**  
SB 66 allows on-premise licensees (e.g., restaurants) to deliver alcohol with food orders, a measure introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to support struggling businesses.  

Key discussions included:  
- **Support**: Industry representatives, including the Future Lodging and Restaurant Association and the Wine Institute, emphasized the bill’s importance as a revenue lifeline for restaurants.  
- **Concerns**: Public health advocates, such as New Futures, opposed the bill due to concerns about increased alcohol accessibility without corresponding investments in substance use disorder prevention and treatment.  
- **Amendments**: Suggestions included reducing the volume of alcohol allowed for delivery and shortening the bill’s **two-year sunset provision** to one year. Industry representatives argued for removing the sunset provision entirely to provide business certainty.  
- **Logistics**: The bill restricts alcohol delivery to employees of the licensed establishment, excluding third-party services like DoorDash, to address liability concerns.

#### **Senate Bill 107 (SB 107)**  
SB 107, sponsored by Senator Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, aims to provide financial assistance to newer businesses excluded from previous COVID-19 relief programs, such as the Main Street Relief Fund.  

Key points included:  
- **Testimonies in Support**: Business owners, including Doug Clark (restaurant owner) and Patrick Kelly (Strike 9 Brewing), shared their struggles as new businesses denied relief due to arbitrary cut-off dates. Elizabeth Tompkins (jewelry store owner) and Kevin Dwyer (restaurant owner) emphasized the importance of supporting locally owned businesses.  
- **Challenges**: New businesses often face delays in opening and lack pre-pandemic financial data, making them ineligible for relief programs. The appeals process for the Main Street Relief Fund was described as difficult to navigate.  
- **Legislative Intent**: SB 107 seeks to ensure that newer businesses are included in future federal relief funds, recognizing their economic importance and the need for equitable support.  
- **Unanimous Support**: The hearing concluded with 68 supporters, no opposition, and no neutral positions, reflecting strong backing for the bill.

3. **Regulatory Clarity and Fairness**: Ambiguities in definitions, fees, and eligibility criteria were recurring concerns, particularly in bills related to alcohol licensing and direct shipping.
