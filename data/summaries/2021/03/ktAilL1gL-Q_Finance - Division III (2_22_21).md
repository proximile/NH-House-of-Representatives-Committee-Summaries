The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division III meeting on February 22, 2021, centered on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), focusing on financial compliance, program quality, technology modernization, and strategic planning. The discussions highlighted key initiatives, challenges, and future goals across various divisions and bureaus within the department. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **1. Financial Compliance and Program Quality**
- **Financial Compliance Unit**: This unit manages the single audit process, ensures corrective action plans are implemented, and reduces outstanding audit findings. Responsibilities were centralized to improve efficiency.
- **Internal Audit Function**: A relatively new function, it focuses on establishing internal controls and issuing policy guidance. The department aims to respond to audit findings within 24 months and improve corrective action tracking.
- **Data Management and Analytics**: The data analytics unit evaluates data accuracy, conducts analysis, and manages Medicaid quality monitoring. A publicly accessible website tracks 200 measures derived from 7,000 data points to assess managed care organization performance.
- **Medicaid Quality Strategy**: Federally required, this strategy outlines how the state measures the health of its Medicaid population. The program reviews 200 measures and 50 tables/reports to identify trends and outliers.
- **Substance Misuse Planning and Evaluation**: This unit collaborates with partners to evaluate outcomes in substance use disorder programs, focusing on metrics like ER visit reductions, housing, employment, and family unity.

### **2. Division of Program Quality and Integrity**
- **Bureau of Program Integrity**: Focuses on preventing, detecting, and recovering fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid and food stamp programs. Key units include Medicaid Program Integrity, Third-Party Liability, Quality Assurance, and Special Investigations.
- **Third-Party Liability**: Ensures Medicaid is the payer of last resort by coordinating with other insurers to recover improper claims.
- **Special Investigations Unit**: Investigates and prosecutes client fraud in Medicaid, TANF, and food stamp benefits. The unit has faced significant turnover but is working to address backlogs.
- **Financial Recoveries**: Significant recoveries from fraud and abuse investigations contribute to general funds, with annual recoveries around $500,000.
- **Future Plans**: The division aims to finalize its mission and vision statements, establish key performance measures, and improve oversight mechanisms.

### **3. Substance Misuse Prevention and Health Services Assessment**
- **Substance Misuse Prevention**: The Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Services is exploring early intervention strategies and collaborating to provide data for targeted prevention services.
- **Health Services Assessment**: This unit conducts external quality reviews of providers, focusing on rigorous comparisons to ensure quality care. It also supports mental health centers and psychiatric inpatient facilities.
- **Budget and Salaries**: Concerns were raised about the high percentage of fringe benefits (54%) relative to salaries. The division is reviewing these calculations for accuracy.

### **4. Technology Modernization and Budget Challenges**
- **Centralized Claims System**: Plans are underway for a centralized claims system starting in 2025-2026 to streamline long-term support services, fee-for-service claims, and Medicaid claims.
- **System Improvements**: The department is modernizing legacy systems, including MMIS, New Heights, and the Child Support System, with plans starting as early as 2024. Salesforce platforms are being implemented for COVID-19 response, child care registry, and Medicaid quality assurance.
- **Hardware and Software Management**: Outdated hardware and software are being replaced to improve efficiency and reduce manual workarounds.
- **Budget Constraints**: The department faces funding challenges, with deferred maintenance on systems and a significant portion of the budget allocated to transfers to the Department of Information Technology (DoIT).
- **Staffing Issues**: A 33% vacancy rate in information services, driven by retirements and private-sector competition, has impacted project completion and service maintenance.
- **Strategic Planning**: Efforts are focused on improving system interoperability, reducing duplication, and enhancing client services. Better coordination between capital and operational budgets is needed.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has increased overtime costs and accelerated the implementation of technology solutions for contact tracing and other services.
- **Future Goals**: The department aims to improve care coordination, expand integrated eligibility systems, and implement a closed-loop referral system to enhance citizen services.

### **Key Challenges**
- **Data Access**: Real-time data is needed for effective investigations and fraud detection.
- **Staffing**: High vacancy rates, particularly in the Bureau of Program Integrity and information services, hinder operations.
- **Budget Limitations**: Funding constraints and deferred system maintenance pose significant hurdles.
- **Legacy Systems**: Outdated IT systems require modernization to improve efficiency and service delivery.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the DHHS’s commitment to enhancing financial compliance, program quality, and technology systems. While significant progress has been made in areas like Medicaid integrity, substance misuse prevention, and data management, challenges related to staffing, budget, and legacy systems remain. Strategic planning and modernization efforts are underway to address these issues and improve service delivery, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The department’s focus on accountability, efficiency, and innovation aims to ensure better outcomes for New Hampshire’s population.
