**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting on March 30, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened virtually on March 30, 2021, in compliance with COVID-19 emergency orders. The meeting focused on several key legislative discussions, procedural updates, and plans for future sessions. Here’s a detailed summary of the key points:

### **Meeting Logistics**
The Chair confirmed that the meeting adhered to House rules and emergency orders, with members and the public participating via Zoom or telephone. A roll call was conducted, with members stating their locations and confirming they were alone during the meeting.

### **Bill Status Update**
The Chair provided an update on the status of bills before the committee, which included 38 House bills and 6 Senate bills. Of these:
- 15 House bills were retained.
- 14 House bills were recommended to pass with amendments.
- 2 House bills were voted as "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate).
- 1 House bill was referred to municipal government.
- 3 Senate bills were acted upon, with 3 remaining for further consideration.

### **Discussion on Senate Bill 22: Sale of Lucky Seven Tickets**
Senate Bill 22 addresses the sale of Lucky Seven tickets, specifically allowing the play of electronic "Select E7" games, setting limits on deal sizes, and maximum prices per ticket. Diamond Distributors, a major paper Lucky Seven ticket distributor, opposed certain sections of the bill, particularly the removal of the requirement for paper tickets to be dispensed from electronic machines. They argued that this change blurs the line between Lucky Seven devices and slot machines. The discussion also referenced past court rulings and legislation, such as House Bill 348.

### **Discussion on Senate Bill 27: Charitable Gambling Revenues**
The committee discussed Senate Bill 27, which relates to the sale of Lucky Seven tickets and charitable gambling revenues. Charlie McIntyre, Executive Director of the NH Lottery, explained that the bill was drafted in response to a request from Feed New Hampshire.org, a charitable trust seeking an exemption to access charitable gambling revenues despite not being registered with the Secretary of State. The committee raised concerns about the definition of charitable organizations and whether expanding eligibility could lead to a floodgate of similar requests.

### **Debate on House Bill 626: Horse Racing Machines**
A heated discussion occurred regarding House Bill 626, which involves horse racing machines. Representative Elliot questioned the logic of a three-year pause on new establishments using these machines. Representative Romney defended the bill, arguing it prevents the proliferation of standalone gaming locations and allows communities to opt-in. Representative Kirk criticized the bill, accusing opponents of hypocrisy, particularly noting Churchill Downs' involvement in similar gaming initiatives elsewhere.

### **Future Meeting Plans**
The Chair outlined plans for upcoming sessions, including:
- Focus on House Bills 1, 2, and 25 on Wednesday.
- Discussion of "Ought to Pass" bills on Thursday.
- Consideration of "ITL" bills on Friday.
- A Republican caucus scheduled for the next day.
- A presentation on the federal stimulus bill’s impact on state revenues.

### **Committee Work**
The committee acknowledged the complexity of some bills and the need for further work sessions to address unresolved issues, particularly concerning charitable gambling and the definition of eligible organizations.

The meeting highlighted procedural updates, detailed debates on specific bills, and outlined plans for future legislative work, reflecting the committee’s commitment to thorough and thoughtful deliberation on key issues.
