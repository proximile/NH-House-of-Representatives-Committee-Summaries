**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division III Meeting (March 12, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division III, convened remotely on March 12, 2021, to discuss House Bill 2 (HB2), the state's budget trailer bill. The meeting, conducted via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on budgetary and funding issues, with an emphasis on transparency, thorough review, and public access. Key discussions and decisions from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

1. **Catastrophic Aid Suspension**  
   - The committee debated whether to suspend or repeal catastrophic aid payments to hospitals. A motion to retain the suspension of catastrophic aid in HB2 was unanimously approved, with some members suggesting it be retained in case future funding becomes available.

2. **Medical Education Funding**  
   - The oversight of not including graduate medical education (direct and indirect) payments in HB2 was discussed. The committee agreed to draft an amendment to include these payments, despite concerns about reducing support for medical education amid workforce shortages.

3. **Foster Grandparent Program**  
   - The committee debated whether to repeal or suspend the Foster Grandparent Program, which had been inactive for over a decade. Some members advocated for suspension, citing the program's value, while the department argued for repeal due to insufficient funding and operational challenges. Further discussion was planned.

4. **Social Services Block Grant**  
   - Section 23, which adjusts the Social Services Block Grant based on cost-of-living increases, was reviewed. The department requested additional language to streamline reporting requirements and reduce repetitive administrative processes.

5. **Transparency and Process**  
   - Members emphasized the importance of transparency and thorough review of budgetary items, particularly those without clear dollar amounts. They agreed to revisit several items in future meetings to ensure proper funding and implementation. Concerns were raised about approving funds without reviewing necessary reports.

6. **HB2 Sections and Appropriations**  
   - The committee reviewed multiple sections of HB2, focusing on identifying areas requiring further discussion, research, or amendments. Key sections included:  
     - **Lakes Region Facility Sale (Section 20)**: Discussion deferred pending more information.  
     - **Quarterly Reports (Section 21)**: Considered standard boilerplate language, with potential penalties for non-compliance discussed.  
     - **Unfunded Positions (Section 21)**: Concerns were raised about unfunded positions in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), with suggestions to freeze hiring.  
     - **Medicaid Enhancement Tax (Section 27)**: The use of Medicaid enhancement tax revenue was discussed, with clarification requested from DHHS.  
     - **Parental Reimbursement (Section 30)**: The committee debated eliminating parental reimbursement for child placement in state programs, with some members questioning its cost-effectiveness.  
     - **Weiler Rule (Section 32)**: The committee unanimously supported continuing the requirement for DHHS to seek legislative approval for federal eligibility changes.  
     - **Reproductive Health Facilities (Section 34)**: Proposed language changes were acknowledged, but detailed discussion was deferred until the new language was available.

7. **Forensic Psychiatric Hospital**  
   - Concerns were raised about funding a 60-bed forensic psychiatric hospital, especially given ongoing discussions about the future of the Sununu Center and mental health care in the state.

8. **Dental Medicaid Program**  
   - The committee discussed the potential reinstatement of a dental Medicaid program, noting its cost-effectiveness in preventing more severe health issues. However, it was clarified that no current program exists to fund this initiative.

9. **Voting on HB2 Sections**  
   - The committee took roll-call votes on several HB2 sections, including accepting sections related to the New Hampshire Granite Advantage Healthcare Trust Fund and other budgetary items.

### **Future Meetings and Process**  
- The committee planned to meet daily through March 26 to continue reviewing HB2, with specific sections scheduled for deeper discussion and potential amendments. A work session was confirmed for the following Monday.  
- The chair emphasized the importance of efficiency and ensuring all voices are heard in the decision-making process. The committee discussed the best approach to handling remaining HB2 items and potential amendments.  
- Public transparency and adherence to notice requirements were highlighted, ensuring all discussions were properly calendared and accessible to the public.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting concluded with acknowledgments to department representatives and a reminder to prepare for future discussions on the budget. The committeeâ€™s focus remained on careful consideration of budgetary items, the importance of reviewing reports before making funding decisions, and ensuring transparency and public input in the legislative process.
