**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance - Division III Meeting (March 8, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division III, convened on March 8, 2021, to discuss the state’s Medicaid program and related budgetary matters. The meeting, held remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, featured presentations and discussions led by key officials, including Medicaid Director Henry Lipman and Medicaid Finance Director Athena Gagnon. The discussions centered on Medicaid program improvements, funding challenges, quality measures, and the state’s response to the ongoing public health emergency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points covered across all segments:

---

### **Medicaid Program Overview and COVID-19 Impact**
- **Mission and Enrollment**: Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to low-income populations, including the elderly, disabled, and children. Enrollment increased significantly during the pandemic, particularly in the Granite Advantage program (Medicaid expansion), which saw a 41.6% rise in enrollment since March 2020.
- **Federal Funding**: New Hampshire receives at least 50% federal matching through the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), with enhanced rates during the public health emergency. However, there is uncertainty about the duration of this enhanced funding, potentially leading to budget shortfalls in 2022 and 2023.
- **Demographics and Expenditures**: The elderly and disabled account for the majority of Medicaid expenditures, despite representing a smaller portion of the enrollee population.

---

### **Quality Measures and Performance Improvement**
- **Key Metrics**: The state tracks quality measures such as well-child visits, breast cancer screening, blood pressure control, and follow-up care after emergency department visits for mental illness and substance use. New Hampshire generally scores above the national average but aims to improve further, particularly in follow-up care for substance use.
- **Performance Goals**: The state focuses on raising performance to the 75th percentile in areas like prevention, treatment, adolescent health, women's health, mental health, and substance use disorder.
- **Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)**: The state uses MCOs to deliver Medicaid services and has implemented incentive programs to encourage MCOs to meet performance targets. A consumer guide helps Medicaid members compare MCOs based on quality metrics.

---

### **Program Improvements and Legislative Updates**
- **Managed Care Contracts**: The state renegotiated MCO contracts to reallocate funds to safety net providers during the pandemic. Efforts include leveraging federal waivers to expand telemedicine and compensate family members for caregiving.
- **Adult Dental Program**: Two bills (Senate Bill 150 and House Bill 103) are under consideration to shape and fund the adult dental benefit program, with implementation planned for April 2022.
- **Medicaid to Schools**: This program allows schools to receive Medicaid reimbursement for services provided to eligible students, with potential expansion to include telemedicine services.
- **Federal Compliance**: The state has addressed compliance requirements, such as documenting intergovernmental transfers and submitting state plan amendments.

---

### **Telehealth and Workforce Challenges**
- **Telehealth Expansion**: The state expanded telehealth services during the pandemic, leveraging federal waivers and executive orders. A new eligibility group was created for COVID-19 testing, providing 100% federal match funding.
- **Workforce Shortages**: The state is addressing healthcare workforce shortages by exploring options like individual nurse enrollment and expanding the scope of practice for certain roles. The governor’s budget includes funding to address staffing vacancies in the Medicaid division.

---

### **Budgetary and Administrative Challenges**
- **Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)**: The MMIS, which processes Medicaid claims, is undergoing a modular re-procurement strategy to modernize the system over the next five years. Inadequate maintenance could risk losing federal funding.
- **Uncompensated Care Fund**: Also known as the Medicaid Enhancement Tax (MET), this fund supports hospitals and has been impacted by the pandemic.
- **Electronic Health Records (EHR) Incentive Payments**: The EHR incentive program is winding down, and the state is transitioning to a new MMIS, which requires running two systems simultaneously, increasing costs.

---

### **Special Programs and Grants**
- **Maternal Opioid Misuse Model Grant**: A federal grant supports mothers and children affected by opioid addiction, with enrollment set to begin in July 2021. The program targets 250-300 mothers annually in the Manchester area.
- **Innovation for the Delivery of New Systems (IDN) Waiver**: This waiver funded initiatives like technology for tracking patient admissions and discharges, expanded substance use disorder treatment providers, and improved care coordination in correctional systems. The waiver’s total cost was reduced from $110 million to $75-$80 million due to county funding shortfalls.
- **Dual Eligibles Program**: The state funds a program for individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid to cover Part D prescription drug benefits, with funding rates determined annually in October.

---

### **Future Challenges and Focus Areas**
- **Enrollment and Disenrollment**: The state anticipates disenrolling ineligible individuals once the public health emergency ends, which could result in significant cost savings.
- **Long-Term Supports and Services**: The committee planned to discuss long-term supports and services in subsequent meetings, indicating their importance in the Medicaid budget.
- **Budget Concerns**: The governor’s budget includes increases in general funds, partly due to the transfer of DCYF (Division for Children, Youth, and Families) costs into the Medicaid budget. Adequate funding is critical to avoid financial penalties and maintain federal matching funds.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s efforts to enhance Medicaid services, address healthcare workforce issues, and comply with federal requirements while responding to the ongoing public health emergency. Key challenges include managing budget shortfalls, modernizing Medicaid systems, and ensuring adequate funding for critical programs. The state remains focused on improving quality measures, expanding access to care, and addressing the long-term impacts of the pandemic on healthcare delivery and funding.
