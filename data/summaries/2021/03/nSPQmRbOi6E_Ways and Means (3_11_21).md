The March 11, 2021, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee was a comprehensive session focused on fiscal policies, tax reforms, and revenue impacts. Conducted electronically via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the meeting addressed a wide range of issues, with an emphasis on balancing fiscal responsibility with the state’s economic needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Fiscal and Revenue Issues**
1. **Credit Carryovers (CCOs)**:
   - The committee debated the impact of accumulated credit carryovers on state revenues. Options included refunding overpayments to taxpayers or spreading out the financial impact over time. Concerns were raised about the potential strain on state liquidity, with estimates suggesting fiscal impacts ranging from $30.2 million in FY22 to $107 million in FY24. The committee considered whether to “rip the band-aid off” with immediate action or adopt a more gradual approach.

2. **Single Sales Factor Delay**:
   - Members discussed delaying the implementation of the single sales factor tax apportionment method, previously included in the budget. This delay could increase revenue estimates for FY23. The committee weighed historical data and economic trends to inform their decision and considered including the delay in House Bill 2 (HB2).

3. **Revenue Estimates and Economic Trends**:
   - The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) provided updated revenue estimates, which did not account for the single sales factor. Discussions included the potential positive or negative effects of delaying its implementation. Broader economic indicators, such as unemployment rates and vaccination progress, were also considered in assessing the state’s fiscal outlook.

4. **Tax Policy Changes**:
   - **Business Enterprise Tax (BET) Reduction**: A reduction in the BET rate was projected to result in a $4.7 million loss in FY22 and a $13.3 million loss in FY23, partially offset by increased Business Profits Tax (BPT) revenues.
   - **Meals and Rooms Tax Reduction**: A proposal to reduce the meals and rooms tax from 9% to 8.5% was reviewed, with an estimated $19 million annual revenue loss. Some members questioned whether this reduction would significantly impact consumer behavior.
   - **Interest and Dividend Tax Reduction**: The committee confirmed a $6.3 million revenue reduction in FY23 due to the phased elimination of the interest and dividend tax.

5. **Travel and Tourism Funding**:
   - The suspension of travel and tourism development funding raised concerns about its impact on New Hampshire’s tourism industry. Studies suggested that every dollar spent on tourism advertising generates $8 in tax revenue, making the suspension potentially detrimental to the state’s economy.

6. **Revenue Sharing and Liquor Commission**:
   - The committee discussed the suspension of revenue sharing with cities and towns for the biennium, a provision similar to the previous budget. Additionally, the Liquor Commission was enabled to process merchant cards independently of the Department of Information Technology.

### **Legislative and Procedural Matters**
1. **House Bill 614 Error**:
   - Representative Ross informed the committee about an error in the amendment adopted for House Bill 614, where the wrong amendment was mistakenly adopted. The committee discussed steps to rectify the error, including potentially adopting a new amendment in the next session.

2. **House Bill 15**:
   - The committee debated House Bill 15, which includes internet transaction facilitators and motor vehicle rentals under the meals and rooms tax. An amendment clarifying that travel service agents are not taxed under the bill passed with a 12-11 vote. The bill, with the amendment, passed with a 22-2 vote, though Representative Schamberg indicated he would provide a minority report opposing it.

3. **Public Hearings and Revenue Estimates**:
   - The committee scheduled public hearings for several Senate bills and planned to update revenue estimates for the finance committee. The urgency of providing accurate revenue estimates was emphasized.

### **Committee Procedures and Next Steps**
- The committee planned to continue discussions in upcoming meetings, focusing on revenue estimates, the single sales factor, and other fiscal policies. Members stressed the importance of detailed analysis, consensus-building, and clear documentation before finalizing decisions.

### **Key Themes**
The meeting highlighted the tension between tax reduction goals and the need to maintain state revenue and fiscal stability. Discussions underscored the importance of balancing immediate economic relief with long-term fiscal responsibility. Procedural issues, such as correcting legislative errors and ensuring accurate revenue estimates, were also central to the committee’s work. Overall, the session demonstrated the committee’s commitment to addressing complex fiscal challenges while maintaining transparency and accountability.
