The transcript is from the **first meeting of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting**, held on March 9, 2021. The meeting was conducted virtually via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Introduction and Roll Call**:  
   - Chair Barbara Griffin opened the meeting, and Representative McDonald conducted a roll call to confirm attendance. Members confirmed they were alone or with minimal others in their locations, as required by the Right-to-Know Law.

2. **Purpose of the Meeting**:  
   - The committee’s purpose was to officially receive redistricting bills (HB 50-55) before deadlines. However, the committee acknowledged that redistricting data from the U.S. Census Bureau would not be available until September 2021, significantly delaying their work.

3. **Public Input and Technical Issues**:  
   - Public sign-up for the meeting was reportedly unavailable due to a broken link, limiting public participation. Two attendees, Olivia Zink (Open Democracy Action) and Liz Tentarelli (League of Women Voters), spoke, emphasizing the importance of fair, nonpartisan redistricting and public engagement.

4. **Discussion on Redistricting Challenges**:  
   - Members discussed past redistricting issues, including the complexities of creating floaterial districts (districts combining multiple towns) and the tension between state constitutional requirements (e.g., towns with sufficient populations having their own representatives) and federal equal representation mandates.
   - Representative Weber highlighted the challenges of representing multi-town districts and the need to balance state and federal requirements.

5. **Bills and Motions**:  
   - The committee unanimously voted to retain six bills (HB 50-55) related to apportioning state representative, state senate, congressional, executive council, county commissioner, and state party convention delegate districts. These bills will serve as vehicles for future redistricting work.

6. **Future Meetings and Process**:  
   - Chair Griffin proposed holding future meetings to discuss the redistricting process and public input, even before census data is available. Members agreed on the importance of establishing guidelines and addressing procedural questions early.
   - Scheduling challenges were noted, as committee members are also part of other committees with overlapping meeting times.

7. **Closing Remarks**:  
   - The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the day’s town elections and a reminder to coordinate future meeting schedules to avoid conflicts.

Overall, the meeting focused on procedural steps, acknowledging the delay in census data, and setting the stage for future discussions on redistricting. The committee emphasized transparency, public input, and the need to address both state and federal redistricting requirements.
