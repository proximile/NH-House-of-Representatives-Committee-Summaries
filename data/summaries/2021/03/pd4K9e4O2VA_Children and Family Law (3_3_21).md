### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Divorce and Equality in Family Law**
- **House Bill 142**: This bill aimed to modernize divorce laws by clarifying grounds for divorce, including habitual substance abuse and same-sex adultery. Testimonies, such as from **Mindy Green**, highlighted the inequality faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, who cannot cite adultery in same-sex marriages under current law. **Attorney Jay Markell** emphasized the bill’s goal of ensuring fairness for both traditional and same-sex couples.
- **House Bill 139**: This bill sought to require evidence in divorce cases to be submitted at least five days before a hearing to ensure due process. While supporters argued it prevents unfair surprise evidence, opponents raised concerns that it could be exploited by abusers to delay proceedings, particularly in cases involving alimony or child support.

#### **2. Parental Rights and Due Process**
- **House Bill 547**: This bill proposed that each parent be entitled to at least one evidentiary hearing in custody cases. **Representative Gay** shared a case where a parent was denied a hearing despite evidence of child abuse. However, opponents like **Aaron Justina** (NH Legal Assistance) argued that existing laws already guarantee this right, making the bill redundant.
- **Guardian ad Litem (GAL) Responsibilities**: Another bill aimed to require GALs to refer parties suspected of domestic violence to crisis centers and conduct lethality assessments. Critics warned this could misidentify victims and breach confidentiality.

#### **3. Reunification Therapy and Custody Cases**
The meeting extensively discussed the harmful practice of **reunification therapy**, often ordered in custody cases involving allegations of abuse. Key concerns included:
- **Trauma and Revictimization**: Reunification therapy forces children to interact with abusive parents, causing further harm.
- **Financial Burden**: Families face significant out-of-pocket costs for therapy, which is often not covered by insurance.
- **Lack of Due Process**: Judges frequently order therapy without evidentiary hearings, relying on unqualified therapists.
- **Legislative Solutions**: Bills like **House Bill 556** aimed to prohibit state-ordered counseling without recognized medical codes, particularly targeting reunification therapy. Advocates called for stronger language to ban the practice outright.

#### **4. Domestic Violence and Judicial Reform**
- **House Bill 577**: This bill proposed moving domestic violence cases from family court to superior court to ensure more serious treatment and accountability. **Representative Gay** argued that family court often fails to protect victims, while opponents like **Erin Jacina** (NH Legal Assistance) contended that family court judges are better trained to handle family dynamics.
- **Coercive Control Model**: Advocates urged adopting the UK’s coercive control model to better address domestic violence and educate judges on abuse dynamics.

#### **5. Judicial Efficiency and Case Management**
- **Complex Case Docket Assignment**: A bill aimed to prevent certain cases from being assigned to complex or high-conflict dockets, with concerns raised about the reallocation of marital cases to criminal courts.
- **Pro Se Litigants**: Discussions highlighted the challenges faced by unrepresented parties in family court, particularly in superior court settings.
- **Study Committee**: A proposed committee would work with the circuit court to gather data and improve decision-making in parental rights and responsibilities cases.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities and challenges in family law, with a focus on protecting vulnerable individuals, ensuring due process, and modernizing outdated legal frameworks.
