**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting - Division II (March 10, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, convened on March 10, 2021, to discuss budget-related matters for various state departments, including Safety, Transportation, and Fish and Game. Due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the meeting was conducted electronically, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone. The discussions centered on budget adjustments, funding challenges, and the importance of maintaining critical state services amidst financial constraints.

### **Key Discussions and Decisions:**

#### **1. Budget Adjustments and Revenue Reclassification**
- **Department of Safety Budget**: The Department of Safety proposed several budget adjustments, including reclassifying revenue sources for intra-agency transfers and grants from external state agencies to align with accounting practices. Specific adjustments included:
  - **New Hampshire Hospital Security Operations**: Increased appropriations to match budgeted amounts with the Department of Health and Human Services.
  - **Highway Fund Adjustment**: Corrected a keying error to ensure full funding of the Commissioner’s office debt service by highway funds.
  
- **Division-Wide Adjustments**: The committee discussed reducing reliance on the general and highway funds by reallocating resources to dedicated funds (e.g., fire fund, watercraft safety fund, criminal records fund, and 911 fund). The highway fund, in particular, has faced significant strain, necessitating careful management to avoid service cuts.

#### **2. New Initiatives and Programs**
- **Body Cameras Program**: A new $1 million program to provide body and cruiser cameras to local law enforcement agencies was introduced. The Department of Safety requested a full-time temporary Business Administrator position to oversee the program, with concerns raised about its affordability given budget constraints.
  
- **Cold Case Unit**: The importance of the Cold Case Unit, which investigates unsolved crimes with a minimal staff of two full-time investigators, was emphasized. The committee highlighted its value in seeking justice for victims and their families, noting ongoing inquiries from families about progress in investigations.

#### **3. Staffing, Human Impact, and Employee Well-Being**
- **Staffing Shortages**: Budget constraints have led to unfunding 50 positions and increased stress on employees. The committee acknowledged the human toll of these cuts and discussed efforts to support employee well-being, including implementing a new wellness and resiliency policy.
  
- **Retiree Health Costs**: Increased retiree health costs were addressed, with funding redistributed across divisions to ensure sustainability without long-term concerns.

#### **4. Federal Funding, Grants, and Compliance**
- **Federal Grants**: The committee stressed the importance of effectively managing federal funds, particularly those related to COVID-19, disaster response, and highway safety. Compliance with federal programs was highlighted to avoid losing critical funding.
  
- **Highway Safety Initiatives**: Federal grants support traffic safety initiatives, such as seat belt promotion and traffic enforcement, through the Office of Highway Safety. The potential impact of reduced federal funding on these activities was discussed.

#### **5. Law Enforcement and Public Safety**
- **Gun Licensing and Background Checks**: The committee reviewed the state’s role in conducting background checks for handgun purchases, while the FBI handles long gun purchases. Concerns were raised about potential shifts in responsibility, with the state arguing its checks provide additional safety layers.
  
- **Lab and Toxicology Services**: Additional funding and positions were requested for the state’s lab, particularly for urine and CODIS (DNA database) testing. Backlogs in forensic and toxicology services could delay court cases and law enforcement investigations.

#### **6. Public Access and Future Planning**
- **Public Participation**: The committee ensured public access to the meeting and addressed potential issues with participation. Upcoming public hearings on the budget were planned, with expectations of higher participation due to virtual access.
  
- **House Bill 2 (HB2)**: Sections of HB2 were revisited, including discussions on body and dashboard camera funds, transfer authorities, and filling unfunded positions.

#### **7. Division-Specific Challenges**
- The committee recognized the unique challenges of Division II, which includes dedicated funds like the education trust fund and highway fund. Balancing these with general fund allocations was a key focus.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of budget management, the impact of funding cuts on state operations and employees, and the importance of strategic planning to maintain essential services. Discussions highlighted the need for careful allocation of resources, effective grant management, and support for critical programs like the Cold Case Unit, body cameras initiative, and lab services. The committee emphasized transparency and public participation as it worked to address financial challenges while ensuring the continued delivery of vital state services.
