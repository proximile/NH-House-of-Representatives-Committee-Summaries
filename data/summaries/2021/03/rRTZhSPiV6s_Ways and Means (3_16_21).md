### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (March 16, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on March 16, 2021, to discuss several bills related to charitable gaming, tax transparency, and disaster response.

---

#### **Charitable Gaming Bills (SB 22, 23, 25, 27)**

1. **Senate Bill 22**:  
   - **Lucky 7 Dispensing Devices**: The bill proposes making the printing of paper tickets optional for Lucky 7 machines, aiming to reduce costs for charities and promote environmental sustainability. Supporters argued that many players discard unused tickets, while opponents contended that paper tickets differentiate these devices from slot machines and maintain the integrity of charitable gaming.  
   - **Deal Size Increase**: The bill seeks to increase the maximum deal size for Lucky 7 tickets from 3,500 to 14,000, with proponents claiming this would attract more players and increase prizes. Critics argued it primarily benefits machine operators and could harm traditional bingo games.  
   - **Blurring Lines with Slot Machines**: Concerns were raised about features like autoplay, bright screens, and sound effects making Lucky 7 machines resemble casino games, potentially undermining the purpose of charitable gaming.  
   - **Paper vs. Electronic Games**: Traditional paper Lucky 7 tickets are more profitable for charities, with higher revenue retention compared to electronic games. Critics worried that electronic games, which offer higher payouts to players, could divert funds from charities.  
   - **Membership Requirements**: The committee discussed challenges faced by non-membership charities (e.g., organizations serving homeless populations) in meeting eligibility requirements for charitable gaming, suggesting accommodations should be made.  
   - **Opposition Testimony**: Diamond Distributors, a supplier of paper Lucky 7 tickets, opposed the bill, arguing it would further blur the line between dispensing devices and slot machines and harm charities reliant on traditional bingo games.  

2. **Senate Bill 23**:  
   - Sponsored by **Senator Tom Sherman**, this bill removes the outdated requirement for a member of the sponsoring charitable organization to sign daily affidavits during gaming events. Both charities and gaming operators supported the change, citing reduced logistical burdens.  

3. **Senate Bill 25**:  
   - Presented by **Representative Norm Major** on behalf of Senator Chuck Morse, the bill simplifies the administration of charitable gaming licenses by resetting the 10-day gaming limit to December 31st each year, rather than on the anniversary of the license issuance. This change aims to reduce administrative complexity for gaming operators.  

4. **Senate Bill 27**:  
   - A "housekeeping" bill requested by the gaming commission, SB 27 updates definitions and processes related to charitable gaming licenses, including the definition of a "deal" in Lucky Seven games.  
   - **Membership Requirements**: Concerns were raised about excluding non-membership organizations like educational or medical nonprofits, prompting suggestions to revise the language for inclusivity.  
   - **Secretary of State Registration**: Clarification was provided on the significance of registering with the Secretary of State, which confirms an organization’s existence and New Hampshire-based status.

#### **Current Use Tax Formula (SB 48)**

1. **Senate Bill 48**:  
   - Sponsored by **Senator Bob Guida**, the bill seeks to make the formula used to determine current use tax rates publicly available, promoting government transparency.  
   - **Supporting Testimony**: **Jason Stock** of the NH Timberland Owners Association and **Robert Johnson** of the NH Farm Bureau testified in favor, emphasizing the formula’s straightforward cash flow analysis and the benefits of transparency for landowners and the public.  
   - **DRA Position**: **Carolyn Lear**, Assistant Commissioner at the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA), clarified that the DRA does not oppose the bill but worked with the sponsor to ensure no issues with the proposed exemption.

#### **Disaster Response Nexus Provisions (SB 103-fn)**

1. **Senate Bill 103-fn**:  
   - Sponsored by **Senator Bradley**, the bill streamlines nexus provisions for out-of-state businesses and employees performing disaster-related or emergency work in New Hampshire. It removes regulatory obstacles like taxes, licensing, and registration during declared emergencies.  
   - **Supporting Testimony**: **Owen Smith** of AT&T highlighted the bill’s role in facilitating rapid disaster response and recovery, noting that 32 other states have similar legislation.  
   - **Concerns**: **Carolyn Lear** from the DRA raised potential revenue losses, as the bill could exempt out-of-state businesses from nexus during disaster response periods.  
   - **Committee Discussions**: Members debated the bill’s impact on liability, revenue, and local business opportunities, with questions about mandatory reporting for out-of-state contractors.

#### **Next Steps**

The committee acknowledged the need to refine several bills, particularly regarding membership requirements for charities, deal sizes for Lucky 7 games, and language clarity in SB 27. They also planned to review revenue estimates, the impact of federal stimulus funds and vaccinations on state revenues, and upcoming work on **House Bill 2**. Discussions with the **Controller** and **Treasurer** on the **credit carry-forward issue** were also scheduled for future sessions.

### Conclusion

The meeting highlighted bipartisan support for streamlining charitable gaming regulations, promoting tax transparency, and facilitating disaster response efforts. However, concerns about revenue impacts, regulatory clarity, and the integrity of charitable gaming remained central to the discussions. The committee planned to address these issues in subsequent work sessions and refine the bills to better align with stakeholder needs and public interests.
