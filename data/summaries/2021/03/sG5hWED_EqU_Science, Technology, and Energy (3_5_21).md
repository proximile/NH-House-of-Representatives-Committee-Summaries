The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee meeting on March 5, 2021, centered on energy policy, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. The discussions, held remotely due to the COVID-19 emergency, focused on several key bills and broader issues, including net metering, renewable energy, forest management, and air quality. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Net Metering and Local Energy Generation**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill 106**, which proposed raising the net metering cap for municipalities from 1 megawatt (MW) to 5 MW. An amendment introduced a 2 MW cap, sparking significant discussion. Proponents of the higher cap argued that it would support municipalities and hydro facilities already investing in larger projects, while others viewed the 2 MW cap as a pilot program to test the concept. Concerns were raised about reintroducing caps, as previous net metering caps had been lifted. The economic impact of net metering was also discussed, with some arguing that the default service rate for net metered electricity does not account for reliability and infrastructure costs. Many representatives supported the bill as a way to encourage local power generation, reduce energy costs, and decrease reliance on imported energy. The committee considered phased approaches to increasing the cap over time to balance pilot testing with municipal needs.

### **Community Power and Energy Independence**
The committee discussed **House Bill 315**, which focuses on community power aggregation. A bipartisan amendment was introduced to balance consumer protection with innovation in community power programs. Key provisions included metering standards, capacity obligations for municipal aggregators, and protections for non-participants to ensure they are not burdened by program costs. The amendment also allows counties to create aggregation plans for subsets of municipalities, provided they request participation by majority vote. Representatives emphasized the importance of reducing New Hampshire’s dependence on out-of-state energy and supporting local projects like solar and hydro power. The transition to clean energy was highlighted as a way to achieve economic and environmental benefits.

### **Renewable Energy and Economic Considerations**
The meeting underscored the economic advantages of local energy generation, particularly for municipalities, schools, and businesses. However, concerns were raised about the intermittency of renewable energy sources like solar and wind and the need for reliable baseline power systems. The discussion also touched on the importance of energy storage solutions, such as batteries and pumped hydro storage, to manage energy demand peaks. The economic impact of renewable energy policies on industries like biomass and timber was a recurring theme, with representatives expressing concerns about job losses and the viability of biomass plants.

### **Environmental and Air Quality Initiatives**
The committee addressed New Hampshire’s progress in reducing emissions, with significant reductions (50% to 95%) achieved over the past 30 years due to state laws and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. However, further reductions will require new policies. The state is exploring remote inspections and leveraging technology to enhance environmental monitoring and enforcement. Vehicle emissions remain the largest source of pollution, and the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and the development of charging infrastructure were discussed. The state is investing in EV infrastructure using funds from the VW settlement and participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions from power plants. The committee also addressed PFAS contamination, emphasizing regulation, permitting, and enforcement actions to manage emissions.

### **Forest Management and Biomass**
The importance of New Hampshire’s forest industry and biomass energy was highlighted, with discussions on the economic and environmental benefits of using low-grade wood products for thermal energy. Concerns were raised about stricter EPA standards on particulate matter (PM) emissions from wood-burning stoves and biomass plants, which could impact regulations. Representatives stressed the need for cleaner wood-burning technologies and proposed creating a study commission to explore alternative uses for low-grade wood products.

### **Legislative Process and Bipartisanship**
The committee emphasized the importance of bipartisan cooperation and compromise to advance energy and environmental policies. Several bills were retained for further discussion to reduce the workload for an upcoming legislative session. The procedural aspects of retaining and amending bills were discussed, with representatives highlighting the need for stability and predictability in energy policy to support businesses and constituents.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing environmental, economic, and regulatory considerations in energy policy. Key themes included the promotion of local energy generation, the transition to clean energy, the economic impact on local industries, and the importance of bipartisan collaboration to achieve sustainable energy and environmental goals. The committee aimed to finalize amendments and prepare for votes on critical bills, ensuring they align with the needs of municipalities and support New Hampshire’s transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy future.
