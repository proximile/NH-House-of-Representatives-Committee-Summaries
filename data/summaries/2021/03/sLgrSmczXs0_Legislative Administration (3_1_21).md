**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting (March 1, 2021): Legislative Administration**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 1, 2021, focused on discussions surrounding **House Concurrent Resolution 2 (HCR2)** and several related bills aimed at addressing the state of emergency declared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting, conducted virtually via Zoom due to the ongoing emergency, highlighted significant debates over executive overreach, legislative oversight, and the societal impacts of prolonged emergency measures.

### **Key Discussions and Themes**

1. **House Concurrent Resolution 2 (HCR2)**:
   - **Purpose**: HCR2 sought to terminate the state of emergency, arguing that the initial crisis had passed and that the continuation of emergency powers was no longer justified.
   - **Support**: Numerous speakers, including legislators, experts, and members of the public, supported HCR2. They criticized Governor Chris Sununu for assuming unilateral control through emergency orders, bypassing the legislature, and violating constitutional principles such as separation of powers, individual liberties, and privacy rights.
   - **Testimonies**:
     - **Representative Leah Kushman** and **Dr. Jay Bhattacharya** (Stanford University) argued that the state of emergency was no longer necessary, citing data on COVID-19 deaths, hospital capacity, and vaccination progress. They highlighted the disproportionate harms of lockdowns, including mental health issues and economic damage.
     - **James Conor**, **Leslie Tatro**, and **Donald McFarland** emphasized that the prolonged state of emergency infringed on constitutional rights and caused significant societal harm, particularly to children and vulnerable populations.
     - **David Martin** questioned the scientific basis for the initial emergency declaration, arguing that it served commercial interests rather than public health.
   - **Opposition**: **Representative Timothy Horan** defended the state of emergency, arguing that it was necessary to protect public health given the severity of the pandemic.

2. **Legislative Oversight and Executive Authority**:
   - **House Bill 389**: Proposed the creation of a **Legislative Emergency Executive Orders Oversight Committee** to review and approve the renewal of the governor's emergency orders. The committee would consist of 10 members, with a majority or tie vote required to renew an order. The bill aimed to restore legislative involvement in emergency decision-making and was supported by those frustrated with the lack of legislative input during the pandemic.
   - **House Bills 277, 280, 325, and 559**: These bills aimed to enhance legislative oversight over emergency declarations and orders. They proposed mechanisms for remote decision-making, allowing the legislature to terminate specific emergency orders, and requiring legislative renewal of a state of emergency beyond the initial 21-day period. Debates centered on the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches and the practicality of remote decision-making.

3. **Criticism of Executive Overreach**:
   - Multiple speakers, including **Mark Rosetti** and **Daniel Richard**, criticized the governorâ€™s use of emergency powers as bypassing the legislature and violating constitutional principles. They called for restoring legislative authority and ending the state of emergency.
   - **Tammy Clark**, an OSHA-certified health and safety expert, testified against mandatory mask-wearing, stating that masks are ineffective against viral transmission and can create health hazards, especially for children.

4. **Societal and Economic Impact**:
   - Testimonies highlighted the negative effects of prolonged emergency orders, including economic harm to businesses, social isolation, and restrictions on personal freedoms. **Leslie Tatro** and others expressed concern about the mental health crisis exacerbated by lockdowns, particularly among children and individuals with depression or addiction.

5. **Constitutional Concerns**:
   - Speakers cited violations of the New Hampshire Constitution, including Article 1 (individual liberty), Article 2B (privacy rights), and Article 29 (separation of powers). They argued that the emergency orders infringed on fundamental rights and lacked a legal basis.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting reflected widespread frustration with the prolonged state of emergency and a call for the legislature to reassert its authority. Supporters of HCR2 and related bills emphasized the need to restore constitutional governance, protect individual freedoms, and prevent future executive overreach. Opponents, however, defended the state of emergency as a necessary measure to protect public health. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing executive authority with legislative oversight and addressing the societal and economic impacts of prolonged emergency measures. The committee planned to hold an **executive session** to discuss amendments and finalize the bills, with the next meeting scheduled for the following Tuesday at 9:00 AM.
