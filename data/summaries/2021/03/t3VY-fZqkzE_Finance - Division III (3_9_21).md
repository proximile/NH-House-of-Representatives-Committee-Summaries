### **Key Areas of Discussion**

#### **1. Division of Long-Term Supports and Services (DLTSS)**
The DLTSS oversees programs for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and those in need of long-term care. Key programs include:
- **Choices for Independence Waiver**: Provides home and community-based services to prevent nursing facility care.
- **Adult Protective Services (APS)**: Focuses on preventing abuse, neglect, and exploitation of vulnerable adults, with a 100% response rate target for high-risk cases.
- **Title III and Title XX Programs**: Offer services like home-delivered meals, adult day services, and caregiver support, though workforce shortages have hindered delivery.

The aging population in New Hampshire, with over one-third expected to be over 65 by 2030, necessitates strategic planning for nursing facilities and community-based services. Challenges include reduced nursing facility occupancy due to COVID-19, workforce shortages, and outdated IT systems. Plans include repurposing 27 nursing facility beds in Hampton for a geriatric psychiatric unit and leveraging kitchen facilities for meal delivery programs.

#### **2. Bureau of Developmental Services (BDS)**
The BDS manages waivers for developmental disabilities, acquired brain disorders, and in-home supports. Key points include:
- **Service Provision and Waitlist Management**: The BDS successfully served 1,000 individuals during the biennium, with no current waitlist for services. Transition planning for students exiting the school system is a priority.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Workforce shortages and family health concerns have slowed service starts. The closure of Cratchit Mountain required new programs for 26 individuals.
- **Waiver Compliance**: The BDS is working towards full compliance with federal home settings requirements by July 2023.
- **Budget and Financials**: A $38 million carry forward from fiscal year 2021 will be available for use in 2022.

#### **3. Bureau of Family Centered Services (BFCS)**
The BFCS supports families of children with special health care needs through programs like respite care, parent-to-parent advocacy, and health care coordination. Challenges include a 41% staff vacancy rate, though hiring efforts are underway. Special medical services for children with complex needs remain a critical focus.

---

#### **4. Budget and Funding**
Significant budget increases were discussed, including:
- **5% Increase for CFR Waiver Rates**: Aimed at improving workforce capacity and consumer satisfaction for adult day services and home health.
- **Nursing Facility Funding**: A 5.5% tax on nursing facility revenues supports Medicaid payments, with federal matching funds.
- **Capital Requests**: Funding for IT modernization, including the Bureau of Elderly and Adult Services (BEAS) modernization, Developmental Services IT remediation, and the Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) system.

---

#### **5. Workforce and IT Challenges**
Workforce shortages across nursing facilities, home and community-based services, and administrative roles were a recurring theme. Outdated IT systems, some dating back to 1998, hinder operational efficiency and compliance. The forthcoming Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) report is expected to provide recommendations for system redesign and IT infrastructure improvements.

#### **6. COVID-19 Response**
The pandemic has significantly impacted service delivery, with enhanced federal funding supporting programs like meals on wheels and the Long-Term Care Stabilization Program. However, workforce shortages and health concerns have slowed service starts and increased operational challenges.

---

### **Future Plans and Strategic Initiatives**
- **State Plan on Aging**: Development of a plan to address the needs of the growing senior population.
- **System Redesign**: Stakeholder engagement to gather input on service delivery improvements, particularly from the disability community and area agencies.
- **IT Modernization**: Prioritizing IT projects to improve compliance, operational efficiency, and service delivery.
- **Transition to Community-Based Models**: Phasing out state-run facilities like the Laconia State School and transitioning to community-based services.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the critical need for strategic planning, workforce development, and IT modernization to address the growing demand for long-term care and developmental services in New Hampshire. The impact of COVID-19, demographic shifts, and compliance requirements were central themes, with a focus on leveraging resources and funding to ensure timely and effective service delivery. The forthcoming A&M report and continued stakeholder engagement are expected to guide future efforts in system redesign and service improvements.
