The **NH House of Representatives Finance - Division III meeting on March 5, 2021**, focused on critical issues within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), particularly the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), juvenile justice reforms, and the future of the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC). Conducted remotely due to COVID-19, the meeting emphasized systemic challenges, budget considerations, and the need for transformative approaches to better serve vulnerable youth and families. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Juvenile Justice System and Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)**
The **SYSC**, New Hampshire’s only secured facility for detained and committed youth, was a central topic. Key issues included:
- **High Costs and Declining Population**: SYSC’s population has significantly decreased, but fixed operational costs remain high, resulting in a high cost per youth. The facility’s structure, designed for a larger population, is now inefficient.
- **Behavioral Health Needs**: Youth at SYSC often have complex behavioral health and trauma-related needs, requiring specialized staffing and separate units, which further drives costs.
- **Future of SYSC**: There was a call for decisive action, including the possibility of closing SYSC and building a smaller, more efficient facility or transitioning to alternative, clinically appropriate settings. Comparisons were made to Vermont, which closed its juvenile corrections facility and partnered with private providers.
- **Recidivism and Programming**: The high recidivism rate (approximately 60%) highlighted the need for evidence-based treatment programs. Legislative changes, such as House Bill 517, have disrupted treatment continuity and parole decisions, underscoring the need for reform.

### **2. Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF)**
The **DCYF** presented updates on child protection services, juvenile justice, and systemic reforms:
- **Child Protection Improvements**: DCYF has implemented a 24/7 hotline and refined intake practices to reduce unnecessary investigations and better support families. Efforts are focused on reducing caseloads to national standards (12 cases per worker) to improve service quality.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic led to increased referrals for educational neglect and truancy due to remote learning challenges. DCYF is working with schools to address these issues without unnecessary child protection referrals.
- **Family Services**: DCYF aims to reduce out-of-home placements by strengthening in-home support services and using evidence-based models like Multisystemic Therapy (MST). Family Resource Centers play a key role in preventing recurring crises.
- **Staffing Challenges**: DCYF has made progress in hiring but continues to face high turnover rates. Efforts to improve retention include reducing caseloads, addressing secondary trauma, and ensuring psychological safety for staff.

### **3. Budget and Funding Considerations**
Budget discussions highlighted the need for strategic investments and reforms:
- **SYSC Budget**: Despite declining youth populations, SYSC’s costs remain high due to fixed expenses like staffing, utilities, and repairs. The committee debated the feasibility of reducing costs without compromising essential services.
- **Medicaid Reimbursement**: There was discussion about leveraging Medicaid reimbursement for therapeutic community-based programs, which is currently unavailable for correctional facilities like SYSC.
- **Federal Funding**: Many programs, such as child abuse prevention (CAPTA) and teen independent living, rely on federal grants with specific usage restrictions. The committee reviewed these accounting units to ensure compliance and efficiency.
- **Additional Funding Requests**: DCYF requested funding for family resource centers, juvenile justice diversion programs, and staffing to meet caseload standards.

### **4. Systemic Reforms and Future Directions**
The meeting emphasized the need for transformative approaches to improve outcomes for youth and families:
- **Juvenile Justice Transformation**: Efforts are underway to divert youth from the court system through early assessments and community-based services. The goal is to serve youth in their homes rather than in residential placements.
- **Behavioral Health and System of Care**: The state is redesigning residential care and introducing trauma-informed, evidence-based practices to better meet the needs of youth and reduce reliance on detention facilities.
- **Legislative Action**: The committee recognized the need for legislative mandates to drive significant change, particularly in reforming SYSC and addressing systemic inefficiencies.

### **5. Challenges and Opportunities**
Several challenges were identified, alongside opportunities for improvement:
- **Housing Instability**: A recurring issue affecting families involved with child protection, with efforts to secure housing vouchers to prevent foster care placements.
- **Community Program Capacity**: Family resource centers and other community services are struggling to handle increased referrals, highlighting the need for expanded capacity.
- **Internal Controls**: Concerns about fraud, waste, and abuse in programs, particularly with housing vouchers, were addressed, with assurances that internal controls and federal requirements are in place.
- **Data and Metrics**: Development of metrics to track repeat families in the system and improve service delivery was emphasized.

### **6. Public Advocacy and Next Steps**
A representative from **Waypoint**, an advocacy organization, called for systemic change, advocating for the closure of SYSC and the development of more appropriate treatment settings for youth with complex needs. The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issue and the need for a comprehensive plan before making decisions. Future discussions will focus on exploring alternative models and ensuring that the state continues to meet the needs of its most vulnerable youth.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of reforming New Hampshire’s juvenile justice and child welfare systems. Key themes included the need for data-driven decisions, strategic budget allocations, and transformative approaches to better serve youth and families. The future of SYSC remains a critical issue, with calls for decisive action to align resources with the clinical and behavioral health needs of youth. The committee emphasized the importance of legislative support and collaboration to drive meaningful change.
