**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commerce and Consumer Affairs (3/24/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 24, 2021, focused on several key bills addressing healthcare, mental health, and cannabis regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Senate Bill 59 (SB 59): Collaborative Care Model for Mental Health**

SB 59 aims to improve mental health care delivery in New Hampshire through a **collaborative care model**, integrating mental health services into primary care. Key points include:

1. **Model Overview**:  
   - The model involves a team of primary care providers, care managers, and psychiatric consultants, allowing psychiatrists to consult on patient care without requiring in-person visits unless necessary.  
   - It is designed to improve access, reduce costs, and enhance health outcomes, and is already supported by Medicare and federally qualified health centers.

2. **Mental Health Crisis in NH**:  
   - New Hampshire faces a severe shortage of psychiatrists and mental health practitioners, with nearly a quarter of the population experiencing unmet mental health needs.  
   - The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues, increasing demand for services and straining resources like emergency departments.

3. **Support for SB 59**:  
   - Testimonies from the New Hampshire Psychiatric Society, NAMI New Hampshire, and other stakeholders highlighted the bill’s potential to bridge care gaps, reduce provider burnout, and improve patient outcomes.  
   - Insurers like Anthem and Harvard Pilgrim already cover the model but report low utilization. The bill aims to encourage broader adoption by ensuring reimbursement across all carriers.

4. **Concerns and Clarifications**:  
   - Questions were raised about patient consent, the role of primary care physicians, and the potential for the model to reduce overall healthcare costs.  
   - The bill was praised for its focus on care coordination, which could reduce reliance on emergency services and inpatient care.

5. **Vote Recommendation**:  
   - Stakeholders urged the committee to vote in favor of SB 59, emphasizing its importance in addressing the mental health crisis and improving access to care.

### **Senate Bill 38 (SB 38): For-Profit Conversion of Medical Cannabis ATCs**

SB 38 proposes allowing Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) for medical cannabis to convert from nonprofit to for-profit entities. Key discussions included:

1. **Purpose of SB 38**:  
   - The bill aims to help ATCs operate more efficiently and lower prices for patients by removing the nonprofit requirement, which limits their ability to access capital and reduce costs.

2. **Support and Opposition**:  
   - **Supporters**: Argued that the bill would help ATCs compete with neighboring states where recreational cannabis is legal and prices are lower. They emphasized that strict regulatory oversight and patient safety standards would remain intact.  
   - **Opponents**: Expressed concerns that for-profit ATCs could lead to out-of-state corporate dominance, potentially compromising quality and affordability. They suggested reducing regulatory burdens on ATCs instead.

3. **Financial Challenges**:  
   - ATCs face significant hurdles, including high taxes, inability to access traditional bank loans, and costly operational requirements, which drive up prices for patients.

4. **Historical Context**:  
   - SB 38 is similar to **House Bill 1345** from 2020, which passed the House but died in the Senate. Supporters argue it is a necessary evolution of the program to ensure sustainability.

5. **Future of Cannabis in NH**:  
   - The discussion acknowledged the likelihood of recreational cannabis legalization in New Hampshire. Supporters of SB 38 see it as a proactive step to prepare ATCs for future competition.

### **Senate Bill 35 (SB 35): NEA Participation in Health Insurance Risk Pool**

SB 35 allows the New Hampshire chapter of the National Education Association (NEA) to participate in the state's health insurance risk pool program. Key points include:

1. **Purpose**:  
   - The bill addresses a statutory oversight that excludes NEA New Hampshire from the program, despite its integral role in founding the SchoolCare coalition.

2. **Support and Clarifications**:  
   - Testimonies emphasized that the bill is narrowly tailored and would only allow NEA New Hampshire as an employer to participate, not individual teachers or union members.  
   - Concerns about taxpayer costs were addressed, with assurances that there would be no financial impact on the state or localities.

3. **Outcome**:  
   - The public hearing concluded with nine supporters, no opposition, and no neutral positions.

### **Senate Bill 97 (SB 97): Direct Primary Care and PBM Regulations**

SB 97 addresses **direct primary care (DPC)** and **pharmacy benefit manager (PBM)** regulations. Key discussions included:

1. **Part 1: Direct Primary Care Referrals**:  
   - **Opposition from Insurers**: Anthem and America’s Health Insurance Plans argued that the bill undermines in-network providers, increases costs, and disrupts care coordination.  
   - **Support from DPC Providers**: Dr. Samuel McCready and Dr. Eric Crop highlighted the bureaucratic challenges of traditional insurance models and the affordability and transparency of DPC.  
   - **Insurance Department Concerns**: Tyler Brennan noted potential operational challenges and premium increases but acknowledged DPC’s benefits for burned-out physicians.

2. **Part 2: PBM Regulations**:  
   - **Support from Pharmacies**: Rick Newman argued that the bill ensures PBMs cannot prevent retail pharmacies from mailing prescriptions to patients, a simple and non-controversial change.  
   - **Insurance Department Clarification**: Brennan suggested aligning the language with existing PBM regulations to avoid creating different standards.

3. **Committee Action**:  
   - The public hearing on SB 97 concluded with **20 in support, 2 opposed, and 2 neutral**. The bill will likely undergo further discussion and potential amendments before a final vote.
