### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting – Division II, Department of Education (March 3, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, held a meeting on March 3, 2021, to discuss the Department of Education (DOE) budget, focusing on **special education funding**, **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**, and the **Building Aid Program**. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, addressed key funding mechanisms, challenges, and future directions for education-related programs. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Special Education Funding**
Special education aid, formerly known as Catastrophic Aid, was a central topic. Key points included:  
- **Reimbursement Structure**: The state reimburses school districts for special education costs exceeding 3.5 times the average per-pupil expenditure, covering 80% of additional costs up to 10 times the average. If funds are insufficient, reimbursements are prorated.  
- **Full Funding in 2021**: For the first time since 2008, the state fully funded special education aid without proration in 2021.  
- **Invoicing and Compliance**: Districts submit invoices for allowable costs, which the DOE reviews to ensure alignment with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Discrepancies are addressed through clarification requests.  
- **Court-Ordered Placements**: The state covers costs for court-ordered special education placements with no reimbursement cap.  
- **Budgeting Challenges**: Districts face difficulties due to delayed reimbursements, as special education aid is paid in December of the following year. Some districts maintain reserve funds to manage these costs.  
- **Cost Trends**: While the number of students receiving special education aid has remained stable, costs have risen, potentially due to increased expenses for services like out-of-district placements.

### **2. Career and Technical Education (CTE) Funding**
The committee discussed CTE funding, transportation, and efforts to expand access. Highlights included:  
- **Reimbursement Mechanisms**: The state reimburses up to 75% of CTE tuition costs, with sending districts covering the remaining 25%. Transportation costs for out-of-district CTE centers are reimbursed to sending schools.  
- **Funding Shortfalls**: Significant shortfalls exist, with $3 million for tuition and $2 million for transportation in the current year. Legislative efforts are underway to address these issues, though changes would not take effect until the following year.  
- **Enrollment Trends**: CTE enrollment is increasing, with nearly 10,000 students participating annually despite declining high school populations. The state is working to expand access, particularly for underrepresented students from sending schools.  
- **Federal Perkins Funding**: New Hampshire receives $6.1 million in federal Perkins funding for equipment and program enhancements, with an expected increase to $6.5 million next year.  
- **Expansion Efforts**: The state is exploring regional CTE programs at comprehensive high schools and partnerships with community colleges to reduce travel time and increase access.  
- **Consultant Report**: A study identified travel time and scheduling conflicts as barriers to CTE participation. The state is working with regional centers and districts to address these issues.

### **3. Building Aid Program**
The Building Aid Program, which supports school infrastructure, was discussed in detail. Key points included:  
- **Purpose and Structure**: The program provides grants covering 30% to 60% of construction or reconstruction costs, with higher percentages for less affluent communities. The average state share is 38%.  
- **Funding Source**: The program is funded through the Education Trust Fund, with an annual cap of $50 million.  
- **Payment Structure**: Since 2013, the state pays 80% upfront and 20% upon project completion, eliminating long-term payment obligations.  
- **Historical Context**: The program, established in the 1940s, faced a moratorium from 2010 to 2019 due to financial constraints. During this period, only obligated payments for past projects were made.  
- **Current Status**: The moratorium ended in 2020, and the state appropriated $50 million for the first time. In 2021, $39 million was allocated, funding three out of five eligible projects.  
- **Funding Gap**: Schools are seeking $104 million in state aid for $270 million worth of projects, but the program can only allocate $32 million over the biennium if fully funded.  
- **Retroactive Projects**: Schools that constructed projects during the moratorium without state aid are not eligible for retroactive funding unless authorized by law.  
- **Future Challenges**: The state continues to pay off bonds for pre-2013 projects, with payments expected until 2030. Balancing old obligations with new project demands remains a challenge.

### **4. Maintenance of Effort (MOE) Requirements**
The state uses special education aid and CTE funding to meet federal MOE requirements, ensuring continued federal funding for programs like IDEA and Perkins grants.  

---

### **5. Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with representatives seeking further clarification on funding formulas, reimbursement processes, and the impact of rising costs on school budgets. The committee acknowledged the importance of addressing funding shortfalls, expanding CTE access, and supporting school infrastructure while balancing old obligations and new project demands. The meeting was adjourned to reconvene later in the day for further discussion.
