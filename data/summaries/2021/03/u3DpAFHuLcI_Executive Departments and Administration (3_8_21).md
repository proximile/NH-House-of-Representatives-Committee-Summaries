**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on March 8, 2021**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on March 8, 2021, to discuss several bills addressing public health, environmental safety, occupational licensure, and youth engagement. The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing regulatory oversight, public safety, and practical implementation challenges. Below is a consolidated summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **House Bill 141: Public Registry for AFFF (PFAS-Containing Firefighting Foam)**  
**Focus:** Addressing PFAS contamination in groundwater through a public registry for Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF).  

**Key Points:**  
1. **Health Risks of PFAS**:  
   - PFAS, found in firefighting foams, are linked to severe health issues, including cancer, thyroid disease, and developmental problems. These chemicals persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in the human body.  

2. **Purpose of the Bill**:  
   - The bill would require the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to create a public registry tracking the storage, use, and discharge of AFFF to identify contamination sources and prioritize cleanup efforts.  

3. **Historical Use and Challenges**:  
   - AFFF has been widely used at military bases, airports, and firefighting facilities. While its use has declined, legacy contamination remains a concern.  
   - Challenges include the lack of historical records, the 120-day reporting deadline (criticized as too short), and the absence of funding for DES to administer the registry.  

4. **Support and Opposition**:  
   - **Support**: DES and advocates emphasized the registry’s potential to protect drinking water and support firefighters, who face occupational exposure to PFAS.  
   - **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about the burden on municipalities, especially smaller fire departments, and the feasibility of retroactively reporting historical data.  

5. **Outcome**:  
   - The committee leaned toward recommending the bill as **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)** due to its unworkable retroactive requirements and the existence of current laws addressing PFAS reporting and disposal.

### **Other Bills Discussed**  

1. **House Bill 405: Out-of-State Occupational Licensure**  
   - The bill aimed to address out-of-state applicants for occupational licensure but was criticized for lacking clarity and failing to incorporate previous committee recommendations. The committee recommended it was **not ready for further consideration**.  

2. **House Bill 84: Naming State Property**  
   - The bill proposed naming a terminal at Pease Tradeport. The committee voted to **retain the bill for further study**, emphasizing the importance of honoring historical figures.  

3. **House Bill 218: Licensing for Itinerant Vendors and Peddlers**  
   - The committee debated repealing licensing requirements for itinerant vendors. The motion to **pass the bill with amendments** narrowly passed, reflecting differing views on regulatory oversight.  

4. **House Bill 209: Licensing for Music Therapists**  
   - The bill sought to establish licensing for music therapists. Concerns about its drafting and lack of alignment with previous committee work led to a narrow vote to **indefinitely postpone the bill**.

### **House Bill 457: Legislative Youth Advisory Council (LYAC)**  
**Focus:** Reforming the LYAC to improve diversity and functionality.  

**Key Points:**  
1. **Sponsor’s Testimony (Representative Greg Hill)**:  
   - The bill proposed reducing the number of appointing authorities for LYAC members from four to two (Senate President and Speaker) to enhance coordination and diversity of thought.  

2. **Youth Advisory Council’s Perspective (Alinka Drondo)**:  
   - The LYAC supported the bill with **Amendment 2021-0672H**, which expanded its functions to address a wider range of youth issues, hold public forums, and continue virtual meetings post-pandemic.  

3. **Committee Discussion**:  
   - Members raised questions about outreach, diversity, and the inclusion of post-secondary youth (up to age 22).  
   - The committee unanimously voted to **retain the bill for further study**, emphasizing the value of the LYAC and the need to refine the bill.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the challenges of addressing complex public health and environmental issues, such as PFAS contamination, while balancing regulatory burdens and resource constraints. The committee also highlighted the importance of fostering youth engagement and refining occupational licensure frameworks. Key outcomes included:  
- **House Bill 141**: Likely to be recommended as ITL due to implementation challenges.  
- **House Bill 457**: Retained for further study to enhance the LYAC’s diversity and functionality.  
- **Other Bills**: Varied outcomes, reflecting ongoing debates over regulatory oversight and public safety.  

The discussions emphasized the need for thoughtful, evidence-based legislation that addresses critical issues while minimizing unintended burdens on municipalities and stakeholders.
