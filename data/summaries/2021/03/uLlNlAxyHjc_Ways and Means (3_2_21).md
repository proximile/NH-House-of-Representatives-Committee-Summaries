**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on March 2, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on March 2, 2021, in an electronic format via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting was accessible to the public through Zoom or telephone, and members began with a roll call to confirm attendance and compliance with the Right-to-Know law. The committee discussed and voted on several bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 626** (historic horse racing and charitable gaming) and **House Bill 15** (taxation of online rental facilitators), as well as other tax-related and procedural matters. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **House Bill 626: Charitable Gaming and Historic Horse Racing**
1. **Introduction of Historic Horse Racing**: The bill proposes to introduce historic horse racing as a form of charitable gaming, with a 25% tax rate on revenue generated by the machines. This rate aligns with those in states like Kentucky, Wyoming, and Virginia.
2. **Revenue Distribution**: Revenue from the machines would be shared, with a minimum of 88% returned to players as prizes. The remainder would support charities and education, consistent with New Hampshire’s charitable gaming framework.
3. **Local Option Debate**: A significant point of contention was whether to include a local option, allowing communities to vote on whether to permit these machines. Proponents of the local option argued it would protect vulnerable populations and allow communities to decide based on their unique needs. Opponents noted that charitable gaming has never required a local option and that the machines are simply another game in the existing portfolio. An amendment to include a local option failed by a vote of 14-8.
4. **Responsible Gaming**: Amendments to create a registry of banned individuals and require reports on problem gamblers were proposed but also failed. Discussions emphasized the need for robust oversight, staff training, and responsible gaming displays to address potential gambling addiction concerns.
5. **Bet Limits and Age Restrictions**: The bill sets a $25 bet limit, though most bets are expected to be smaller. It allows 18-year-olds to gamble on these machines, consistent with existing charitable gaming laws. Concerns about age restrictions were raised but not addressed in the bill.
6. **Final Vote**: The bill passed with a vote of 16-5 and will move forward to the Senate.

### **House Bill 15: Taxation of Online Rental Facilitators**
1. **Meals and Rooms Tax Clarification**: The bill addresses the taxation of online platforms facilitating room and vehicle rentals, ensuring they collect and remit the Meals and Rooms (M&R) tax. This follows a New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling that determined online platforms are not operators under the existing M&R tax statute.
2. **Travel Agent Exemption**: Concerns were raised about whether the bill would unintentionally tax travel agent services. The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) clarified that travel agents are typically paid commissions by hotels, not directly by consumers, and thus would not be subject to the tax.
3. **Amendment Debate**: Representative Baxter proposed an amendment to explicitly exempt travel agent services from the tax. However, concerns about the amendment’s language and potential loopholes led to further discussion. The DRA expressed confidence that the issue could be addressed through rule-making rather than an amendment.
4. **Next Steps**: The committee considered whether to proceed with an amendment or rely on the DRA’s rule-making process. No final decision was made, but the bill’s proponents argued it was fair and addressed the court’s concerns.

### **Other Key Discussions and Votes**
1. **Lodging and Travel Agent Commissions**: The committee debated the taxation of travel agent commissions, concluding that consumers ultimately pay the same amount regardless of the commission structure. No further action was deemed necessary.
2. **Retention of Bills**: Several bills were retained for further study, including:
   - **HB 210**: Increasing exemptions under the interest and dividend tax and decreasing research development credits.
   - **HB 252**: Creating a committee to study employee tax credits for childcare stipends.
   - **HB 504**: Addressing state education property tax and low-income homeowner relief.
   - **HB 568**: Increasing exemptions under the interest and dividend tax and repealing the tax by 2025.
   - **HB 346**: Funding sources for the domestic violence program fund.
   - **HB 400**: Collection of sales taxes from foreign jurisdictions by NH businesses.
   - **HB 621**: Allowing registered deeds to retain a portion of the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program surcharge.
3. **Constitutional Amendments**: The committee voted on two constitutional amendments:
   - **CACR 1**: Prohibiting an income tax on earned personal income (passed 13-10).
   - **CACR 2**: Prohibiting a broad-based sales tax (passed 13-10).
4. **Technical and Procedural Matters**: The meeting was marked by technical difficulties, with some representatives experiencing connectivity issues. The committee emphasized the need for clarity on certain bills and amendments, particularly those involving the DRA.

### **Key Themes**
- **Balancing Revenue and Responsibility**: Discussions emphasized the need to balance revenue generation with responsible gaming practices and fair tax collection.
- **Local Control vs. State Authority**: The failure of the local option amendment for HB 626 highlighted tensions between state and local control over gaming.
- **Clarity and Fairness**: Both HB 626 and HB 15 aimed to clarify existing laws and ensure fairness in tax collection and gaming operations.
- **Rule-Making vs. Amendments**: The committee debated whether to address concerns through amendments or rely on administrative rule-making.

The meeting ended without a final vote on HB 15, as the committee sought further clarity on the travel agent exemption issue. The committee planned to address **HB 10** and **HB 15** the following day, with Representative Baxter tasked with clarifying an amendment for HB 15.
