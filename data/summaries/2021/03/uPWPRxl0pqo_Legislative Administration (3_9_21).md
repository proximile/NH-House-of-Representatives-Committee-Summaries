The New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Committee meeting on March 9, 2021, focused on **House Bill 186 (HB 186)**, which proposes the repeal of inactive committees and revisions to the membership or duties of certain committees, councils, and boards. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency.

**Key Points Discussed:**

1. **Introduction of HB 186**:
   - The bill is the result of over two years of work by the Committee on Committees, led by Representative Karen Ebel.
   - It aims to streamline the state's statutory committees by repealing inactive ones and adjusting the membership size of others to reduce legislative burden.
   - The bill is part of a broader effort to review and update the state's committee structure, which had not been comprehensively reviewed in over a decade.

2. **Testimony from Representative Ebel**:
   - Representative Ebel explained the extensive process of compiling data on over 200 statutory committees, including their meeting frequency and relevance.
   - The bill reflects bipartisan recommendations from the Committee on Committees and focuses on administrative, rather than substantive, changes.
   - She emphasized the need for periodic reviews of committees to avoid the accumulation of inactive or obsolete bodies.

3. **Public Testimony**:
   - **Insurance Department**: Supported the repeal of the Joint Healthcare Committee, which they deemed obsolete, and suggested technical amendments to remove references to the committee in the statute.
   - **Fish and Game Department**: Opposed the removal of the requirement that members of the Public Water Access Advisory Board be residents of the seacoast region, arguing that the boardâ€™s work is closely tied to the commercial fishing industry centered in that area. They suggested alternative language focusing on engagement with the industry rather than residency.

4. **Committee Discussion**:
   - Committee members questioned the definitions and implications of residency requirements for certain boards, particularly the Public Water Access Advisory Board.
   - There was consensus on the need to ensure that committee members have relevant expertise, regardless of their place of residence.

5. **Executive Session**:
   - The committee decided to recess the executive session to March 29, 2021, to further discuss the remaining bills, including HB 186.

**Conclusion**:
The meeting highlighted the complexities of updating and streamlining the state's committee structure. The committee acknowledged the importance of ensuring that statutory committees remain relevant and functional, while also addressing concerns about residency and expertise requirements for specific boards. The executive session was postponed to allow for further deliberation.
