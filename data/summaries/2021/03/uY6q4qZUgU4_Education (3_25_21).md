### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Senate Bill 19 (SB 19): Authorizing Signum University to Grant Degrees**
   - **Overview**: SB 19 would allow Signum University, an online institution specializing in language, arts, literature, and Tolkien studies, to grant degrees.
   - **Testimony**: Senator Ruth Ward introduced the bill, emphasizing its academic focus. Representative Timothy Horrigan raised concerns about the university’s accreditation, legitimacy, and lack of physical presence. Corey Olson, representing Signum University, was present but did not provide additional testimony.
   - **Status**: The bill had previously passed the Senate and was under committee review.

2. **Senate Bill 20 (SB 20): One-Year Certificates of Eligibility for CTE Instructors**
   - **Overview**: SB 20 aims to address teacher shortages in career and technical education (CTE) by allowing individuals with industry experience but lacking formal degrees to teach in CTE programs.
   - **Testimony**: Steve Appleby from the NH Department of Education explained the bill’s purpose, focusing on the certification process and code of conduct for these teachers.
   - **Discussion**: The committee explored the implications of the bill for addressing CTE teacher shortages.

3. **Senate Bill 24 (SB 24): Brewster Academy Charter Amendment**
   - **Overview**: SB 24 would allow Brewster Academy, a private school, to amend its charter and increase its board of trustees from 25 to 30 members.
   - **Testimony**: Representative John K. McDonald introduced the bill, and Christie Karen, the associate head of Brewster Academy, provided testimony. The bill seeks to streamline charter amendments, reducing the need for legislative approval.
   - **Discussion**: The committee examined the school’s funding sources and its role in the community.

4. **Senate Bill 135 (SB 135): Addressing Pandemic-Related School Funding Challenges**
   - **Overview**: SB 135 proposes to ensure schools receive funding based on the higher of two calculations: the current funding formula or the previous year’s funding. This aims to mitigate the impact of drops in average daily membership and difficulties in collecting free and reduced lunch forms due to the pandemic. The bill has a fiscal impact of approximately $45 million.
   - **Amendments**:
     - **Amendment 1012H**: Extends the fiscal capacity disparity equitable grant through June 30, 2023, and updates parameters for calculating the grant based on updated property valuations.
     - **Amendment 1020H**: Extends the free and reduced-price lunch equitable grant through June 30, 2023, targeting districts with higher concentrations of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.
   - **Purpose of Grants**:
     - The fiscal capacity disparity grant provides approximately $50 million to districts with lower-than-average property valuations.
     - The free and reduced-price lunch grant directs $11-12 million to districts with higher percentages of low-income students.
   - **Impact of Amendments**: Without these amendments, $60 million in equitable grants would expire on June 30, 2021, significantly impacting school districts. The amendments aim to address a $90 million gap in state funding for public schools.
   - **Testimonies**:
     - **Jeff McLynch** (After School Funding Fairness Project) highlighted the urgency of SB 135, noting a 4% enrollment decline and a 24% drop in free/reduced lunch counts due to federal waivers.
     - **Leslie Want** (Manchester School District) and **Dr. John Goldhardt** (Manchester Superintendent) emphasized the bill’s importance for Manchester, which faces significant funding losses.
     - **Dr. Corinne Cascadden** (former Superintendent) shared the challenges of districts like Berlin, where 65% of property is tax-exempt.
     - **Jerry Frew** (NH School Administrators Association) supported SB 135 and the amendments, emphasizing their importance for struggling communities and students.
   - **Federal Funding**: Representatives discussed whether $350 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds for schools could supplement state funding. It was clarified that this money is allocated directly to schools under a federal formula and is not intended for state-level funding formulas.
   - **Next Steps**: The committee planned to merge the amendments and finalize them before sending them to the Finance Committee. The deadline for reporting Senate bills is May 6, 2021.

### **Key Concerns and Themes**
- **Equity in Funding**: The discussions underscored the importance of addressing disparities in property wealth and student needs, particularly in high-poverty districts.
- **Pandemic Impact**: The pandemic has exacerbated funding challenges, with artificially suppressed enrollment numbers and difficulties in collecting free and reduced lunch data.
- **Urgency**: The committee emphasized the urgency of finalizing amendments to SB 135 to prevent significant funding shortfalls for schools.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the critical need for legislative action to address pandemic-related funding challenges and promote equity in New Hampshire’s education system. The committee’s focus on SB 135 and its amendments reflects a commitment to ensuring that state dollars are directed to districts with the greatest need. The discussions also touched on broader issues such as teacher shortages, private school governance, and online university accreditation, illustrating the multifaceted nature of the state’s educational challenges.
