**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Finance - Division II, USNH, CCSNH, Governor, Part II (2/26/21)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on February 26, 2021, centered on discussions about the proposed merger of the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH), as well as related budget and workforce considerations. The conversation highlighted both the potential benefits and significant challenges of the merger, emphasizing the need for careful planning, adequate funding, and stakeholder involvement to ensure a successful transition.

### Key Points:

1. **Merger Discussions and Governance**:
   - The merger has been under discussion since June 2020, with cautious engagement from both the USNH and CCSNH boards of trustees. While the USNH board supports consolidation, the CCSNH board has been more reserved, stressing the need for detailed information and careful consideration.
   - A proposed 15-member board would oversee the merged system, with five members appointed by each of the existing boards and five by the governor. However, full integration would take time, and representatives emphasized the importance of preserving the identity and voice of community colleges, which often risk being overshadowed in such mergers.

2. **Concerns and Challenges**:
   - Representatives expressed concerns about the lack of designated funding for the merger and the complexity of integrating two large systems. Key issues include accreditation, financial aid, unions, benefits, and the potential for logistical and financial challenges.
   - The timeline for the merger, tied to the state budget bill (HB2), was debated, with some arguing that it is too rushed and requires more time for thoughtful implementation.
   - Lessons from other states, such as Connecticut and New York, where similar mergers faced difficulties, were referenced to underscore the importance of learning from past mistakes.

3. **Budget and Funding**:
   - The governor’s budget proposal includes reductions in funding for both USNH and CCSNH, raising concerns about its adequacy to support the merger. Representatives discussed the potential need for additional funding sources, such as federal pandemic relief funds.
   - The capital budget for both systems was reviewed, with a focus on maintaining critical infrastructure and addressing maintenance needs. Diverting capital funds toward merger-related expenses was identified as a challenge.

4. **Technology and Synergies**:
   - The need for a unified technology platform across both systems was emphasized to streamline operations and improve the student experience. The Canvas learning management system was cited as a successful example of shared technology.
   - Ongoing efforts to identify synergies, such as shared contracts and transfer pathways, have already yielded cost savings. Representatives stressed the importance of leveraging these efficiencies in the merger process.

5. **Student and Workforce Impact**:
   - The human impact of the merger on students, faculty, and staff was a key concern. Representatives emphasized the importance of involving stakeholders in the planning process and ensuring that the merger benefits students by improving access to education and career pathways.
   - Workforce development was a recurring theme, with a focus on aligning educational programs with industry needs, particularly in healthcare and technical fields. Initiatives like "Women and Technology Days" were highlighted as efforts to encourage women to explore technical careers.

6. **Historical Context and Lessons**:
   - Past attempts at mergers, such as the failed effort between the Art Institute and UNH, were referenced to underscore the importance of clear communication and planning.
   - Representatives stressed the need to learn from other states that have successfully merged higher education systems, ensuring that New Hampshire avoids repeating mistakes.

7. **Future of Public Higher Education**:
   - The merger was framed as a critical step for the future of public higher education in New Hampshire, given the rapidly changing landscape of higher education. Representatives acknowledged the need to adapt to better serve students and the state.

### Overall Themes:
The meeting reflected a mix of support for the merger’s potential benefits—such as improved efficiencies, enhanced student pathways, and better alignment with workforce needs—and caution about its implementation. Representatives emphasized the importance of thoughtful planning, transparent decision-making, and preserving the strengths of both systems. Adequate funding, stakeholder involvement, and learning from past experiences were identified as essential components of a successful merger process.
