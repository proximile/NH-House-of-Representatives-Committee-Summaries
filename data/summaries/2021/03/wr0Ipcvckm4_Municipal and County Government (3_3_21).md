### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Municipal and County Government (March 3, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 3, 2021, to address a range of municipal and county government issues. The meeting, conducted electronically via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on topics such as budget transparency, property tax assessments, zoning ordinances, affordable housing, and emergency housing assistance. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Budget Transparency and Accessibility**
A significant portion of the meeting centered on improving budget transparency and accessibility for taxpayers and elected officials. Key points included:
- **Challenges in Budget Reporting**: Representatives highlighted difficulties in comparing annual reports and making informed budget decisions due to a lack of detailed information. A citizens' petition for full budget details in annual reports passed overwhelmingly but was not honored by some local boards, prompting calls for legislative action.
- **Electronic Spreadsheet Formats**: Testifiers, including Wayne Gortel and Donna Green, advocated for municipalities and school districts to provide budgets in electronic spreadsheet formats (e.g., Microsoft Excel or CSV) to enhance transparency and analysis. Concerns were raised about the potential for public manipulation of files, but proponents emphasized that official versions would remain accessible on municipal websites.
- **Legislative Proposals**: Three bills (HB 243, HB 415, and HB 454) were discussed, aiming to require municipalities to publish detailed budget information in standardized formats and timelines. Opponents, including the NH Municipal Association and the NH School Boards Association, argued that these bills would impose unfunded mandates and burdens on smaller towns and school districts.
- **Balancing Transparency and Practicality**: The committee debated the practicality of 30-day notice requirements for budget publication, particularly in light of unexpected expenses like those related to COVID-19. The discussion underscored the need to balance transparency with the resources and capabilities of local governing bodies.

### **2. Property Tax Assessments and Relief**
The committee addressed issues related to property tax assessments and relief, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic:
- **Suspension of Revaluations (HB 552)**: The bill proposed suspending mandatory property tax revaluations for one year to provide relief for struggling property owners. Opponents, including assessors from Hanover and Hudson, argued that suspending revaluations would create inequities and complicate tax assessments. Proponents emphasized the need to delay tax increases for property owners in areas with rapidly rising values.
- **Equity in Taxation**: Representatives emphasized the importance of maintaining equity in property tax assessments, as required by the state constitution.

### **3. Zoning and Small Business Support**
The meeting included discussions on zoning ordinances and their impact on small businesses:
- **Easing Restrictions on Retail Spaces (HB 573 and HB 574)**: These bills aimed to reduce barriers for small businesses by easing restrictions on changing the use of retail spaces. Supporters argued this would help landlords and small businesses adapt to retail evolution and competition from online retailers. Opponents, including the NH Municipal Association, contended that such decisions should remain at the local level.
- **Local vs. State Control**: The debate highlighted the tension between state-level legislation and local autonomy, with opponents arguing that zoning decisions should be made locally to avoid unintended consequences.

### **4. Affordable Housing and Tiny Homes**
The committee explored the role of tiny homes in addressing New Hampshire's affordable housing crisis:
- **Tiny House Legislation (HB 588)**: The bill aimed to allow tiny houses on permanent foundations, focusing on affordable workforce housing. Amendments removed provisions for tiny homes on wheels, addressing concerns raised during the study committee process. Testifiers emphasized the need for statewide recognition of tiny homes to ensure consistent access to affordable housing.
- **Wastewater and Zoning Issues**: Concerns were raised about self-contained wastewater systems and zoning requirements for tiny homes. The discussion highlighted the need for clear regulations to support tiny home development while addressing environmental and zoning challenges.

### **5. Emergency Housing Assistance**
The committee discussed the importance of emergency housing assistance, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic:
- **HB 512**: This bill aimed to prevent municipalities from denying emergency housing aid due to a landlordâ€™s refusal to allow property inspections. Representatives emphasized the need to keep vulnerable individuals housed, even in substandard conditions, rather than forcing them into homelessness.

---

### **6. Procedural and Legislative Process**
The meeting included detailed discussions on legislative processes and amendments:
- **Amendments and Voting**: The committee debated the fairness and clarity of amendments, particularly those that significantly alter the original intent of a bill. Members emphasized the importance of careful consideration and public input in legislative decisions.
- **SB2 Method and Warrant Articles**: The committee discussed whether original and amended versions of warrant articles should both appear on the ballot, with concerns raised about voter confusion and fairness.

---

### **7. Other Key Discussions**
- **Involuntary Lot Merging (HB 284)**: The committee passed an amendment to remove the sunset clause, allowing property owners to apply at any time to unmerge involuntarily merged lots.
- **Animal Control Officers**: The committee considered a bill addressing issues with elected animal control officers and their relationship with local boards, ultimately deciding to retain the bill for further consideration.

The meeting reflected a focus on balancing transparency, equity, and practicality in municipal and county governance. Discussions highlighted the complexities of addressing issues like budget transparency, property tax relief, zoning regulations, and affordable housing while considering the resources and autonomy of local governments.
