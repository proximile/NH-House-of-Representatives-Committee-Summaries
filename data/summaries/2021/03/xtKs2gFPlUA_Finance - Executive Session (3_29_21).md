- **Medicaid and Federal Funding**: Enhanced federal Medicaid matching funds (FMAP) were leveraged to reduce the state’s general fund obligations. This included extending FMAP assumptions and reallocating funds for Medicaid management information systems.
- **Family Planning Programs**: A $50,000 allocation was added to stimulate competition among family planning service providers.

### **4. Workforce and Health Care Challenges**
- **Workforce Shortages**: Discussions highlighted workforce shortages, particularly in health care, with competition for personnel among state agencies, counties, and civilian organizations.
- **Personnel and Budget Cuts**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) faced significant cuts, including a $50 million reduction in General Funds and a $22 million reduction in personnel costs. Critics argued these cuts would disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.
- **Family Planning and Reproductive Health**: A contentious amendment aimed to separate funding for family planning services from reproductive health facilities that provide abortions, sparking debate over access to essential health services.

- **Education Funding**: The committee discussed funding for dual and concurrent enrollment programs, state scholarship programs, and building aid for school districts.

---

### **6. Privacy and Legislative Oversight**
- **Closed-Loop Referral System**: A significant discussion centered on privacy concerns related to a closed-loop referral system in the DHHS department. An amendment requiring a privacy review before further expansion of the system resulted in a **10-10 tie**, causing the motion to fail.

- **Department of Energy**: Opposition was raised to the creation of the Department of Energy without a public hearing.
