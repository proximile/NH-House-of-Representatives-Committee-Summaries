**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance - Division II Meeting (March 25, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance - Division II meeting on March 25, 2021, centered on budget amendments and adjustments, particularly those related to education funding. The discussion highlighted efforts to address the financial challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, ensure fiscal responsibility, and provide stability for school districts. Key points from the meeting include:

### **Education Funding Amendments**
1. **Amendment 1027h**: This amendment simplified financial transfers between the Education Trust Fund and the General Fund by consolidating two previously approved transfers ($36.7 million and $100 million) into a single net transfer of $63.3 million. It also ensured that the Education Trust Fund remained protected, with Department of Transportation (DOT) appropriations coming from the General Fund rather than the Education Trust Fund.

2. **Third Grade Reading Assessment Amendment**: To address low participation in third-grade reading assessments due to the pandemic, this amendment proposed using 2019 assessment data if 2021 data was deemed unreliable. This ensured consistent funding calculations for education adequacy.

3. **Amendment 1028h**: Proposed by Representative Heath, this amendment appropriated $100 million to the Education Trust Fund for the 2022-2023 biennium. It aimed to stabilize education funding for municipalities, ensuring they received at least the same amount as in prior years despite pandemic-related enrollment drops. The amendment also included a provision to increase the $100 million cap if there was an unspent surplus in the Education Trust Fund.

4. **Failed Amendment**: Another proposal under Amendment 1028h sought to direct $100 million directly to school districts rather than reducing property taxes. However, this amendment failed with a 4-3 vote.

### **Debate and Concerns**
- Representatives engaged in extensive discussions about the implications of these amendments, particularly their impact on property taxes and school districts. Concerns were raised about funding schools for students who may no longer be enrolled due to pandemic-related disruptions. Proponents argued that the amendments provided necessary stability during an unprecedented time.
- There was also debate about ensuring education funding reflected actual student enrollments (ADM) and addressed discrepancies caused by the pandemic, such as free and reduced lunch data.

### **Federal Funding for Schools**
- Representatives discussed the distribution of federal COVID-19 relief funds ($350 billion) to schools, noting that these funds had minimal restrictions on how they could be spent. Some expressed concerns about creating unrealistic expectations for additional state funding.
- Challenges with federal funding reimbursement were also highlighted, as school districts were required to spend funds upfront before receiving reimbursement, creating cash flow issues.

### **Budget Adoption**
- The committee moved to accept the governor’s recommended budget for departments such as safety, transportation, and education, incorporating previously adopted changes. This motion passed with a 4-3 vote.

### **Voting Outcomes**
- **Amendment 1027h** was approved unanimously (7-0) by the committee.
- **Amendment 1030h**, related to third-grade reading assessments, was also approved unanimously, ensuring alignment with the budget.

### **Upcoming Meetings**
- The committee scheduled meetings for the following week to address retained bills and finalize HB1 and HB2. Members expressed appreciation for the collaborative process and leadership during the budget discussions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to balancing fiscal responsibility with the need to support education funding during the pandemic. By addressing issues such as enrollment data reliability, property tax impacts, and federal aid distribution, the committee worked to provide stability for school districts while advancing the state budget.
