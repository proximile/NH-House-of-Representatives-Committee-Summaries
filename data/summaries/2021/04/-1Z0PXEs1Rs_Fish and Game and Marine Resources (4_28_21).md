**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Fish and Game and Marine Resources (April 28, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee convened on April 28, 2021, to discuss several bills impacting environmental regulation, marine resources, and permitting processes. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on **Senate Bills 51, 129, and 146**, as well as the formation of subcommittees to review retained bills. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Senate Bill 51: Lobster Roll Bill**
- **Purpose**: The bill, introduced by Senator Denise Riccardi, seeks to eliminate the requirement for restaurants to obtain a Fish and Game license when purchasing processed and packaged lobster meat from licensed wholesalers or processors.
- **Background**: The New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association raised concerns after restaurants were unexpectedly required to obtain licenses for selling lobster meat. The bill aims to streamline regulations while maintaining oversight over the lobster fishery.
- **Support**: The Fish and Game Department supports the bill, noting that restaurants selling live lobsters would still need a license. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate.
- **Outcome**: The House committee voted 18-0 to recommend passage, placing it on the consent calendar.

### **Senate Bill 129: Environmental Permitting and Endangered Species**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses permitting backlogs related to alteration of terrain (AOT) permits and aims to balance environmental protection with economic development. It focuses on minimizing impacts on endangered species and their habitats.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Introduces the term **"appreciably"** to modify the phrase "jeopardize the continued existence of species," aligning with federal Endangered Species Act language.
  - Establishes a **mitigation fund** for unavoidable wildlife impacts, funded by voluntary payments from developers.
  - Requires the Fish and Game Department to adopt rules to implement new standards, with public input.
- **Support**: Senator Jeb Bradley (primary sponsor) and construction industry stakeholders argue the bill is necessary to protect jobs and expedite permit approvals. Conservation groups, including The Nature Conservancy, support the mitigation fund but oppose the inclusion of "appreciably."
- **Opposition**: Environmental advocates fear the bill could weaken protections for endangered species by allowing "minimized harm" rather than preventing harm altogether.
- **Concerns**: Committee members debated the ambiguity of "appreciably" and the potential for increased workload on the Fish and Game Department, which is already underfunded.
- **Outcome**: No final decision was reached. The discussion emphasized the need for clarity, funding, and effective rulemaking to balance environmental and economic interests.

### **Senate Bill 146: Omnibus Environmental and Marine Resources Bill**
- **Purpose**: The bill includes provisions related to derelict fishing gear cleanup and emergency executive orders for public health concerns.
- **Key Sections**:
  1. **Section 3 (Emergency Orders)**: The committee recommended changing "emergency order" to "executive order" to clarify the governor’s authority to act on public health issues, such as restricting the importation of certain animals during a pandemic.
  2. **Section 5 (Derelict Fishing Gear Cleanup Fund)**: The committee debated renaming the fund to remove "fishing for energy," which was seen as confusing. The fund supports cleanup efforts for derelict fishing gear and marine trash, with fees collected from commercial fishing licenses. Concerns were raised about the timing of fee discounts for fishermen participating in cleanup programs.
- **Outcome**: The committee recommended passage of SB 146 with the proposed amendments.

### **Subcommittee Formation and Retained Bills**
- The committee formed subcommittees to review three retained bills:
  1. **House Bill 118**: Related to the Fish and Game Commission.
  2. **House Bill 241**: Trout-related provisions.
  3. **House Bill 490**: Use of live-action game profits.
- Reports are due by September 1, 2021, with final recommendations to the House by November 1, 2021.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Regulatory Efficiency vs. Environmental Protection**: The committee sought to balance streamlining regulations (e.g., SB 51 and SB 129) with maintaining robust environmental protections, particularly for endangered species and marine resources.
2. **Funding and Resource Challenges**: The Fish and Game Department’s underfunding and increasing workload were recurring concerns, especially in the context of SB 129’s permitting backlog.
3. **Clarity in Language**: Ambiguous terms like "appreciably" sparked significant debate, highlighting the need for precise language in legislation and effective rulemaking.
4. **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The meeting underscored the importance of involving stakeholders, including developers, conservation groups, and the public, in shaping environmental policies.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected the committee’s efforts to address regulatory inefficiencies, protect endangered species, and support economic development. While SB 51 and SB 146 moved forward with amendments, SB 129 remained contentious, with ongoing discussions about its potential impact on wildlife protections. The formation of subcommittees and the emphasis on rulemaking and stakeholder collaboration signaled a commitment to balancing diverse interests in environmental and marine resource management.
