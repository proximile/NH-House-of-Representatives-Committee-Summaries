The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee meeting on **Executive Departments and Administration**, held on **April 22, 2021**, focused on refining legislation related to professional licensing, investigative authority, and interstate compacts. The discussion spanned four key segments, addressing **Senate Bill 133 (SB 133)**, confidentiality and due process in disciplinary proceedings, and the implementation of interstate compacts for speech-language pathology, audiology, and occupational therapy. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **1. Senate Bill 133 and the Role of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**
The subcommittee debated **Part 7 of SB 133**, which concerns the **OPLC's role in investigations** for professional boards. Key points included:
- **Investigative Authority**: Members expressed concerns that the bill's language might imply the OPLC would take over investigative responsibilities from professional boards, conflicting with existing statutes. They emphasized that boards should retain ultimate authority over investigations, with the OPLC providing support when requested.
- **Clarity in Language**: Representatives called for explicit language to ensure the OPLC assists boards without overriding their authority. Concerns were raised that the bill might be premature, as the OPLC's enforcement unit is still in development.
- **Collaboration**: There was consensus that the OPLC should work closely with boards, leveraging their expertise while providing investigative support. The OPLC affirmed its commitment to collaboration without usurping board authority.
- **Next Steps**: The subcommittee requested the OPLC revise the bill's language to clarify the division of responsibilities and address inconsistencies in investigative procedures across boards.

### **2. Confidentiality, Due Process, and Disciplinary Proceedings**
The subcommittee discussed refining the bill to address confidentiality, due process, and procedural clarity in disciplinary actions. Key points included:
- **Confidentiality and Disclosure**: Concerns were raised about the conditions under which investigative information can be disclosed to law enforcement or health licensing agencies. Members emphasized the need for clear language to maintain confidentiality unless specific circumstances (e.g., criminal activity) warrant disclosure.
- **Due Process**: The importance of due process for licensed professionals was highlighted, particularly when non-disciplinary remedial actions (e.g., addressing mental or physical health issues) are considered. Members suggested adding language to ensure individuals have the opportunity to respond before actions are taken.
- **Settlement Agreements vs. Consent Orders**: The distinction between settlement agreements (negotiated before a hearing notice) and consent orders (issued after a hearing notice) was clarified, with a focus on precise language to differentiate these processes.
- **Appeals Process**: The bill outlines an appeals process to the Supreme Court, with a rehearing required before an appeal. Members also discussed criteria for deeming complaints unfounded (e.g., lack of jurisdiction, frivolousness).
- **Technical Corrections**: The subcommittee identified and proposed fixes for typographical errors and unclear phrasing throughout the bill.

### **3. Interstate Compacts: Speech Language Pathology, Audiology, and Occupational Therapy**
The subcommittee reviewed the **Speech Language Pathology and Audiology Compact** and the **Occupational Therapy Compact**, which aim to facilitate professional mobility across state lines. Key points included:
- **Licensing Requirements**: Individuals moving to New Hampshire must obtain a state license if they establish residency, with exemptions for military families.
- **Compact Fees and Revenue Concerns**: Members expressed concerns about potential revenue loss from licensing fees if individuals "shop around" for cheaper licenses in other states. They agreed that the **OPLC**, which is self-funded, should cover any fees associated with the compacts.
- **Compact Structure and Oversight**: The compacts operate similarly to existing models (e.g., nursing and physical therapy), with mutual recognition of licenses across member states. The **Compact Commission** has authority to assess fees, but states can mitigate costs by charging fees to individuals practicing under the compact.
- **Financial Safeguards**: Amendments were proposed to ensure the OPLC covers fees and that compact representatives cannot unilaterally commit the state to financial obligations.
- **Public Oversight**: Compact meetings are public, with agendas published in advance, allowing states to instruct their representatives on voting. States can withdraw from compacts if obligations become too burdensome.

---

### **4. Practical Concerns and State Sovereignty**
The discussion also addressed practical concerns about the compacts, including:
- **Rule-Making and State Autonomy**: While the compact governs interstate practice, individual states retain control over their own licensing rules and scope of practice.
- **Enforcement and Due Process**: The home state handles disciplinary actions for a professionalâ€™s license, but the compact allows for coordinated enforcement and communication between states.
- **Fiscal Impact**: States can assess fees to offset lost revenue from no longer requiring full licenses for compact members.
- **Comparisons to Existing Compacts**: The compacts were compared to successful models like nursing and physical therapy, which have been operational for years.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The subcommittee emphasized the need for clear language, collaboration, and financial safeguards in all discussed legislation. Key next steps included:
- Revising SB 133 to clarify the OPLC's role and ensure board authority is maintained.
- Finalizing language on confidentiality, due process, and procedural clarity in disciplinary proceedings.
- Drafting amendments to ensure the OPLC covers fees associated with interstate compacts and to protect state resources.
- Reconvening to review updated language and finalize the legislation before the **May 27th** legislative deadline.

Overall, the meeting highlighted a commitment to balancing professional mobility, due process, and state sovereignty while ensuring efficient and transparent governance of professional licensing and disciplinary processes.
