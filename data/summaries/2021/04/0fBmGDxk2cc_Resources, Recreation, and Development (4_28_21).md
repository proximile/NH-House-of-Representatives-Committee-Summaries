The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 28, 2021, focused on **Senate Bill 146**, an omnibus bill addressing **Resources, Recreation, and Development**. The discussions were divided into four segments, each tackling distinct but interconnected issues related to public health, environmental sustainability, waste management, and coastal resource protection. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key points from the meeting:

1. **Zoonotic Disease Prevention and Live Animal Market Regulations**:  
   - **Senate Bill 146** empowers the **Director of Fish and Game** to monitor and respond to emerging zoonotic pathogens, addressing threats to public health, food security, biodiversity, and economic stability. The bill allows for **legislation**, **rulemaking**, or **emergency executive orders** to mitigate risks.  
   - It introduces **common-sense regulations** for live animal markets to prevent disease transmission, prohibiting the sale of high-risk species (e.g., bats, rodents, primates) and mandating separation of wildlife from livestock during transport. Existing livestock and shellfish markets are exempt.  
   - Violations may result in **written warnings** or **fines**, balancing public health and private property rights.  
   - The bill was developed collaboratively with **Fish and Game** and the **Department of Agriculture**, addressing future risks while respecting current market practices.  

2. **Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling Infrastructure**:  
   - Part two of the bill renews New Hampshireâ€™s **solid waste reduction goals**, aiming for **25% reduction by 2030** and **45% by 2050**. It focuses on reducing landfill use, increasing recycling, and finding markets for recyclable materials.  
   - The bill addresses rising tipping fees for municipalities and the need to extend landfill capacity. It works in tandem with **House Bill 413**, which creates a solid waste task force and sets deadlines for composting regulations.  
   - Testimony highlighted the outdated nature of current waste goals (last updated in the 1990s) and the challenges of landfill capacity and rising costs. The bill reframes goals to focus on **disposal reduction**, using landfill and incinerator data for better tracking.  
   - Industry experts emphasized the need for improved recycling infrastructure, including establishing large-scale recycling facilities in New Hampshire to reduce the burden of transporting recyclables out of state.  

3. **Coastal Resource Management and Water Quality Standards**:  
   - The bill establishes a **Coastal Program** in state statute, funded by NOAA, to assist municipalities with coastal planning, economic development, and hazard mitigation (e.g., storm surges, flooding). It ensures federal activities, such as offshore wind energy development, are consistent with state laws.  
   - Part four updates state standards for measuring chemicals like nitrogen in water bodies, particularly in the Great Bay area. This provides municipalities with more flexibility in meeting EPA requirements and reduces the financial burden of upgrading wastewater treatment plants.  
   - The bill aligns state standards with the **National Shellfish Sanitation Program**, protecting aquaculture and resolving conflicts between the Clean Water Act and shellfish sanitation requirements.  

4. **Derelict Fishing Gear and Ocean Plastics**:  
   - The bill creates a **Derelict Fishing Gear Fund** to support cleanup efforts for lost or abandoned fishing gear, which poses environmental and navigational hazards.  
   - The fund is supported by **search charges** ($10-$25) on certain fishing licenses and fines for dumping, with exemptions for fishermen participating in cleanup activities.  
   - The bill codifies interdepartmental collaboration (Fish and Game, Environmental Services, Health and Human Services, Agriculture) to address invasive species and environmental issues, exemplified by a successful invasive zebra mussel management effort.  
   - Amendments removed **shrimp licenses** due to the decline of Northern shrimp in the Gulf of Maine and extended the deadline for implementing a **takeback program for firefighting foams** containing PFAS chemicals to July 1, 2023, due to COVID-19-related delays.  

5. **Collaboration and Future Steps**:  
   - The bill reflects extensive collaboration between state agencies, municipalities, and industry stakeholders.  
   - Committee members raised concerns about funding, enforcement, and the effectiveness of waste reduction goals but emphasized the need for long-term planning and incentives.  
   - Future work sessions were planned to finalize amendments and prepare recommendations, with a focus on addressing environmental challenges collaboratively.  

In summary, **Senate Bill 146** represents a comprehensive effort to address public health, environmental sustainability, and resource management in New Hampshire. It balances proactive measures for zoonotic disease prevention, waste reduction, and coastal protection with practical considerations for industry stakeholders and municipalities. The bill highlights the importance of interdepartmental collaboration, federal funding opportunities, and clear state goals to achieve meaningful progress.
