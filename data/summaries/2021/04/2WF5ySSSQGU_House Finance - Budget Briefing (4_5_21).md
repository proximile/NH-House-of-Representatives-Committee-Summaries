**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Budget Briefing (4/5/21)**

On April 5, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened to discuss the proposed state budget for the upcoming biennium. The $13.46 billion budget is balanced without relying on new taxes or federal stimulus funds from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Key highlights include tax reductions, increased funding for essential services, and strategic allocations to address pandemic-related challenges and long-term needs.

### **Budget Overview and Revenue Sources**
- **Total Budget**: $13.46 billion for the biennium, a 1.4% decrease from the previous biennium.
- **Revenue Sources**: Primarily from existing streams, including the business profits tax (27.8%), meals and rooms tax (20%), and liquor sales (8.1%). Federal funds account for 31.5%, slightly higher than usual due to CARES Act recovery funds.
- **Rainy Day Fund**: Increased to $142.6 million, the highest in state history.

### **Tax Reductions**
The budget proposes several tax cuts to support businesses and residents:
- Decrease the statewide education property tax by $100 million.
- Reduce the meals and rooms tax rate to 8.5%.
- Lower the business enterprise tax rate to 0.55% and the business profits tax rate to 7.6%.
- Phase out the interest and dividends tax over five years.

### **Funding Allocations**
1. **Health and Social Services**: The largest category, receiving 43.2% of the budget, prioritizes direct service provision, exempting developmental services, children’s health insurance, and nursing home funding from cuts.
2. **Education**: 22% of the budget, including federal and general funds, fully funds aid to public charter schools and special education for higher-cost students.
3. **General Government**: 7.7%.
4. **Administration of Justice and Public Protection**: 11.8%, including funding for body-worn and dashboard cameras for law enforcement.
5. **Transportation**: 9.9%, with additional funds for highway block grants and bridge betterment programs.

### **Key Initiatives and Adjustments**
- **Sununu Youth Services Center Closure**: The budget mandates the closure of the facility in its second year, freeing up over $12 million annually due to its high costs and low occupancy.
- **Child and Family Services**: Federal TANF funds will reduce daycare waitlists, aiding parents’ return to work.
- **Medicaid and Health Services**: Fully funds the governor’s recommendations for managed care, fee-for-service, and children’s health insurance plans.
- **Elderly and Adult Services**: Addresses a proposed 18% increase in county nursing home costs, limiting growth to 2% to avoid property tax hikes.
- **Public Health and Family Planning**: Ensures state family planning funds are not used for abortion services, with $50,000 allocated for bonuses to new providers.
- **Mental Health Services**: Supports workforce enhancements to address high vacancy rates and removes a provision for a new 60-bed forensic mental health hospital due to lack of policy review.
- **IT Infrastructure**: Allocates significant funding ($35-43 million over two years) to modernize outdated IT systems, particularly within the Department of Health and Human Services.
- **Workforce Development**: Authorizes 350 new hires (13% growth) in the Department of Health and Human Services to address workforce shortages.

### **Other Notable Provisions**
- **Historical Horse Racing**: Supported to generate additional education trust fund revenue.
- **Commission on Higher Education**: Formed to study merging the community college and university systems.
- **Peer Support Services**: Committee committed to following up on funding specifics.
- **Legislative Branch Budget**: Includes an increase in funding, though details were not discussed.

### **Fiscal Responsibility and Surplus**
The budget emphasizes fiscal responsibility, addressing a negative balance carried forward from FY20 due to pandemic-related revenue losses. It includes revenue adjustments and appropriations to balance the budget, with potential draws from the rainy day fund if revenues fall short.

### **Conclusion**
The proposed budget reflects a commitment to fiscal prudence, essential service prioritization, and strategic investments to address both immediate and long-term challenges. It balances tax reductions with targeted funding increases, supports workforce development, and modernizes critical infrastructure. The committee concluded by inviting further questions and discussions in subsequent sessions.
