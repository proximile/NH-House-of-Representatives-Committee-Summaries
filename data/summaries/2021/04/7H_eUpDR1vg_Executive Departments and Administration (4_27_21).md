**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting â€“ Executive Departments and Administration (April 27, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 27, 2021, covered a wide range of topics, primarily focused on **Senate Bill 155 (SB 155)**, **Senate Bill 104 (SB 104)**, and **Senate Bill 133 (SB 133)**, as well as discussions on vaccine mandates and child care staffing. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Senate Bill 155: Codifying COVID-19 Emergency Measures**
SB 155, sponsored by Senator Bradley, aimed to codify certain emergency measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic into statute. The bill was narrowed to nine key provisions, with discussions focusing on:

1. **Temporary Health Partners**:  
   - The bill introduced "temporary health partners" to assist Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) in long-term care facilities. Concerns were raised about their qualifications, as they only complete an 8-hour course without clinical experience. Questions also arose about their transition to LNAs after 100 hours of work and the need for Medicaid reimbursement changes.

2. **Pharmacy Technicians Administering Vaccines**:  
   - Pharmacy technicians were permitted to administer COVID-19 vaccines under pharmacist supervision, consistent with federal guidelines. Debate centered on whether this provision should be temporary or permanent, given the likelihood of annual COVID-19 boosters.

3. **Outdoor Dining Expansion**:  
   - The bill extended outdoor dining provisions until 2023, but concerns were raised about local zoning, ADA compliance, septic system capacity, and public safety. Municipal representatives emphasized the need for local oversight and clearer language in the bill.

4. **Emergency Licensure**:  
   - Over 22,000 emergency licenses were issued during the pandemic at no cost. Some representatives suggested implementing a nominal fee for temporary licenses post-pandemic to cover administrative costs.

5. **Amendment 1149 (Vaccine Passports)**:  
   - Representative Baxter introduced an amendment to prohibit the state or its subdivisions from mandating COVID-19 vaccine passports or discriminating against unvaccinated individuals. The amendment also barred the state from contracting with or funding private businesses that require vaccine passports. The debate centered on protecting bodily autonomy, medical privacy, and preventing discrimination.

6. **Other Issues**:  
   - Concerns were raised about septic system overloads and water supply issues due to expanded outdoor dining. Municipal representatives highlighted the need for local authority in approving outdoor dining expansions.

The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review, with plans to address technical and policy concerns.

### **Senate Bill 104: State Employee Classification and Reverse Auctions**
SB 104, an omnibus bill, addressed state employee classification and reverse auctions. Key points included:

1. **State Employee Classification**:  
   - The bill codified recommendations from the Joint Committee on Employee Classification (JCEC), streamlining the classification process, particularly for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An amendment was proposed to standardize the classification of senior leadership positions within the Department of Administrative Services (DAS).

2. **Reverse Auctions**:  
   - The bill promoted the use of reverse auctions, an electronic bidding process designed to drive down prices for state procurement. DAS officials highlighted successes, such as a joint venture with Vermont for road salt procurement, resulting in significant savings. Concerns about low bidders and cost overruns were addressed, with emphasis on competitive bidding laws and contract enforcement.

The committee planned to form a subcommittee to further review the amendment and address remaining questions.

### **Senate Bill 133: Child Care Staffing Qualifications**
SB 133 focused on child care staffing qualifications, with discussions centered on an amendment to lower educational requirements for entry-level child care workers (associate teachers). Key points included:

1. **Amendment Details**:  
   - The amendment proposed allowing documented life experience to substitute for 30 hours of training in child growth and development, along with 1,000 hours of supervised child care experience and ongoing training after hiring.

2. **Testimonies**:  
   - **Opponents** argued that the amendment would compromise child care quality and devalue the profession, emphasizing the importance of early childhood education and training.  
   - **Supporters** highlighted the urgent need to address staffing shortages and keep child care centers operational, particularly for low-income families.

3. **Broader Issues**:  
   - The child care system in New Hampshire was described as broken, with chronic underfunding, high costs for parents, and low wages for workers. Participants acknowledged the need for long-term solutions, including increased funding and innovative training programs.

The Department of Health and Human Services is revising child care rules, with plans to submit them for review in September 2021. The amendment was referred to a subcommittee for further discussion.

### **Vaccine Mandates and Passports**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on **Amendment 1149**, which sought to prohibit vaccine mandates and passports. Key points included:

1. **Support for the Amendment**:  
   - Proponents emphasized **bodily autonomy**, **individual rights**, and **privacy concerns**, arguing that vaccine passports could lead to **discrimination** and create a **"two-tiered society."** Concerns were raised about **coercion** and the potential erosion of **public trust** in vaccines.

2. **Opposition and Concerns**:  
   - Healthcare professionals and hospital representatives opposed the amendment, citing its potential impact on **public health and safety**. They emphasized the importance of **vaccination requirements** in healthcare settings to protect vulnerable populations.  
   - The Business and Industry Association (BIA) opposed the amendment, arguing it would interfere with private businesses' ability to enforce vaccine requirements for workplace safety.

3. **Debate on Broader Implications**:  
   - The discussion touched on the potential for vaccine passports to **marginalize** individuals who choose not to be vaccinated, as well as **privacy concerns** associated with requiring proof of vaccination status. Some speakers drew parallels to **historical injustices**, such as discrimination against Jews in Nazi Germany and Black people under Jim Crow laws.

The amendment was referred to a **subcommittee** for further review, with some suggesting it might be more appropriately addressed in the **House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee**.
