The April 27, 2021, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee centered on several key bills, with a primary focus on **Senate Bill 3 (SB 3)**, which addresses the tax treatment of forgiven Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, as well as discussions on **Senate Bill 139-FN**, **Senate Bill 101-FN**, and **Senate Bill 112**. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key points:

---

### **Senate Bill 3: PPP Loan Forgiveness and Tax Treatment**
1. **Purpose and Context**:
   - SB 3 aims to align New Hampshire’s tax treatment of forgiven PPP loans with federal law, which excludes forgiven PPP loans from gross income and allows businesses to deduct expenses paid with these funds. Under current state law, forgiven PPP loans are treated as taxable income, though businesses can deduct expenses, potentially resulting in no net tax liability if all funds are used for deductible expenses.
   - The bill seeks to provide tax relief to businesses that relied on PPP loans during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are still struggling financially.

2. **Federal vs. State Tax Code**:
   - New Hampshire’s tax code is tied to the 2018 IRS code, not the 2020 code, creating a discrepancy. SB 3 would update the state’s tax code to match the federal stance on PPP loans.

3. **Fiscal Impact**:
   - The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) estimates SB 3 would reduce state revenue by $71 million in FY 2021 and $8 million in FY 2022. However, the fiscal impact has fluctuated, with some estimates reaching $91.7 million.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential loss of state revenue and its impact on funding for other priorities like healthcare, infrastructure, and broadband expansion. There was also discussion about whether federal funds from the **American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)** could offset this revenue loss.

4. **Testimony and Debate**:
   - Business owners and representatives testified about the critical role PPP loans played in keeping their businesses afloat and retaining employees. They emphasized the financial strain of potentially having to pay taxes on forgiven loans.
   - Some legislators questioned whether businesses would face additional tax liability if PPP funds were used for deductible expenses like payroll, while others raised concerns about potential "double benefits" for businesses.
   - Proponents argued that taxing PPP loans would undermine the program’s intent, harm small businesses, and send a negative message about New Hampshire’s business climate.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee plans to hold additional work sessions to analyze the fiscal impact, review updated data, and consider guidance from the IRS and Treasury. There was also discussion about adding a preamble to the bill to clarify its intent and ensure alignment with federal guidelines.

### **Senate Bill 139-FN: Bingo Dates**
1. **Purpose**:
   - The bill proposes increasing the number of bingo game dates allowed per month from 10 to 16, totaling 192 games per year, to support charities.

2. **Testimony**:
   - **Trisha Molillo** introduced the bill on behalf of Senator Kevin Avard, emphasizing its goal to allow charities to hold more bingo events.
   - **Mike McLaughlin**, representing Arrow International and Community Bingo, opposed the bill, arguing it could reduce opportunities for smaller charities in commercial bingo halls by favoring high-performing charities.
   - **Paul Laflamme**, representing the Spartans Drum & Bugle Corps and Symphony New Hampshire, supported the bill, stating it would allow charities like his to operate more frequently and fill unused dates in commercial halls.

3. **Key Concerns**:
   - Debate centered on balancing the needs of charities and commercial bingo halls, with concerns about unintended consequences for smaller charities.

### **Senate Bill 101-FN: Business Profits Tax Threshold**
1. **Purpose**:
   - The bill seeks to increase the minimum gross business income threshold for filing a Business Profits Tax (BPT) return from $50,000 to $75,000, effective July 1, 2021.

2. **Testimony**:
   - **Senator Donna Soucy**, the bill's prime sponsor, argued that the $50,000 threshold, set in 1993, is outdated and burdens small businesses with unnecessary administrative costs.
   - **Greg Moore** from Americans for Prosperity supported the bill, noting that 86% of businesses in the $50,000-$75,000 range have zero tax liability, making the filing requirement redundant. He suggested indexing the threshold to inflation to avoid future legislative adjustments.
   - **Carolyn LeBlanc**, Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Revenue, provided data showing that increasing the threshold to $100,000 would cost the state approximately $2.2 million in revenue.

3. **Key Points**:
   - Discussion focused on reducing administrative burdens for small businesses, with suggestions to consider a higher threshold or indexing to inflation.

### **Senate Bill 112: Historic Racing**
1. **Purpose**:
   - The bill establishes pari-mutuel pools for historic horse racing, similar to **House Bill 626**, which the committee previously approved.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The bill is projected to generate $12.2 million annually for the Education Trust Fund and $6 million for local charities.
   - A concern was raised about the exclusion of a Keene-based license holder due to the bill’s May 2020 cutoff date. A proposed amendment to change the date to December 31, 2020, was defeated in the Senate.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Since **House Bill 626** is already progressing through the Senate and is expected to pass, the committee may not need to take further action on **Senate Bill 112**.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the economic and fiscal implications of SB 3, with stakeholders advocating for tax relief to support pandemic-affected businesses while balancing the state’s revenue needs. Discussions on SB 139-FN and SB 101-FN focused on reducing administrative burdens for charities and small businesses, while SB 112 was largely overshadowed by the progress of House Bill 626. The committee adjourned with plans for follow-up work sessions on SB 3 and no immediate action needed on SB 112.
