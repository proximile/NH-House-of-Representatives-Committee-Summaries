### **Senate Bill 89: Election Procedures and Register of Probate**

1. **Register of Probate (Part 5)**:
   - **Opposition**: Several speakers, including **Kathy Stacy**, **Anna Tilton**, and former Register of Probate **Donna Scitec**, opposed reinstating the Register of Probate as a county function, arguing it should remain under the judiciary. They cited concerns about costs, lack of training, inefficiency, and the burden on counties. Scitec noted that the role has been largely ceremonial since the unification of the court system in 1983.
   - **Support**: **Jane Bradstreet**, a Register of Probate, supported the bill, emphasizing the need for better public assistance in probate matters and improved customer service. The bill proposed reinstating some duties of the Register of Probate to assist individuals through the probate process, with a nominal fee to fund this role.

2. **Absentee Ballot Pre-Processing (Part 3)**:
   - **Concerns**: **Dan Healy**, a town clerk, raised concerns about the mandate to open absentee ballot outer envelopes the day before the election, citing time constraints and security issues.
   - **Support**: **Margaret Burns** of the NH Municipal Association supported pre-processing for efficiency but suggested amendments to clarify roles in marking checklists. **Deputy Secretary of State David Scanlan** highlighted the success of pre-processing in the 2020 election but noted the need for uniformity and voter contact for curing deficiencies.

3. **Post-Election Audits and Investigations (Part 4)**:
   - Scanlan urged caution in establishing processes for post-election investigations, emphasizing the importance of finality in election results. The bill aimed to address discrepancies in vote counts and audits, allowing the Attorney General to investigate significant differences between announced election results and recounts or audits.

4. **Other Issues**:
   - Concerns were raised about the accuracy of voting machines and the need for better oversight, particularly in light of the Windham election controversy. The bill also addressed the logistics of opening ballot boxes for investigation while preserving the chain of custody.

### **Senate Bill 83: Election Law Provisions**

1. **Voter Registration Portal**:
   - The bill proposed creating an online portal for voter registration and updates, allowing voters to submit information but still requiring verification by election officials. The Secretary of State’s office noted that implementing this portal would take time, suggesting a target of the 2024 election cycle. The **League of Women Voters of NH** supported the portal as a step toward modernizing voter registration.

2. **Recount Fees**:
   - The bill adjusted recount fees based on the margin of victory in elections. For races with a margin of 0.25% or less, recount fees would be waived, while fees would increase for margins between 0.25% and 3%.

3. **Legible Financial Statements**:
   - Candidates and political committees would be required to submit legible financial statements, addressing issues with unreadable faxed or handwritten documents. The importance of standardizing campaign finance reporting to ensure transparency was emphasized.

4. **Fiscal Year Budgets**:
   - Towns with fiscal years starting on July 1 would be allowed to spend money before their town meetings, similar to towns with January fiscal years. This addressed issues that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic when meetings were delayed.

5. **Election Officials on the Ballot**:
   - The bill clarified that election officials who are on the ballot can still perform duties at polling places but cannot handle ballots for their own races. Questions were raised about whether restrictions on moderators handling ballots conflict with the NH Constitution, which assigns moderators the role of counting votes.

### **Additional Key Provisions in SB 89**

1. **Residency Requirement for City Clerks**:
   - The bill required city clerks to be New Hampshire residents, addressing cases where clerks live out of state. It did not remove any duties but changed the title of chief election officer to the moderator.

2. **Photographs at Polling Places**:
   - The bill prohibited taking photographs of other voters or their ballots within the guardrail, aiming to protect voter privacy and prevent coercion.

3. **Absentee Ballot Processing**:
   - The bill allowed clerks to open absentee ballot envelopes before Election Day to verify signatures and address irregularities, enabling voters to “cure” issues with their ballots. This process would streamline Election Day operations.

### **Key Discussions and Concerns**

- **Implementation Timeline**: Concerns were voiced about the feasibility of implementing the voter registration portal by the proposed deadlines, with suggestions to extend the timeline to 2024.
- **Support for Modernization**: The League of Women Voters of NH supported the portal as a step toward modernizing voter registration.
