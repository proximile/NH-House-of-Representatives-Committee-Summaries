**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Executive Departments and Administration (4/21/21)**

On April 21, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting via Zoom to discuss **Senate Bill 133**, a comprehensive piece of legislation addressing various aspects of occupational licensure, professional regulation, and administrative processes. The bill’s multiple sections sparked extensive debate, with key discussions focusing on interstate compacts, professional licensing, workforce shortages, and public safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key points:

---

### **Interstate Compacts and Licensure Portability**
1. **EMS Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact (REPLICA)**:
   - **Section 2** proposed repealing the EMS Compact, enacted in 2018 to allow EMS personnel to practice across state lines. Supporters of repeal argued it was unused in New Hampshire, created confusion, and undermined local economic contributions. Opponents, including the **Department of Defense (DoD)** and EMS professionals, emphasized its importance for:
     - **Military families**, enabling spouses to maintain licensure during relocations.
     - **Emergency response**, facilitating mutual aid during disasters.
     - **Public safety**, ensuring standardized training and accountability through a national database.
   - Concerns were raised that repealing the compact would harm military families and New Hampshire’s attractiveness for military basing.

2. **Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Compact and Occupational Therapy Compact**:
   - **Section 5** introduced these compacts, supported by the DoD and stakeholders for their benefits to:
     - **Military spouses**, who often face licensure challenges during relocations.
     - **Workforce mobility**, reducing redundant licensing processes.
     - **Public safety**, ensuring disciplinary actions are shared across states.
   - These compacts were seen as complementary to existing licensure reforms and aligned with the **2019 National Defense Authorization Act**.

3. **Physical Therapy and Psychology Compacts**:
   - The **Physical Therapy Compact** was cited as a successful model for interstate agreements.
   - New Hampshire’s participation in the **Psychology Compact (PsyPact)** was discussed, with concerns raised about the redundancy of a proposed "Telepass" license for telehealth services.

### **Professional Licensing and Regulation**
1. **Music Therapy Licensing**:
   - **Section 6** proposed licensing board-certified music therapists to protect the public from unqualified practitioners and legitimize the profession. Advocates highlighted music therapy’s transformative impact on clients with neurological or developmental challenges.
   - Disputes arose over the **scope of practice** between music therapists and speech-language pathologists, with calls for amendments to clarify language.

2. **Temporary Licensure for CNAs**:
   - **Section 9** aimed to recognize individuals who completed an 8-hour training course and worked at least 100 hours during the COVID-19 pandemic as temporary CNAs, addressing workforce shortages in nursing homes.

3. **Barbering and Cosmetology Programs**:
   - **Section 11** allowed high school programs to be recognized as schools for barbering and cosmetology, enabling students to obtain apprentice licenses and addressing ambiguities in licensing requirements.

4. **Telemedicine Licensing**:
   - **Section 12** proposed a new telepsychology license for out-of-state psychologists to provide remote services in New Hampshire, offering an alternative to the Psychology Compact.

### **Public Safety and Workforce Issues**
1. **Food Protection Manager Certification**:
   - **Section 13** addressed concerns about the $300 certification fee for food protection managers, proposing exemptions for low-risk businesses to reduce financial burdens on small establishments.

2. **Skilled Professional Medical Personnel**:
   - Discussions focused on eligibility and service coverage authorization for skilled personnel in long-term care, with the Department of Health and Human Services opposing restrictions that could delay service delivery.

3. **EMS License Revocation**:
   - **Section 10** proposed aligning EMS license suspension and revocation processes with other healthcare professions, promoting a "just culture" approach to encourage transparency and learning.

### **Subcommittee Work and Procedural Matters**
- Subcommittees were assigned to review specific sections of the bill, including occupational therapy and audiology compacts, music therapy licensing, and food protection certification.
- Procedural discussions addressed subcommittee operations, public hearings, and rulemaking processes, emphasizing the need for efficiency and early planning.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Support for Military Families**: Multiple compacts were supported for their role in easing licensure portability for military spouses and personnel.
2. **Public Safety and Accountability**: Stakeholders emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards for professional licensing and ensuring disciplinary actions are shared across states.
3. **Workforce Flexibility**: Proposals addressed workforce shortages in healthcare, long-term care, and vocational education by streamlining licensing processes and recognizing temporary credentials.
4. **Balancing Regulation and Flexibility**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance regulatory requirements with the needs of small businesses, professionals, and the public.

The meeting concluded with no immediate decisions, as further discussions and subcommittee work were scheduled to address the bill’s sections in detail.
