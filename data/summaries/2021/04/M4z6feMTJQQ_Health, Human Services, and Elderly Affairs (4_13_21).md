**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (April 13, 2021)**

On April 13, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened to discuss several key pieces of legislation, focusing on **Senate Bill 45 (SB 45)** and **Senate Bill 120 (SB 120)**. Both bills aim to improve healthcare delivery and access, particularly for vulnerable populations, while addressing administrative challenges, licensure issues, and patient privacy concerns.

### **Senate Bill 45: Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Enhancements**
SB 45 seeks to improve the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program by integrating PDMP data into electronic health records (EHRs) and streamlining access for healthcare providers. The bill also emphasizes robust patient privacy protections and clarifies definitions and access rules. Key points include:

1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to reduce administrative burdens for healthcare providers by integrating PDMP data into EHRs, ensuring efficient access to controlled substance prescription data while maintaining patient privacy.
   
2. **Privacy Protections**: SB 45 includes provisions to prevent unauthorized access to PDMP data, particularly by retired practitioners. It also removes references to data sharing with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to ensure PDMP data is used for individual patient care rather than public health analysis.

3. **Federal Funding**: While the bill could make New Hampshire eligible for additional Medicaid funding, this is considered a secondary benefit rather than the primary goal.

4. **Testimony and Support**: 
   - **Senator Bob Giuda**, the bill’s sponsor, highlighted the importance of privacy and efficiency.
   - **Dr. David Strang**, an emergency physician and PDMP advisory council chair, emphasized the inefficiencies of the current system and the benefits of EHR integration.
   - Representatives from the New Hampshire Hospital Association and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification also voiced support, citing improved workflow and patient safety.

5. **Concerns and Questions**: Committee members raised issues about patient consent, data access tracking, and the potential implications of moving PDMP administration from the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification to DHHS, as proposed in the state budget.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee considered retaining the bill to address potential issues arising from budget-related changes to PDMP administration.

### **Senate Bill 120: Physician Assistants (PAs) at the VA**
SB 120 addresses the supervision of physician assistants (PAs) working within the Veterans Administration (VA) system, particularly when their supervising physicians are not licensed in New Hampshire. The bill aims to clarify licensure requirements and improve veterans’ access to care. Key points include:

1. **Purpose**: The bill clarifies that New Hampshire-licensed PAs can work under VA physicians who are licensed in other states or U.S. territories, addressing a gap in current law.

2. **Licensure Requirements**:
   - An amendment was proposed to ensure supervising physicians hold a valid U.S. license, excluding physicians licensed outside the U.S.
   - The bill emphasizes compliance with federal VA regulations while maintaining state licensure standards for PAs.

3. **Scope of Practice**: The bill is narrowly focused on PAs working within the VA system and does not expand their scope of practice or allow for tele-supervision outside the VA.

4. **Veterans’ Access to Care**: The bill aims to improve access to care for veterans, particularly in rural areas like the North Country, where veterans often travel long distances for treatment.

5. **Historical Context**: The discussion referenced a 2017 incident where a burst pipe at the Manchester VA surgical suite led to a partnership with Catholic Medical Center, highlighting the need for flexible care arrangements.

6. **Collaborative Process**: The committee worked collaboratively to refine the bill’s language, ensuring clarity and alignment with both federal VA regulations and state licensure laws.

7. **Straw Poll**: A non-binding straw poll indicated broad support for the bill, with plans to revisit it in a future work session to finalize amendments.

### **Additional Discussion: Medicaid Spend-Down Requirements**
The committee briefly discussed **House Bill 1639**, which adjusted Medicaid spend-down requirements but was not funded in the state budget. Members emphasized the need to address this oversight to ensure the law’s implementation.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on improving healthcare delivery and access while balancing administrative efficiency, licensure standards, and patient privacy. Key themes included:
- **Collaboration**: Members from both parties worked together to address concerns and refine legislation.
- **Veterans’ Care**: Ensuring access to care for New Hampshire veterans was a recurring priority.
- **Privacy and Efficiency**: Balancing efficient access to healthcare data with robust privacy protections was a central focus, particularly in discussions around SB 45.

The committee planned to revisit both SB 45 and SB 120 in future work sessions to address outstanding concerns and finalize the legislation.
