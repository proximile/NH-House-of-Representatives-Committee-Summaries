The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration (EDNA) committee convened on April 29, 2021, to discuss several key legislative issues, primarily centered around **Senate Bill 133** and other related bills. The meeting addressed a wide range of topics, including professional licensure, emergency medical services (EMS), food safety, and healthcare regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### 1. **Senate Bill 133: Licensing Boards and Disciplinary Procedures**
   - **Standing Orders for Licensing Boards**: The committee discussed allowing boards, councils, and commissions to delegate non-discretionary tasks (e.g., issuing licenses) to staff, speeding up the process while retaining board oversight for cases involving criminal records or disciplinary actions.
   - **Disciplinary Proceedings**: Disciplinary hearings are generally public, but boards can close portions of hearings to protect sensitive medical or psychological information, especially for boards like the **Board of Psychology** and **Board of Medicine**. Non-disciplinary remedial actions (e.g., addressing mental health issues) would remain confidential, though final license actions would be public.
   - **Consistency and Privacy**: The committee debated ensuring consistency in disciplinary procedures across boards while acknowledging unique needs (e.g., the Board of Psychology). Privacy concerns, particularly for victims of sexual assault, were emphasized, balancing public safety with due process and third-party privacy.
   - **Technical Adjustments**: Several technical and grammatical changes were proposed to clarify language in the bill, such as specifying information disclosure to law enforcement.

### 2. **Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and the REPLICA Compact**
   - **EMS Compact (REPLICA)**: The EMS Compact allows licensed EMS personnel to practice across state lines, facilitating emergency response during crises like wildfires or pandemics. New Hampshire adopted the compact in 2020.
   - **Debate on Repealing the Compact**:
     - **Support for Repeal**: Some representatives argued the compact is unnecessary, citing existing mechanisms like mutual aid agreements and the governor’s emergency powers. Concerns were raised about out-of-state personnel adhering to New Hampshire’s protocols.
     - **Opposition to Repeal**: Others highlighted the compact’s benefits, such as expedited licensing for military families and enhanced emergency coordination. Experts clarified that New Hampshire retains control over the scope of practice for out-of-state personnel.
   - **Real-World Examples**: Colorado’s use of the compact during wildfires was cited as evidence of its effectiveness.

### 3. **Professional Licensure and Scope of Practice**
   - **Music Therapy Licensure**: The committee discussed licensure for music therapists, focusing on clarifying their scope of practice to avoid overlap with speech-language pathologists. A proposed amendment, modeled after Maryland’s legislation, was seen as a compromise.
   - **Professional Standards Board**: Changes to the board’s membership, including representation from higher education and K-12 education, were approved.
   - **Temporary Health Partners**: A bill allowing temporary health partners (e.g., pandemic aides) to transition to licensed nursing assistant (LNA) status after 100 hours of work was debated, with concerns raised about compliance with CMS requirements.
   - **Telehealth for Psychologists**: A bill creating a separate telehealth license for out-of-state psychologists was debated, with opponents arguing current licenses already allow telehealth services.

### 4. **Food Safety Regulations**
   - **Section 13 of SB 133**: This section proposed exempting small food establishments (with five or fewer employees) from the requirement to have a certified food protection manager on-site at all times. Instead, these establishments would need a certified manager on staff but not necessarily present during operations.
   - **Debate on Section 13**:
     - **Support**: Proponents, including Senator Gary Daniels and the New Hampshire Restaurant Association, argued the change would reduce financial burdens on small businesses without compromising food safety.
     - **Opposition**: Critics, including Representative Fellows, raised concerns about public safety, particularly for high-risk foods, and argued the existing variance process is sufficient.
   - **Testimony**: Colleen Smith (DHHS) noted that rule changes were already being developed to mirror the proposal. Mike Sullen (Aroma Joe's Coffee) highlighted challenges with the current variance process.
   - **Committee Decision**: The committee voted to remove Section 13, citing public safety concerns and the adequacy of the variance process.

### 5. **General Legislative Process**
   - **Amendments and Voting**: The committee discussed procedural aspects, including amendments, voting, and the handling of omnibus bills. For example, sections of bills could not be retained if the overall bill was voted down.
   - **Cosmetology and Aesthetics Schools**: A bill related to apprentice certificates for barbering, cosmetology, and aesthetics was amended to align with House Bill 575, allowing training in both licensed schools and shops.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance efficiency, public safety, and regulatory consistency across various sectors. Key issues included streamlining professional licensure processes, addressing concerns about the EMS Compact, and ensuring food safety without overburdening small businesses. The committee agreed to refine amendments and address broader issues in future discussions, with several motions passing and others facing opposition due to unresolved concerns.
