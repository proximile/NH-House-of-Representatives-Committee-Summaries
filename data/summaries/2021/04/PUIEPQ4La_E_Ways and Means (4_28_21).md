**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting on April 28, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on April 28, 2021, to discuss the state's revenue projections, fiscal outlook, and the impact of various economic factors on tax collections. The meeting, conducted electronically via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on key revenue streams, housing market trends, and the influence of federal stimulus measures. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Revenue Projections and Fiscal Trends**
1. **Revenue Estimates**: The committee reviewed updated revenue estimates for fiscal years (FY) 2021, 2022, and 2023. FY 2021 estimates were revised to exclude anomalous receivables, providing a more accurate baseline. Projections for FY 2022 and 2023 anticipated economic shifts, with negative growth ranges expected due to the removal of the housing market spike and other factors.
2. **Business Taxes**: Business tax revenues were performing strongly, with FY-to-date collections 21% ahead of plan. Federal stimulus packages, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), were credited with boosting business performance and consumer spending. Growth ranges for FY 2022 and 2023 were adjusted to 2-6% and 3-5%, respectively, based on predicted GDP trends.
3. **Interest and Dividends Tax**: This tax performed well, likely due to a strong stock market and federal stimulus funds. However, the IRSâ€™s extension of the federal tax filing deadline to May 17, 2021, raised concerns about delayed filings.
4. **Communication Services Tax**: This tax remained stable, with slight fluctuations. The committee continued to assess the taxability of video conferencing services like Zoom.

### **Impact of COVID-19 and Federal Stimulus**
1. **Meals and Rentals Tax**: Revenues were significantly impacted by the pandemic but showed signs of recovery due to increased consumer confidence, lifted travel restrictions, and expanded outdoor dining options.
2. **Tobacco Tax**: Revenues surged, partly due to Massachusetts' ban on flavored tobacco products, which increased cross-border sales in New Hampshire. The committee also discussed the potential impact of a federal ban on menthol cigarettes.
3. **Tobacco Settlement**: The state received $47.8 million from the tobacco settlement, exceeding the $38.4 million estimate. The Department of Justice is investigating the reasons for the increase, which is tied to national sales rather than direct state sales.
4. **Senate Bill 3 (SB3)**: The committee discussed SB3, which addresses how federal stimulus funds are taxed, and its potential impact on revenue projections. Concerns were raised about accurately determining the extent to which stimulus funds influenced business tax revenues.

### **Housing Market and Real Estate Trends**
1. **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: This tax saw strong performance, driven by low mortgage interest rates, virtual home sales, and increased property values. However, concerns were raised about housing inventory shortages and rising building costs.
2. **Housing Affordability**: The committee noted a 16.5% increase in the median sale price from March 2020 to March 2021, with a year-to-date increase of 19%. This narrowed the range of what people could afford, raising concerns about housing affordability.
3. **Utility Property Tax**: This tax performed slightly ahead of plan and prior year figures. The committee discussed factors influencing future revenues, such as economic conditions and new construction.

### **Budgetary and Fiscal Planning**
1. **House Bill 2 and Budget Impact**: The committee discussed how the passage of House Bill 2 or the budget could affect state revenues, emphasizing the need for adjustments based on final outcomes.
2. **Revenue Adjustments**: The committee reviewed the process of adjusting revenue estimates and how changes in law or economic conditions are reflected in the surplus statement. They stressed the importance of understanding these adjustments for budgetary decisions.
3. **Liquor Commission Revenue**: The Liquor Commission reported higher revenue estimates but noted potential transfers to the Department of Health and Human Services due to shortfalls in related funds.

### **Future Work and Upcoming Meetings**
The committee acknowledged the need for further analysis, particularly regarding SB3 and its implications for revenue projections. They planned to:
- Hear from an economist on the state of the New Hampshire economy.
- Hold work sessions on remaining Senate bills, including those related to lucky seven tickets and incentive bills.
- Revisit revenue issues in May with updated data.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire's fiscal landscape, shaped by federal stimulus measures, pandemic recovery, and evolving consumer behavior. The committee emphasized the importance of accurate revenue projections, transparent financial planning, and proactive measures to address housing affordability and other economic challenges. Future meetings will focus on refining revenue estimates and preparing for potential budgetary adjustments.
