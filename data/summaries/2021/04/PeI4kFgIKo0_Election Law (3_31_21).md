The New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee meeting on March 31, 2021, addressed several key election-related bills, focusing on absentee ballot processes, electronic poll books, and voter checklist maintenance. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Senate Bill 54 (SB 54): Absentee Ballot Application Changes**
SB 54 proposed requiring additional identification information, such as the last four digits of a Social Security number or a driver’s license number, on absentee ballot applications. Key points from the debate included:
- **Concerns Over Voter Rights**: Critics argued the bill could create barriers for elderly, disabled, or naturalized citizens who might struggle to provide the required information, potentially disenfranchising voters.
- **Privacy and Verification Issues**: Town clerks cannot verify Social Security numbers or updated driver’s license numbers, making the requirements ineffective. There were also concerns about exposing private information on absentee ballot forms.
- **Administrative Burden**: Clerks testified that the bill would add significant administrative work without addressing fraud, as existing safeguards (e.g., mailing ballots to verified addresses) are sufficient.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included simplifying the bill’s language and requiring photo ID for in-person absentee ballot requests, which clerks found more practical.
- **Constitutional and Practical Concerns**: Representatives questioned the necessity of the bill, citing no evidence of widespread absentee ballot fraud and raising concerns about its alignment with constitutional principles.
- **Senator Gray’s Defense**: The bill’s sponsor argued it aimed to ensure election integrity by providing multiple verification options, though critics noted the impracticality and cost of such measures.

The bill faced significant opposition, with the committee closing the public hearing without further action, signaling challenges for its passage.

### **Senate Bill 46 (SB 46): Electronic Poll Books**
SB 46 sought to make permanent the use of electronic poll books (e-poll books) in New Hampshire municipalities, following a successful pilot program. Key discussions included:
- **Benefits**: E-poll books streamline voter check-in, reduce wait times, and improve election night data compilation. Pilot towns like Milford and Londonderry reported positive experiences.
- **Security and Backup Systems**: E-poll books are hardwired and not internet-connected, minimizing cybersecurity risks. Paper checklists serve as backups in case of technical failures.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives raised concerns about catastrophic failures in other states, though New Hampshire’s system includes safeguards like paper backups and strict guidelines.
- **Incremental Adoption**: The bill allows towns to gradually adopt e-poll books, ensuring comfort with the technology before full implementation.
- **Public Testimony**: Todd Fahey of AARP New Hampshire opposed the bill, arguing it could create barriers for older adults. However, most stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, supported it for improving election efficiency.

### **Senate Bill 31 (SB 31): Voter Checklists and Absentee Ballot Affidavit**
SB 31 aimed to streamline voter checklist maintenance and simplify the absentee ballot affidavit process. Key points included:
- **Provisions**: The bill shifts responsibility for notifying out-of-state voters from local clerks to the Secretary of State and combines two absentee ballot affidavits into one to reduce confusion.
- **Testimony**: Senator James Gray, the prime sponsor, emphasized the bill’s focus on efficiency and accuracy. Advocates like Lucas Meyer and Pam Spencer urged New Hampshire to join the **Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC)** instead of creating a new system, citing cost savings and improved voter roll accuracy.
- **Concerns**: Redundancy in existing statutes and the need for better voter roll maintenance tools were highlighted.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**:
- **Election Integrity vs. Accessibility**: Discussions across all bills centered on balancing election integrity with voter accessibility, with concerns raised about unnecessary barriers and administrative burdens.
- **Technology and Security**: The adoption of e-poll books and electronic systems was supported for efficiency but required robust safeguards, including paper backups and incremental implementation.
- **Cost and Efficiency**: Stakeholders emphasized the need for cost-effective solutions, with ERIC proposed as a viable alternative to developing new systems.
- **Stakeholder Input**: Extensive testimony from town clerks, moderators, and advocacy groups shaped the discussions, with most supporting SB 31 and SB 46 while raising concerns about SB 54.

The committee will likely consider amendments to address security, redundancy, and accessibility concerns before advancing the bills.
