### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (4/28/21)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 28, 2021, centered on several key issues related to criminal justice and public safety, with a significant focus on firearm legislation, particularly **Senate Bills 141 and 154**. The discussions also touched on animal welfare and procedural challenges in the legislative process. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and debates:

---

### **Firearm Background Checks and Senate Bill 141**
1. **Current System (Gun Line)**:
   - The **New Hampshire State Police Gun Line** conducts background checks for firearm purchases, including additional state-specific checks (e.g., state criminal records, protective orders) beyond the federal **National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)**.
   - The Gun Line faced significant delays due to increased gun sales (60-65% rise), COVID-19 staffing issues, and expanded scope of checks. However, recent reforms, including improved phone systems, reduced backlogs, and streamlined processes, have reduced average wait times to 14 minutes, with 97% of inquiries answered immediately.

2. **Proposed Changes (SB 141)**:
   - SB 141 proposes shifting background checks for handguns from the Gun Line to the FBI’s NICS system, similar to long guns. Supporters argue this would eliminate redundancy, reduce delays, and save taxpayers over $400,000 annually by abolishing the Gun Line.
   - The bill also shifts responsibility for domestic violence and stalking-related background checks to **county sheriffs**, with the state providing initial funding ($10,000 per county) for setup and training.

3. **Support for SB 141**:
   - Proponents, including **Senator Bob Giuda**, firearm store owners, and organizations like the **National Rifle Association (NRA)** and **Gun Owners of America**, argue the bill streamlines the process, protects Second Amendment rights, and addresses inefficiencies in the current system.
   - Supporters highlight that the Gun Line lacks statutory authority, duplicates NICS, and has caused delays, sometimes taking days or even a year for firearm returns under protective orders.

4. **Opposition to SB 141**:
   - Opponents, including the **New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence**, argue the Gun Line provides critical state-specific protections, such as cross-referencing protective orders and state criminal records, which NICS lacks.
   - Concerns were raised about gaps in NICS, such as missing protective orders issued after hours or without a defendant’s date of birth, potentially allowing 50-70 prohibited individuals annually to purchase firearms.
   - Critics also expressed concerns about the burden on county sheriffs, potential unfunded mandates, and the loss of protections for domestic violence victims.

5. **Neutral Stance**:
   - The **Department of Safety**, led by Commissioner Robert Quinn, remained neutral on SB 141, emphasizing that it is a policy decision for the legislature. Quinn noted that the Gun Line has addressed its previous issues and is functioning effectively.

### **Senate Bill 154: State Enforcement of Federal Gun Laws**
1. **Purpose of SB 154**:
   - The bill prohibits New Hampshire from enforcing any presidential executive order that restricts or regulates the right to keep and bear arms. It aims to protect Second Amendment rights and prevent state resources from being used to enforce federal gun laws.

2. **Support for SB 154**:
   - Supporters, including the **New Hampshire Firearms Coalition** and **Gun Owners of America**, argue the bill safeguards state sovereignty and individual rights. They emphasized the importance of self-defense and preventing federal overreach.

3. **Opposition to SB 154**:
   - Opponents, including **Gun Sense New Hampshire** and the **Kent Street Coalition**, argued the bill undermines public safety efforts, such as federal initiatives to regulate ghost guns, bump stocks, and red flag laws. Critics also highlighted the potential for the bill to hinder law enforcement cooperation on issues like domestic violence, extremism, and mass shootings.
   - Concerns were raised about the constitutionality of the bill and its potential to lead to legal challenges.

4. **Amendment Proposals**:
   - Amendments were proposed to expand the bill’s scope to cover federal laws and ATF rules, not just executive orders. The bill ultimately passed with amendments, with an 11-10 vote.

### **Domestic Violence and Firearm Access**
- A recurring theme throughout the discussions was the impact of firearm legislation on domestic violence victims. Opponents of SB 141 and SB 154 highlighted that 9 out of 10 domestic violence homicides in New Hampshire involve firearms, primarily handguns.
- The Gun Line’s ability to notify individuals protected by domestic violence orders if the subject of the order attempts to purchase a firearm was cited as a critical protection that would be lost under SB 141.

---

### **Animal Welfare and Other Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 110**:
   - The bill addresses leaving animals in vehicles under extreme temperatures and allows deputized individuals to intervene. Concerns were raised about the practicality and liability of deputizing citizens to break car windows, as well as the difficulty of determining extreme temperatures. The bill was retained for further discussion.

2. **Senate Bill 122**:
   - The bill includes provisions on guardianship by great grandparents, a council on autism disorders, and increased penalties for harming service animals. Members debated the merits of combining unrelated provisions into a single bill, with some advocating for separate bills to allow more focused public input and debate.

---

### **Procedural Challenges**
- Members discussed the challenges of debating and amending bills during remote meetings, emphasizing the importance of maintaining order and allowing for healthy discussion.
- Concerns were raised about the practice of combining unrelated bills into one, which some argued denies the public the opportunity to comment on specific issues.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted deep divisions over firearm legislation, with debates centering on balancing Second Amendment rights with public safety, particularly for domestic violence victims. While supporters of SB 141 and SB 154 emphasized efficiency, cost savings, and constitutional protections, opponents stressed the importance of state-specific safeguards and the potential risks to vulnerable populations. The discussions also underscored the complexities of addressing animal welfare and procedural challenges in the legislative process.
