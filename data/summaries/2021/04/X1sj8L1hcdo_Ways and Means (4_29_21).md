**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (April 29, 2021)**

The April 29, 2021, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee focused on the state’s economic recovery, labor market conditions, and demographic trends in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion, conducted electronically via Zoom, included presentations from experts, debates on policy implications, and considerations for legislative action. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and insights from the meeting:

---

### **Economic Recovery and Labor Market**
1. **Economic Overview**: Brian Rotbloch, an economist from the New Hampshire Employment Security, highlighted that the state’s economy had rebounded faster than expected in 2021, with significant job gains and GDP growth. However, challenges remained, particularly in reducing unemployment to pre-pandemic levels.
   
2. **Unemployment Rate**: The official unemployment rate was 3%, but when accounting for individuals receiving pandemic-related unemployment benefits, the rate was closer to 6%. This discrepancy underscored the incomplete picture of economic recovery.

3. **Labor Force Challenges**: The pandemic led to a significant exodus from the labor force, particularly among older workers and women, due to health concerns, childcare issues, and early retirement. Reintegrating these individuals into the workforce was identified as critical for sustained recovery.

4. **Job Market Trends**: While industries like manufacturing, technology, and professional services saw job growth, sectors such as hospitality, retail, and personal services faced substantial losses. The rise of remote work emerged as a defining trend, enabling some industries to thrive despite the pandemic.

5. **Small Business Impact**: Approximately 15-20% of small businesses remained closed, with rural areas potentially facing longer recovery timelines compared to urban centers. The federal definition of a small business (up to 500 employees) was criticized as misaligned with New Hampshire’s economy, where most businesses employ fewer than 50 people.

### **Demographic and Housing Trends**
1. **Remote Work and In-Migration**: The rise of remote work positioned New Hampshire as an attractive destination for remote workers, particularly those seeking affordable housing and quality of life. This trend was expected to boost in-migration and economic growth.

2. **Housing Market**: The state experienced a surge in housing demand, especially in rural areas, as remote workers relocated. This trend highlighted the need for addressing housing affordability and availability.

3. **Population Growth**: New Hampshire’s population growth relies heavily on in-migration, given its low birth rate. The state has seen an increasing trend of attracting younger individuals (25-29 years old), which could positively impact the labor force and economy.

### **Revenue and Taxation**
1. **Business Tax Revenues**: Business tax revenues fluctuated significantly, particularly after the 2018 federal tax reforms. While they declined during the pandemic, they rebounded strongly and surpassed pre-pandemic levels.

2. **PPP Loans**: Over $3.6 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans were issued to New Hampshire businesses, with the majority going to corporations, LLCs, and partnerships. The committee debated whether forgiven PPP loans should be treated as taxable revenue, considering the potential for double benefits to businesses.

3. **Non-Business Tax Revenues**: Non-business tax revenues grew modestly, with a notable spike around 2016. The committee reviewed the factors driving these changes and their implications for state finances.

4. **Tax Conformity**: Updates were provided on California’s decision to conform to federal tax exemption provisions for PPP loans, highlighting the financial impact and the need for clarity in aligning state policies with federal rules.

### **Policy and Legislative Considerations**
1. **Work Search Requirements**: The reinstatement of work search requirements for unemployment benefits, set to begin on May 23, 2021, was discussed as a measure to encourage re-employment and reduce reliance on pandemic-related assistance.

2. **Legislative Amendments**: The committee considered amendments to Senate Bill 3, focusing on preventing the double use of expenses for tax purposes. They also emphasized the need for data-driven decision-making and clarity in federal stimulus rules.

3. **Future Outlook**: Continued economic stimulus, infrastructure investment, and addressing housing affordability were identified as essential for supporting long-term growth. The committee planned to review several bills and amendments in upcoming work sessions to ensure informed policy decisions.
