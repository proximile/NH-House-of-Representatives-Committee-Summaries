He explained that the budget was balanced, with a surplus in the education trust fund and a slight deficit in the general fund, which could trigger a draw on the rainy day fund.

5. **Procedural Clarifications**: There were discussions about the process for incorporating amendments into the final bills and the committee’s authority to make policy changes, especially in light of overlapping issues with the Health and Human Services Committee.

6. **Adjournment**: The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, and the chair announced plans for a briefing the following week.
