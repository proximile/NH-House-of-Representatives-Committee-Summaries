### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Science, Technology, and Energy (April 19, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on April 19, 2021, to discuss key energy policies, focusing on renewable energy development, net metering, energy storage, and legislative updates. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 emergency, addressed several bills, including **Senate Bill 78 (SB 78)** and **Senate Bill 91 (SB 91)**, and explored the financial, regulatory, and market challenges facing renewable energy projects in the state.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

#### **1. Renewable Energy Development and Policy Stability**
   - **Policy Predictability**: Developers emphasized the need for consistent and predictable energy policies to secure financing for renewable energy projects. Fluctuating default service rates and net metering credits create uncertainty, complicating long-term revenue modeling.
   - **Revenue Streams**: Renewable energy projects rely on three primary revenue sources: energy sales, capacity payments, and renewable energy certificates (RECs). Net metering and group net metering are critical mechanisms for facilitating transactions, especially for small generators.
   - **Legislative Urgency**: The committee highlighted the need to pass **SB 91** to address gaps in current laws, particularly for distributed storage and generation projects under 5 megawatts. Bipartisan collaboration was urged to refine the bill and address stakeholder concerns.

#### **2. Net Metering and Community Solar**
   - **Net Metering**: Net metering allows customers to offset energy usage with renewable generation and receive credits for excess energy. **SB 91** aims to clarify and streamline net metering eligibility, particularly for low- to moderate-income community solar projects. The bill also seeks to "grandfather" the solar credit adder to provide financial certainty for developers.
   - **Hydroelectric Projects**: Part 2 of **SB 91** addresses net metering eligibility for hydroelectric facilities, such as those at **Monadnock Paper Mills**, which face unique interconnection challenges.
   - **Cross Subsidies**: Concerns were raised about cross subsidies in net metering, with large projects potentially overcompensated and smaller ones undercompensated. The committee debated whether to expand net metering caps or adopt a more market-based approach.

#### **3. Renewable Energy Fund (SB 78)**
   - **Funding Stability**: **SB 78** aims to reintroduce "continually appropriated" language to the Renewable Energy Fund, ensuring unused funds do not lapse at the end of the fiscal year. This change would provide stability for renewable energy projects, which currently face delays and disruptions due to funding lapses.
   - **Unused Funds**: Approximately **$2.5 million** remained unspent in the fund in the previous fiscal year, highlighting inefficiencies in the current system.

#### **4. Energy Storage and Modernization**
   - **Legislative Clarity**: Part 1 of **SB 91** focuses on energy storage, ensuring it is not treated as electricity generation for wholesale market purposes. The bill emphasizes consumer choice, property rights, and economic development in the energy storage sector.
   - **Grid Modernization**: High interconnection costs and outdated grid infrastructure were identified as significant barriers to renewable energy development. Developers need clearer information on grid hosting capacity to avoid excessive costs.

#### **5. Market Dynamics and Financial Mechanisms**
   - **Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)**: New Hampshire’s RPS goal of 25% renewable energy by 2025 lags behind neighboring states (e.g., Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont), which aim for 80-100%. This impacts NH’s attractiveness for renewable energy investment.
   - **RECs and ACPs**: REC values vary based on supply and demand, influenced by RPS. NH RECs are less valuable than those in other New England states. Alternative Compliance Payments (ACPs) act as a ceiling price for RECs, ensuring utilities never pay more than the set price.
   - **Penalties for Non-Performance**: ISO New England’s pay-for-performance system imposes financial penalties on generators that fail to meet capacity obligations during critical peak events.

#### **6. Economic and Regulatory Challenges**
   - **Soft Costs**: Renewable energy projects face high soft costs, such as permitting and labor, which hinder adoption. Over-regulation could further complicate project feasibility.
   - **Property Taxes and PILOTs**: Renewable energy projects often negotiate Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreements to manage property tax expenses, which can be a major cost.
   - **Policy Stability**: Frequent policy changes create uncertainty for long-term renewable energy investments. Grandfathering clauses can provide stability for projects built under existing policies.

#### **7. Environmental and Economic Benefits**
   - **Emissions Reduction**: Renewable energy is critical for reducing emissions in the heating, building, and electricity sectors. Maine’s inclusion of thermal energy in its RPS was highlighted as a potential model for New Hampshire.
   - **Utility Upgrades**: Large-scale renewable energy projects often require utility upgrades, which developers pay for, potentially benefiting ratepayers by reducing future costs.

### **Legislative Actions and Next Steps**
   - **SB 91**: The bill aims to promote renewable energy development, provide financial certainty for solar projects, and modernize New Hampshire’s energy laws to support local generation and storage. Stakeholders, including the **Granite State Hydropower Association** and **Sierra Club**, testified in support of parts of the bill.
   - **Work Sessions**: The committee planned to hold work sessions to further discuss **SB 78** and **SB 91**, with a focus on refining the legislation and addressing stakeholder concerns.
   - **Future Plans**: The committee considered scheduling a briefing on the proposed Department of Energy and continued discussions on renewable energy policies.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of renewable energy development in New Hampshire, highlighting the need for stable policies, grid modernization, and increased investment to achieve environmental and economic benefits. The discussions on **SB 78** and **SB 91** reflected a bipartisan effort to address regulatory gaps, provide financial certainty, and support the state’s transition to clean energy.
