**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee Meeting (April 21, 2021)**

On April 21, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee convened to discuss several bills related to family law and juvenile justice. The meeting focused on three key pieces of legislation: **Senate Bill 94 (SB 94)**, **Senate Bill 16 (SB 16)**, and **Senate Bill 93 (SB 93)**, as well as the broader implications of these bills for families and youth in New Hampshire. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s discussions and outcomes.

---

### **1. Senate Bill 94 (SB 94): Juvenile Diversion Programs**
**Purpose**: SB 94 proposes reforms to the juvenile justice system, emphasizing **diversion programs** and **voluntary strengths-and-needs assessments** for youth involved with law enforcement. The bill aims to reduce the number of youth entering the formal juvenile justice system by addressing underlying issues such as mental health, developmental disabilities, and adverse childhood experiences.

**Key Points**:
- **Voluntary Assessments**: Both the youth and their parents/guardians must consent to the assessment. If either party objects, the process cannot proceed, ensuring active family involvement in decision-making.
- **Law Enforcement Concerns**: Some law enforcement representatives expressed skepticism about diversion programs’ effectiveness and frustration with previous reforms implemented without their input. Proponents countered that SB 94 addresses these concerns by involving all stakeholders and focusing on a preventative, individualized approach.
- **Implementation Plan**: The bill will be rolled out in phases across different judicial circuits to allow for adjustments based on feedback and outcomes.
- **Support from Stakeholders**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Public Defender’s Office, the Office of the Child Advocate, and the Department of Health and Human Services testified in support, highlighting the bill’s potential to improve outcomes for youth and reduce recidivism.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to recommend SB 94 for placement on the **consent calendar**, reflecting broad support for the bill.

### **2. Senate Bill 16 (SB 16): Alimony Statute Amendment**
**Purpose**: SB 16 revises the formula for calculating alimony to align with recent changes in federal tax law, which eliminated the tax deductibility of alimony for payers and the taxability for recipients.

**Key Points**:
- **Testimony**:
  - **Grant Bosse** (Majority Policy Director for the NH Senate) introduced the bill on behalf of Senator Sharon Carson, explaining its goal to adjust the alimony formula to reflect tax law changes.
  - **Marilyn Mahoney** (Alimony Working Group) testified in support, noting that the bill reduces the alimony formula from 30% to 23% of the difference in gross incomes to maintain fairness. It also allows for modifications of alimony orders made after January 2019, with a deadline of July 1, 2022, for such requests.
- **Clarifications**: The bill ensures that judges can consider the impact of federal tax law when making alimony adjustments and allows for retroactive modifications to the date the other party received notice.
- **Outcome**: SB 16 was passed with a **unanimous vote** and placed on the consent calendar.

### **3. Senate Bill 93 (SB 93): Permanency Planning Under the Child Protection Act**
**Purpose**: SB 93 clarifies the permanency planning process for children in the child protection system, including the timing of permanency hearings and the circumstances under which extensions or early hearings may be granted.

**Key Points**:
- **Testimony**:
  - **Grant Bosse** introduced the bill, explaining that it emerged from a legislative study committee and the NH Model Court Project. The bill aims to provide clarity and flexibility in permanency planning.
  - **Rebecca Ross** (DCYF) supported the bill, emphasizing its potential to better meet the needs of children and families by providing clear guidance on permanency hearings.
  - **Marcia Sink** (CASA of NH) highlighted the importance of timely permanency for children, sharing a personal story of a mother who successfully reunified with her children after being given additional time.
  - **Suzelle Juarez** (UNH student) and **Moira O’Neil** (NH Child Advocate) spoke in support, underscoring the mental health impact of delays in permanency and the importance of maintaining relationships with biological family members.
- **Outcome**: SB 93 was passed **unanimously**, though it could not be placed on the consent calendar due to a fiscal note.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted a shift toward **preventative and individualized approaches** in both juvenile justice and family law. SB 94’s focus on diversion programs and voluntary assessments reflects a broader trend toward addressing the root causes of youth involvement with law enforcement rather than relying on punitive measures. Similarly, SB 16’s adjustments to alimony calculations and SB 93’s emphasis on timely permanency planning demonstrate a commitment to fairness and responsiveness in family law.

All three bills received strong support from stakeholders and committee members, with SB 16 and SB 94 being placed on the consent calendar and SB 93 passing unanimously despite a fiscal note. The discussions underscored the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, including law enforcement, advocacy groups, and state agencies, in crafting effective and equitable policies for children and families in New Hampshire.

The meeting concluded with a brief break before moving on to the next hearing.
