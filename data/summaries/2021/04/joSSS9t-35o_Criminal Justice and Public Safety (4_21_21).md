### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **Senate Bill 40 (SB 40): Consent to Search Motor Vehicles**
- **Purpose**: SB 40 standardizes the process for obtaining consent to search motor vehicles and aligns search warrant requirements with electronic warrant standards. It changes the language from "affidavit" to "written statement under oath."
- **Testimony**:
  - **Richard Head** (Judicial Branch) supported the bill, emphasizing its alignment with Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) standards.
  - **Chief David Goldstein** (Franklin Police) suggested adding "solely" to clarify that refusal to consent cannot be the sole reason for detention.
  - **Captain Joseph Ebert** (NH State Police) recommended allowing vehicle operators to re-engage if they change their mind about consenting.
  - **Devin Chafee** (ACLU of NH) opposed adding "solely," arguing it could undermine case law protections.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill clarifies that refusal to consent to a search cannot be used as a basis for further detention.
  - Concerns were raised about unintended consequences of ambiguous language and the need to balance law enforcement needs with individual rights.

#### **Senate Bill 60 (SB 60): Open Container Law for Cannabis**
- **Purpose**: SB 60 regulates the transportation of open cannabis containers in vehicles, similar to alcohol open container laws, to prevent impaired driving.
- **Testimony**:
  - Supporters, including **Senator Sherman** and **Chief Andrew Siguri**, emphasized public safety and the rise in marijuana-related impaired driving.
  - Critics, particularly advocates for therapeutic cannabis patients, argued the bill unfairly targets medical users. They highlighted challenges in storing cannabis in inaccessible areas like trunks, which could damage the product.
  - Concerns were also raised about the bill’s potential impact on hemp and CBD products.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill requires unsealed cannabis containers to be stored in the trunk or an inaccessible area, with a $150 fine for violations.
  - Amendments were proposed to exempt therapeutic cannabis patients and caregivers from the law.
  - Discussions highlighted the delayed effects of edibles and the difficulty of enforcing cannabis impairment compared to alcohol.

#### **Senate Bill 92 (SB 92): Bail Reform and Pretrial Detention**
- **Purpose**: SB 92 aims to address concerns about dangerous individuals being released on personal recognizance (PR) bail, particularly in cases involving violent crimes.
- **Testimony**:
  - Law enforcement officials, including police chiefs, supported the bill, citing cases where individuals released on PR bail reoffended, often violently.
  - Critics, including the **ACLU** and **Americans for Prosperity**, argued the bill undermines due process, disproportionately affects vulnerable communities, and increases pretrial detention without sufficient data to justify the changes.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill requires a judge’s review within 72 hours (or sooner) for individuals charged with violent crimes before PR bail is granted.
  - Opponents emphasized the need for better education for bail commissioners and improved data systems rather than legislative changes.
  - Supporters argued the bill is a “surgical approach” to protect victims and ensure public safety.

#### **Senate Bill 110 (SB 110): Rescuing Animals from Vehicles**
- **Purpose**: SB 110 allows individuals to rescue animals left in distress in vehicles under extreme temperatures, provided they follow specific protocols and have law enforcement authorization.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Senator Tom Sherman** introduced the bill, inspired by **Olivia Hammer**, a 17-year-old advocate who highlighted the dangers of heatstroke for animals in vehicles.
  - Law enforcement supported the bill, as it provides a controlled process for intervention rather than allowing individuals to act independently.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill requires a witness to be present and remain until law enforcement arrives to ensure accountability.
  - It balances animal welfare, public safety, and property rights while minimizing liability for individuals and law enforcement.

#### **Senate Bill 122 (SB 122): Omnibus Criminal Justice and Public Safety Bill**
- **Purpose**: SB 122 consolidates multiple legislative proposals, including provisions related to crimes, judicial processes, human trafficking, service animals, and guardianship for minors.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Sarah Aiken** (Autism Council) supported a technical amendment updating membership requirements.
  - **Pamela Kyleck** (NH Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence) supported provisions addressing trafficking victims and immunity for reporting crimes.
  - **Ryan Donnelly** (Granite State Independent Living) advocated for enhanced penalties for harming service animals.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill includes sections on speeding up license reinstatement for DWI offenders, exemptions for trafficking victims, and guardianship for minors.
  - Concerns were raised about potential duplication with other legislation and the practicality of certain provisions, such as open container laws for medical marijuana.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Public Safety vs. Individual Rights**: The discussions reflected a tension between ensuring public safety and protecting individual rights, particularly in the context of bail reform (SB 92) and therapeutic cannabis use (SB 60).

3. **Amendments and Clarifications**: Multiple amendments were proposed across the bills to address unintended consequences, particularly for therapeutic cannabis patients and hemp/CBD users.
4. **Collaboration and Stakeholder Involvement**: The committee emphasized the need for collaboration on amendments and thorough vetting of legislation to ensure clarity and fairness.
