**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Judiciary (4/20/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 20, 2021, focused on a range of legislative bills, primarily addressing juvenile justice reform, judicial efficiency, and other key issues. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Juvenile Justice Reform**
1. **Appointment of Counsel**: 
   - Extensive discussions emphasized the need for earlier appointment of legal counsel for juveniles in delinquency proceedings. This includes ensuring access to counsel during interrogations and requiring that waivers of counsel are only valid after consulting with a lawyer.
   - **House Bill 188 and Senate Bill 143**: These bills were discussed in detail, with testimony supporting effective representation for juveniles. Concerns were raised about expanding the right to counsel in civil proceedings, prompting discussions on refining the language to address these issues.
   - **National Juvenile Defender Center Recommendations**: Testimony highlighted the importance of implementing recommendations from the National Juvenile Defender Center, including better performance standards for juvenile defenders and eliminating council fees to reduce financial burdens on families.

### **Judicial Efficiency**
1. **Referees in Probate Court**: 
   - The bill proposes allowing referees (retired judges over 70) to issue orders in uncontested probate matters, such as wills, administration, and name changes. This aims to improve efficiency while maintaining oversight by active judges. Concerns were raised about the competency of retired judges and the need for continuing education.
2. **Termination of Parental Rights**: 
   - The bill seeks to remove the exclusive jurisdiction of probate courts over termination of parental rights cases, allowing family courts to handle these cases as well.
3. **Supreme Court Justices Sitting in Lower Courts**: 
   - The bill clarifies that Supreme Court justices can sit temporarily in circuit courts, with provisions for recusal if a case they handled is appealed.

### **Police Disciplinary Hearings**
1. **Senate Bill 41**: 
   - Introduced by Senator French, this bill aims to make police decertification hearings public, similar to disciplinary hearings for judges and lawyers. Attorney Jill Bissonnette from the ACLU of New Hampshire testified in support, highlighting the lack of transparency in current processes. She suggested retaining Senate Bill 41 and using House Bill 471 as the primary vehicle for addressing the issue due to cleaner language.

### **National Guard Enlistment Recruiting Plan**
1. **Senate Bill 143, Part 12**: 
   - The bill proposes repealing the National Guard scholarship program and replacing it with an enlistment incentive program. Major General David Mikolaities testified on the challenges of recruitment and retention in the National Guard. The State Veterans Advisory Committee supported this section, which involves creating a new fund for enlistment recruiting, replacing an older underutilized fund.

### **Other Key Provisions**
1. **Cybersecurity Incident Reporting**: 
   - Part 8 of Senate Bill 143, introduced by Senator Rosenwald, requires political subdivisions to report cybersecurity incidents to the NH Cybersecurity Integration Center and suggests cybersecurity standards.
2. **EMS Data Sharing**: 
   - The bill expands the ability to share EMS data for research and analysis, aiding in emergency response and public health initiatives.
3. **Overpayment Recovery for Public Assistance**: 
   - The bill allows the Department of Health and Human Services to recover overpayments directly from recipients, rather than adjusting future benefits.
4. **Insurance Licensing Statutes**: 
   - Part 11 of Senate Bill 143, introduced by Senator Daniels, updates insurance licensing statutes to align with national standards and allows the Department of Revenue to share information with the Insurance Department to ensure proper premium tax collection.

### **Legal Representation and Fees**
1. **Attorney Fees for Juvenile Cases**: 
   - There was a debate on the structure of attorney fees, with some advocating for hourly rates to ensure adequate representation, while others discussed phased compensation models.
2. **Indigent Legal Services Costs**: 
   - The bill clarifies that costs for indigent legal services, including investigative and expert fees, are paid through the Judicial Council, not the judicial branch.

### **Mediation and Arbitration Quality Assurance**
1. **Office of Mediation and Arbitration**: 
   - The bill allows the Office of Mediation and Arbitration to establish a quality assurance program, permitting limited confidentiality waivers for complaint investigations.

### **Questions and Clarifications**
- Committee members raised questions on various parts of the bills, including fiscal implications, retention of recruits, and definitions of terms like "foreign insurance companies." Testifiers provided detailed responses to clarify the intent and mechanics of the proposed legislation.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to continue hearings in subsequent weeks, ensuring thorough review and timely passage of the bills. Overall, the discussions focused on improving the juvenile justice system, enhancing judicial efficiency, increasing transparency in police disciplinary hearings, and addressing concerns related to legal representation, cybersecurity, and public assistance.
