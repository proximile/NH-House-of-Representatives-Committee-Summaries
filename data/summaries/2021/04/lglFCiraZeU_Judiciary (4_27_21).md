**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (April 27, 2021): Senate Bill 134**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on April 27, 2021, to discuss **Senate Bill 134**, an omnibus bill addressing a wide range of legal, administrative, and public safety issues. The meeting, held electronically due to COVID-19, featured testimony from stakeholders, legislators, and experts, with a focus on refining and modernizing state laws. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and provisions:

---

### **1. Mental Health Training for Law Enforcement (Section 9)**
- **Ken Norton** (NAMI New Hampshire) and **Chief David Goldstein** (Franklin Police Chief) testified in support of funding for **Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training**, a 40-hour program teaching de-escalation strategies, mental health awareness, and officer wellness. The training, currently supported by a federal grant set to expire, is in high demand. The bill appropriates **$210,000** to ensure consistent availability across the state. Legislators emphasized the importance of this training in reducing lethal force incidents and improving responses to mental health crises.

---

### **2. Remote Notarization and Probate Simplification (Sections 2 & 7)**
- Attorneys **Virginia Sheehan** and **Robert Wells** advocated for making **remote notarization** of estate planning documents permanent, citing its effectiveness during the pandemic. They also supported simplifying **probate administration** to save time and costs for citizens and the courts. **Attorney Hillman** highlighted the expansion of the **waiver of administration process**, which would streamline uncontested estates. The bill also updates the **Uniform Power of Attorney Act** and the **Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act**.

---

### **3. Structured Settlement Protection Act (Section 5)**
- **Brian Dear** (National Association of Settlement Purchasers) testified in favor of creating a **New Hampshire-specific Structured Settlement Protection Act**, aligning the state with others to ensure consumer protections and a uniform legal framework for structured settlement transactions.

---

### **4. Employer Access to Motor Vehicle Records (Section 10)**
- **John Diana** (Samba Safety) supported allowing employers **electronic access to motor vehicle records** to verify driver qualifications more efficiently. This provision aims to improve road safety by addressing the current impractical and costly notarization requirement.

---

### **5. Civil Liability for Highway Damage (Section 4)**
- **Zachary Toll** (NH Attorney General’s Office) and the **Department of Transportation** discussed amendments to **RSA 236:39**, clarifying strict liability for damages caused to highways, guardrails, and signage. The amendments allow the state to pursue claims based on **estimated damages**, addressing inefficiencies in the current process. Legislators debated the retroactive application of these changes and their alignment with other states' laws.

---

### **6. Collaborative Law Act (Section 6)**
- **Attorney Anna Goulet Zimmerman** advocated for codifying **collaborative law** in New Hampshire, a voluntary dispute resolution process for family law matters. This process involves attorneys, mental health professionals, and financial planners to reduce litigation and conflict.

---

### **7. Laser Pointer Regulations**
- **BAE Systems** testified in support of amending a 2016 law that prohibits the use of laser pointers at aircraft and law enforcement. The current law unintentionally criminalizes legitimate uses in research, development, and consumer electronics. The proposed amendment adds exceptions for lawful uses while maintaining prohibitions on malicious use. The amendment also updates **RSA 422** to address the use of drones with laser pointers. Concerns were raised about potential impacts on free speech and protests.

---

### **8. Suspended Sentences and Rehabilitation**
- The bill allows inmates to petition for **suspended sentences 12 months before their two-thirds date**, enabling earlier participation in re-entry programs. Legislators emphasized the importance of this provision in facilitating rehabilitation and reducing recidivism.

---

### **9. School Employee Background Checks**
- **Diana Fenton** (Department of Education attorney) discussed provisions mandating **criminal background checks** for teachers and volunteers. A study committee was proposed to explore extending these requirements to private schools, with a focus on child safety.

---

### **10. Industrial Hemp Cultivation**
- The bill updates laws to allow **industrial hemp cultivation** under federal guidelines, aligning New Hampshire statutes with federal regulations.

---

### **11. Electronic Signatures and Notarization**
- While there was broad support for **remote online notarization**, opposition was voiced against mandating the acceptance of **electronic signatures** by registries of deeds, citing concerns about fraud and accountability.

---

### **12. General Discussions and Next Steps**
- Legislators asked clarifying questions on various topics, including the cost of highway repairs, insurance coverage for damages, and the frequency of mental health training for officers. Amendments were discussed and will be forwarded to the committee for deliberation. The committee planned to hear from additional stakeholders and address amendments in subsequent sessions.

---

### **Key Themes**
- **Public Safety**: Provisions on mental health training, laser devices, and employer access to vehicle records aimed to enhance safety.
