**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Meeting (4/21/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 21, 2021, to discuss several education-related bills: **Senate Bill 44 (SB 44)**, **Senate Bill 147 (SB 147)**, and **Senate Bill 148 (SB 148)**. The meeting focused on workforce development, financial aid, transportation, special education, Career and Technical Education (CTE), emergency preparedness for student-athletes, and outdoor education. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Senate Bill 44: Workforce Pathway Program**
- **Purpose**: SB 44 establishes a workforce pathway program within New Hampshire’s community college system to provide short-term training (6 months or less) for unemployed, underemployed, and dislocated workers, particularly those impacted by COVID-19.
- **Support**: Chancellor Susan Huard and other stakeholders highlighted the program’s alignment with successful models in states like Virginia and Utah. The Business and Industry Association (BIA) and the New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association emphasized the urgent need for workforce training in sectors like manufacturing and healthcare.
- **Concerns**: Anne-Marie Banfield raised issues about the program’s focus on employer needs over student interests, potential privacy concerns with competency sharing, and the lack of long-term funding clarity.
- **Funding**: The program will leverage existing funding sources, including the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and Pell Grants, with potential for federal grant support.

### **Senate Bill 147: Omnibus Education Legislation**
- **FAFSA Completion (Part 1)**: The bill proposes requiring high school students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as a graduation requirement, with waivers for families opting out. Stakeholders emphasized the decline in FAFSA completion rates and the need to increase access to financial aid for post-secondary education.
- **Transportation for School Activities (Part 3)**: The bill addresses the use of motor coaches (e.g., Concord Trailways) for long-distance school trips, which is currently illegal in New Hampshire. School administrators argued that motor coaches are more practical for trips over 75 miles but raised concerns about driver certification and safety standards.
- **Special Education Costs (Part 4)**: Senator Jeb Bradley introduced a provision to provide $250,000 in state aid to small communities (under 1,000 residents) to offset special education costs. Questions arose about how this would apply to cooperative school districts, which receive funding as a whole rather than individual towns.
- **Testimonies**: Stakeholders, including Joe Atchison (Neef Network) and Joel Carstens (UNH Financial Aid), supported the FAFSA requirement, while school administrators like Tim Brewer (Keene School District) and Peter Curro (Londonderry School District) advocated for motor coach use.

### **Senate Bill 148: Omnibus Education Legislation**
- **CTE Programs (Part 2)**: The bill updates CTE programs to align with the Perkins Act, includes private and homeschool students, and addresses transportation and tuition funding challenges. It also proposes adding a high school counselor to the CTE Advisory Council.
- **Emergency Plans for Sports (Part 3)**: The bill updates emergency response plans for sports-related injuries, requiring schools to integrate these plans into their overall emergency protocols. Provisions include AED access, weather policies, and heat acclimatization. The effective date was moved to September 1, 2022, to allow time for implementation.
- **Vocational Rehabilitation (Part 1)**: Updates to administrative rules were discussed, including the repeal of outdated programs to align with current practices.
- **Post-Secondary Career Schools (Part 4)**: The bill proposes exemptions for small yoga teacher training programs (under $100,000 in annual income) from licensure requirements, citing their focus on personal growth rather than career preparation. Larger programs would require surety bonds for consumer protection.
- **Outdoor Education (Part 5)**: The bill emphasizes the economic and educational benefits of outdoor education, aligning with New Hampshire’s growing outdoor recreation sector. It encourages collaboration between schools and the community college system to prepare students for careers in fields like forestry, marine science, and outdoor recreation.
