### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (March 31, 2021)  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on March 31, 2021, to discuss the **American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)** of 2021, a $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package signed by President Biden on March 11, 2021. The meeting, held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on the allocation, eligible uses, and challenges associated with ARPA funds. Emily Brock, Director of the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), provided detailed insights into the funding distribution and guidelines. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed:

---

#### **1. Funding Distribution and Certification**
- ARPA allocates $350 billion to states and local governments, with $195 billion for states and $130.4 billion for cities and counties.  
- States must certify their use of funds with the U.S. Treasury within 60 days of enactment, with payments expected within that timeframe.  
- Smaller jurisdictions (populations under 50,000) will receive funds through the state, with restrictions ensuring distributions do not exceed 75% of the jurisdiction’s most recent budget.  

---

#### **2. Eligible Uses of ARPA Funds**
- **Public Health Emergency Response**: Funds can be used for COVID-19-related expenses, including mitigating negative economic impacts.  
- **Premium Pay for Essential Workers**: Up to $13/hour additional pay, capped at $25,000 per worker annually. Local governments have the authority to determine who qualifies as essential workers within their jurisdictions.  
- **Revenue Replacement**: States and local governments can claim lost revenue due to the pandemic and use funds to replenish government services. Specific sectors like hospitality, tourism, and meals and rooms taxes were highlighted as areas needing revenue replenishment.  
- **Infrastructure Investments**: Funds can be used for critical projects such as water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure. Specific projects like water interconnect systems and broadband development were discussed as potential eligible uses.  
- **Nursing Homes and Healthcare Facilities**: Renovations and improvements to nursing homes and healthcare facilities were explored as eligible uses, provided they align with ARPA’s guidelines.

#### **3. Challenges and Ambiguities**
- **Lack of Clear Guidance**: Representatives expressed significant concern about the lack of detailed guidance from the U.S. Treasury on eligible uses of ARPA funds. Specific areas of ambiguity included:  
  - Defining "negative economic impacts" and retroactive claims for revenue losses.  
  - Determining eligibility for premium pay and whether losses in specific areas (e.g., municipal zoos) can be claimed.  
  - Clarifying how to compare revenue loss and ensure eligible expenditures for 2023 and covered periods.  
- **Restrictions**: ARPA funds cannot be used to offset tax reductions, delay tax increases, or be deposited into pension funds. All funds must be spent by December 31, 2024.  

---

#### **4. Coordination and Communication**
- Representatives emphasized the need for better communication and coordination between state and local governments to ensure ARPA funds are used effectively.  
- Clarity on how revenue losses in specific areas (e.g., meals and rooms taxes) could be replenished was identified as a priority.  

---

#### **5. Next Steps**
- **Seeking Clarity**: The Treasury is expected to provide further guidance on eligible uses and distribution timelines. Representatives committed to seeking additional clarity to help local governments plan effectively.  
- **Certification and Compliance**: States and local governments are preparing to certify their use of funds and ensure compliance with ARPA’s restrictions.

#### **Overall Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the complexity of ARPA’s provisions and the urgent need for clear guidance to help states and local governments navigate the funding process effectively. Key priorities include addressing revenue losses, supporting essential workers, investing in critical infrastructure, and ensuring coordination between state and local entities. The discussions highlighted both the challenges and opportunities associated with ARPA funds, with a strong focus on leveraging these resources to support pandemic recovery and long-term infrastructure improvements in New Hampshire.
