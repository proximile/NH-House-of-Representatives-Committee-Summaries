The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 27, 2021, focused on discussions related to several bills addressing commerce and consumer affairs, particularly in the insurance and alcohol industries. The meeting centered on **Senate Bill 124**, **Senate Bill 125**, and **Senate Bill 138**, with detailed debates on their provisions, potential impacts, and stakeholder perspectives. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **Insurance Regulations (Senate Bill 124)**  
1. **Travel Insurance**:  
   - The bill establishes a regulatory framework for travel insurance, including consumer disclosures and sales practices.  
   - It prohibits opt-out sales and ensures fair marketplace practices, modeled after the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) standards.  
   - Supported by the Department of Insurance, it has been adopted in 11 states and aims to benefit consumers and regulators.  

2. **Self-Storage Insurance**:  
   - Allows self-storage facilities to sell limited property insurance (capped at $10,000) to renters, covering loss or damage to stored items.  
   - Employees work under the license of a licensed insurance agent, ensuring oversight and training.  
   - The bill, modeled after legislation in 40 states, aims to provide convenience and consumer choice while maintaining strong consumer protections.  

3. **Medicare Supplemental Insurance**:  
   - Addresses the issue of disabled individuals under 65 who continue to pay higher premiums after turning 65.  
   - Mandates that issuers switch to lower premium rates once the individual turns 65, preventing overcharging.  

4. **Domestic Insurance Company Investments**:  
   - Allows domestic insurance companies to engage in replication transactions (combinations of bonds and derivatives).  
   - Aligns New Hampshire with regulations in 30 other states, providing more investment flexibility.

### **Alcohol Regulations (Senate Bill 125)**  
1. **Craft Beer Industry Reforms**:  
   - **Satellite Locations**: Allows breweries to establish retail outlets separate from their main manufacturing sites. Concerns were raised about the lack of a limit on the number of locations, potentially creating competition with full-service restaurants.  
   - **Direct Shipping**: Permits in-state breweries to ship directly to consumers, a practice currently allowed only for out-of-state breweries.  
   - **Contract Brewing**: Removes restrictions on contract brewing, enabling smaller breweries to outsource production to meet demand.  
   - **Sales Limits**: Eliminates the current one-case-or-keg-per-person-per-day limit for off-premise sales, which was seen as confusing and restrictive.  

2. **Support and Economic Benefits**:  
   - Supported by the New Hampshire Brewers Association and individual breweries, the bill aims to help local businesses compete with out-of-state entities, grow operations, and increase tax revenue and job creation.  

3. **Concerns and Opposition**:  
   - **Three-Tier System**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Grocers Association and New Futures, argued that the bill could undermine the three-tier system (manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer), which ensures consumer safety and fair competition.  
   - **Unintended Consequences**: Concerns were raised about potential harm to small businesses, particularly restaurants and retailers, due to unlimited satellite locations or direct shipping.  
   - **Regulatory Clarity**: Stakeholders called for clearer language in the bill to address ambiguities, such as the number of satellite locations allowed and the requirement for satellite facilities to produce beer on-site.  

4. **Amendments and Next Steps**:  
   - The committee acknowledged the need for amendments to address concerns, particularly around satellite locations and the three-tier system. A hearing on proposed amendments was scheduled for the following week.

### **Investment Metals and Gems (Senate Bill 138)**  
1. **Purpose and Key Changes**:  
   - Addresses challenges faced by New Hampshire residents trading in investment metals (e.g., gold, silver, platinum) and gems.  
   - Reduces the physical delivery window from 20 days to 7 days and allows storage in depositories outside New Hampshire, aligning with practices in 45 other states.  
   - Maintains strong consumer protections while enabling residents to participate in these markets more efficiently.  

2. **Support and Discussion**:  
   - Received unanimous support in the Senate (24-0) and was backed by Barry Glennon of the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation.  
   - Senator David Waters, the prime sponsor, explained the bill’s intent and addressed questions about consumer protection and alignment with uniform securities laws.

### **Key Themes and Conclusion**  
- **Modernization and Alignment**: All three bills aim to modernize New Hampshire’s laws to reflect current market practices and consumer needs, aligning the state with regulations in other jurisdictions.  
- **Consumer Protection**: Emphasis was placed on balancing consumer protection with convenience and market participation.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: The discussions highlighted the importance of addressing concerns from various stakeholders, including industry representatives, regulatory bodies, and advocacy groups.  
- **Amendments and Next Steps**: The committee acknowledged the need for amendments to address ambiguities and unintended consequences, with plans to continue discussions before finalizing the bills.  

Overall, the meeting underscored the tension between fostering innovation and economic development in the insurance and alcohol industries while maintaining regulatory safeguards and protecting existing systems like the three-tier alcohol distribution model.
