The New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Committee held a meeting on May 20, 2021, to discuss and amend two key bills: **Senate Bill 142** and **Senate Bill 100**. Due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the meeting was conducted virtually via Zoom, with public access provided through the platform or telephone. The discussions centered on amendments, procedural challenges, and balancing public input with legislative priorities.

### **Senate Bill 142: Addressing Study Commissions**
The committee focused on **Senate Bill 142**, which pertains to various study commissions. Key points included:
1. **Limited Options**: Members acknowledged that their options were limited but noted that none were inherently bad, and no actions would close doors unless the entire bill was altered.
2. **Motion to Pass**: A motion to pass the bill was supported, with members urging approval given procedural and institutional challenges.
3. **Amendment Proposals**: Representative Green proposed **Amendment 2021 d575**, which sought to remove sections related to workplace safety for medical professionals and workforce housing. The amendment aimed to reestablish a commission to study grand families, with minor changes to membership and reporting dates.
4. **Debate on Amendments**: Members debated the merits of the amendment. Some argued that removing sections on PTSD for First Responders and workforce housing would harm important initiatives, while others supported the amendment to address unfunded mandate concerns and ensure issues were handled by the correct committees.
5. **Public Input and Support**: Representative Smith highlighted that the sections being removed, particularly the PTSD section for First Responders, were the only parts of the bill that received public support.
6. **Compromise and New Amendment**: After extensive debate, members agreed to draft **Amendment 2021 d612 H**, which restored the PTSD section while addressing unfunded mandate concerns, ensuring both the grand families and PTSD commissions remained in the bill.
7. **Voting and Passage**: The new amendment passed unanimously (14-0), and the amended bill also passed with a vote of 14-0. Both were moved to the consent calendar.
8. **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to prepare committee reports for the amended bills and set the next meeting for Monday if necessary, though it was ultimately deemed unnecessary.

### **Senate Bill 100: Omnibus Bill on Commissions and Committees**
The committee also discussed **Senate Bill 100**, an omnibus bill addressing various commissions and committees. Key points included:
1. **Amendment 2021-1554H**: The committee reviewed this amendment, which proposed:
   - Changing the membership of certain committees, including adding members from the Senate and House Ways and Means and Finance Committees.
   - Removing sections related to workplace safety in healthcare settings, payments in lieu of taxes, education costs for children in residential facilities, and the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns.
2. **Debate on Amendment 1554H**:
   - Representative Smith opposed removing the healthcare workplace safety section, citing unanimous public support and suggesting it be reintroduced in a separate bill.
   - Representative Green supported the amendment, arguing that removing certain sections would allow them to be addressed more appropriately in future legislation.
   - Members discussed the challenges of omnibus legislation, which combines unrelated topics, and the difficulty of adequately addressing each issue in a single bill.
3. **Vote on Amendment 1554H**: The amendment passed with an 8-6 vote, removing the specified sections from the bill.
4. **Discussion on Ought to Pass as Amended**: Some members expressed concern about removing the healthcare workplace safety section but supported passing the amended bill to avoid killing the entire bill, which had bipartisan Senate support. Removed sections could be reintroduced as standalone bills or addressed in committee of conference.
5. **Procedural Issues**: The committee considered drafting a further amendment to reinstate the healthcare workplace safety section but decided against it due to time constraints. The issue could be revisited in committee of conference or in the next legislative session.
6. **Final Decision**: The committee moved forward with the **ought to pass as amended** motion for Senate Bill 100, acknowledging that the bill would likely go to committee of conference for further negotiation.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of legislative administration, particularly the challenges of balancing public input, procedural correctness, and diverse priorities. The committee demonstrated a commitment to compromise, as seen in the unanimous passage of the amended **Senate Bill 142**, and the careful consideration of **Senate Bill 100**, which underscored the difficulties of omnibus legislation. Both bills reflected the committeeâ€™s efforts to address critical issues while navigating institutional constraints and public expectations.
