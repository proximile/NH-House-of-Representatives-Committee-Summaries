**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (May 4, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened electronically on May 4, 2021, to discuss a range of legislative bills and amendments, focusing on charitable organizations, gaming regulations, tax policies, and disaster response. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to refine legislation to ensure fairness, reduce bureaucratic burdens, and address stakeholder concerns. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Charitable Organizations and 501(c) Codes**
The committee debated the classification and regulation of charitable organizations under various 501(c) codes. Key concerns included ensuring that funds are used appropriately and not diverted for lobbying or political purposes. Representatives questioned whether all 501(c) organizations, particularly those benefiting internal members rather than the public, should qualify for charitable gaming funds. **Representative Hackett** provided a detailed breakdown of IRS 501(c) subsections, emphasizing the need to ensure public benefit from gaming revenues.

### **2. Bingo and Charitable Gaming Regulations**
Several bills related to charitable gaming were discussed:
- **Senate Bill 139 (SB139)**: Proposed changes to bingo date regulations, with concerns raised about the potential impact on charities. The committee considered whether to remove date restrictions altogether or find a compromise to ensure equitable opportunities for all organizations.
- **Senate Bill 112 (SB112)**: The committee discussed reconciling this Senate version of a charitable gaming bill with the House version (**HB565**). Debates centered on the composition of a proposed study committee, with the Senate favoring specificity in appointments and the House preferring flexibility.
- **Senate Bill 22-FN**: Focused on the sale of Lucky Seven tickets, the bill sparked discussions about requiring organizations to offer 25-cent tickets alongside $1 tickets. **Tyler Clark**, representing Diamond Distributors, opposed the mandate, arguing that 25-cent tickets are unpopular. Concerns were also raised about the transition of Lucky Seven machines from dispensing physical tickets to displaying results electronically, which could increase the speed of play and resemble semi-slot machines.
- **Senate Bill 27**: Included an amendment proposed by **Representative Abrami** to allow exceptions for certain charities that do not meet all technical requirements for gaming licenses. **John Conforti** of the New Hampshire Lottery and **Lisa Allen** of FeedNH.org testified in support of the amendment, emphasizing the need to include bona fide charities that may not meet all legal criteria.

### **3. Business Profits Tax Threshold**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 101 (SB101)**, which proposes increasing the minimum gross business income required for filing a business profits tax return from $75,000 to $100,000. Representatives debated the fiscal impact on small businesses and considered an amendment to adjust the threshold based on inflation, ensuring it remains fair and relevant over time.

### **4. Disaster Response and Business Licensing**
**Senate Bill 103 (SB103)**, addressing out-of-state businesses performing disaster-related work in New Hampshire, was reviewed. The committee questioned the practicality of requiring businesses to provide a written statement "upon request" by the Secretary of State, expressing concerns about enforcement and clarity in the language.

---

### **5. PPP Loan Forgiveness and Tax Implications**
The committee focused on **Senate Bill 3 (SB3)**, which deals with the tax treatment of forgiven Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. An amendment was proposed to exclude forgiven PPP loans from taxable income but **not allow deductions for expenses paid with PPP funds**. Concerns were raised about the bill’s potential to benefit larger, more profitable businesses rather than struggling small businesses. The fiscal impact of SB3 was estimated at **$99 million**, assuming all PPP loans are forgiven. Testimony from CPAs and tax experts was scheduled for further analysis.

### **6. General Discussions and Broader Implications**
The meeting included broader discussions on the complexities of tax codes, the need for periodic reviews of charitable gaming regulations, and the challenges of balancing regulatory requirements with the needs of businesses and charities. Representatives emphasized the importance of ensuring that funds raised through gaming remain within the state for charitable purposes and that regulatory changes do not inadvertently harm small businesses or charitable organizations.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to revisit the discussed bills in subsequent meetings, with members encouraged to submit amendments for review. Additional information was requested, including a list of organizations under various 501(c) categories and clarification on the statutory authority for displaying gaming results on video monitors. The committee aimed to finalize its work within the legislative deadline, ensuring that the bills effectively address stakeholder concerns while minimizing unintended consequences.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to refining legislation that supports charitable organizations, small businesses, and disaster response efforts while addressing concerns about regulatory fairness, fiscal responsibility, and the integrity of charitable gaming. Through detailed discussions and proposed amendments, the committee sought to balance the needs of diverse stakeholders with the broader public interest.
