### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Resources, Recreation, and Development (May 19, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting of the Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee on May 19, 2021, addressed a range of critical issues related to environmental protection, public health, and legislative processes. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone. The discussions were organized into two main segments, focusing on invasive species, legislative amendments, PFAS remediation, and an omnibus bill addressing solid waste, zoonotic diseases, and derelict fishing gear.

#### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Invasive Species and Property Rights**:
   - The committee emphasized the need to address invasive species, such as zebra mussels, which pose significant threats to water systems. Collaboration with federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Agriculture, was highlighted as essential for managing these threats while respecting property rights.

2. **Legislative Amendments**:
   - **House Bill 397**: The bill, concerning shoreline protection fees, was amended by the Senate to include additional provisions for the Piscataqua Development Authority. The committee agreed to concur with the Senate’s changes.
   - **House Bill 99**: This bill, related to seasonal platforms on public waters, was amended by the Senate to clarify rules for installation and ownership. The committee also concurred with these changes.
   - **House Bill 235**: Addressing groundwater withdrawals and PFAS remediation, the Senate’s version of the bill excluded private well owners from accessing remediation funds. The committee decided to non-concur and requested a committee of conference to address this issue, emphasizing the importance of providing redress for homeowners with contaminated private wells.

3. **PFAS Remediation Fund**:
   - Members discussed the necessity of including private well owners in the PFAS remediation fund, as many affected individuals rely on private wells for drinking water. The committee underscored the importance of ensuring these homeowners receive the necessary support after years of living with contaminated water.

4. **Retained Bills**:
   - The committee acknowledged the need to discuss retained bills in future sessions but noted that formal action on these bills could not occur until November.

5. **Senate Bill 146 (Omnibus Bill)**:
   - **Amendments to SB 146**:
     - **Part 2** (solid waste disposal) was removed and added to House Bill 413 under the Environment and Agriculture Committee’s purview.
     - **Part 3** (zoonotic disease prevention) was revised, changing "emergency order" to "executive order" to avoid confusion given the ongoing state of emergency.
     - **Part 5** (derelict fishing gear fund) underwent significant changes, including renaming the fund and removing shrimp from the surcharge due to the shutdown of the New England shrimp fishery.
     - **House Bill 3235** (water user impacts) was added as **Part 7** to ensure its inclusion in case of legislative negotiations.
   - **Discussion on Zoonotic Disease Prevention**:
     - Some representatives expressed concerns about the enforceability and practicality of the zoonotic disease prevention section, citing logistical and financial challenges.
     - Fish and Game representatives testified in favor of the provision, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to address disease transmission between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.
   - **General Legislative Process**:
     - The committee discussed the balance between providing general direction in statutes and allowing agencies to develop specific rules, enabling them to adapt to changing circumstances without requiring legislative action.
     - Public hearings on rulemaking provide opportunities for input from stakeholders and legislators.
   - **Roll Call and Voting**:
     - The committee conducted a roll call to confirm attendance and proceeded with discussions on the bill and amendments.
     - A motion was made to recommend that SB 146 "ought to pass as amended," with further discussion on the specifics of the amendments.

#### Overall Focus and Outcomes:
The meeting focused on balancing environmental protection, property rights, and public health, with particular attention to addressing PFAS contamination and invasive species. The committee worked to reconcile differences between House and Senate versions of key bills, particularly regarding access to remediation funds for private well owners. The discussion on SB 146 highlighted the importance of proactive legislation to address emerging issues like zoonotic diseases and environmental management. The committee’s efforts aimed to refine legislative proposals to ensure they align with agency capabilities and legislative intent, providing effective solutions to pressing environmental and public health challenges.
