### **6. Senate Bill 26: Woodsville Fire District Funding and Road Maintenance**
The majority of the meeting focused on **Senate Bill 26**, which addresses the funding and maintenance of roads within the Woodsville Fire District, a precinct within the town of Haverhill. The bill sparked significant debate due to its implications for local control, financial responsibility, and community relations.

#### **Key Issues and Discussions**:
- **Background**: Woodsville has historically maintained its own roads since the late 1800s. A state-mandated funding formula, established in 2009, requires Haverhill to allocate a significant portion of its highway funds to Woodsville, leading to tensions and financial disparities.
- **Local Control and Fairness**:
  - Proponents of SB 26 argued that the current law undermines local control by forcing Haverhill taxpayers to subsidize Woodsville’s road maintenance, which they described as unfair. They emphasized that Woodsville should bear its own financial responsibilities.
  - Critics, including Woodsville residents and former Haverhill town manager Glenn English, argued that repealing the law would result in double taxation for Woodsville residents and harm their ability to maintain infrastructure.
- **Financial Mismanagement and Audits**:
  - Concerns were raised about financial mismanagement in Woodsville, including the misuse of highway funds for non-road-related expenses. Audits conducted by the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) revealed irregularities, such as overpayments and commingling of funds.
  - SB 26 includes provisions to enforce stricter audit requirements, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Community Division**:
  - The issue has caused deep division between Haverhill and Woodsville, with Haverhill residents feeling unfairly burdened and Woodsville residents feeling targeted. The dispute has led to litigation and threats against Haverhill town officials.
- **Historical Context**:
  - The 2009 funding formula was criticized for being passed without proper scrutiny and benefiting Woodsville disproportionately. Critics argued that it was implemented through legislative maneuvering (via HB2).
- **Emotional and Personal Testimonies**:
  - Testimonies highlighted the personal and emotional toll the dispute has taken on the community, reflecting broader tensions over local governance, taxation, and fairness.

#### **Committee Decision**:
The committee decided to retain SB 26 for further study, scheduling an executive session for May 19 to review additional information, including audit reports and written testimonies.

The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on pending legislation. The committee emphasized the importance of balancing local control, financial responsibility, and community needs in its decision-making process.
