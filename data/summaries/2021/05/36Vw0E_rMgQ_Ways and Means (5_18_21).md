**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting – May 18, 2021**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee held a virtual meeting on May 18, 2021, via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting included a work session and an executive session, focusing on several key bills and amendments related to gaming, sports betting, charitable gaming, and the tax treatment of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

---

### **1. Meeting Logistics**
- The meeting was conducted electronically, with public access provided through Zoom or telephone.
- Roll call votes were required for all decisions.

---

### **2. Gaming and Sports Betting Legislation**
- **Senate Bill 22 (SB22)**: The committee discussed and voted on SB22, which pertains to charitable gaming, specifically Lucky Seven tickets. An amendment (1491-H) was proposed to allow venues to sell dollar tickets without being required to sell 25-cent tickets. The bill passed as amended with a **20-1 vote**.
- **House Bill 330 (HB330)**: The committee debated whether to concur with the Senate’s amendment, which removed the cap on the number of sports betting retail locations (previously limited to 10). Some members argued for retaining the cap to control competition and profitability, while others supported allowing market forces to determine the number of locations. The committee decided **not to concur** and requested a **committee of conference** to further discuss the issue.
- **Senate Bill 306 (SB306)**: The committee unanimously concurred with a Senate amendment requiring the House Ways and Means Committee chair to notify the Senate Ways and Means Committee chair of any meetings convened under the bill.

### **3. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan Tax Implications**
- **Senate Bill 3 (SB3)**: The committee extensively debated SB3, which addresses the tax treatment of forgiven PPP loans. Key points included:
  - **Current Law vs. SB3 Proposal**: Under current law, forgiven PPP loans are treated as taxable income, but SB3 proposes to exclude them from gross business income. It also ensures that expenses paid with PPP funds remain deductible, potentially creating a "double benefit" for businesses.
  - **Revenue Concerns**: Passing SB3 could result in significant revenue loss for the state, estimated at 20-25% of the Business Profits Tax (BPT). This raised concerns about the impact on the state budget and surplus projections, especially since PPP-related tax impacts span multiple years (2022-2024).
  - **Impact on Businesses**: Small businesses that did not anticipate paying taxes on forgiven PPP loans could face financial strain if SB3 is not passed. However, larger corporations with subsidiaries might disproportionately benefit, raising equity concerns.
  - **Political Considerations**: The decision to pass SB3 was framed as largely political, with some arguing it is necessary to appear supportive of businesses, even if the economic impact is minimal.
  - **Amendment Proposed by Rep. Spilsbury**: The amendment aimed to prevent a "double dip" by disallowing businesses from deducting expenses tied to forgiven PPP loans. Supporters argued this would neutralize the tax impact, while opponents contended it would negate the benefits of SB3.
  - **Data and Uncertainty**: Representatives expressed frustration over the lack of clear data on the fiscal impact of SB3 and the PPP program, with the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) estimating a $99 million impact based on unclear assumptions.

### **4. House Bill 533 (HB533)**
- **Issue Identified**: The bill inadvertently omitted **Tier 2** for brick-and-mortar locations and contained a reference error to **RSA 287**, which was repealed in 2019. The correct reference should have been **RSA 287D**.
- **Action Taken**: The House voted **19-2** (with 3 not voting) to **non-concur** with the Senate version and form a **committee of conference** to correct the errors.
- **Additional Concerns**: Representatives discussed discrepancies between the House and Senate versions, including new sections added by the Senate regarding the **Attorney General’s office** and **lottery commission enforcement**.

---

### **5. Other Discussions**
- The committee briefly touched on other bills, including procedural issues such as setting up reminders for legislative responsibilities and reviewing the status of various bills.
- Future meetings were planned to discuss PPP loans and American Recovery Funds with the Chamber of Commerce and to receive updates on related rules.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Gaming and Sports Betting**: The committee emphasized the need for further discussion with the Senate on contentious issues, particularly the cap on sports betting retail locations and charitable gaming regulations.
2. **PPP Loan Tax Implications**: The debate centered on balancing the need to support businesses with the potential fiscal consequences for the state, while addressing concerns about fairness and transparency in tax treatment.
3. **Error Correction in HB533**: The House identified technical errors in the bill and moved to resolve them through a committee of conference.
4. **Lack of Data**: Representatives expressed frustration over the lack of clear data on the fiscal impact of SB3 and the PPP program, making it difficult to make informed decisions.
5. **Political and Economic Implications**: The discussion highlighted the tension between providing stimulus to businesses and maintaining fiscal responsibility, with concerns about New Hampshire’s competitiveness and reliance on business taxes.

### **Outcome**
- The committee proceeded with motions to **non-concur** on HB330 and HB533, forming committees of conference to address these issues.
- The debate on SB3 and its proposed amendment remained unresolved, with representatives calling for more data and consideration of intermediate measures before making a final decision.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of balancing economic recovery efforts with fiscal responsibility, while addressing technical and procedural challenges in legislative processes.
