### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire Legislative Youth Advisory Council Meeting (May 16, 2021)

The New Hampshire Legislative Youth Advisory Council convened virtually on May 16, 2021, to discuss **House Bill 544 (HB 544)**, a contentious piece of legislation addressing **divisive concepts** related to race, sex, and other protected characteristics in education and state-funded institutions. The meeting, conducted via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, included introductions, a detailed discussion of the bill, and perspectives from both its sponsor and a guest speaker. The council ultimately voted unanimously to oppose the bill, citing its potential to stifle important conversations about systemic racism and inequality.

#### **Introduction and Context**
The meeting began with members introducing themselves, sharing their locations, grades, and areas of interest (e.g., voting rights, climate action, gun control, healthcare, education). A roll call was conducted to ensure compliance with the Right-to-Know Law, which mandates transparency in government proceedings.

#### **Overview of HB 544**
**Representative Keith Ammon**, the bill’s prime sponsor, provided an overview of HB 544. He explained that the bill does not ban **Critical Race Theory (CRT)** or discussions of divisive concepts but aims to prevent taxpayer funds from being used to promote or endorse specific views or ideologies. The bill prohibits teaching or training that advocates:
- One race or sex is inherently superior to another.
- Individuals are inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive due to their race or sex.
- Individuals should be discriminated against based on race or sex.

Representative Ammon emphasized that the bill focuses on **individual rights** and opposes **collectivist ideologies** that divide people based on race or sex. He argued that CRT is rooted in **Marxist theory** and aims to divide rather than unite people. He clarified that the bill does not ban discussions of CRT or related topics but prevents taxpayer-funded endorsement of its tenets. As an example, he cited **anti-whiteness training** in the Manchester School District, which he claimed promotes collective guilt based on race.

#### **Concerns About the Bill**
Youth council members expressed significant concerns about the implications of HB 544:
1. **Vagueness and Potential Misuse**: Members criticized the bill for being vague, particularly regarding who decides what constitutes a "divisive concept" and how the reporting mechanism would be enforced. They worried this could lead to misuse and a "nanny state" where schools and businesses avoid discussing systemic issues to avoid losing state funding.
2. **Impact on Education**: Members argued that the bill could deter educators from teaching important historical events and systemic issues, such as slavery, the civil rights movement, and gender inequality. They emphasized the importance of open and honest conversations about systemic racism and sexism to address inequalities and create a more inclusive society.
3. **Misrepresentation of CRT**: The discussion clarified that CRT is not about labeling individuals as racist but about understanding how racism functions systemically in society today. Members emphasized that the bill misrepresents CRT and conflates it with broader discussions about systemic racism.
4. **Flipping the Narrative**: Members noted that the bill flips the narrative on racism and sexism, labeling those who point out systemic issues as racists or sexists against white people or men.

#### **Questions and Discussion**
Youth council members raised several questions during the discussion:
- **Privilege and Implicit Bias**: Members asked how the bill would affect discussions of privilege and implicit bias in schools. Representative Ammon responded that the bill allows for objective discussions but prohibits endorsing specific views or penalizing students for their beliefs.
- **Objective Teaching**: Members inquired about how the bill would ensure that divisive concepts are taught in an objective manner. Representative Ammon reiterated that the bill aims to protect individual rights and prevent taxpayer-funded promotion of divisive ideologies.

#### **Guest Speaker: Ismael Huni**
**Ismael Huni**, the **Movement Politics Director** for **Rights and Democracy in New Hampshire**, was invited to provide an opposing perspective on the bill. While his full remarks were not included in the transcript, he commended the youth council for their insightful questions and engagement with the issue.

#### **Council’s Vote and Next Steps**
After a thorough discussion, the council unanimously voted to oppose HB 544, citing its potential to harm marginalized communities and hinder progress on addressing systemic issues. The council plans to draft a statement opposing the bill and send it to the House and Senate, as the bill is currently part of the state budget being reviewed by the Senate. The meeting concluded with plans for future discussions on improving the council’s effectiveness and continuing advocacy efforts over the summer.

#### **Key Themes**
- The meeting highlighted the **broader national debate** on CRT and divisive concepts in education, with HB 544 being described as a "carbon copy" of a Trump-era executive order.
- The discussion underscored the tension between protecting individual rights and ensuring open, honest conversations about systemic racism and inequality.
- Youth council members demonstrated a strong commitment to advocating for marginalized communities and addressing systemic issues in education and society.

Overall, the meeting provided a platform for robust dialogue on HB 544, with the youth council ultimately taking a firm stance against the bill due to its potential negative impact on education and social progress.
