**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (5/11/21)**

On May 11, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee held a virtual meeting to discuss several key legislative items, including **Senate Bill 96 (SB 96)**, **Senate Bill 95 (SB 95)**, and **Senate Bill 143 (SB 143)**. The meeting, conducted via Zoom and phone due to COVID-19, focused on police reform, judicial system improvements, juvenile justice, and privacy violations, reflecting a mix of bipartisan support, stakeholder testimonies, and debates over amendments. Here are the key points from the meeting:

### **Senate Bill 96: Police Reform and Judicial System Improvements**
SB 96, a centerpiece of the meeting, aims to implement recommendations from the **LEACT Commission** (Law Enforcement Accountability, Community, and Transparency Commission), established in response to the murder of George Floyd in 2020. The bill received broad support from stakeholders, including the **New Hampshire Police Association**, the **ACLU-NH**, and other advocacy groups, but also sparked significant debate over specific provisions.

1. **Key Provisions**: SB 96 includes measures such as **body-worn cameras**, **retention of records**, **school resource officer agreements**, and **implicit bias training for judges**. It also addresses juvenile justice reforms and the **retention of records** for law enforcement.

2. **Racial Data Collection**: A major point of contention was the removal of a provision for **racial data collection** during police stops, which was shifted to a **study committee**. Advocates like **Gilles Bissonnette (ACLU-NH)** argued that data collection is essential for transparency and accountability, while others supported the study committee approach due to logistical concerns.

3. **Judicial Bias Training**: Another debated issue was the downgrading of **mandatory bias training for judges** to a **suggestion**. Proponents of mandatory training emphasized its importance for equitable treatment within the justice system.

4. **Amendment Discussions**:
   - **Amendment 1386h**: This amendment removed a provision allowing **remote participation** in public meetings. Supporters argued that remote meetings hinder communication and decorum, while opponents highlighted their accessibility benefits. The amendment was **adopted**.
   - **Qualified Immunity Amendment**: Representative Birch proposed an amendment related to qualified immunity, which was deemed non-germane. The committee scheduled a separate public hearing to address it.

5. **Testimonies**: Key testimonies included:
   - **Senator Bradley (Sponsor)**: Highlighted the bill’s alignment with LEACT Commission recommendations but noted the Senate’s removal of voluntary race/ethnicity data on driver’s licenses due to concerns about racial profiling.
   - **Chief Joe Hobeki (Hollis Police)**: Supported SB 96 but opposed the qualified immunity amendment and expressed concerns about the removal of data collection.
   - **Will Stewart (Stay Work Play NH)**: Argued that the bill would help attract and retain young people by increasing trust in law enforcement.
   - **Mark Morrison (NH Police Association)**: Supported SB 96 but warned that last-minute amendments, particularly on qualified immunity, could jeopardize its success.

6. **Public Participation**: Over 120 people signed up in support of SB 96, 12 in opposition, and 4 as neutral. Thirteen individuals testified during the meeting.

### **Senate Bill 95: Privacy Violations**
The committee also addressed **SB 95**, which deals with invasions of privacy. Key actions included:
1. **Amendment 1361**: This amendment removed Part 2 of SB 95 and upgraded the offense to a **felony**. Concerns were raised about the potential consequences of felony charges, such as increased legal costs and longer trials. The amendment was **adopted** (15 in favor, 6 against).
2. **Final Vote**: The committee voted to pass SB 95 as amended (12 in favor, 9 against).

### **Senate Bill 143: Juvenile Justice Reform**
SB 143 focused on juvenile justice reforms, with the committee reconsidering its previous decision to address concerns about the bill’s viability.
1. **Amendment 1378**: This amendment ensured that juveniles have **counsel at the start of the court process**, addressed payment for contract attorneys, and set standards for juvenile counsel. However, it removed provisions requiring representation throughout the entire process and eliminating fees for publicly appointed counsel. The amendment was **adopted** after extensive discussion.
2. **Final Vote**: The committee voted to pass SB 143 as amended.

### **Committee Dynamics and Next Steps**
Members commended the chair for maintaining a respectful and productive environment. The committee scheduled its next meeting for the following Tuesday to continue discussions on **SB 96** and the proposed qualified immunity amendment.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to advancing police reform, judicial transparency, and juvenile justice while balancing concerns about implementation and unintended consequences. Despite disagreements over specific provisions, the discussions reflected a collaborative effort to address complex issues and foster trust in the justice system.
