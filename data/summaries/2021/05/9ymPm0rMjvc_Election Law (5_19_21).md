### **Key Themes and Debates**

1. **State vs. Federal Control**:
   - The meeting centered on the tension between state sovereignty and federal oversight, particularly in response to the "For the People Act" (HR1/S1). Supporters of Amendment 1445 argued it was necessary to protect New Hampshire’s ability to manage its elections, while opponents viewed it as a partisan effort to resist federal reforms aimed at expanding voter access.

2. **Election Integrity vs. Voting Access**:
   - Proponents of stricter election laws emphasized the need to prevent fraud and maintain accurate voter checklists. Opponents argued that measures like the dual election system and voter ID requirements would create unnecessary barriers, particularly for marginalized communities, young voters, and those with disabilities.

3. **Administrative Challenges**:
   - Local election officials, including town clerks and supervisors of the checklist, testified that proposals like the dual election system would double their workload, increase costs, and make it harder to recruit volunteers. Critics highlighted the impracticality of managing two voter registration systems and checklists on the same election day.

4. **Historical Context**:
   - Some speakers drew parallels between past voter suppression tactics, such as literacy tests, and the potential impact of restrictive amendments. They emphasized the importance of federal oversight, citing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 as successful examples of federal intervention.

5. **Partisan Divide**:
   - The debate revealed a clear partisan split, with Republicans generally supporting measures to resist federal overreach and Democrats opposing what they viewed as voter suppression tactics. Advocacy groups like the League of Women Voters and civil rights organizations urged lawmakers to focus on improving election access and transparency.
