**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting on May 5, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on May 5, 2021, via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. The meeting focused on the financial and legislative implications of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, particularly in relation to **Senate Bill 3 (SB3)**, which proposes changes to the tax treatment of PPP loan forgiveness in New Hampshire. Discussions also touched on related issues such as tax extensions, federal guidance, and the broader impact on state revenues.

### Key Points and Discussions:

1. **SB3 and PPP Loan Taxation**:
   - **Current Law vs. SB3**: Under current New Hampshire law, PPP loan forgiveness is taxable. SB3 aims to align state law with federal law, making forgiven PPP loans non-taxable. This change could significantly impact state revenues, with the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) estimating a potential fiscal impact of just under $100 million.
   - **Refund Implications**: If SB3 passes, businesses that paid taxes on forgiven PPP loans may request refunds, potentially affecting state revenues. The committee sought clarity on how much of the state’s current surplus ($275 million ahead of projections) is tied to PPP loans and how SB3 might influence future refunds.

2. **CPA Perspectives**:
   - **Clarity and Neutrality**: Representatives from CPA groups, including Robin Abbott, Carl Heathfield, and Kevin Kennedy, emphasized the need for clarity in tax treatment of PPP loans. While the CPA Society remains neutral on SB3, they aim to educate legislators and businesses on the implications of the bill.
   - **Extensions and Amended Returns**: Many businesses filed tax extensions due to uncertainty around PPP loan taxation, with $131.5 million in extensions reported—the highest in a decade. If SB3 passes, overpayments from extensions could result in refunds or credits for future tax periods, potentially leading to a large number of amended 2020 returns.

3. **Fiscal Impact and Timing**:
   - **Revenue Concerns**: The committee explored the fiscal impact of SB3, including the potential for significant refunds and the de-linking of expenses from the source of funds, which could exacerbate the fiscal impact. The complexity of PPP loan taxation, including deductions for expenses paid with PPP funds, was also discussed.
   - **Business Diversity**: The committee acknowledged the diverse outcomes for businesses during the pandemic, with some sectors thriving (e.g., moving companies, glass installers) while others struggled. This diversity complicates efforts to generalize the impact of PPP loans on tax revenues.

4. **Federal Guidance and Legislative Coordination**:
   - **Awaiting Federal Guidance**: The committee is awaiting federal guidance on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, expected by May 11, 2021, which could impact their discussions and decisions on SB3.
   - **Upcoming Sessions**: The committee planned to hold a session on May 11, 2021, to address several bills (excluding SB3, pending additional information) and a revenue discussion on May 12, 2021, hoping to receive guidance on the latest stimulus package.

5. **Other Legislative Discussions**:
   - **House Bill 565**: Representative Romney discussed House Bill 565, which relates to a study committee on charitable gaming. The bill was passed by the House but tabled by the Senate, with ongoing discussions about the composition of the committee to ensure better representation and participation.
   - **Main Street Relief Program**: The committee briefly touched on the state’s Main Street Relief Program, which provided aid to businesses, and whether similar tax treatment should apply to these funds.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the complexity of PPP loan taxation and the challenges of estimating the fiscal impact of SB3. The committee emphasized the need for clarity in tax policy to avoid confusion for businesses and potential revenue shortfalls for the state. As SB3 progresses, the committee plans to continue analyzing the issue, considering federal guidance and the diverse outcomes for businesses during the pandemic.
