The transcript captures a New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee meeting focused on discussing the amendments to a bill related to summer camps, outdoor dining, and temporary health partners. The meeting began with procedural notes, confirming that the session was conducted electronically via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with public access provided through the platform.

Key discussions included:

1. **Summer Camps**: Representative Lekkis proposed amendments to address the impact of COVID-19 on summer camps, particularly those unable to operate in 2020. The concern was whether camps that couldnâ€™t operate due to the pandemic would lose their grandfathered status if the statute expired at the end of 2021. The committee agreed to seek legal clarification on the issue.

2. **Outdoor Dining**: Representative Grota presented changes to allow for expanded outdoor dining for restaurants and food service establishments. The amendment clarified that establishments on municipal sewer systems could expand seating as allowed by the municipality, while ensuring compliance with local regulations.

3. **Temporary Health Partners**: The committee defined "temporary health partners" as individuals hired under federal and state waivers during the COVID-19 emergency. There was interest in exploring a permanent alternative pathway for licensing healthcare workers, particularly for those who cannot afford upfront costs for training.

4. **Military Service Members**: Representative Allegro raised concerns about the exclusion of Navy personnel in a section addressing temporary health partners for former military medics. It was noted that House Bill 567, which addresses this issue, is pending in the Senate. The committee agreed to include a clause stating that the section would not apply if HB 567 passes.

5. **Non-Germane Amendment**: The committee clarified that a non-germane amendment related to vaccines would be addressed in a separate public hearing and not included in the current bill.

The subcommittee concluded by informally approving the discussed amendments, with plans to refer the bill to the full committee for further consideration. The meeting ended with a reminder of the upcoming public hearing on the vaccine-related amendment.
