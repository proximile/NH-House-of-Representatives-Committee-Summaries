The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on May 18, 2021, focused on **Senate Bill 131** and several amendments, with significant attention given to proposed changes to axle weight limits for forestry trucks and other transportation-related issues. The meeting included a public hearing and committee discussion, highlighting both industry needs and infrastructure concerns. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **Senate Bill 131 and Key Amendments**
1. **Axle Weight Limits for Forestry Trucks**:
   - **Amendment 1442**: This amendment proposed increasing the maximum allowable weight for tandem axles on forestry trucks from 40,000 to 44,000 pounds, specifically for vehicles transporting raw forest products like logs and wood chips. The amendment aimed to address challenges faced by the timber industry, such as uneven terrain and variable loads, and to align New Hampshire’s weight limits with neighboring states like Maine, which allows up to 46,000 pounds. The amendment was adopted by a vote of 16-6, with supporters arguing it would help the forestry industry remain competitive in the regional market. Opponents raised concerns about potential damage to roads and bridges, as higher axle weights exponentially increase pavement wear and could lead to more bridges being posted as E2, restricting access for many trucks.
   - **Industry Support**: Jason Stock, Executive Director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, testified in favor of the amendment, emphasizing the regional nature of the forest products market and the need for consistency across state lines. Andrew Player, representing the Department of Safety, also supported the amendment, stating that vehicles are capable of safely carrying the increased weight.
   - **Infrastructure Concerns**: David Rodrigue, Director of Operations for the New Hampshire Department of Transportation, highlighted the potential impact on bridges, noting that the amendment would require re-rating many bridges to ensure they can handle the increased axle weights. He also pointed out that the law already provides a 10% buffer, effectively allowing axle loads up to 44,000 pounds, which could further strain infrastructure.

2. **Other Amendments**:
   - **Amendment 1536 (Vehicle Decals)**: This amendment added certain vehicles to the decal system and passed unanimously. It was seen as a technical correction to align with existing laws.
   - **Amendment 1528 (Electric Vehicle Charging and Rate Design)**: This amendment removed provisions allowing municipalities to establish tax credits for electric vehicle charging stations and set rate design standards. It passed 13-6, with supporters arguing it was premature and opponents emphasizing the need to incentivize EV infrastructure.
   - **Amendment 1372 (Non-Driver ID Cards)**: This amendment removed language that singled out disabled individuals for non-driver photo ID cards, affirming their equal status. It passed unanimously.

### **Committee Discussion and Considerations**
- Committee members discussed the practical challenges of enforcing weight limits in remote areas, as trucks are often loaded without scales. Jason Stock explained that truckers rely on experience and techniques to estimate loads, but compliance remains challenging in the woods.
- The committee also considered the legal and regional context, noting that the amendment mirrors **House Bill 279**, which passed the committee in February 2021 with bipartisan support. New Hampshire’s current laws already allow some vehicles to operate with axle weights exceeding 40,000 pounds, particularly in certain configurations like tri-axle units.

### **Retained Bills**
- The committee discussed plans to address retained bills later in the year, with potential full committee work sessions rather than subcommittees.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the passage of **Senate Bill 131** as amended, with a unanimous vote (19-0). Committee members expressed appreciation for the collaborative effort and acknowledged the challenges of balancing industry needs with infrastructure preservation. The discussion highlighted the tension between supporting the timber industry’s need for higher axle weights to remain competitive and the potential strain on infrastructure, particularly bridges. The amendment aimed to address industry concerns while maintaining safeguards for infrastructure.
