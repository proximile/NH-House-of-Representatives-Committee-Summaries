### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (May 19, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on May 19, 2021, to discuss key legislative issues, primarily focusing on **Senate Bill 92 (SB 92)** and its proposed amendments, as well as **House Bill 296 (HB 296)**. The meeting, held virtually due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, began with procedural announcements, a roll call, and a moment of silence for a deceased individual.

#### **Primary Focus: Senate Bill 92 and Bail Reform**
The central discussion revolved around **SB 92**, which addresses pre-trial detention and bail reform, particularly for individuals charged with violent crimes such as murder, rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. A proposed amendment (**Amendment 2021-1549**) to SB 92 sparked significant debate. Key elements of the amendment included:

1. **Reduction of Detention Time**: The amendment proposed reducing the time a person could be held before a bail hearing from 72 hours to 24–36 hours, excluding weekends and holidays.
2. **Higher Standard of Evidence**: It introduced a "clear and convincing" evidence standard for detaining individuals charged with violent offenses, aligning with the standard used in life sentence cases.
3. **Failures to Appear**: The amendment allowed for detention of individuals who repeatedly fail to appear in court within a three-year period.
4. **Domestic Violence and Protective Orders**: It emphasized stricter measures for domestic violence cases, citing instances where offenders were released and reoffended.

#### **Key Points of Debate**
The discussion highlighted several critical issues and perspectives:

1. **Public Safety vs. Due Process**: Proponents of the amendment argued that it was necessary to protect victims of violent crimes and ensure public safety by allowing judges, rather than bail commissioners, to make detention decisions. They emphasized the higher burden of proof (clear and convincing evidence) as a safeguard against unjust detention. Opponents, however, raised concerns about potential violations of due process, arguing that removing bail commissioners from the process could lead to unnecessary incarceration, especially over weekends or holidays when courts are closed.

2. **Bypassing the Bail Commission**: Critics of the amendment noted that it bypassed the **Bail Commission**, a body established to review and recommend bail reforms. They argued that the amendment was crafted without sufficient input from all stakeholders, including bail commissioners, law enforcement, and public defenders, and could roll back recent bail reforms, potentially increasing jail populations and county budgets.

3. **Financial and Resource Impacts**: Concerns were raised about the financial strain on county budgets and the court system, particularly the need for additional circuit court judges to handle the increased workload.

4. **Historical Context and Collaboration**: Some representatives referenced the **commission on pre-trial detention**, which had previously vetted bail reform over several years. They argued that the amendment deviated from the collaborative process that had informed earlier legislation.

5. **Retention for Further Study**: After the amendment passed by a vote of 13-8, a motion was made to retain SB 92 for further review and possible subcommittee work. This motion passed unanimously (21-0), indicating the committee’s desire to refine the bill further and address unresolved concerns.

#### **Discussion of House Bill 296**
The committee also briefly discussed **HB 296**, which addresses the sending of unsolicited intimate images. The Senate had made minor changes to the bill, including removing "annoy or alarm" from the intent requirement. Some members felt this weakened the bill and considered whether to concur with the Senate’s changes or seek a committee of conference.

#### **Other Legislative Matters**
The meeting touched on another bill involving the statute of limitations for crimes against minors, with the Senate reducing the limitation period from six to three years. Some members preferred the original six-year period.

#### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with the committee adjourning, having decided to retain SB 92 for further work and to address the Senate’s changes to HB 296 in future sessions. The formation of a subcommittee to further review SB 92 was proposed, with several members expressing interest in participating. The discussion underscored the complexities of balancing public safety, due process, and legislative clarity in criminal justice reforms, highlighting the need for careful deliberation and stakeholder input.
