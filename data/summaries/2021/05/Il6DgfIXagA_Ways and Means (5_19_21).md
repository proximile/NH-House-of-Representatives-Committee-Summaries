### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (May 19, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee held a virtual meeting on May 19, 2021, to discuss key fiscal and legislative issues impacting the state’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on three main topics: the **Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans**, the **American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds**, and broader **business recovery challenges**. Here is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans**
The PPP, a federal relief program, provided critical support to businesses during the pandemic, helping them retain employees and cover essential expenses. However, its implementation and tax implications raised significant concerns:
- **Taxation of PPP Loans**: A major issue was the state’s treatment of forgiven PPP loans as taxable income under the Business Profits Tax (BPT). Many businesses were unaware of this and viewed PPP funds as a lifeline rather than taxable income. Taxing these loans could hinder recovery for businesses still struggling financially.
- **Senate Bill 3 (SB3)**: The committee discussed SB3, which proposes exempting forgiven PPP loans from state taxation. The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) estimated the fiscal impact of SB3 at **just under $100 million**, spread over multiple years (FY25–FY28) due to credit carryovers and net operating losses (NOLs). Local chambers of commerce strongly supported SB3, emphasizing that only 20-30% of businesses are likely to pay BPT and that small businesses need relief to survive.
- **Business Recovery**: Representatives from chambers of commerce (Upper Valley, Greater Nashua, Salem, and Portsmouth) highlighted the uneven recovery across industries. While sectors like home improvement and outdoor recreation thrived, others, such as restaurants, hotels, and retail, faced significant challenges. Workforce shortages, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs added to the uncertainty, with full recovery expected to take until 2022 or 2023.

### **2. Workforce Challenges**
The pandemic exacerbated workforce issues, particularly in the hospitality and service sectors:
- **Hiring Difficulties**: Businesses struggled to find employees due to childcare responsibilities, health concerns, and competition for higher wages. Some businesses offered bonuses or increased pay, but many remained understaffed.
- **Governor’s Workforce Incentives**: Governor Sununu’s plan to replace the $300 federal unemployment supplement with $1,000 bonuses for workers returning to employment was praised but raised concerns about its long-term effectiveness. Some workers might only stay for the required six weeks to receive the bonus.
- **Chamber Efforts**: Chambers of commerce are supporting businesses through training programs and partnerships with organizations like the Small Business Development Center, emphasizing the importance of local businesses to the community.

### **3. American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Funds**
The committee discussed the allocation, usage, and reporting requirements for ARPA funds, which provide $1.9 trillion in federal relief for COVID-19 recovery:
- **Eligible Uses**: ARPA funds can be used for COVID-19 response, economic recovery, premium pay for essential workers, government services, and infrastructure projects like water, sewer, and broadband. The covered period for obligating funds runs from March 3, 2021, to December 31, 2024, with spending allowed until 2026.
- **Prohibited Uses**: Funds cannot be used for pension deposits, tax reductions, or delaying tax increases, though local governments have more flexibility.
- **Revenue Loss Calculation**: Jurisdictions can use ARPA funds to cover revenue shortfalls based on a base year and a 4.1% growth rate.
- **Broadband and Infrastructure**: Investments in broadband are encouraged, with a preference for government-owned projects. Broadband projects must meet specific technological standards.
- **Reporting Requirements**: Recipients must adhere to strict reporting requirements, including initial reports by July 31, 2021, quarterly updates, and performance reports for states and large jurisdictions.
- **Local Government Flexibility**: Local governments can use funds for public health payroll, capital investments, and social services, provided expenditures are tied to COVID-19 impacts.
- **Uncertainties**: Questions remain about the distribution of funds to Non-Entitlement Units (NEUs) and certification processes, which require rigorous identification steps.

### **4. Fiscal and Legislative Considerations**
The committee addressed broader fiscal and legislative issues:
- **House Bill 2 (HB2)**: The potential impact of HB2, which proposes changes to business tax credits, was discussed. The DRA noted that HB2 could shift fiscal impacts to earlier years (FY22–FY24) if taxpayers claim refunds instead of carrying forward credits.
- **Inflation Concerns**: The committee briefly discussed the potential impact of inflation on state revenues, particularly in FY23, which is expected to be a challenging year for fiscal impacts.

---

### **5. Next Steps**
The committee planned to:
- Review additional data from the DRA on the fiscal impact of tax changes proposed in HB2 and their interaction with SB3.
- Continue engaging with stakeholders to clarify ARPA fund distribution and usage.
- Monitor the long-term revenue implications of legislative changes and support measures that aid economic recovery.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of balancing tax policy with the need to support businesses and communities recovering from the pandemic. Key takeaways include the importance of exempting PPP loans from state taxation, addressing workforce challenges, and ensuring effective and compliant use of ARPA funds. The committee emphasized the need for continued collaboration and flexibility to foster a robust economic recovery in New Hampshire.
