The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on May 5, 2021, focused on a range of critical topics, with a central emphasis on the tax treatment of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan proceeds, state funding mechanisms, and initiatives to address affordable housing and Medicaid expansion. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

#### **1. Senate Bill 3 (SB3) and PPP Loans**
- **Neutral Stance**: Representatives, including members of the CPA society, maintained a neutral position on SB3, framing it as a philosophical or political issue rather than one requiring advocacy. They emphasized the need for clarity and simplicity in tax laws to facilitate taxpayer compliance.
- **Tax Implications of PPP Loans**: The committee debated whether PPP loan forgiveness should be taxable. Concerns were raised that amending SB3 to disallow deductions for expenses paid with PPP funds could create confusion and complicate tax filings. The current law, which allows such deductions, was viewed as clearer and more straightforward.
- **Fiscal Impact**: SB3’s potential fiscal impact was estimated at just under $100 million. Accountants suggested that not passing SB3 might simplify matters for taxpayers by avoiding the need for amended returns and uncertainty about the timing of disallowed expenses.
- **Main Street Program**: The committee briefly discussed whether funds from the state’s Main Street Program, similar to PPP, should also be non-taxable. While businesses preferred tax-free treatment, no clear guidance was yet available.

#### **2. School Building Aid Debt Service**
- The committee revisited decisions made during the 2008 recession regarding the state’s school building aid program. Concerns about meeting financial obligations to communities that borrowed for school construction led to adjustments in funding mechanisms, including an increase in the meals and rooms tax from 8% to 9% in 2009. The debt service, which peaked at $14 million annually, has decreased to about $8 million and is projected to continue declining until 2030.

#### **3. Medicaid Expansion and Funding**
- The discussion highlighted New Hampshire’s Medicaid expansion under the Granite Advantage Health Care Program. To address funding shortfalls, the committee considered transferring funds from the Liquor Commission to a trust fund, ensuring the program’s continuity without relying on state general funds.

#### **4. Affordable Housing Initiatives**
- The committee addressed the state’s workforce housing shortages, noting that a recent budget session allocated $5 million annually from the real estate transfer tax to an affordable housing fund managed by the Housing Finance Authority. This initiative aims to support communities and businesses in need.

#### **5. Charitable Gaming Study Committee**
- Representative Romney discussed House Bill 565, which proposes a study committee on charitable gaming. The bill passed the House but was tabled in the Senate. The committee considered amendments to the bill, including the composition of the study committee, with suggestions to include members from Ways and Means and ensure bipartisan representation.

#### **6. Federal Guidance on Stimulus Funds**
- The committee acknowledged the pending federal guidance on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which could impact their discussions and decisions. They emphasized the need for clarity before finalizing SB3.

#### **7. Revenue Adjustments**
- The committee discussed revenue adjustments for programs like the **Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP)** and **school building aid debt service**, which are funded through surcharges on certain transactions. These funds are removed from general revenue and allocated to their designated purposes.

### Themes and Priorities:
- **Clarity and Simplicity in Tax Policy**: The committee consistently stressed the importance of clear and straightforward tax laws to minimize confusion and ensure compliance.
- **Fairness and Practicality**: Discussions focused on balancing political considerations with practical implications for taxpayers and businesses, particularly regarding PPP loans and state-funded programs.
- **Economic Recovery and Support**: The committee highlighted efforts to support businesses, affordable housing, and healthcare initiatives, recognizing the uneven economic impact of the pandemic across industries.

### Conclusion:
The meeting concluded with plans for an executive session to address several bills, including SB3, and upcoming caucus meetings to prepare for further discussions. The committee’s deliberations underscored the complexity of tax legislation and the importance of aligning policy decisions with the needs of taxpayers, businesses, and communities.
