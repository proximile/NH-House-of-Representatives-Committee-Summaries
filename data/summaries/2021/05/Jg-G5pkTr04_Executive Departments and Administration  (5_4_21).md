The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 4, 2021, focused on the Executive Departments and Administration Committee’s review of various bills and amendments, addressing critical issues such as child care, professional licensing, healthcare workforce shortages, and emergency services. The meeting was conducted in a hybrid format, with detailed discussions and votes on multiple sections of Senate Bill 133 and other related legislation. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Child Care and Workforce Shortages**
1. **Child Care Crisis (House Bill 230)**: The committee acknowledged the longstanding child care crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and agreed to study House Bill 230 over the summer to address workforce shortages and accessibility.
2. **Child Care Licensing Amendment (Senate Bill 133)**: A subcommittee proposed an amendment to allow documented life experience (e.g., foster parenting, camp counseling) to substitute for academic qualifications in child care licensing. This aimed to ease entry into the profession while maintaining standards. The amendment passed unanimously, with discussions on including "closely related activities" to ensure flexibility.

### **Professional Licensing and Compacts**
1. **Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Compact**: The committee reviewed and amended sections of Senate Bill 133 related to professional compacts, ensuring the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) would cover associated costs. Concerns about costs and out-of-state licensee tracking were addressed, and the sections passed with amendments.
2. **EMS Licensure Compact**: Representatives debated the necessity of the EMS compact, which allows emergency medical personnel to work across state lines. While some argued it was redundant given existing mutual aid agreements, others highlighted its potential benefits for military families and emergencies. The motion to repeal the EMS compact section passed 11-8.
3. **Nursing and Temporary Health Partners**: Temporary measures were proposed to address nursing shortages, allowing temporary health partners who worked during the pandemic to transition to licensed nursing assistant (LNA) roles without completing full training. While concerns about training quality were raised, the amendment passed with significant support.

### **Healthcare and Emergency Services**
1. **Nursing Staff Shortages**: The committee discussed temporary measures to alleviate staffing shortages in nursing homes, including allowing temporary health partners to assist with basic patient care. Amendments were proposed to facilitate the transition of these workers to LNA roles, balancing workforce needs with care quality.
2. **EMS Compact and Mutual Aid**: The debate over the EMS compact highlighted differing views on its utility. Some representatives argued it was unnecessary, while others supported it for future emergencies and military-related opportunities. The motion to repeal the compact section ultimately passed.

### **Other Key Legislation**
1. **Senate Bill 42 (Conflicts of Interest)**: The committee unanimously supported an amendment to raise the monetary threshold for conflicts of interest from $200 to $1,000, recommending the bill as "Ought to Pass."
2. **Senate Bill 57 (Pharmacy Technicians)**: The bill allowing pharmacy technicians to perform administrative tasks remotely under pharmacist supervision was unanimously supported, with the committee recommending it as "Ought to Pass."
3. **Food Protection Manager Regulations**: Amendments were proposed to exempt small businesses with fewer than six food handlers or those not actively preparing food from requiring an on-site manager. The amendment passed overwhelmingly, with concerns about public safety in high-risk food establishments addressed.

### **Procedural Matters**
1. **Section-by-Section Review of Senate Bill 133**: The committee conducted a detailed review of the omnibus bill, voting on each section individually and compiling comprehensive amendments. Procedural clarity was emphasized, with discussions on minority reports and the handling of contentious sections.
2. **Hybrid Work Session**: The meeting was conducted as a hybrid work/executive session, with no official votes planned for the day. Representatives addressed scheduling conflicts and the handling of controversial amendments.

### **Key Outcomes**
- **Child Care Workforce**: Amendments to ease entry into the child care workforce through documented life experience were approved.
- **Professional Compacts**: Sections related to audiology, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy compacts were amended and passed, while the EMS compact section was repealed.
- **Healthcare Workforce**: Temporary measures to address nursing shortages were supported, with amendments facilitating the transition of temporary health partners to LNA roles.
- **Other Legislation**: Bills addressing conflicts of interest, pharmacy technician roles, and food protection manager regulations were amended and passed.

The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing immediate workforce needs with long-term regulatory standards, ensuring clarity and accountability in professional licensing, and addressing critical issues in child care, healthcare, and emergency services. Discussions will continue in subsequent meetings to finalize amendments to Senate Bill 133 and other pending legislation.
