**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting on May 18, 2021**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on May 18, 2021, to discuss amendments to **Senate Bill 96 (SB 96)**, a comprehensive piece of legislation addressing police accountability, implicit bias training, and data collection on race and ethnicity. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused primarily on **Amendment 2021-1244**, which sought to eliminate **qualified immunity** for government employees, particularly law enforcement officers. The debate also touched on other amendments, including those related to data collection and implicit bias training. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Amendment 2021-1244: Eliminating Qualified Immunity**  
The most contentious issue of the meeting was **Amendment 2021-1244**, which mirrored **House Bill 111 (HB 111)** and aimed to eliminate qualified immunity for government employees. The amendment would allow citizens to seek redress in state courts for harms caused by government actions, shifting financial liability from individual employees to their government employers.  

#### **Support for the Amendment:**  
- **Accountability and Justice**: Supporters, including **Representative Burch** (the amendment’s sponsor) and advocacy groups like **Americans for Prosperity**, argued that qualified immunity shields government employees from accountability for misconduct. They emphasized that municipalities, like private-sector employers, should be responsible for their employees’ actions.  
- **Legal and Moral Arguments**: Supporters cited cases like **Tolan v. Cotton**, where qualified immunity prevented victims of egregious misconduct from obtaining redress. They argued that eliminating qualified immunity would restore public trust in government and law enforcement.  
- **Economic Benefits**: Some supporters, including business leaders like **Jerry Greenfield** (co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s), contended that accountability would improve government operations and public safety outcomes.  

#### **Opposition to the Amendment:**  
- **Municipal and Law Enforcement Concerns**: Opponents, including the **New Hampshire Municipal Association**, the **New Hampshire Troopers Association**, and the **New Hampshire Association of Fire Chiefs**, argued that eliminating qualified immunity would expose local governments and public employees to excessive litigation and financial burdens. They highlighted the challenges of recruitment and retention in law enforcement and fire services.  
- **Economic Impact on Small Communities**: Representatives from small, economically struggling communities like **Franklin** warned that the amendment could devastate local governments, increase insurance costs, and hinder economic revitalization efforts.  
- **Legal Redundancy**: Critics, including **Representative Lynn**, noted that existing laws (e.g., **RSA 507-B**, **RSA 541-B**, and **42 U.S.C. § 1983**) already provide avenues for redress for constitutional violations. They argued the amendment was unnecessary and could create confusion in the legal system.  
- **Unintended Consequences**: Opponents warned that the amendment could lead to a “hunker down” mentality among public employees, discouraging them from performing their duties effectively.  

#### **Outcome:**  
After extensive debate, **Amendment 2021-1244 was defeated**, with opponents successfully arguing that it could undermine public safety and local governance while creating unnecessary legal and financial burdens.

### **2. Amendment 2021-1510: Reinstating Demographic Data Collection**  
This amendment aimed to reinstate a provision for **demographic data collection** (race and ethnicity) that had been removed by the Senate.  

#### **Support:**  
Proponents emphasized the importance of transparency and data-driven policy to address systemic issues in law enforcement and public services.  

#### **Opposition:**  
Critics argued that the provision was unnecessary and could infringe on privacy rights.  

#### **Outcome:**  
**Amendment 2021-1510 was defeated.**

### **3. Amendment 2021-1391: Removing Implicit Bias Training for Judges**  
This amendment proposed removing a section of SB 96 that encouraged judges to undergo **implicit bias training** annually.  

#### **Support:**  
Supporters argued that the provision was redundant and encroached on the judicial branch’s independence.  

#### **Opposition:**  
Opponents believed the training was essential for addressing systemic biases in the justice system.  

#### **Outcome:**  
**Amendment 2021-1391 passed**, and the committee recommended SB 96 with this amendment.

### **4. General Themes and Conclusions**  
Throughout the meeting, several recurring themes emerged:  
- **Accountability vs. Protection**: The debate centered on balancing the need to hold public employees accountable for misconduct with protecting them from frivolous lawsuits that could hinder their ability to perform their duties.  
- **Economic Impact**: Opponents of eliminating qualified immunity argued it would disproportionately harm small, resource-strapped communities, while supporters believed accountability would improve government operations and public trust.  
- **Legal and Practical Implications**: Critics argued that existing laws already provide remedies for constitutional violations, while supporters contended the amendment was necessary to close gaps in accountability.  
- **Public Trust**: Both sides acknowledged the importance of maintaining public trust in government and law enforcement but disagreed on whether eliminating qualified immunity would achieve this.  

The committee concluded by moving **SB 96, as amended**, to the **consent calendar** for further consideration. The meeting highlighted deep divisions on the issue of qualified immunity and underscored the complexity of balancing accountability, public safety, and local governance.
