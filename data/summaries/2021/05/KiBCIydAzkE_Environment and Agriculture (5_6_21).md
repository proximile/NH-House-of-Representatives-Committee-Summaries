### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Environment and Agriculture (May 6, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on May 6, 2021, to address critical environmental and agricultural issues, focusing on **waste management and recycling strategies** as well as **pesticides and neonicotinoids**. The meeting, conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, emphasized the need for innovation, collaboration, and science-based legislation to tackle these complex challenges.

### **Waste Management and Recycling Strategies**

1. **Waste-to-Energy Technology**:
   - Waste-to-energy technologies, particularly mass burn incineration, were highlighted as effective methods to reduce solid waste volume and greenhouse gas emissions. However, building additional facilities in New Hampshire may not be feasible due to the state’s low solid waste volume and dispersed population.

2. **Recycling and Waste Diversion**:
   - New Hampshire currently recycles or composts 35% of its waste, but there is potential to increase this to 80%. Strategies discussed included passing comprehensive recycling legislation, implementing bottle bills (similar to neighboring states), and expanding programs that repurpose recycled glass for road construction.

3. **Out-of-State Waste**:
   - In 2018, 49% of New Hampshire’s solid waste came from out of state. To address this, the committee considered imposing surcharges on out-of-state waste to disincentivize its disposal in New Hampshire landfills, mirroring policies in states like Ohio.

4. **Landfill Gas-to-Energy Facilities**:
   - The state is exploring the construction of additional landfill gas-to-energy facilities, which capture methane from landfills to produce energy, reduce emissions, lower fuel costs, and create jobs. Two landfills in New Hampshire were identified as viable for this technology.

5. **Legislative Updates and Recommendations**:
   - The committee discussed updating New Hampshire’s solid waste management plan, last revised in 2003, increasing funding for waste management, and revisiting recycling and waste management legislation. Collaboration with organizations like the Northeast Resource Recovery Association (NRA) was emphasized to develop sustainable strategies.

6. **Retained Bills**:
   - Several retained bills were reviewed, including:
     - **HB 366**: Animal cruelty legislation, to be refined by a subcommittee.
     - **HB 367**: Quarantine requirements for imported animals, to be held until fall.
     - **HB 438**: Confidentiality of animal records, also held until fall.
     - **HB 585**: Prepayment of dog licensing fees, to be reviewed by a subcommittee.
     - **HB 627**: Value-added grant matching fund for agricultural producers, to be revisited after the budget is finalized.

7. **Future Plans**:
   - The committee plans to invite experts from the University of New Hampshire’s College of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COLSA) to discuss intersections with the committee’s responsibilities.

### **Pesticides and Neonicotinoids**

1. **Overview of Pesticides**:
   - Pesticides pose significant health risks to humans, including immediate effects like rashes, nausea, and blindness, as well as long-term effects such as Alzheimer’s, asthma, and cancer. Farmers and agricultural workers are particularly vulnerable due to pesticide application and drift, which can travel up to 50 miles.

2. **Neonicotinoids (Neonics)**:
   - Neonics are neurotoxic insecticides widely used against sap-feeding insects like aphids. They are water-soluble and often applied as seed treatments, reducing the need for multiple sprays. However, they have raised concerns due to their impact on non-target organisms, particularly bees.
   - Research indicates neonics harm bees, increasing mortality, impairing feeding, and reducing colony growth. While colony collapse disorder (CCD) has declined since 2008, neonics are still linked to bee health issues.
   - Chronic human exposure to neonics has been associated with congenital heart disease and memory loss, though acute effects are rare due to their low mammalian toxicity.

3. **Economic and Regulatory Considerations**:
   - Neonics provide economic benefits by reducing pest populations and improving crop yields, particularly for fruits and vegetables. However, their benefits are minimal for crops like corn and soybeans.
   - Several states, including Vermont, Maryland, and Connecticut, have restricted neonic use to certified applicators. New York has proposed legislation to ban neonics where risks outweigh benefits.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the importance of **nuanced, science-based legislation** to address the interconnected challenges of waste management, pesticide use, and agricultural sustainability. Key takeaways include:

- **Waste Management**: New Hampshire must adopt innovative solutions like landfill gas-to-energy facilities, increase recycling rates, and address out-of-state waste through surcharges. Updating the state’s solid waste management plan and increasing funding are critical steps.
- **Pesticides and Neonics**: Balancing the economic benefits of pesticides with their health and environmental risks is essential. Restrictions on neonicotinoids, informed by research and stakeholder input, should be considered to protect pollinators and public health.
- **Collaboration**: Partnerships with organizations like the NRA and academic institutions like UNH’s COLSA will be vital in developing sustainable strategies.

The committee committed to continuing its work on these issues, emphasizing the need for collaboration, innovation, and evidence-based policymaking to improve New Hampshire’s environmental and agricultural practices.
