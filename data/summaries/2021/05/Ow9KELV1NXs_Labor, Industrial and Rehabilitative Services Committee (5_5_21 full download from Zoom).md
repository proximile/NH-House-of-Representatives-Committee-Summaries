### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee Meeting (May 5, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on May 5, 2021, via Zoom, to address key legislative issues and updates related to labor, unemployment, and COVID-19 workplace policies. The meeting was authorized under the state of emergency due to COVID-19 and included procedural announcements, a Pledge of Allegiance, and a roll call to ensure compliance with the Right to Know Law.

#### **Key Discussions and Outcomes:**

---

### **1. Senate Bill 137: Tipped Wages for Employees**
The committee engaged in a detailed discussion on **Senate Bill 137**, which proposes changes to the **minimum hourly rate for tipped employees**. The bill seeks to replace the current system, where tipped wages are set at **45% of the federal minimum wage**, with a fixed rate of **$3.27 per hour**. This change is intended to prevent tipped wages from doubling if the federal minimum wage increases to $15 per hour.

#### **Key Points:**
- **Opposition**: Representative Timothy Horgan argued against the bill, highlighting that tipped employees are already underpaid and overworked, particularly after the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. He warned that lowering their wages would further disadvantage these workers.
- **Support**: Senator Jeb Bradley, the bill’s sponsor, defended the proposal, stating that increasing the tipped wage could place undue financial pressure on restaurants, many of which are still recovering from the pandemic. He noted that the bill includes a contingency clause, meaning it would only take effect if the federal minimum wage increases.
- **Impact on Restaurants**: Supporters, including representatives from the **New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association**, argued that tipped employees often earn significantly more than the minimum wage through tips. They expressed concern that raising the tipped wage could lead to job losses, reduced shifts, and increased automation in restaurants.
- **Comparison to Other States**: New Hampshire is one of the few states that ties tipped wages to a percentage of the federal minimum wage, while most states have a fixed tipped wage rate.
- **Technical Concerns**: Questions were raised about drafting errors and the inclusion of **secondary game operators**, who are currently paid $7.25 per hour. It was suggested that these issues be addressed in future revisions.
- **Outcome**: The committee continued to debate the bill’s merits, focusing on balancing the needs of tipped employees with the financial realities of the restaurant industry. Further discussions and potential amendments are expected.

### **2. Unemployment Benefits and Trust Fund Updates**
The Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Employment Security provided an update on unemployment claims, the trust fund status, overpayments, and appeals.

#### **Key Points:**
- **Unemployment Trust Fund**: The trust fund remained solvent, with a balance of $104 million, and was projected to stay solvent through 2021. Measures were in place to avoid surcharges that could disincentivize hiring.
- **Overpayments and Waivers**: About 1% of payments were overpayments due to inaccurate information provided by claimants, and 1.5% were due to agency error. The state can waive repayment for state funds but must follow federal guidelines for federal funds, creating a more complicated process.
- **Appeals Backlog**: The department is handling a significant backlog of appeals and is increasing capacity by hiring additional hearing officers and law firms.
- **Gig Workers and Self-Employed**: Gig workers and self-employed individuals are currently eligible for unemployment benefits under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, but eligibility will end once PUA expires.
- **Work Search Requirement**: The state reinstated the work search requirement for unemployment benefits starting May 23, 2021, to encourage re-entry into the workforce.
- **Nonprofits and Municipalities**: The department waived the requirement for nonprofits and municipalities to reimburse unemployment costs during the pandemic.

### **3. Senate Bill 123: Employer Payment for COVID-19 Testing**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 123**, which addresses employer payment for required COVID-19 testing. The bill aims to prevent employers from requiring employees to pay for COVID-19 tests as a condition of employment.

#### **Key Points:**
- **Bill Introduction**: Senator Sue Prentice explained that the bill aligns with existing labor laws and aims to protect workers and ensure safe workplaces.
- **Committee Questions**: Members inquired about the bill’s simplicity compared to its original version, HIPAA concerns, and scenarios where employers might require testing due to external exposure.
- **Outcome**: The committee continued to evaluate the bill, with a focus on ensuring clarity and fairness in workplace testing policies.

### **4. Secondary Game Operators and Tipped Wages**
The committee heard testimony from Rick Newman of the New Hampshire Charitable Gaming Operators Association, who argued for including secondary game operators under the tipped wage category, as they rely heavily on tips. Concerns were raised about potential federal minimum wage increases and their impact on these workers. Opposition to the bill was voiced by Gail Kinney, a pastor representing the Economic Justice Team of the New Hampshire United Church of Christ, who argued that the bill was unnecessary and would freeze wages unfairly.

### **5. Procedural and Administrative Matters**
The meeting included procedural discussions about scheduling executive sessions and addressing questions from committee members. The chair emphasized the importance of accommodating all members, especially those receiving COVID-19 vaccinations, and ensuring clarity on federal and state wage laws.

---

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing economic recovery, worker protections, and employer concerns in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key issues included tipped wages, unemployment benefits, and COVID-19 workplace policies. The committee will continue to deliberate on these matters, with potential amendments and further discussions expected to shape the final outcomes of the proposed bills.
