**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (May 10, 2021)**

On May 10, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on discussions, amendments, and votes on several bills related to criminal justice and public safety, as well as procedural matters and subcommittee appointments. Key highlights from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Senate Bill 34**:  
   The bill aimed to tighten the definition of synthetic drugs to facilitate enforcement. Concerns were raised about its potential impact on private sales, such as gardening or hunting supplies. After debate, the bill passed with a roll call vote of 13 yeas to 8 nays.

2. **Senate Bill 40**:  
   The committee debated an amendment adding the word "solely" to clarify that refusal to consent to a search alone cannot be grounds for detention. While some members argued the amendment provided necessary clarity, others deemed it unnecessary. The amendment passed with 11 yeas to 7 nays, and the bill itself passed with 18 yeas to 3 nays.

3. **Senate Bill 122**:  
   This omnibus bill included provisions on human trafficking, guardianship, and legal counsel for autism. The committee considered an amendment that removed certain sections and added others. The transcript ended before a final vote was taken.

4. **Senate Bill 141**:  
   The bill aimed to address delays in the state’s gun background check system. Some members expressed concerns about potential de facto gun registration and the involvement of state police in handgun background checks. Others emphasized the importance of protecting domestic violence victims. The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill (ITL) passed with 15 yay votes and 6 nay votes.

5. **Senate Amendments to House Bills**:  
   - **HB 239**: The Senate amended the bill to extend the statute of limitations for prosecuting assaults against minors from six years to three years. While some members preferred the original six-year extension, they acknowledged the three-year extension as an improvement.  
   - **Other Amendments**: The committee generally agreed to concur with Senate amendments, including one that added "sheriffs" to a bill concerning the destruction of valueless property by police.

6. **HB 579**:  
   The bill requires public notice before immigration checkpoints. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of enforcing such requirements for federal checkpoints, but the bill aims to address instances where American citizens are detained.
