**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (May 12, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened virtually on May 12, 2021, via Zoom due to the ongoing state of emergency. The meeting focused on the fiscal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of federal stimulus programs, challenges in revenue estimation, and legislative considerations. Key discussions and takeaways are summarized below:

### **1. Virtual Meeting and Public Access**
The meeting was conducted remotely, with public access provided through Zoom or telephone. All votes were conducted by roll call to ensure transparency.

### **2. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan Impact**
The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) provided an update on the fiscal implications of forgiven PPP loans. Under current law, forgiven PPP loans are considered taxable income but are offset by deductions for business expenses, resulting in a minimal net impact on state revenues. However, **Senate Bill 3 (SB3)**, which proposes to exclude forgiven PPP loans from taxable income, could have a significant fiscal impact, estimated at $100 million over several years, with the bulk of the effect expected in FY22.

### **3. Revenue Anomalies and Estimation Challenges**
The committee highlighted the difficulties in estimating state revenues due to the pandemic and federal stimulus programs. The pandemic initially caused a significant negative anomaly in revenues, while stimulus programs created a positive anomaly. The DRA emphasized the complexity of quantifying the exact impact of these competing factors. Additionally, this was the first year of implementing **market-based sourcing** for service companies, introducing further uncertainty into revenue estimates. Compliance and audit activities related to this new tax provision are expected to begin after returns are filed in the fall.

### **4. Taxpayer Composition and Revenue Analysis**
The committee examined the breakdown of tax revenue from different taxpayer types, particularly focusing on extension payments. Data from the DRA revealed that about 49% of $197.4 million in extension payments came from combined filers, primarily larger corporations. The DRA also noted challenges in separating wage increases from profit increases in the current data, particularly for high-income earners, and its effect on Business Profits Tax (BPT) revenues.

### **5. Stimulus Impact on Revenue and Economic Activity**
The committee explored how federal stimulus programs, including the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), influenced consumer spending and state revenues. Increased spending was observed in sectors like home improvement and retail, while personal savings reached record highs, indicating a mixed economic impact. Anecdotal evidence suggested economic recovery in some sectors (e.g., appliances, home renovations), while others, such as hospitality and tourism, continued to struggle.

### **6. Legislative Bills and Future Discussions**
The committee discussed **SB3** and its potential impact on state revenues, with plans to continue analyzing its implications over multiple fiscal years. **Senate Bill 22 (SB22)** was also mentioned, with plans to address it in upcoming sessions. The committee emphasized the need for clarity on ARPA spending guidelines to avoid jeopardizing federal funding and expressed interest in collaborating with local chambers of commerce to understand the pandemic's impact on small businesses.

### **7. Revenue Estimates and ARPA Funds**
The DRA provided updated revenue estimates for FY21 but has not yet adjusted projections for FY22 and FY23 due to uncertainty surrounding ARPA funds. The committee stressed the importance of understanding ARPA guidelines to inform future budget adjustments and ensure compliance with federal requirements.

### **8. Economic Recovery and Sectoral Impacts**
Representatives acknowledged the challenge of quantifying the pandemic's net economic impact on state revenues. While some sectors showed signs of recovery, others faced ongoing struggles, highlighting the uneven nature of the economic rebound.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of assessing the pandemic's fiscal impact on New Hampshire, particularly in light of federal stimulus programs and legislative changes like SB3. The committee emphasized the need for accurate revenue projections, clarity on ARPA spending rules, and continued analysis of legislative proposals to navigate the state's economic recovery effectively. Future discussions will focus on refining revenue estimates, addressing legislative bills, and collaborating with stakeholders to better understand the pandemic's economic effects.
