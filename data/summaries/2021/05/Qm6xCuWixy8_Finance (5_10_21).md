The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on May 10, 2021, focused on a range of bills addressing finance, public health, broadband expansion, and education funding. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **Senate Bill 77 (Sheriffs’ Fees):**
   - The bill proposed increasing sheriffs’ service fees, which had not been updated in over a decade. 
   - Testimony was provided by **Senator Lou D’Alessandro** (prime sponsor), **Sheriff Dominic Ricciardi** (Carroll County Sheriff), and **Marissa Chase** (NH Association for Justice).
   - An amendment was introduced to allow county delegations to adjust fees annually based on the Consumer Price Index. However, confusion arose over the amendment's wording, which appeared to replace the entire bill rather than supplement it. The committee recessed the discussion to allow for corrections to the amendment.
   - Earlier in the meeting, **Amendment 1363**, which adjusted the bill’s effective date, was adopted unanimously.

2. **Senate Bill 85 (Broadband Expansion):**
   - This bill aimed to improve broadband access, particularly in underserved rural areas, by establishing a matching grant program. The program would split funding 50-50 between state/federal funds and local entities (municipalities, counties, or communication districts).
   - **Senator Jeb Bradley** (prime sponsor) emphasized the importance of broadband for telemedicine, education, and remote work.
   - **Amendment 1328**, introduced by Senator Bradley and Representative Ober, ensured the program would continue if the Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI) was dissolved, transferring its duties to the Department of Energy. This amendment passed unanimously.
   - Another proposed amendment would allow projects in the planning phase as of January 1, 2021, to be eligible for funding. This was not finalized during the meeting but will be addressed in another bill.
   - Public testimony highlighted the urgent need for reliable broadband, with concerns raised about the high costs of infrastructure for small towns and the need for state support to reduce financial burdens on residents. The bill was approved unanimously by the committee and moved to consent due to its non-monetary nature.

3. **Senate Bill 82 (Full-Day Kindergarten Funding):**
   - The bill aimed to correct a funding issue for school districts that transitioned from part-time to full-day kindergarten. 
   - **Senator Regina Birdsall** (prime sponsor) explained that the bill addressed an error in the previous omnibus bill, ensuring funding for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
   - **Mark Manganiello** from the Department of Education confirmed the funding was already included in the budget.
   - After debate, the committee voted **12-9** to declare the bill inexpedient to legislate (ITL), as the funding was already secured in the budget.

4. **Senate Bill 98 (SNAP Incentive Program):**
   - This bill proposed creating a SNAP incentive program in state statute, allowing SNAP shoppers to purchase additional fruits and vegetables by matching their purchases.
   - Testimony in support of the bill was provided by **Senator Becky Whitley**, **Brendan Cornwell** from the NH Food Bank, and other stakeholders.
   - The committee voted **11-9** to retain the bill, with the expectation that it would be funded in the state budget.

5. **Senate Bill 152 (Affordable Housing Programs):**
   - This bill aimed to address affordable housing initiatives. Testimony from the Department of Health and Human Services indicated that the provisions in the bill were already covered by existing programs.
   - The committee voted **20-0** to declare the bill inexpedient to legislate (ITL), as the proposed measures were redundant.

### **Other Bills:**
- **Senate Bill 82**: Voted inexpedient to legislate (ITL).
- **Senate Bill 85**: Voted ought to pass as amended.

### **Announcements:**
- A tour of the Secure Psychiatric Unit was scheduled for members of Division Three, with plans to arrange another tour for other interested committee members.
- The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which was passed without a roll call.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes:**
- The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on addressing critical issues such as broadband expansion, affordable housing, and public health initiatives like the SNAP incentive program.
- Broadband expansion emerged as a priority, with strong support for state and federal funding to bridge the digital divide in rural areas.
- Technical challenges with remote participation, including audio issues and confusion over amendments, were noted but did not prevent the committee from making progress on key bills.
- The committee’s decisions reflected a balance between addressing immediate needs (e.g., broadband, sheriffs’ fees) and avoiding redundancy (e.g., affordable housing, kindergarten funding).

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of state support for critical infrastructure and public health programs, while also ensuring efficient use of resources by avoiding duplication of existing efforts.
