#### 2. **SB 46 (Electronic Poll Books)**
   - **Objective**: Allow cities and towns to use electronic poll books beyond the current trial program.
   - **Concerns**: Implementation timelines and budget implications for municipalities were discussed, as this would be a local expense. The Secretary of State’s office expressed no issues with the timeline in SB 46 but noted concerns in SB 83.

   - **Objective**: Address various election-related issues, including disqualification rules for election officials, election information portals, recount fees, candidate statements, and optional town meeting procedures.
   - **Focus**: The committee concentrated on **Part 1**, which deals with moderators who are candidates handling ballots. Members debated the constitutional and practical implications of allowing moderators to delegate their duties during elections. Concerns included conflicts of interest, unfair advantages, and the loss of experienced election officials. Suggestions included further study or amendments to clarify roles and responsibilities.

#### 5. **Pre-processing of Absentee Ballots**

#### 9. **Attorney General’s Role**

   - **Concerns**: Expanding this power without clear limits could affect election integrity.

#### 10. **Study Committee on Post-Election Audits**

#### 13. **Recount Fees**
   - **Debate**: Fees for recounts were discussed, with some arguing that current fees are too low and do not cover costs, while others felt fees should remain affordable for candidates. The need to discourage unnecessary recounts while ensuring fairness was highlighted.

#### 14. **Absentee Ballot Processing**
   - **Amendment**: Streamline the pre-processing of absentee ballots, allowing moderators to identify and correct errors in affidavits and applications before Election Day. The amendment aimed to address logistical issues and ensure voters have the opportunity to correct mistakes without being disenfranchised.

#### 15. **Legibility of Reports**
   - **Discussion**: Require political committees to submit legible reports, with concerns raised about forcing candidates to use electronic formats. It was clarified that handwritten reports would still be acceptable as long as they are legible.

#### 16. **Fiscal Year Budgets**
