**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting on May 17, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on May 17, 2021, to discuss and potentially amend several Senate bills, including **SB 78**, **SB 91**, and **SB 113**, as well as **House Bill 315**. The meeting began with technical reminders and a postponement of a scheduled presentation due to the Senate Finance Committee’s involvement.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **House Bill 315**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 315**, which the Senate had amended by incorporating language from **Senate Bill 109** and adding a floor amendment related to utility property tax exclusions. While the chair expressed a preliminary inclination to concur with the Senate’s amendments, several committee members requested additional time to review the changes. The decision was deferred to the next executive session.

#### **Senate Bill 78**
The focus shifted to **SB 78**, which proposes amendments to the Renewable Energy Fund. A suggested amendment would require fiscal committee approval for expenditures in the event of a budget veto or continuing resolution. Representative Lynn Ober emphasized the need for legislative oversight during budget crises to ensure the continuity of renewable energy projects, which often face delays due to budget uncertainties. Committee members debated the bill’s language, particularly regarding the fund’s non-lapsing status and continual appropriation. The chair noted that the committee would revisit these issues in future sessions.

#### **Senate Bill 91**
The committee spent significant time discussing **SB 91**, an omnibus energy bill with multiple sections. Key points included:
1. **Tariff Clarification and Network Load Calculation**: Members discussed how certain generation could impact the calculation of network load and capacity charges during peak demand.
2. **Part Four (Limited Electrical Producers)**: There was extensive debate about avoided transmission costs, compensation mechanisms for producers, and the segregation of transmission and distribution costs. Concerns were raised about the clarity and implementation of these provisions.
3. **Study Committee Proposal**: To address uncertainties, a proposal was made to create a study committee to further examine Part Four, with findings due by November 18, 2021. The effective date of Part Four was suggested to be delayed by 18 months to accommodate this process.
4. **Energy Storage and Peak Demand Management**: Discussions highlighted the importance of energy storage in reducing peak demand and avoiding costly transmission investments. Members emphasized the potential benefits of distributed energy resources, such as batteries, in lowering overall energy costs.
5. **Grid Resilience and Cybersecurity**: Representative Callie Pitts raised concerns about grid resilience and cybersecurity, though these issues were deemed outside the scope of the current bill discussion.
6. **Energy Data Hub**: Representative Quick mentioned the **Energy Data Hub**, a statewide energy data platform progressing through a settlement process with utilities, which will aid in managing a more diverse and decentralized energy system.

#### **Senate Bill 113**
The committee also discussed **SB 113**, with a proposed amendment moving language related to hydrogen derived from biomass fuels, water, or methane gas from **SB 113** to **SB 78**. This change was suggested by Senator Bradley and agreed upon by stakeholders.

### **Overall Themes and Next Steps**
The meeting underscored the complexities of modernizing New Hampshire’s energy policies, particularly in balancing incentives for renewable energy and storage with the need for fair compensation and avoiding unintended cost shifts. Legal and practical challenges were highlighted, especially regarding the integration of transmission and distribution systems and compliance with federal regulations.

The committee agreed to draft an amendment for **SB 91**, which would include a study committee for Part Four, delay its effective date, and eliminate Part Five of the bill. An executive session to review the amendment was planned for the following week. Discussions on **SB 78**, **SB 91**, and **SB 113** will continue in future sessions, with a focus on ensuring legislative oversight and addressing the technical and financial complexities of renewable energy and storage initiatives.
