The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee meeting on May 3, 2021, centered on discussions surrounding several energy-related bills, with a focus on renewable energy standards, funding mechanisms, energy storage, and regulatory clarity. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance legislative oversight, stakeholder interests, and practical implementation of energy policies.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **Senate Bill 113: Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)**
- The bill aims to establish a uniform alternative compliance payment (ACP) rate of $55 across all renewable energy classes, ensuring consistency in New Hampshire’s RPS. It also includes provisions to qualify hydrogen derived from water for renewable energy credits.
- Senator Jeb Bradley, the bill’s sponsor, suggested retaining the bill in committee to allow more time for consensus-building among stakeholders. Committee members raised questions about the $55 rate’s rationale, its impact on electricity rates, and whether the bill should be retroactive. There was also discussion about potentially separating the hydrogen provision into a standalone bill.

#### **Senate Bill 78: Renewable Energy Fund Restoration**
- This bill seeks to restore the continuous appropriation of funds from the renewable energy fund, a provision removed in 2017. Representative Lynn Ober, who was expected to explain the 2017 change, did not attend, leaving committee members confused about the rationale behind the change.
- Karen Kampton from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) highlighted challenges caused by the current funding structure, where unspent funds cannot be carried over, leading to delays in renewable energy projects. The committee discussed balancing legislative oversight with the efficient use of dedicated funds, ensuring they are used for their intended purposes without unnecessary interference.

#### **Renewable Energy Fund and Local Control**
- Discussions revealed inefficiencies in the renewable energy fund due to fiscal year misalignment, which hampers project implementation. Concerns were raised about the fund being diverted for unintended purposes during budget crises.
- There was debate over a provision granting consumers the right to install energy storage systems without unnecessary restrictions. Some representatives argued this could undermine local zoning authority, leading to a proposed amendment to ensure compliance with local regulations.

#### **Senate Bill 91: Energy Storage and Market Regulations**
- The committee focused on technical and legal aspects of energy storage, transmission costs, and the role of limited producers in the electricity market. Key discussions included:
  - **Language and Definitions**: Refining terms like "fair share" and "just and reasonable" to ensure clarity and fairness for utilities and customers.
  - **Avoided Transmission Costs**: Crediting limited producers for avoided transmission costs, provided transactions occur within the same distribution grid and do not require interstate transmission.
  - **Energy Storage and Regulation**: Recognizing the value of energy storage systems, such as batteries, in grid stability and ancillary services like frequency regulation.
  - **Jurisdictional Issues**: Creating a limited within-state wholesale electricity market separate from the ISO New England market to align with state authority over retail and within-state wholesale sales.
  - **Rulemaking and Consumer Protection**: Tasking the PUC with establishing procedures for limited producers to sell electricity at wholesale and retail levels, protecting ratepayers from excessive costs while encouraging local energy production.

#### **General Themes**
- **Funding and Efficiency**: The committee emphasized the need for efficient use of the renewable energy fund, addressing delays caused by fiscal year misalignment and ensuring funds are used for their intended purposes.
- **Local Control vs. State Regulation**: Debates highlighted the tension between local zoning authority and state-level energy policies, particularly regarding energy storage installations.
- **Regulatory Clarity**: Efforts were made to refine legislative language to avoid ambiguity, ensuring fairness and practicality in energy policy implementation.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Proposed amendments were developed in consultation with utilities, clean energy advocates, and legislators, aiming to balance diverse interests while promoting energy innovation and reliability.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to continue discussions, finalize amendments, and seek further input from stakeholders, including Representative Lynn Ober and the PUC. A work session on Senate Bill 91 was scheduled to address energy storage system rules and utility approval processes. The committee aimed to draft amendments, remove redundant language, and hold another meeting by May 13th or later to finalize the bill.

Overall, the meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to advancing renewable energy, supporting local energy production, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks to protect consumers and promote energy reliability.
