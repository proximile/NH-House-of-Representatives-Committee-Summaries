**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting on May 4, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on May 4, 2021, to discuss and debate several key bills, including **Senate Bill 143 (SB 143)**, **Senate Bill 134 (SB 134)**, **Senate Bill 95 (SB 95)**, and **Senate Bill 126 (SB 126)**. The meeting, held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on issues ranging from public assistance and data privacy to tenant protections and remote public meetings. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Senate Bill 143 (Omnibus Bill)**
SB 143, an omnibus bill addressing various legal and administrative issues, was a major focus of the meeting. Key amendments and discussions included:
- **Recovery of Unauthorized Payments (Part 2)**: An amendment to remove this section, which allowed the Department of Health and Human Services to retroactively recover payments deemed unauthorized, passed 19-1. Concerns were raised about penalizing recipients for department errors, especially during the pandemic.
- **Cybersecurity (Part 8)**: An amendment to remove this section failed 10-10, as it was seen as a non-mandatory suggestion rather than a statutory requirement.
- **Medical Data Sharing and Emergency Medical Services (Parts 9 & 10)**: An amendment to remove these sections passed 11-9 due to concerns about sharing non-anonymized medical data and unclear language.
- **Civil Asset Forfeiture (Part 12)**: An amendment incorporating provisions from HB 31, which strengthens due process protections in civil asset forfeiture cases, passed 18-2.

### **Senate Bill 134**
SB 134 addressed various legal and technical issues, including:
- **Electronic Signatures and Encryption**: Representatives debated the accessibility and security of electronic signatures, particularly for vulnerable populations. Amendments refined definitions and addressed concerns from county registries.
- **Amendments**: Several amendments were proposed, including adjustments to structured settlements, civil liability for highway damage, and prohibitions on drones and lasers under the Aeronautics Act.
- **Mental Health Appropriation**: A $210,000 appropriation for mental health intervention training programs was included, though some representatives expressed discomfort with inserting appropriations into omnibus bills without proper finance committee review.

### **Senate Bill 95 (Remote Public Meetings)**
SB 95 focused on continuing remote access to public meetings post-pandemic. Key points included:
- **Remote Meetings**: The bill codified the governor’s emergency order allowing remote public meetings, ensuring transparency and accessibility. A study committee was established to assess the effectiveness of remote meetings, with a sunset clause set for July 1, 2022.
- **Public Participation**: Testifiers highlighted the benefits of remote meetings, including increased accessibility for individuals with disabilities, childcare responsibilities, or transportation challenges. Over 100 individuals supported the bill, emphasizing its positive impact on civic engagement.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives raised questions about recording requirements and the need for roll call votes during virtual meetings to ensure accountability.

### **Senate Bill 126 (Tenant Protections)**
SB 126 addressed tenant protections and housing assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic:
- **Tenant Protections**: The bill allowed tenants to cure non-payment of rent up to the eviction hearing date and removed the requirement for an eviction notice to access rental assistance. It also aligned New Hampshire’s discrimination laws with federal fair housing laws.
- **Support**: The bill was praised as a win-win for tenants and landlords, with housing advocates emphasizing the importance of keeping tenants in their homes amid a 1% rental vacancy rate and high housing costs. Landlord and tenant groups supported the bill’s balanced approach.

### **Key Themes and Concerns**
Throughout the meeting, several recurring themes emerged:
- **Transparency and Due Process**: Amendments sought to protect individuals from government overreach, particularly in cases of public assistance errors and civil asset forfeiture.
- **Data Privacy**: Concerns were raised about the sharing of medical and motor vehicle records, with some representatives advocating for stricter protections.
- **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Remote public meetings and tenant protections were seen as ways to remove barriers to participation and housing stability.
- **Legislative Process**: Some representatives criticized the use of omnibus bills, arguing that combining unrelated provisions undermines the legislative process.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with votes on several amendments and bills, reflecting differing opinions on the proposed changes. The committee planned to reconvene to finalize discussions on pending amendments and bills, including **Senate Bill 96**, and to hold executive sessions as needed. The discussions highlighted the complexities of legislative decision-making, with representatives grappling with detailed amendments, procedural issues, and broader concerns about the legislative process.
