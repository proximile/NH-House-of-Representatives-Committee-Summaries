### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (May 13, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened virtually on May 13, 2021, to discuss a range of education-related bills and issues. The meeting focused on workforce development, education access, student safety, special education funding, Career and Technical Education (CTE), environmental education, and legislative amendments. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Workforce Development and Education Access**
- **Senate Bill 44: New Hampshire Work Pathway Program**  
  The bill aims to establish a workforce pathway program to help underemployed or unemployed individuals gain skills and certifications for higher-paying jobs in high-demand industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and construction. While some representatives questioned the necessity of the program given the state’s low unemployment rate (3%), others highlighted its potential to streamline workforce training efforts and improve access to federal grants. Concerns about reliance on federal funding led to suggestions for a sunset clause to terminate the program if funding dries up.

- **Senate Bill 147: FAFSA Requirement for Graduation**  
  Part One of the bill proposes requiring high school students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or file a waiver to graduate. Supporters argued this would increase access to financial aid and encourage postsecondary education, while opponents raised concerns about privacy, bureaucracy, and the burden on families not planning to attend college. The waiver process was debated, with some suggesting guidance counselors should focus on assisting students rather than making FAFSA completion mandatory.

### **2. Student Safety and Transportation**
- **Senate Bill 147: Central Registry for Abuse and Neglect Reports**  
  Part Two of the bill proposes a central registry for reports of abuse and neglect involving school staff, including bus drivers. Concerns were raised about extending the registry to occasional bus drivers (e.g., for field trips), as it might discourage companies from providing these services. The committee debated whether the registry should apply to all drivers or only those regularly transporting students.

- **Motor Coaches and Contract Carriers**  
  The committee discussed the legality and safety of using motor coaches for school transportation, as current law mandates yellow school buses and certified drivers. Safety concerns included the lack of emergency exits and drills on motor coaches. Proposals included allowing motor coaches with federal safety inspections and requiring emergency exit training. Liability issues and enforcement challenges were also highlighted.

- **Background Checks for School Personnel**  
  The bill aims to create a registry to track individuals with histories of abuse or neglect to prevent their employment in schools. Discussions focused on whether bus drivers, coaches, and volunteers should undergo the same stringent background checks as certified educators. Concerns were raised about the economic impact and driver shortages in the commercial bus industry if additional certification requirements were imposed.

### **3. Special Education and Catastrophic Aid**
- **Funding for Small Communities**  
  The committee discussed a proposal to increase state aid for catastrophic special education costs in communities with 1,000 or fewer residents. Questions arose about how "significant financial harm" would be determined and whether the aid would be equitable for larger districts facing similar financial strain. The term "community" was not clearly defined, leading to confusion about eligibility.

- **Cooperative Agreements and Emergency Aid**  
  Representatives sought clarity on how cooperative agreements between school districts and towns handle special education costs, particularly for towns without schools. The availability of a $250,000 emergency aid fund was discussed, though it was noted that the fund has rarely been used.

### **4. Career and Technical Education (CTE)**
- **Transportation and Tuition Reimbursement**  
  The committee discussed changes to transportation reimbursement for students attending regional CTE centers, including those in alternative education programs. Concerns were raised about funding availability, as the current budget falls short of covering actual transportation costs. The state reimburses up to 75% of CTE tuition, with the remaining 25% covered by the student’s resident school district.

- **Expanding CTE Programs**  
  With many CTE centers over-enrolled and conducting lotteries to select students, the committee explored expanding CTE offerings, including online programs and after-hours courses. Questions were raised about transportation and tuition costs for private and homeschool students attending CTE programs.

### **5. Environmental and Outdoor Recreation Education**
- **Curriculum Integration**  
  The committee debated the inclusion of "environmental skills" in education criteria, with some arguing that technical and interpersonal skills already cover the necessary competencies. Discussions focused on integrating environmental science and outdoor recreation education into the curriculum, emphasizing lifelong learning and practical applications.

- **Yoga and Fitness Instruction**  
  Representatives debated whether advanced yoga classes should be classified as vocational training under state regulations. Stakeholders argued that such classes are primarily recreational and should not be subject to the same regulations as career schools.

### **6. Legislative Amendments and Federal Funding**
- **Amendments to Bills**  
  The committee reviewed amendments to Senate Bill 135, including proposals for fiscal capacity disparity grants and free and reduced-price lunch funding. These amendments aim to allocate state funds more equitably based on property values and poverty levels, extending funding through FY 2023.

- **Committee of Conference Actions**  
  The committee discussed two bills requiring Committee of Conference action: HB 320 (civics competency assessment for high school graduation) and HB 432 (offenses preventing employment in schools). The chair planned to poll committee members on these bills and make recommendations for concurrence or non-concurrence.

- **Federal Pandemic Funding**  
  Approximately $600 million in federal pandemic-related funding was allocated to New Hampshire schools, though detailed disbursement information was still pending.
