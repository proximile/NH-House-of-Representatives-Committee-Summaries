**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee Meeting on May 10, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on May 10, 2021, to discuss several key bills addressing municipal governance, energy policy, housing, and broadband infrastructure. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

---

### **Senate Bill 84: Village Districts and the Purple Paint Law**
The committee focused on **Senate Bill 84**, which originally aimed to clarify that village districts are subject to the right-to-know law (RSA 91-A). However, the bill was amended in the Senate to include a **"purple paint law"**, allowing landowners to use purple paint markings to indicate no trespassing, replacing traditional signage. Key points included:
- **Representative Ellen Reed** advocated for reinserting the original purple paint provision, highlighting its benefits for landowners in rural areas, such as cost savings and reduced sign tampering.
- **Senator Reagan**, the bill’s sponsor, clarified that the primary intent was to ensure village districts comply with the right-to-know law, but he was unaware of the purple paint amendment.
- **Christina Snyder**, a public member, supported the amendment, emphasizing the practicality of purple paint for property owners.
- **Cordell Johnson** (NH Municipal Association) noted that village districts are already subject to the right-to-know law as political subdivisions, but the bill aims to make this explicit.
- **Linda Dion** argued that the purple paint provision should be handled by the Fish and Game Committee or another relevant committee, as it pertains to criminal trespass rather than municipal governance.

The committee debated splitting the bill into its two parts and referring the purple paint provision to the appropriate committee. The chair, **Representative Dolan**, indicated further consultation with House leadership and the Fish and Game Committee would determine the next steps.

### **Senate Bill 86: Construction Inspections, Housing Conservation, and Energy Systems**
**Senate Bill 86** was divided into three parts, each addressing distinct issues:

#### **Part 1: Third-Party Inspections for Construction Projects**
- The bill allows planning boards flexibility in requiring third-party inspections for construction projects, particularly for smaller projects where third-party involvement can increase costs.
- Contractors can verify compliance, but municipalities retain the authority to require third-party reviews if necessary.
- Supported by the NH Association of General Contractors and the NH Municipal Association, the bill aims to reduce costs while maintaining project oversight.

#### **Part 2: Re-establishing the Housing and Conservation Planning Program (HCPP)**
- This voluntary program assists municipalities in planning for affordable housing while conserving natural resources.
- It offers technical assistance and matching grants but does not request funding at this time.
- Supported by housing advocates, conservation groups, and realtors, the program seeks to balance housing needs with environmental preservation.

#### **Part 3: Prohibiting Restrictions on Heating and Energy Systems**
- The bill prevents municipalities from adopting measures that restrict the choice of heating systems or energy providers (e.g., gas, oil, solar, geothermal).
- It ensures consumer choice and protects local energy businesses (e.g., propane and heating oil providers).
- Concerns were raised about potential impacts on local zoning authority, but no municipalities have attempted to impose such restrictions.

The committee discussed the importance of protecting consumer choice, reducing costs, and balancing local autonomy with state-level oversight. Stakeholders from the construction, housing, and energy industries expressed strong support for the bill.

### **Senate Bill 86, Part 3: Local Control Over Energy Sources**
The committee held a detailed discussion on **Part 3 of SB 86**, which addresses local control over energy sources for heating homes and businesses:
- The bill aims to prevent municipalities from mandating electric-only heating systems, ensuring **consumer choice** in energy sources (e.g., propane, natural gas, heating oil).
- **Energy industry representatives** testified in support, emphasizing the economic impact on local businesses and the importance of energy diversity, especially during extreme weather.
- Concerns were raised about the **electrify everything movement**, with testifiers citing examples of ineffectiveness in cold weather and increased costs in neighboring states.
- The **NH Building Officials Association** noted that the bill bypassed input from the Building Code Review Board, potentially creating conflicts with existing codes.
- The discussion highlighted the need to balance **consumer choice**, **economic concerns**, and **environmental goals**, with strong support for the bill from energy providers.

### **Senate Bill 88: Broadband Infrastructure and Communication Districts**
**Senate Bill 88** is an omnibus bill addressing broadband deployment and regulation, divided into three parts:

#### **Part 1: Formation of Communication Districts**
- Allows municipalities to form communication districts for broadband purposes, streamlining the approval process by removing redundant steps.

#### **Part 2: One-Touch Make-Rady Process**
- Introduces a **"one-touch make-ready"** process to simplify the deployment of wires on utility poles, reducing delays and costs.

#### **Part 3: Streamlined RFI Process**
- Streamlines the Request for Information (RFI) process for municipalities issuing bonds to finance broadband infrastructure.
- Requires providers to submit detailed service maps and creates a centralized list of interested providers maintained by the Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI).

Key points from the discussion included:
- **Senator Jay Kahn** emphasized the need for clarity in forming communication districts.
- **Senator Jeb Bradley** highlighted the benefits of the one-touch process for accelerating broadband expansion.
- **Mark Dean** (NH Electric Cooperative) and **Carol Monroe** (ValleyNet) supported the bill, stressing the importance of universal access and last-mile connectivity.
- **Jim Isaac** (public member) suggested defining **adequate broadband service** beyond the FCC’s 25/3 Mbps standard, focusing on underserved areas.

The committee discussed potential amendments, including immediate implementation of Part 2 and clarifying the role of OSI in maintaining provider lists.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted procedural challenges in handling omnibus bills, the importance of ensuring amendments are germane to the committee’s jurisdiction, and the need for collaboration across committees and stakeholders. Key themes included **consumer choice**, **local autonomy**, **economic impact**, and **environmental goals**, with strong support for bills addressing energy diversity, housing conservation, and broadband infrastructure. The committee deferred decisions on some bills pending further consultation and amendments.
