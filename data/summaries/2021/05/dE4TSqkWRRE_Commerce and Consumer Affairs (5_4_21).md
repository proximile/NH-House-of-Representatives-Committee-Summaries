### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (May 4, 2021)

On May 4, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened via Zoom to discuss amendments to **Senate Bill 125**, focusing on liquor-related legislation. The meeting addressed a range of issues, including nano brewery licensing, direct-to-consumer shipping, food requirements, and the **three-tier system** of alcohol distribution. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Nano Brewery Licensing and Operations**
- **Single-Location Limitation**: The committee proposed limiting nano breweries to one location, emphasizing that their licenses are designed for small-scale, hobbyist operations and are significantly cheaper than other licenses. Concerns were raised about allowing multiple locations or joint ventures, but the committee stressed the importance of maintaining the integrity of the **three-tier system** (producer, distributor, retailer).
- **Food Requirements**: New Hampshire requires establishments serving alcohol to also offer food. While some members questioned this rule, especially for nano breweries, others supported it as a measure to promote responsible alcohol consumption. The compromise allowed nano breweries to serve **one pint** without food, but a second pint required a **nano plus license** and the presence of food, which could be provided by food trucks or third-party vendors.
- **Sample Sizes and Retail Outlets**: Nano brewers were granted the same privileges as other beverage manufacturers, allowing them to offer **4-ounce samples** or **16-ounce pints**. If food was available, a second pint could be served. These retail outlets would only sell the manufacturer’s products and could source food from third-party vendors.

### **2. Direct-to-Consumer Shipping**
- **In-State and Out-of-State Shipping**: The amendment allowed in-state beverage manufacturers to ship directly to New Hampshire consumers, aligning with existing law (RSA 178:27). Out-of-state direct shippers would still need to comply with existing regulations, including reporting the names and addresses of purchasers for tax compliance. The committee emphasized the importance of auditing shipments to ensure taxes were paid and alcohol was not shipped to underage individuals.
- **Quantity Limits**: The amendment proposed limiting the quantity of alcohol that could be shipped to individual consumers (e.g., 60 containers per year) as a political compromise to balance consumer access with the Liquor Commission’s revenue interests.
- **Repeal of Direct Shipper Limitations**: The committee proposed removing limitations that prevented out-of-state direct shippers from shipping beer to New Hampshire licensees, enabling businesses to access products not available locally.

### **3. The Three-Tier System**
- **Overview and Concerns**: The three-tier system, established post-Prohibition, separates manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers to prevent monopolies and ensure fair distribution. Several committee members expressed concerns about the erosion of this system, which has been bypassed in many liquor-related laws. The amendment sought to uphold the system while allowing limited direct shipping.
- **Future Review**: The committee acknowledged the need for a broader review of the three-tier system and its relevance in modern liquor legislation. Subcommittees were planned to further examine this issue, along with food requirements and other liquor-related concerns, with meetings expected to resume in September.

### **4. Compliance, Enforcement, and Taxation**
- **Auditing and Enforcement**: The Liquor Commission monitors compliance with shipping laws, ensuring taxes are paid and alcohol is not shipped to underage individuals. However, concerns were raised about the adequacy of resources for enforcement, especially with potential staff reductions. Some members criticized the Finance Committee’s decision to reduce enforcement staff.
- **Consumer Data Collection**: The amendment required manufacturers to report consumer data (names and addresses) for tax enforcement. This data is retained for the current year plus one, then archived for five years. Privacy concerns were raised, but the committee clarified the necessity of this measure for compliance.

### **5. Expansion of Beverage Definitions**
- **Non-Traditional Ingredients**: The committee addressed changes to the definition of "beverage" to include products made with non-traditional ingredients like sugar, allowing these products to enter the New Hampshire market through licensed wholesalers.

---

### **6. Stakeholder Involvement and Future Steps**
- **Stakeholder Input**: Some participants expressed frustration over changes that were not previously discussed with all stakeholders, highlighting the need for greater stakeholder involvement in the amendment process.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to hold an executive session the following Thursday to finalize the amendments and address outstanding questions. Members emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach to liquor laws, rather than incremental changes, to ensure consistency and address ongoing concerns.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to modernize New Hampshire’s alcohol regulations, balancing the needs of local businesses, consumer access, and regulatory oversight. Key areas of focus included nano brewery licensing, direct-to-consumer shipping, the three-tier system, and compliance enforcement. The committee emphasized the importance of stakeholder input and planned further discussions to address broader issues in the state’s liquor legislation.
