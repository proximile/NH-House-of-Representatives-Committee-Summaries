The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on May 25, 2021, to discuss **Senate Bill 3 (SB3)**, which addresses the tax treatment of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans forgiven under federal COVID-19 relief efforts. The meeting began with roll call, where members confirmed their attendance and locations. 

The committee focused on whether to exempt forgiven PPP loans from state business taxes, a decision with significant fiscal implications. The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) estimated that passing SB3 would reduce future tax revenues by **$99.4 million**, but current business tax revenues were running **$172.7 million above budget**, providing a cushion to absorb this loss.

Key points from the discussion:
1. **SB3’s Purpose**: The bill aligns New Hampshire with federal policy, ensuring that forgiven PPP loans are not taxed, as intended by the federal government’s stimulus program.
2. **Fiscal Impact**: Members debated the bill’s financial implications, with DRA noting that most PPP loans are expected to be forgiven. The committee acknowledged the uncertainty in exact figures but agreed the state could manage the revenue loss.
3. **Support for SB3**: Representatives emphasized the bill’s importance in supporting businesses recovering from the pandemic. They highlighted that PPP loans were a lifeline for many businesses, enabling them to retain employees and maintain operations.
4. **Amendment Discussions**: An amendment was proposed but ultimately not advanced, as members concluded that the bill should pass unamended to maintain consistency with federal policy.
5. **Vote**: The committee unanimously voted **23-0** to recommend SB3 for passage.

The meeting concluded with members expressing appreciation for the collaborative and thorough review process. The committee planned to meet the following day to discuss revenue projections and further details on PPP loans.
