### **Unemployment System and COVID-19 Impact**
The Department of Labor provided a detailed update on the state’s unemployment system, emphasizing its response to the unprecedented surge in claims during the pandemic. Key points included:
- **Unemployment Claims**: New Hampshire experienced a dramatic spike in unemployment claims, far exceeding levels seen during the Great Recession. Despite the surge, the state processed claims more efficiently than in previous crises.
- **Trust Fund Solvency**: The unemployment trust fund remains solvent, currently at $104 million, and is projected to end 2021 with $65-84 million. Federal funding and state measures have helped avoid borrowing, though replenishing the fund to pre-pandemic levels may take up to five years.
- **Overpayments**: Overpayments totaled $43 million, with $18 million attributed to individual errors and $25 million to agency errors. Individuals at fault are required to repay, while those not at fault may request waivers, particularly for federal overpayments. New Hampshire has a 97.6% accuracy rate in payments, higher than many other states.
- **Appeals Backlog**: A backlog of approximately 2,500 appeals exists, with the department handling around 500 cases per month. Efforts to hire additional hearing officers and law firms aim to expedite the process.
- **Work Search Requirement**: Starting May 23, 2021, unemployment claimants are required to actively search for work. The department is organizing virtual workshops and job fairs to assist in this transition.

### **Senate Bill 137: Tipped Wage Legislation**
The meeting also addressed **Senate Bill 137**, which seeks to adjust the tipped wage rate in New Hampshire. Key discussions included:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to prevent a significant increase in the tipped wage rate, currently tied to 45% of the federal minimum wage. If the federal minimum wage rises, the tipped wage could double, potentially straining the hospitality industry.
- **Arguments in Favor**: Supporters, including **Senator Bradley**, argued that a drastic increase in the tipped wage could lead to job losses, reduced hours, and increased reliance on technology. They emphasized that most tipped employees’ income comes from tips, not the base wage.
- **Concerns and Opposition**: Opponents, such as **Representative Horgan**, argued that tipped employees are already underpaid and overworked. They advocated for aligning the base wage with the federal minimum wage, with tips as additional income.
- **Industry Perspective**: **Henry Value**, representing the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, supported the bill, citing the financial pressures on the hospitality industry during and after the pandemic.
- **Technical Issues**: Questions arose about drafting errors in the bill and its interaction with federal wage laws.

### **Gig Workers and PUA Program**
The meeting addressed the challenges faced by gig workers and self-employed individuals:
- **Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)**: These workers are currently eligible for unemployment benefits under the federal PUA program, which is set to expire on September 4, 2021. Without PUA, they would not qualify for state unemployment benefits.
- **Transition Concerns**: The expiration of PUA raises concerns about the financial stability of gig workers, particularly as the economy recovers.

### **Communication and Transparency**
The Department of Labor emphasized its commitment to transparency and communication:
- **Claimant Outreach**: The department has been proactive in informing claimants about overpayments, appeals, and work search requirements.
- **Virtual Resources**: Virtual workshops and job fairs are being organized to help claimants transition back into the workforce.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the multifaceted challenges of managing labor issues during the pandemic, from ensuring the solvency of the unemployment trust fund to addressing the needs of tipped workers and gig employees. While the state has made significant strides in processing claims and maintaining financial stability, ongoing efforts are needed to address backlogs, overpayments, and the potential impact of federal wage increases. The discussions reflected a delicate balance between supporting workers and safeguarding the financial health of industries critical to New Hampshire’s economy.
