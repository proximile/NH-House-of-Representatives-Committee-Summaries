**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Meeting (May 13, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on May 13, 2021, to discuss and vote on a series of bills related to commerce, consumer affairs, and business regulation. The meeting, conducted electronically in accordance with House Rule 67 and the Governor’s Emergency Order No. 12, included public hearings, executive sessions, and roll call votes. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Business Relief and Funding**
- **Main Street Relief Fund**: Representatives debated the eligibility of businesses for financial relief, particularly those that opened after May 26, 2019, and were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While some argued these businesses should not receive assistance, others highlighted the challenges faced by new businesses. A motion to deem **Senate Bill 107** (financial assistance for post-May 2019 businesses) inexpedient to legislate passed, effectively killing the bill.
- **Transparency and Funding Mechanisms**: Concerns were raised about the adequacy and transparency of proposed funding mechanisms for business relief, particularly in the distribution of funds by the governor.

### **Liquor and Alcohol Legislation**
- **Direct Shipping of Liquor (SB 14)**: The committee unanimously recommended the bill for passage, placing it on the consent calendar.
- **Brew Pubs and Dogs (SB 17)**: The bill was retained (10-9) for further discussion due to contentious issues related to health laws and service dogs.
- **Liquor at Farmers' Markets (SB 18)**: An amendment clarifying the bill’s language was unanimously passed, and the bill was recommended for passage as amended.
- **Three-Tier System**: Discussions highlighted concerns about potential erosion of the three-tier system and its impact on small businesses and the economy.

### **Health and Insurance-Related Bills**
- **Collaborative Care Model (SB 59)**: The committee debated the necessity of the bill, which aims to make psychiatric care more readily available. A motion to recommend the bill as inexpedient to legislate passed (10-9).
- **Pharmacy Benefit Managers (SB 97)**: An amendment passed, but further revisions were deemed necessary, and the bill will be revisited in a future session.
- **Residency Under Auto Insurance Policies (SB 36)**: An amendment clarifying the bill’s language was unanimously passed, and the bill was recommended for passage as amended.
- **Membership and Risk Pools (SB 35)**: The committee voted (10-9) to recommend the bill as inexpedient to legislate, citing concerns about setting a bad precedent for future lobbyists.

### **Workplace and Consumer Protections**
- **Accommodations for Pregnant Workers (SB 68 and SB 69)**: Both bills were retained for further discussion. Supporters emphasized their importance for healthy pregnancies and workforce retention, while critics raised concerns about language equating pregnancy with a disability.
- **Investment Metal Contracts**: A bill allowing the delivery of precious metals to licensed depositories rather than requiring physical delivery to the purchaser was discussed. The bill aims to modernize New Hampshire’s laws and provide better security for investors.

### **Omnibus Legislation and Procedural Concerns**
- **Omnibus Bills**: Representatives expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in omnibus legislation, which combines multiple unrelated bills into a single package. There was a call for separate hearings for individual bills to ensure thorough consideration and public understanding.
- **Retention of Bills**: Several bills were retained for further review and refinement, particularly those with significant implications for the liquor industry, small businesses, and consumer protections. The formation of subcommittees was suggested for more detailed analysis.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Transparency and Clarity**: The committee emphasized the need for clear language and transparency in legislation, particularly in areas such as insurance procedures, medical cannabis regulations, and business relief.
- **Balancing Interests**: Discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing the needs of businesses, consumers, and regulatory frameworks, with a focus on adaptability and thoroughness in the legislative process.
- **Roll Call Votes**: Detailed roll call votes were conducted for each bill, reflecting the positions of individual committee members.

Overall, the meeting underscored the challenges of crafting effective legislation that addresses immediate needs while ensuring long-term stability and fairness for businesses and consumers in New Hampshire.
