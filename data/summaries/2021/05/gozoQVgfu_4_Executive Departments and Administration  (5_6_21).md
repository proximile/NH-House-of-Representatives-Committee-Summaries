**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Executive Departments and Administration (5/6/21):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration committee convened on May 6, 2021, to discuss **Senate Bill 58 (SB 58)** and **Senate Bill 104 (SB 104)**. The meeting, held electronically under the governor’s COVID-19 emergency orders, focused on streamlining administrative processes, standardizing practices, and addressing inefficiencies within state executive departments and professional licensing boards.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes:**

#### **Senate Bill 58: Standardizing Practices in the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC):**
SB 58 aims to modernize and standardize the administration of occupational regulation by the OPLC, which oversees 54 professional boards. Key areas of discussion included:

1. **Rulemaking Authority and Licensing Processes:**
   - The committee debated the removal of certain rulemaking capabilities, such as setting fees, application forms, and eligibility requirements, while retaining board authority over temporary licensure and misconduct complaints.
   - Amendments were proposed, including one from Senator Carson requiring pharmacy board inspectors to be licensed pharmacists or pharmacy technicians.
   - The bill advocates for replacing physical signatures on licenses with electronic signatures to streamline processes.

2. **Record Retention and Digital Transition:**
   - The OPLC highlighted inconsistencies in record retention policies across boards and proposed uniform retention schedules for licensing and disciplinary records.
   - A transition to digital record-keeping is underway, with a goal of moving all licensing and renewals online by August 2022 to reduce paper storage issues.

3. **Investigations and Hearings:**
   - Concerns were raised about the role of boards in investigations and hearings, particularly regarding due process and neutrality.
   - The committee discussed the need to separate investigative and adjudicative functions to ensure fairness and avoid conflicts of interest.

4. **Board Compensation:**
   - The bill proposes standardizing per diem compensation for board members, ensuring fair compensation for their time and expertise.

5. **Repeals and Amendments:**
   - SB 58 includes numerous repeals of existing statutes to align practices across boards. Amendments were proposed to ensure the OPLC consults with boards when contracting for services like investigations and hearings.
   - The committee emphasized the need to align the bill with recent legislative changes, particularly those in **Senate Bill 133**, which addressed investigations, hearings, and appeals.

#### **Senate Bill 104: Employee Classifications and Operational Efficiency:**
SB 104 focuses on reclassifying state employee positions and improving operational efficiency. Key points included:

1. **Employee Reclassification:**
   - The bill proposes reclassifying certain senior leadership positions from classified (hourly) to unclassified (salaried) to align with their managerial responsibilities and eliminate inefficiencies related to hourly tracking.

2. **Joint Committee on Employee Classification (JCEC):**
   - The committee proposed changing the JCEC chairmanship rotation from annually to biennially to improve operational efficiency.

3. **Reverse Auctions:**
   - While briefly mentioned, the bill includes provisions related to reverse auctions, though this topic was not extensively discussed.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes:**
- **Modernization and Streamlining:** Both bills emphasize the need to modernize administrative processes, reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, and transition to digital systems.
- **Consistency and Fairness:** The discussions highlighted the importance of standardizing practices across boards while ensuring fairness, due process, and neutrality in investigations and hearings.
- **Collaboration and Consultation:** Proposed amendments underscored the need for the OPLC to consult with professional boards when implementing changes, particularly regarding investigations, hearings, and record retention.

The committee agreed to review SB 58 further to address concerns and ensure consistency with existing legislation. The meeting reflected a broader effort to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of New Hampshire’s executive departments and professional licensing systems.
