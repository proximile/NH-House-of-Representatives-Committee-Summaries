The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on **Election Law** focused on several critical legislative discussions, primarily centered around proposed amendments to election laws, logistical challenges, and efforts to enhance transparency and fairness in the electoral process. The meeting addressed multiple bills, including **Senate Bill 83 (SB 83)** and **Senate Bill 89 (SB 89)**, and covered a wide range of topics, from absentee ballot processing to recount procedures and conflict-of-interest concerns. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key points discussed:

---

### **1. Election Law Amendments and Absentee Ballot Processing**
- **Pre-Processing Absentee Ballots**: The committee debated amendments to allow moderators to pre-process absentee ballots on specific days (Thursday through Saturday) before the election, rather than on the night before. This would help identify and correct errors in voter paperwork, ensuring accurate vote counts. There was disagreement over whether pre-processing should be mandatory or optional for towns and cities.
- **Logistical Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the feasibility of contacting voters to fix errors, particularly the night before the election. Representative Bergeron proposed an amendment to address conflicting language and logistical issues in **SB 89**.

### **2. Post-Election Audits**
- **Study on Audit Counting Devices**: The committee discussed establishing a committee to study post-election audit counting devices. However, concerns were raised about redundancy, as a similar study had already been conducted under **Senate Bill 283**. Members questioned whether another study was necessary or if existing legislation could address the issues.

### **3. Recount Procedures and Fees**
- **Recount Procedures**: The committee considered changes to recount procedures, specifically whether to count votes not part of the official election results (e.g., overvotes or undervotes). Some members argued this could enhance transparency, while others feared it might undermine public confidence in election results.
- **Recount Fees**: **SB 83** proposed increasing recount fees for various offices. While some members felt the fees were too low, others argued they should be higher to discourage unnecessary recounts. Concerns were also raised about the potential high cost of statewide recounts, with members suggesting that fees should reflect actual costs.

### **4. Moderator Roles and Conflict of Interest**
- **Candidates as Moderators**: The committee debated whether moderators who are also candidates for office (e.g., state representatives) should oversee elections. Concerns were raised about the perception of unfairness and conflicts of interest. While moderators often bring significant election experience, excluding them could eliminate potential conflicts but might also deprive towns of their expertise.
- **Public Perception**: Deputy Scanlon emphasized that voters often raise concerns about election officials working the polls while running for office, highlighting the importance of addressing these perceptions to maintain public trust.

### **5. Election Information Portal**
- **Proposed Portal**: **SB 83** proposed establishing an election information portal by January 1, 2023. Members expressed concerns about the feasibility of the timeline and the lack of a fiscal note detailing costs. Deputy Scanlon suggested 2024 as a more realistic deadline.
- **Technical Challenges**: Questions were raised about the state’s capacity to develop the portal, given the lack of existing infrastructure and staffing.

### **6. Attorney General’s Role**
- **Authority Over Ballot Boxes**: The committee debated expanding the attorney general’s authority to unseal and reseal ballot boxes during investigations. Some members were concerned about potential overreach, while others argued it was necessary for enforcing election laws.

### **7. Registrar of Probate Duties**
- **County-Level Responsibilities**: The committee reviewed a proposal to revert the duties of the registrar of probate to the county level, as outlined in the New Hampshire Constitution. Concerns were raised about funding, staffing, and the practicality of this change, given that these responsibilities had been shifted to the circuit court in 2011.

### **8. Itemized Statements by Political Committees**
- **Legibility Requirements**: **SB 83** standardized the format of financial reports submitted by political committees, requiring a minimum font size of 12. Some members expressed concerns about the burden this might place on grassroots candidates who file handwritten reports. It was clarified that handwritten reports would still be acceptable as long as they were legible, and electronic submission was not mandatory.

### **9. Optional Town Meeting Procedures**
- **Budget Expenditures**: The bill addressed how towns could expend funds before the fiscal year’s budget was approved, requiring expenditures to be consistent with prior years’ budgets. Members debated whether “prior year” should refer to the immediate past fiscal year or multiple prior years, ultimately agreeing to clarify the language to refer to the “immediately prior fiscal year.”

### **Key Themes**
- **Transparency and Public Trust**: The discussions emphasized the importance of maintaining public confidence in election processes through transparency, fairness, and clear procedures.
- **Practicality and Feasibility**: Concerns were raised about the logistical challenges, costs, and timelines associated with implementing new election-related initiatives.
- **Conflict of Interest**: Balancing the expertise of election officials with the need to avoid conflicts of interest was a recurring theme.
- **Clarity and Consistency**: The need for clear and consistent language in legislation to avoid confusion and ensure effective implementation was highlighted throughout the meeting.

### **Next Steps**
The committee agreed to delay the executive session to allow time for further amendments and discussions. Members volunteered to draft amendments addressing various sections of the bills, aiming to refine the legislation to ensure fairness, efficiency, and public trust in New Hampshire’s electoral process.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of election law reforms and the importance of balancing practicality, fairness, and public trust in shaping the state’s electoral framework.
