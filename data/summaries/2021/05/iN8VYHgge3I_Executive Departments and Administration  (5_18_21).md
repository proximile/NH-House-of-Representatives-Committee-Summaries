The May 18, 2021, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee, conducted electronically due to COVID-19, addressed a wide range of issues, primarily focusing on outdoor dining, telehealth licensing, vaccine mandates, and public health legislation. The discussions reflected a balance between supporting businesses, ensuring public health, and protecting individual rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **1. Outdoor Dining Extension**
The committee debated extending outdoor dining provisions, initially set to expire in 2022, until December 2023. Testimony from the Municipal Association and businesses emphasized the need for long-term planning and investment security. Amendments also addressed concerns about septic systems, requiring businesses to undergo Department of Environmental Services (DES) reviews for capacity expansions. Local municipalities retained control over approvals, ensuring flexibility for communities. The committee ultimately leaned toward extending the provision until 2023 to support businesses recovering from the pandemic.

### **2. Telehealth Licensing for Psychologists**
The committee reconsidered **Senate Bill 133**, which proposed amendments to allow emergency-licensed psychologists to transition to telehealth licenses. Dr. Debbie Warner, representing the Board of Psychologists, testified that this would ensure continuity of care for patients. The committee voted unanimously to adopt the amendment, recognizing the importance of telehealth in expanding access to mental health services during and after the pandemic.

### **3. Vaccine Mandates and Public Health**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on vaccine mandates, particularly in the context of COVID-19. Key discussions included:

- **Testimony and Debate**: Dr. Ryan Cole, an independent scientist, testified against vaccine mandates, citing the experimental status of COVID-19 vaccines under FDA emergency use authorization and raising concerns about long-term safety data. He argued that mandates could reduce public confidence in vaccines. In contrast, Dr. Beth Daly from the NH Department of Health and Human Services opposed the ban on vaccine mandates, emphasizing their importance for public health, especially in schools and healthcare settings.

- **Ethical and Legal Concerns**: Witnesses and representatives debated the ethical implications of mandating medical treatments, with some arguing that mandates violate civil liberties and constitutional rights. Others highlighted the necessity of mandates to protect vulnerable populations and achieve herd immunity.

- **Amendment 1468-H**: This amendment sought to prohibit discrimination based on vaccination status and limit vaccination requirements. Supporters argued it protected individual rights and privacy, while opponents warned it could undermine public health efforts and conflict with federal regulations like OSHA’s bloodborne pathogen standards.

### **4. Workplace Safety and Discrimination**
The committee addressed concerns about vaccine mandates in the workplace, particularly in industries like healthcare and construction. Discussions included:

- **Existing Exemptions**: Medical and religious exemptions for vaccinations have been in place since 1965, and employers are encouraged to engage in an interactive process with employees to address discrimination concerns.

- **Business Implications**: Representatives from the retail and construction industries expressed concerns about the practical challenges of enforcing vaccine mandates, including meeting contractual obligations with clients who require vaccinated workers.

- **Discrimination Concerns**: There were fears that proposed language could discriminate against religions not recognized by the IRS and violate the First Amendment.

### **5. Legislative Amendments and Public Health**
The committee reviewed and voted on several bills and amendments, including:

- **Senate Bill 58**: Amendments standardized operations across professional licensing boards, removing the requirement for physical signatures and clarifying processes for hiring investigators and legal services. The amendment passed unanimously.

- **Senate Bill 104**: Updates included salary classifications, reverse auctions for state procurement, and title changes within the Department of Administrative Services. The amendment also passed unanimously.

- **Summer Camps and Temporary Health Partners**: Provisions ensured that summer camps affected by the pandemic retained their non-conforming use status. Temporary health partners were clarified as tied to emergency waivers, preventing the creation of a permanent subclass of workers.

### **6. COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Efforts**
Durham and the University of New Hampshire (UNH) were highlighted for their comprehensive COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs. Despite initial restrictions limiting vaccinations to New Hampshire residents, UNH led in vaccination efforts. The committee also discussed the severity of COVID-19, emphasizing its life-altering consequences and the importance of continued vigilance, even with vaccination progress.

- **Vaccine Safety and Efficacy**: Concerns were raised about the potential risks of mandating vaccines for those who may not need them, particularly children and immunocompromised individuals.

- **Registry and Privacy Issues**: There was debate over vaccine registries, with some advocating for opt-in systems to respect patient privacy and others supporting opt-out systems for public health purposes.

- **Legal and Constitutional Issues**: The legality of vaccine mandates was scrutinized, with some arguing they could be unconstitutional and others emphasizing their necessity for public health.
