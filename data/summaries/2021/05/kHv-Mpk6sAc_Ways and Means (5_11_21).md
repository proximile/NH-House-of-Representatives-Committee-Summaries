#### **Key Legislative Discussions and Outcomes:**

1. **Senate Bill 22 (Lucky Seven Tickets)**:
   - The bill addresses the sale of Lucky Seven tickets, allowing for deal sizes up to 14,000 and ticket denominations of 25 cents, 50 cents, and $1.
   - A proposed amendment sought to make the 25-cent ticket optional for charitable organizations, as some were required to purchase these tickets even if unused.
   - The committee postponed the vote on SB 22 to allow for further discussion and potential amendment adjustments at the next meeting.

2. **Senate Bill 27 (Charitable Gaming Regulations)**:
   - The bill standardizes definitions of charitable organizations for games of chance, bingo, and Lucky Seven, reducing the registration waiting period from two years to one year.
   - An amendment allowed exceptions for organizations not fitting traditional categories but meeting specific criteria (e.g., registered with the Attorney General’s Charitable Trust Unit, operating primarily in NH, and using funds for NH residents).
   - The amendment passed 23-1, and the bill was supported as a housekeeping measure. However, concerns were raised about broader regulatory issues, including addiction and financial transparency in charitable gaming, prompting calls for a future commission to study these matters.

3. **Senate Bill 101 (Business Profits Tax Filing Threshold)**:
   - The bill, with an amendment (1367H) adjusting the business profits tax filing threshold, passed unanimously (24-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

4. **Senate Bill 103 (Out-of-State Business Emergency Work)**:

5. **Senate Bill 112 (Historic Racing)**:
   - The committee voted to retain the bill as a fallback position in case similar legislation (House Bill 626) encounters issues. The motion passed unanimously (24-0).

6. **Senate Bill 3 (PPP Loan Forgiveness Taxation)**:
   - The bill addresses the taxation of PPP loan forgiveness. Members emphasized the need to understand ARPA rules to avoid potential clawbacks of federal funds due to state tax cuts.
   - The committee planned to seek further clarification from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and Treasury officials.
