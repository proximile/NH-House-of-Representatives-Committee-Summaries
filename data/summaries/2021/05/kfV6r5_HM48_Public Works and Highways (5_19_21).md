The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on May 19, 2021, focused on **Senate Bill 26**, which addressed funding and formula issues between the Woodsville Village District and the Town of Haverhill. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 emergency, with public access provided via Zoom or telephone.

### Key Points:
1. **Roll Call and Attendance**: Members attended virtually or in person, with some noting their location and whether others were present with them.
2. **Motion to Retain Senate Bill 26**: A motion was made to retain the bill for further work over the summer and fall, with a recommendation to be voted on in January. The motion failed with a vote of **15 against and 6 in favor**.
   - Opponents argued that retaining the bill would delay resolving the issue and that the state should not dictate how towns spend their tax dollars.
   - Supporters believed more time was needed to address the complexities of the issue and potentially reach a resolution without legislative action.
3. **Motion to Pass Senate Bill 26**: After the retention motion failed, a motion to pass the bill was made and seconded. The bill passed with a vote of **20 in favor and 3 against**.
   - Supporters emphasized the need to resolve the issue promptly and avoid further delays.
   - Opponents felt the bill unfairly favored one party and that the issue should be resolved locally without state intervention.
4. **Discussion Highlights**:
   - Members debated whether the state should intervene in local financial disputes, with some arguing for local control and others highlighting the historical involvement of the state in this specific issue.
   - Concerns were raised about the fairness of the funding formula and the ongoing litigation between the parties.
5. **Next Steps**: The bill will proceed to the governor for consideration. The committee also discussed upcoming sessions, including meetings on Senate bills and potential committee of conference work on the capital budget (Senate Bill 25).
6. **Closing Remarks**: The chair thanked the committee for their diligence and acknowledged the challenges of conducting meetings in a hybrid format during the pandemic.

The meeting adjourned with no further business.
