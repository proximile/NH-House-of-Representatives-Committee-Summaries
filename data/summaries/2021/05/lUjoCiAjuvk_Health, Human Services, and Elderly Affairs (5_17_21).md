**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (May 17, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on May 17, 2021, to discuss several key pieces of legislation related to health, human services, and elderly affairs. The meeting, held electronically under the governor’s emergency order, included detailed discussions on **Senate Bill 162**, **Senate Bill 74**, and other related issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Therapeutic Cannabis Program (Senate Bill 162)**
The discussion centered on amendments to New Hampshire’s **therapeutic cannabis program**, focusing on plant count limits, patient access, and program oversight. Key points included:
- **Plant Count Limits**: Representatives debated capping plant counts at 25% of qualifying patients to prevent overproduction, as current Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) are not operating at full capacity, and excess cannabis must be destroyed due to lack of demand. Concerns were raised about balancing patient access with preventing oversupply and potential diversion.
- **Patient Access and Competition**: Emphasis was placed on ensuring patient access and fostering competition among ATCs to drive down prices. Some amendments failed due to concerns about unnecessary restrictions.
- **Program Oversight**: Parallels were drawn to pharmaceutical regulations, with representatives stressing the importance of maintaining controls and oversight in the therapeutic cannabis program.

### **2. Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (Senate Bill 162)**
The bill included updates to the **Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC)**, a framework facilitating foster care placements across state lines. Key discussions included:
- **Modernization of the ICPC**: The updated compact aims to improve the placement of children with relatives across state lines, ensuring safe and appropriate environments while allowing states to track and oversee placements.
- **Jurisdiction Concerns**: Representatives debated the ability of receiving states to take **emergency jurisdiction** over placed children, questioning safeguards to ensure children are returned to the sending state once the emergency is resolved.
- **Implementation Threshold**: The updated ICPC will only take effect once 35 states ratify it. As of the meeting, 11 states had approved the new version.
- **Committee Vote**: The bill passed with a **19-2 vote**, with a committee report and minority report to be prepared.

### **3. Advanced Directives for Health Care (Senate Bill 74)**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 74**, which focuses on improving advanced health care directives. Key points included:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to clarify the process for advanced directives, ensuring patients’ rights and preferences are respected. It includes provisions for surrogacy, decision-making hierarchies, and consent for clinical trials.
- **Concerns and Debates**: 
  - Some representatives raised concerns about ambiguous language, particularly regarding family involvement in decision-making and the removal of common-law spouses from the surrogate hierarchy.
  - There were fears the bill could be misinterpreted as allowing euthanasia or assisted suicide, though it explicitly prohibits these practices.
  - The broad scope of consent for clinical trials and the exclusion of common-law spouses were also debated.
- **Motion to Retain**: A motion to retain the bill for further refinement was discussed but ultimately failed. The bill moved forward with further amendments, with representatives emphasizing the need for precise language to protect patient rights.

### **4. Health and Human Services**
The meeting also addressed broader health and human services issues, including:
- **Developmental Disabilities**: Funding and services for individuals with developmental disabilities, particularly those aged 18-21, were discussed. Representatives highlighted the importance of fully funding these services and developing plans to meet the needs of eligible individuals.
- **Mental Health Issues**: The meeting briefly touched on a **Supreme Court decision** regarding the detention of mental health patients in emergency rooms. Representatives expressed concerns about inadequate mental health facilities and funding, with plans to reactivate the **Mental Health Caucus** to address systemic issues.

### **5. Legislative Process and Amendments**
- **Amendment Process**: Representatives appreciated addressing amendments individually rather than bundling them into omnibus bills, allowing for more focused discussions.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Several amendments were proposed, including clarifications on cannabis registry identification cards, compliance with federal prevention services for children, and the evaluation of children in care facilities.
