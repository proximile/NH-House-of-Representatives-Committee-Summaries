On May 26, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened electronically, as authorized by House Rule 67 and the governor’s emergency order during the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on two key pieces of legislation: **Senate Bill 137 (SB 137)**, addressing the tipped minimum wage, and **Senate Bill 123 (SB 123)**, concerning employer payments for COVID-19 testing. The discussions highlighted partisan divides on labor and public health issues, with debates centering on wage fairness, federal preemption, economic impacts, and vaccine mandates.

### **Senate Bill 137: Tipped Minimum Wage and Labor Policies**

1. **Amendment Discussions**:
   - Representatives proposed amendments to simplify the bill’s language and eliminate a **45% calculation** for tipped wages, which some argued was outdated and problematic.
   - One amendment aimed to align New Hampshire’s tipped wage with the **federal minimum wage** ($7.25), ensuring the state rate does not fall below the federal standard.

2. **Debate on Tipped Wages**:
   - Proponents of raising the **tipped minimum wage** (currently $3.27) argued that increasing it to $7.25 would ensure fairness for tipped workers.
   - Opponents contended that the current system, where tips supplement wages, already ensures workers earn well above the minimum wage, with many earning $20+ per hour.

3. **Concerns Over Federal Preemption**:
   - Some representatives expressed concerns that the bill might conflict with **federal law**, particularly if the federal tipped wage increases, as federal law would supersede state law.
   - They emphasized the need to avoid language that could create conflicts with federal wage laws.

4. **Economic Impact**:
   - Opponents warned that raising the tipped wage could harm the **hospitality industry**, potentially leading to job losses or business closures.
   - Proponents cited examples from other states where higher wages did not negatively impact restaurant growth and argued that higher wages improve worker stability and satisfaction.

5. **Market vs. Regulation**:
   - Some representatives advocated for letting the **market dictate wages**, noting that many employers already pay above the minimum wage to attract workers.
   - Others emphasized the need for a **living wage**, criticizing the current minimum wage as insufficient for basic needs.

6. **Voting and Next Steps**:
   - The committee voted on amendments and the bill itself, with some amendments passing and others failing.
   - Representatives were asked to submit **blurbs** (summaries) for and against the bill by the end of the day for further consideration.

### **Senate Bill 123: Employer Payments for COVID-19 Testing and Vaccine Mandates**

1. **Initial Focus**:
   - The bill initially aimed to require employers to pay for COVID-19 testing if they mandated it for employees.

2. **Amendment 1638H**:
   - Introduced by Representative Seaworth, this amendment simplified the bill by adding the word "test" to existing law, clarifying that employers must pay for any required medical testing, not just COVID-19 tests.
   - The Department of Labor confirmed that under current law, employers are already required to pay for medical examinations, including tests, if mandated.
   - The amendment passed unanimously.

3. **Amendment 1758H**:
   - Proposed by Representative Infantine, this amendment added language to prevent employers from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations as a condition of employment until the vaccines received full FDA approval (not just emergency use authorization). It excluded healthcare providers from this restriction.
   - The amendment sparked significant debate:
     - Supporters argued it protected individual liberty and prevented coercion into taking unproven medical interventions.
     - Opponents argued it undermined public health efforts, created unnecessary fear around vaccines, and deviated from the bill’s original intent.
   - The amendment passed with a vote of 11-9, significantly altering the bill’s focus.

4. **Final Vote**:
   - The amended bill, now addressing both testing and vaccination requirements, was passed with a vote of 11-9.

5. **Key Concerns**:
   - Some representatives expressed frustration that the bill, originally bipartisan and focused on testing costs, had been transformed into a contentious issue around vaccine mandates.
   - Supporters of Amendment 1758H emphasized individual rights and concerns about vaccine safety, while opponents argued it would hinder efforts to end the pandemic and protect public health.

### **Outcome and Broader Implications**

The meeting concluded with the passage of both SB 137 and SB 123, as amended. The discussions reflected broader national debates on labor policies and pandemic-related legislation:

- **SB 137**: The debate over the tipped minimum wage highlighted tensions between ensuring fair wages for workers and protecting the economic viability of the hospitality industry. The committee’s amendments and discussions underscored the challenge of balancing state and federal wage laws while addressing the needs of low-wage workers.
  
- **SB 123**: The transformation of SB 123 from a straightforward cost-sharing measure to a broader debate on vaccine mandates illustrated the polarized nature of pandemic-related legislation. The inclusion of provisions prohibiting employer-mandated vaccinations until full FDA approval added a contentious layer to the bill, reflecting ongoing debates over individual rights versus public health priorities.

Overall, the meeting showcased the complexities of legislating labor and public health issues in a divided political climate, with both bills likely to spark further debate as they move through the legislative process.
