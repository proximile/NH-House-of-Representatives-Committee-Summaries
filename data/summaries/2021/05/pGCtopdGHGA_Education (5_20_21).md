The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on May 20, 2021, to discuss a range of education-related bills and amendments, focusing on workforce development, education funding, special education, career and technical education (CTE), and student support services. The meeting, held via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the complexities of addressing immediate educational needs while ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

- **Concerns Raised**:
  - **Federal Funding Compliance**: Representatives expressed concerns that the bill might violate the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) by misaligning with the state’s federally approved workforce plan.
  - **Department of Education (DOE) Involvement**: Clarifications were made regarding the DOE’s limited role in the bill, which raised administrative and resource concerns.
  - **Sustainability**: Questions were raised about the long-term funding and administration of the program by the community college system.

Representatives called for a fair funding formula that considers factors like property valuation, student needs, and free and reduced lunch percentages.
- **HB 242**: This bill aimed to address disparities by providing additional grants to districts with lower property valuations and higher student needs. It was seen as a critical step toward equitable education funding.

- **Repeal of Outdated Statutes**: Part One of SB 148 repealed outdated RSA statutes related to vocational rehabilitation and telecommunications equipment for the disabled, as these services are now provided through other programs.
