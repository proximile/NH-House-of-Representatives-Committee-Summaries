### **Focus on Senate Bill 26 (SB 26): Haverhill-Woodsville Funding Dispute**

The majority of the meeting centered on **SB 26**, which seeks to resolve a contentious funding dispute between the town of Haverhill and the Woodsville Fire District. Key points of the discussion included:

1. **Historical Context and Funding Disparities**:  
   - The dispute dates back to the late 1800s, with Woodsville historically maintaining its own roads. The current funding formula, established in 2009, requires Haverhill taxpayers to allocate a significant portion of their highway funds to Woodsville. Critics argue this is unfair, as Woodsville receives approximately $551,000 per mile for its eight miles of road, while Haverhill receives $90,700 per mile for its 72 miles of road.  
   - Haverhill officials and residents argue that the current system amounts to double taxation and subsidizes Woodsville’s road maintenance without oversight.

2. **Proposed Solution**:  
   - SB 26 aims to repeal the existing state mandate, allowing Haverhill to regain control over its highway funds. Proponents argue this would restore fairness and local autonomy, while opponents fear it would disadvantage Woodsville residents, who would face double taxation.

3. **Financial and Audit Concerns**:  
   - Testimonies highlighted allegations of financial mismanagement in Woodsville, including the use of highway funds for non-road-related expenses (e.g., sewer and water systems). Audits revealed violations of state statutes, such as improper loans and co-mingling of funds.  
   - The Department of Revenue (DOR) emphasized the importance of audits for transparency and accountability and supported SB 26’s penalties for non-compliance.

4. **Emotional Testimonies and Broader Implications**:  
   - The debate featured emotional testimonies from both sides, with Haverhill officials and residents expressing frustration over the lack of transparency and fairness, while Woodsville residents argued the issue should be resolved locally rather than through state legislation.  
   - The discussion also touched on broader issues of local governance, fairness, and the role of state mandates in local affairs.

5. **Committee Decision**:  
   - After extensive debate, the committee voted 19-1 to **retain SB 26** for further consideration, allowing more time to address concerns and gather additional information. The committee will review the audits and written testimony before making a final decision.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting concluded with unanimous support for the other bills and amendments, reflecting the committee’s recognition of the individuals and projects being honored. However, the discussion on SB 26 highlighted deep-seated tensions and complexities in municipal funding, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and transparency in resolving local disputes. The committee’s decision to retain SB 26 for further study underscores the importance of balancing local control with state oversight to achieve fair and equitable outcomes.
