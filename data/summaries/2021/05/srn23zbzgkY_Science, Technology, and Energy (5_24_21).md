**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Science, Technology, and Energy (May 24, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 24, 2021, focused on several key topics related to energy policy, including the establishment of a new Department of Energy (DOE), discussions on renewable energy legislation, and procedural updates. Below is a cohesive summary combining all segments of the meeting:

---

### **Establishment of the Department of Energy (DOE)**
1. **Purpose and Rationale**:
   - The proposal to create a DOE aims to centralize energy-related functions currently dispersed across the Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI) and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). This reorganization seeks to improve efficiency, enhance accountability, and address perceived conflicts of interest within the PUC.
   - The DOE would consolidate energy policy decision-making, separating policy and regulatory functions to streamline governance.

2. **Structure and Accountability**:
   - The DOE will consist of four divisions: Administrative Support, Policy and Programs, Enforcement, and Regulatory. Division directors will require confirmation by the governor and council, introducing greater oversight compared to the current PUC structure.

3. **Funding and Financial Impact**:
   - The reorganization is projected to modestly save general funds ($250,000 annually) through back-office consolidation. However, the overall budget will increase due to projected revenues from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), most of which are rebated to ratepayers.
   - Funding for the DOE will come from various sources, including ratepayers, the Renewable Energy Fund, and federal grants.

4. **Clarification of Roles**:
   - Concerns about overlaps between the DOE and PUC were addressed, with most functions being distinct. Shared duties are limited to specific, intentional cases, such as investigations and policy implementation.
   - The DOE will handle policy-related tasks like renewable energy rebates, while the PUC will focus on regulatory matters, including rate cases and net metering.

5. **Strategic Goals**:
   - The DOE will assume the role of developing the state’s energy strategy, a responsibility previously held by the OSI. Questions were raised about the DOE’s broader strategic mission beyond administrative tasks.

6. **Legislative History and Bipartisan Support**:
   - The idea for the DOE originated from House Bill 156 (2019), which studied the need for a centralized energy department. The current proposal, Senate Bill 91, has gained bipartisan support, evidenced by a 6-1 vote in the Senate Finance Committee.

### **Executive Session on Senate Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 113**:
   - Focused on alternative compliance payments for renewable energy obligations. The committee voted to retain the bill, increasing the number of retained bills to 15.

2. **Senate Bill 78**:
   - Addressed the continual appropriation of the renewable energy fund. An amendment was adopted, and the bill passed with a unanimous vote.

3. **Senate Bill 91**:
   - Pertained to omnibus legislation on renewable energy and utilities. A significant debate centered on cost-shifting language in the bill, with concerns raised that it would create an impossible standard for the PUC and hinder its effectiveness.
   - The committee voted 11-9 to adopt the amendment and move the bill forward.

---

### **Stakeholder Input and Amendments**
- The DOE proposal underwent multiple amendments based on feedback from stakeholders, including clean energy groups and regulated industries. These amendments addressed concerns about staffing, IT costs, and the separation of department and commission functions.

---

### **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)**
- While no immediate changes were proposed for the SEC, a study committee has been established to evaluate future reforms, focusing on funding, compliance, and monitoring issues.

---

### **Procedural Updates and Public Access**
1. **Meeting Format**:
   - The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with members participating both in person and via Zoom. Public access was provided through Zoom and telephone.

2. **Personal Notes**:
   - Representative Troy Merner was absent due to illness, and Representative Charles Melvin substituted for him. Committee members shared personal notes and expressed support for Representative Merner and his family.

3. **Scheduling Work Sessions**:
   - The committee discussed scheduling work sessions for retained bills in June, with potential dates on June 7th, 14th, and 21st.

---

### **Future Steps and Conclusion**
1. **Presentation on DOE in HB2**:
   - The committee planned to reconvene for a presentation by the Governor’s office on the DOE’s role in HB2 (the budget bill).

2. **Concurrence on Bills**:
   - The committee discussed concurring on House Bills 315 and 373, with minor changes aimed at improving efficiency and policy implementation.

3. **Chair’s Closing Remarks**:
   - The chair thanked the committee for their work throughout the biennium, acknowledging the challenges of virtual meetings and expressing optimism for future sessions.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Streamlining Energy Governance**: The establishment of the DOE reflects a bipartisan effort to centralize energy policy, improve efficiency, and enhance accountability.
- **Focus on Renewable Energy**: Discussions on Senate Bills 78, 91, and 113 highlighted the committee’s commitment to advancing renewable energy initiatives while addressing concerns about cost-shifting and regulatory effectiveness.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: The DOE proposal and related legislation incorporated feedback from various stakeholders, ensuring a balanced approach to energy policy reform.

Overall, the meeting underscored New Hampshire’s efforts to modernize its energy governance framework, address long-standing challenges, and promote sustainable energy practices.
