The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on May 25, 2021, focused on several bills under consideration. The meeting was conducted electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, with members and the public participating via Zoom or telephone. Key highlights include:

1. **Senate Bill 66 (On-Premise Transportation Wines for Delivery)**: The committee reconsidered the bill to add an amendment ensuring it would take effect immediately upon passage, avoiding a lapse in the law when the governor's emergency order expired. The amendment passed unanimously, and the bill was recommended for the consent calendar.

2. **Senate Bill 97 (Health Insurance)**: The committee discussed and passed an amendment removing a problematic section related to pharmacy benefit managers. The bill, as amended, was unanimously recommended for the consent calendar.

3. **Senate Bill 107 (Financial Assistance for Businesses Affected by COVID-19)**: The committee debated whether the bill, which urges the state to make federal relief funds available to businesses previously ineligible for the Main Street Relief Fund, was still relevant. After discussion, the committee voted 11-7 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," with a minority report supporting its passage.

4. **Uber Eats/DoorDash Bill (HB 593)**: The committee discussed an amendment to delay the bill's effective date by 60 days to allow time for contract negotiations. While some members objected, the committee ultimately concurred with the amendment after receiving confirmation that restaurants were okay with the delay.

The meeting also included roll call attendance and procedural discussions, with members confirming their presence and ensuring compliance with the Right to Know Law. The committee concluded by assigning subcommittee roles and preparing for future legislative sessions.
