**Ways and Means Committee Meeting Summary – May 25-26, 2021**  
The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on May 25 and 26, 2021, to discuss revenue estimates, tax-related issues, and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meetings, held electronically under the governor’s emergency order, focused on analyzing current revenue trends, adjusting forecasts, and preparing for upcoming budget decisions. Key discussions and findings are summarized below:

### **Revenue Overview and Adjustments**  
The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) presented updated revenue estimates for fiscal years 2021-2023, incorporating strong April performance data. The committee acknowledged the challenges of forecasting in a dynamic economic environment, particularly due to the influence of federal stimulus funds, Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, and pandemic-related recovery. Anomalies in revenue, such as those tied to stimulus payments and PPP loans, were discussed, though isolating their specific impacts proved difficult.  

### **Tax-Specific Discussions**  
1. **Business Taxes**: April saw a significant increase in business tax revenue, driven by extension payments and stimulus impacts. Revised estimates for FY21 ranged from $947.5 million to $964.9 million, with growth rates for FY22 and FY23 remaining unchanged.  
2. **Tobacco Tax**: Revenue surged due to Massachusetts’ ban on flavored tobacco products, with FY21 revenue 24.4% ahead of plan and 20% above the prior year. The potential impact of a proposed national ban on flavored tobacco products, particularly menthol cigarettes, was also discussed, though detailed revenue breakdowns were unavailable.  
3. **Meals and Rentals Tax**: Revenue aligned with projections but was below plan and prior year. May’s recovery suggested leaning toward higher estimates for FY21, with growth rates of 5-10% for FY22 and 4-6% for FY23.  
4. **Interest and Dividends Tax**: FY21 revenue showed significant growth due to late filings influenced by federal tax deadlines. The potential impact of a proposed federal capital gains tax increase on New Hampshire’s interest and dividends tax was briefly discussed, though no concrete conclusions were drawn.  
5. **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Revenue was ahead of plan and prior year, driven by a hot housing market, low interest rates, and increased home prices. However, concerns about affordability and potential market cooling were noted, with projections showing declines in FY22 and FY23.  
6. **Utility Property Tax**: Revenue was below plan and prior year due to decreased valuations and credits on file, though the tax’s stability during the COVID-19 economic crisis was acknowledged.  

### **SB3 and PPP Loans**  
The committee discussed the impact of SB3, which relates to PPP loan tax treatment, on revenue. SB3 would adjust revenue estimates by accounting for refunds, though the exact anomalous revenue from PPP loans remained unclear.  

### **Stimulus Effects and Future Adjustments**  
The committee acknowledged the difficulty in isolating the impact of federal stimulus packages on revenue, as data does not break down stimulus-related income. They considered adjusting future revenue estimates to account for anomalous stimulus-related income but noted the complexity of predicting long-term impacts.  

### **Future Meetings and Finalization**  
The committee planned to finalize revenue estimates on June 8, incorporating May data and considering the Senate’s budget surplus statement. The discussions highlighted the importance of monitoring economic recovery, stimulus impacts, and tax policy changes in shaping future revenue projections.  

Overall, the meetings underscored the challenges of revenue forecasting in a post-pandemic economy while providing insights into current trends and potential future impacts on New Hampshire’s fiscal landscape.
