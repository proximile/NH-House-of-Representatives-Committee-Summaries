**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Executive Departments and Administration (May 11, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 11, 2021, focused on a range of legislative issues related to executive departments and administration, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussions centered on **Senate Bill 133 (SB 133)** and **House Bill 155 (HB 155)**, addressing topics such as outdoor dining, healthcare staffing, licensing, and emergency measures. Here are the key highlights:

### **Outdoor Dining and Local Control**
- **Outdoor Dining Expansion**: The bill proposed temporary provisions allowing restaurants to expand outdoor dining and liquor licenses during the pandemic. Discussions highlighted the need to balance environmental concerns, particularly for restaurants on septic systems, with the economic benefits of expanded seating. The committee debated whether to extend these provisions through 2023 or sunset them in 2022.
- **Local Authority**: Emphasis was placed on local control, with municipalities given the authority to determine seating arrangements, parking, and other logistical matters.

### **Healthcare and Licensing**
- **Temporary Health Partners (THPs)**: HB 155 introduced the concept of Temporary Health Partners to address staffing shortages in healthcare, particularly in nursing homes. THPs would assist Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) and other medical staff, with the goal of providing a pathway to LNA certification. Concerns were raised about ensuring THPs do not become a permanent underclass of lower-paid workers and that they receive fair pay and training opportunities.
- **Emergency Licensing**: Provisions were discussed to allow lapsed but non-disciplined physicians to assist in emergencies and to streamline the licensing process for out-of-state psychologists providing telemedicine services.
- **Music Therapist Licensure**: A motion to deem the licensure of music therapists "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) passed, with arguments that existing national certification is sufficient.

### **Vaccine Mandates and Passports**
- **Prohibition of Mandates**: A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to an amendment prohibiting state or private entities from mandating vaccines or requiring vaccine passports. Members debated the balance between personal freedoms, privacy, and public health.

### **Pandemic-Related Provisions**
- **Construction**: A section allowing construction to continue during the pandemic was debated, with concerns raised about potential environmental impacts, especially in conservation areas.
- **Summer Camps**: Provisions addressing summer camps unable to operate during the pandemic were discussed, with agreement that these should sunset after the current year.
- **Mail Order Pharmacies**: The committee supported allowing out-of-state pharmacies to ship drugs for clinical trials in New Hampshire, recognizing the benefit to patients involved in research.

### **Process and Amendments**
- **Subcommittee Meetings**: Due to unresolved issues, follow-up subcommittee meetings were scheduled to finalize amendments and prepare for full committee votes.
- **Executive Session**: The meeting concluded with an executive session focusing on specific sections of SB 133, including daycare worker requirements, telemedicine, and skilled medical professionals.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the committee’s efforts to balance immediate pandemic-related needs with long-term statutory clarity and local governance. Discussions highlighted the complexities of addressing public health concerns, personal freedoms, and economic recovery, while striving for legislative precision and fairness in areas such as healthcare staffing, licensing, and outdoor dining. The committee’s collaborative approach and attention to detail were evident throughout the proceedings, with a focus on refining language and ensuring the bills align with the state’s evolving needs.
