The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee meeting on May 3, 2021, focused on several key healthcare-related bills, addressing issues ranging from advanced directives and healthcare provider liability to therapeutic cannabis and child welfare. The meeting, conducted via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, included extensive discussions, testimonies from stakeholders, and considerations of amendments. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key topics and discussions:

---

### **1. Advanced Directives and Healthcare Decision-Making (Senate Bill 74)**
**Purpose and Key Changes**:  
- SB 74 seeks to modernize and simplify New Hampshire’s advanced directive laws, updating statutes related to living wills, healthcare surrogacy, and durable power of attorney (DPOA). The bill aims to ensure patients’ wishes are clearly understood and respected, particularly when they are unable to make decisions themselves.  
- Key updates include:  
  - Clarifying **Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)** orders and **Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)**.  
  - Introducing a **balancing of burdens and benefits** in decision-making.  
  - Allowing **agents or surrogates** to consent to **experimental treatments** or clinical trials for incapacitated patients in life-threatening situations.  
  - Enabling **virtual witnessing** of advanced directives, a provision particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  - Simplifying forms to make advanced directives more accessible and reducing the need for legal assistance.  

**Support and Concerns**:  
- The bill received strong support from stakeholders, including the **New Hampshire Hospital Association**, the **Foundation for Healthy Communities**, and legal professionals, who emphasized its importance in improving patient care and clarity in healthcare decision-making.  
- Concerns were raised about potential overreach, such as whether agents could override patients’ wishes, particularly in cases of **incapacity** or **advanced dementia**. Critics also questioned the default provision allowing **treatment over objection**, which permits agents to authorize treatment even if the patient objects, provided the patient is incapacitated.  
- The **Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester** supported the bill but raised concerns about provisions related to permanent unconsciousness and medically administered nutrition and hydration.

### **2. Healthcare Provider Liability (Senate Bill 149, Part 3)**
**Purpose**:  
- SB 149, Part 3, provides liability protections for healthcare facilities and providers that complied with state and federal emergency orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill aims to shield providers from civil liability when acting under emergency directives.  

**Support and Concerns**:  
- The **New Hampshire Hospital Association** and the **Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire** supported the bill, emphasizing the unprecedented challenges healthcare providers faced during the pandemic.  
- Concerns were raised about conflicts with ethical codes and professional liability, but these issues were not explicitly addressed in the bill.

### **3. Medicaid and Behavioral Health (Senate Bill 149, Part 1)**
**Purpose**:  
- Part 1 of SB 149 clarifies that **behavioral health services** count toward medical expenses for individuals in the Medicaid spend-down program. The bill does not expand Medicaid benefits but ensures mental health care is recognized as health care.  
- It also requires reporting to ensure accountability and uniformity in applying the benefit.  

**Discussion**:  
- Senator Cindy Rosenwald explained that the bill addresses confusion in district offices and ensures mental health care is included in the spend-down program.

**Purpose**:  
- Part 2 updates pharmacy statutes to enhance pharmacy services through **automated pharmacy systems**, particularly in long-term care, hospice, and correctional facilities.

  - Allowing medical providers to certify patients for up to **three years** instead of one.  
  - Increasing patient access to **Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs)** by permitting patients to access all ATC dispensary locations in the state.  
  - Authorizing Department employees to possess and transport therapeutic cannabis for inspection and regulatory purposes.  

**Concerns**:  
- Law enforcement representatives, including the **Chief of Police from Tuftonboro**, raised concerns about the loosening of regulations, particularly the inability to track patient purchases and the potential for caregiver storefronts to operate without oversight.

**Purpose**:  
- The bill addresses gaps in the child protection system, allowing courts to order investigative interviews or examinations of children in abuse or neglect cases.

### **8. Amendments and Executive Sessions**
**Key Amendments**:  
- **Amendment 1187 to SB 120**: Clarifies language related to physician assistants (PAs) working with the VA, ensuring PAs can be supervised by physicians licensed in any state or territory.
