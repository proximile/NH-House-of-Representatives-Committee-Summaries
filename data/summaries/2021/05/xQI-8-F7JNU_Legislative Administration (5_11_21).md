**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Legislative Administration (May 11, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on May 11, 2021, to discuss several key legislative issues, primarily centered around two omnibus bills: **Senate Bill 100** and **Senate Bill 142**. The meeting, held virtually via Zoom, addressed a wide range of topics, from mental health and housing to workplace safety and non-profit taxation. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Key Discussions and Bills**

#### **1. Commissions vs. Committees**
- Members debated the effectiveness of **commissions versus committees**, with some expressing concerns about the time commitment for external members and the size of commissions. There was a preference for **study committees composed of legislators**, which could invite external input as needed.

#### **2. Grand Families Commission**
- The **Grand Families Commission**, established during the opioid crisis to support grandparents raising grandchildren, was a significant topic. While some members supported extending its work for another five years, others felt it should conclude sooner, given its five-year history and existing resources like the **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**. The commission has been a valuable resource for the **Division of Youth and Family Services** and DHHS, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated opioid-related issues.

#### **3. First Responders and PTSD**
- The need for a **commission to study post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among first responders** was strongly supported. The commission, which has existed for six years, mandates **mental health training for first responders**, including firefighters, emergency medical services personnel, and dispatchers. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of such training in small towns with limited budgets, leading to suggestions that this be addressed in separate legislation.

#### **4. Housing and Land Development**
- The **commission to study barriers to increased land development** in New Hampshire was discussed. Previously known as the **SB-43 commission** or the **density commission**, it aims to address the state's urgent housing crisis by providing tools and resources to municipalities for planning and policy conversations around housing. Testimony highlighted its past productivity and the need for more time to complete its work.

#### **5. Building a Pier Over the Jetty at Hampton Beach**
- A **study committee** was proposed to explore building a pier over the **jetty at Hampton Beach**, which is popular but not accessible for people with disabilities. The **New Hampshire State Parks system**, which is operationally self-funded, would need to ensure that such a project maintains the financial health of the park system.

#### **6. Study on the Effects of COVID-19 Lockdowns, Quarantines, and School and Business Closings**
- A **committee** was proposed to study the effects of COVID-19 measures, particularly on vulnerable populations such as students and people with PTSD. There was a suggestion to broaden the scope of the study to include positive effects and the distribution of vaccines and treatments.

#### **7. Workplace Safety in Healthcare Settings**
- **Senate Bill 100** included a section on **workplace safety in healthcare settings**, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19. The bill proposes a **commission to study and recommend solutions** for addressing violence against healthcare workers. **Paula Minihan** of the **New Hampshire Hospital Association** emphasized the growing issue of violence against healthcare workers and supported the commission as a multidisciplinary approach to address the problem.

#### **8. Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOTs) by Charitable Organizations**
- Another part of **Senate Bill 100** focused on studying **PILOTs** made by tax-exempt organizations to municipalities. The goal is to ensure fairness and proper taxation of profit-generating activities within non-profits. Opponents, including **Kathleen Reardon** of the **NH Center for Nonprofits** and **Michael Lachance** of the **YMCA of Greater Nashua**, expressed concerns about the potential burden on non-profits, arguing that PILOTs could divert funds from their charitable missions.

#### **9. Cost of Education in Residential Facilities**
- A **commission to study the cost of education for children in residential facilities** was discussed. Questions were raised about the necessity of such a study, given existing formulas for education funding.

### **Amendment Process and Logistical Challenges**
- Members discussed the possibility of crafting a **consensus amendment** to remove or modify sections of the bills that lacked broad support. This would involve coordinating with the **Office of Legislative Services (OLS)** to draft amendments during the lunch break of the next session.
- The committee acknowledged the difficulty of managing omnibus bills with unrelated sections and the potential for **dividing the question on the floor** to address specific parts separately.

### **Support for Doug**
- The committee was informed about the hospitalization of a member, **Doug**, and encouraged to send well wishes for his recovery.

### **Next Steps**
- The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene the following Thursday to finalize amendments and recommendations for the bills.

### **Key Takeaways**
- The meeting focused on balancing the needs of non-profits, healthcare workers, and educational institutions while ensuring fairness in taxation and funding.
- Opponents of the PILOTs study emphasized the critical role of non-profits in the community, while supporters of the healthcare safety commission highlighted the urgent need to protect healthcare workers from violence.
