The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on May 11, 2021, focused on a range of transportation-related issues, with particular emphasis on **winter road maintenance**, **electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure**, and **towing and abandoned vehicle removal**. The discussions aimed to improve public safety, reduce environmental impacts, and modernize transportation systems. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **Winter Road Maintenance and Environmental Concerns**
1. **Training and Certification Programs**:  
   - The committee discussed the importance of training programs for municipal and commercial road maintenance staff, especially for winter operations. A tiered certification system (bronze, silver, gold) was proposed to recognize municipalities' increasing sophistication in winter maintenance practices.  
   - The focus was on reducing chloride use (from road salt) and exploring alternatives like **brine**, **magnesium chloride**, and **potassium acetate** to minimize environmental harm, particularly to waterways.  

2. **Liability and Certification**:  
   - Provisions were included to limit liability for municipalities that follow certified winter maintenance practices, aiming to reduce over-salting due to fears of slip-and-fall lawsuits.  
   - The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES) supported these efforts, noting their potential to help municipalities comply with EPA stormwater regulations and save costs through reduced salt usage.  

3. **Housekeeping Measures**:  
   - Administrative updates were discussed, including removing outdated language from statutes related to boating education certificates and adjusting committee compositions for study commissions.

### **Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure**
1. **Senate Bill 131**:  
   - Introduced by Senator David Waters, the bill promotes EV infrastructure development in New Hampshire. It includes provisions for **fast chargers** on major transportation corridors (e.g., I-93, 95, 89) and **level 2 chargers** on secondary roads.  
   - Funding for these projects comes from the **Volkswagen (VW) settlement funds**, with about $5.6 million allocated by Governor Sununu.  

2. **Public Accessibility and Tax Incentives**:  
   - The bill ensures public accessibility to charging stations, with clear pricing and credit card payment systems.  
   - It allows municipalities to provide **tax abatements** for EV infrastructure projects, similar to incentives for solar projects.  

3. **Concerns and Opposition**:  
   - Representative Michael Boles raised concerns about **Section 3 (tax relief)** and **Section 4 (Public Utilities Commission involvement)**, arguing that tax relief could shift the burden to other property owners and that incorporating EV infrastructure costs into electricity rates is premature.  
   - Rebecca Ohler from DES clarified that VW funds must be **80% spent within 7-8 years**, with significant interest from businesses and municipalities despite initial project design challenges.  

4. **Amendments and Refinements**:  
   - Representative Erin proposed streamlining redundant language in the bill regarding eligibility for non-driver ID cards for disabled individuals, which Senator Waters supported.

### **Towing and Abandoned Vehicle Removal**
1. **Fair and Equitable System**:  
   - A bill was introduced to establish a rolling list of vetted towing companies that state police can call upon to remove abandoned or disabled vehicles. This system aims to ensure accountability and public safety.  
   - The New Hampshire Towing Association and State Police supported the bill, highlighting its benefits for both the towing industry and the public.

### **Other Discussions**
1. **Decals for Emergency Services**:  
   - The bill allows EMS chiefs and fire chiefs to issue decals for multi-use decal plates, similar to those available to firefighters.  

2. **Committee Business**:  
   - The committee reviewed changes made by the Senate to various bills, including the removal of specific names from legislation and adjustments to committee structures. Plans were made to finalize subcommittees for retained bills in the coming weeks.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Efforts to reduce road salt usage and promote EV infrastructure reflect a commitment to protecting New Hampshireâ€™s waterways and reducing carbon emissions.  
- **Public Safety and Efficiency**: Initiatives like the towing system and winter maintenance certification aim to improve safety and operational efficiency.  
- **Economic and Practical Considerations**: The committee balanced the need for EV infrastructure development with concerns about tax burdens and consumer readiness, advocating for a phased and practical approach.  

The meeting concluded with plans to continue refining legislation, addressing concerns raised by committee members, and advancing transportation-related initiatives that benefit both the environment and the public.
