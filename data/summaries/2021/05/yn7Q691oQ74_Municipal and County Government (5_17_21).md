**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: Municipal and County Government Committee (May 17, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Municipal and County Government Committee convened on May 17, 2021, to discuss and vote on several bills related to municipal and county governance. The meeting, held electronically due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, addressed issues ranging from municipal spending caps and water system funding to renewable energy incentives and property tax relief. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed:**

#### **Senate Bill 52 (SB 52): Municipal Spending Caps**
- **Purpose**: SB 52 aimed to clarify and rectify inconsistencies in the language of RSA 49C:33, a statute governing municipal spending and tax caps. The bill sought to address issues in Nashua, where a 1993 voter-approved spending cap was deemed unenforceable by the Supreme Court due to statutory language inconsistencies.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Support**: Fred T. Boone, a former Nashua alderman and originator of the 1993 spending cap, testified in favor of SB 52, emphasizing the need to enforce voter-approved spending caps and close loopholes.
  - **Opposition**: Nashua Mayor Jim Donchess opposed the bill, arguing that financial pressures stemmed from state-imposed costs (e.g., pensions) rather than uncontrolled spending. He advocated for local resolution rather than state intervention.
- **Broader Impact**: While initially focused on Nashua, the bill was found to have statewide implications for municipal spending caps.
- **Outcome**: A motion to pass the bill failed, and it will proceed with a minority report.

#### **Senate Bill 102 (SB 102): Property Tax Relief and Revitalization**
- **Purpose**: SB 102 aimed to enable municipalities to establish tax relief for residential properties over 40 years old, designated as residential property revitalization zones. The bill encouraged property improvements and renewable energy systems, with tax relief lasting a minimum of five years and extendable if additional units were added.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Expanded tax relief options for renovating older residential structures, particularly to increase affordable housing.
  - Addressed concerns about delaying property tax reassessments to avoid inflated valuations during the COVID-19 real estate bubble.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with a vote of 15-4.

#### **Senate Bill 87 (SB 87): Municipal Finance and Water Funds**
- **Purpose**: SB 87 focused on modernizing municipal finance statutes, particularly related to water system funding, lease purchase agreements, and uncollectible payments.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - **Water Wheeling Charges**: Allowed municipalities like Derry to use water wheeling charges (fees for water transported through their systems) for economic development, with at least 50% of funds reserved for water system maintenance.
  - **Uncollectible Payments**: Updated statutes to allow municipalities to charge fees for uncollectible electronic payments (e.g., credit cards), not just checks.
  - **Lease Purchase Agreements**: Permitted municipalities to use capital reserve funds for lease purchase agreements, even if the agreement included a non-appropriation clause.
