**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference 306-308 (6/14/21):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on June 14, 2021, to discuss proposed legislation related to emergency powers, primarily in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on **House Bill 417**, which aims to establish checks and balances between the governor and the legislature during states of emergency. Key themes and points of discussion included:

1. **Governor’s Emergency Powers and Legislative Oversight**:  
   The bill outlines that the governor can declare a state of emergency, which lasts for 30 days unless renewed. The governor must notify the House Speaker and Senate President before issuing such a declaration. The legislature gains the authority to declare or terminate a state of emergency through a majority vote, ensuring a collaborative approach to emergency management. Additionally, the bill introduces mechanisms for legislative oversight, including the ability to invalidate executive orders and review emergency declarations. It also requires the governor to provide a detailed list of expenditures related to the emergency for transparency.

2. **Legislative Approval for Extended Emergencies**:  
   The representatives debated the need for legislative approval to extend states of emergency beyond 45 days, aiming to prevent indefinite emergency declarations by the governor without legislative input. This was seen as a critical check on executive power, particularly in light of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Policy vs. Emergency Decisions**:  
   Concerns were raised about emergency orders encroaching on policy decisions, which are traditionally the legislature’s responsibility. The group discussed whether the legislature should have the authority to terminate specific emergency orders tied to policy issues, ensuring that policy-making remains within the legislative domain.

4. **Essential Workers and Legislators**:  
   There was significant debate over whether legislators should be classified as essential workers during emergencies, ensuring they can continue their duties without restrictions. Some members expressed concerns about creating a "two-tiered system" where legislators are exempt from restrictions that apply to the public, while others argued it was necessary for legislators to fulfill their responsibilities during crises.

5. **Federal Requirements and Funding**:  
   The discussion touched on how federal requirements for emergency declarations might impact the state’s ability to access funding. Representatives debated whether the legislature should play a role in negotiating these requirements to ensure the state’s needs are met without compromising legislative oversight.

6. **Communication and Transparency**:  
   Several representatives emphasized the importance of improved communication between the governor and the legislature during emergencies. Provisions were included in the bill requiring the governor to notify legislative leaders within 24 hours of taking expedited actions. This was seen as a necessary step to address constituent concerns, ensure accountability, and maintain transparency.

7. **Remote Meetings and Public Access**:  
   The possibility of allowing remote meetings for fiscal committees during emergencies was discussed, though concerns were raised about the practicality and ensuring public access to such meetings. This highlighted the need to balance flexibility with inclusivity during crises.

8. **Historical Context and Lessons Learned**:  
   Members reflected on past emergencies, such as Hurricane Katrina and the 2006 floods in New Hampshire, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They acknowledged the challenges faced and the importance of learning from these experiences to improve future emergency responses. The discussion underscored the need for flexibility, coordination, and a collaborative approach between the executive and legislative branches during crises.

9. **Proposed Amendments and Future Considerations**:  
   The representatives worked on refining the language of the bill, focusing on extending the initial emergency period to 45 days and requiring legislative approval for further extensions. They also debated whether to include penalties for violations of the proposed law. The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene to finalize the bill’s language, ensuring it strikes the right balance between executive flexibility and legislative oversight.

**Overall**, the meeting highlighted the tension between executive authority and legislative oversight during emergencies. The discussions emphasized the need for accountability, transparency, and a collaborative approach to ensure that future crises are managed effectively while safeguarding democratic principles. The bill aims to clarify and formalize these processes, addressing concerns about executive overreach and ensuring that both branches of government work together in the best interest of the public.
