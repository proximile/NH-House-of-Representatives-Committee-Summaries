### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (June 16, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 16, 2021, focused on several critical legislative issues, including protections for pregnant and breastfeeding employees, workforce housing, and mental health care. The discussion highlighted bipartisan support for key bills, procedural challenges, and the urgency of addressing these issues to support vulnerable populations and economic growth.

#### Key Bills and Discussions:

1. **Senate Bill 68 (Pregnancy Protection Bill)**  
   - Introduced by Senator Hennessey on behalf of the governor, this bill aims to provide workplace protections for pregnant employees. It received broad bipartisan support, with only one out-of-state attorney raising concerns that were subsequently resolved.  
   - Supporters emphasized the bill’s importance for workforce participation, ensuring pregnant women can work safely without fear of discrimination or inadequate accommodations.  

2. **Senate Bill 69 (Breastfeeding Bill)**  
   - This bill, developed over several years, seeks to ensure reasonable accommodations for breastfeeding employees in the workplace. It also enjoyed widespread bipartisan support.  
   - Advocates highlighted the challenges faced by breastfeeding mothers, particularly the pressure to stop breastfeeding when returning to work. The bill aims to address these barriers while balancing the needs of employers, especially small businesses.  

3. **Senate Bill 59 (Mental Health Care Bill)**  
   - This bill focuses on mental health care coverage, particularly collaborative care models that integrate mental health services into primary care settings. It passed the Senate unanimously but faced questions in the House.  
   - Supporters argued that the bill is essential for addressing the mental health crisis and ensuring proper reimbursement for psychiatric care. Critics questioned the necessity of statutory language if insurance companies already provide such coverage.  

4. **Senate Bill 86 (Workforce Housing Bill)**  
   - The discussion underscored the urgent need for affordable housing in New Hampshire, with a statewide shortage of approximately 20,000 housing units.  
   - The bill aims to support municipalities in addressing housing shortages through optional programs, with no immediate fiscal impact. Advocates stressed the importance of housing for economic growth and retaining young professionals.  

#### Broader Concerns and Challenges:

- **Procedural Delays**: The committee expressed frustration with the legislative process, particularly the lack of subcommittees due to COVID-19 restrictions, which delayed discussions on these bills. Some members questioned the need for statutory protections if existing policies already address the issues, while others emphasized the importance of proactive legislation to protect vulnerable groups.  
- **Partisan Divides**: The debate revealed partisan differences, with some Republicans expressing concerns about the potential impact of these bills on businesses, while Democrats emphasized the need for equity and protections for vulnerable populations.  
- **Retention of Bills**: Due to unresolved questions and the need for further evidence, some bills were retained for further discussion in the next session. Supporters of SB 68 and SB 69 argued that these bills are critical for protecting pregnant and breastfeeding women and should not be delayed.  

#### Conclusion and Next Steps:

The meeting concluded with a call to reconvene the following day to continue discussions. Lawmakers were urged to reconsider their positions on the bills, with the hope of finding a compromise that would allow some or all of the legislation to move forward. The discussion underscored the challenges of balancing process, partisanship, and the urgent need for protections and solutions in areas like women’s rights, housing, and mental health care. Overall, the meeting highlighted the importance of prioritizing these critical issues to support vulnerable populations and foster economic growth in New Hampshire.
