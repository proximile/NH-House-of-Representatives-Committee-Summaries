The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference, focusing on House Bill 199 and related amendments. Key discussions include:

1. **House Bill 199 (Soil Health and Biostimulants)**:
   - The committee discussed an amendment to include biostimulants in the soil conditioning statute. Concerns were raised about the lack of a public hearing to address potential ambiguities, such as whether compost qualifies as a biostimulant and the regulatory implications.
   - The soil health bill was emphasized as crucial for conservation districts, as it would strengthen their ability to secure grants for technical and mechanical assistance.

2. **Amendment Discussions**:
   - Senator Bradley proposed an amendment, and members debated the potential unintended consequences of adding biostimulant language without a public hearing. The commissioner was consulted and accepted the proposed changes.
   - The committee ultimately agreed to pass the amendment, with assurances that the language would not create additional regulatory obligations.

3. **House Bill 187 (Oversight and Review of Commissioners)**:
   - The committee addressed a "sticky spot" related to oversight and review of commissioners. Discussions centered on the need for a two-thirds majority to pass joint resolutions and the 90-day stay of action for emergency orders, which some members found problematic.
   - Proposals were made to reduce the stay period to 30 days, but further discussion was deferred pending developments on House Bill 417.

4. **House Bill 417 (Emergency Orders and State of Emergency)**:
   - The committee debated amendments to clarify the process for terminating or extending a state of emergency. Key points included:
     - Reducing the initial emergency declaration period from 90 to 30 days, with the governor allowed to renew it twice (totaling 90 days).
     - Requiring the governor to convene a joint session after 90 days to justify continuing the state of emergency, with the legislature voting to affirm or terminate it.
     - Allowing the legislature to terminate individual emergency orders by a simple majority vote of both chambers.
   - Concerns were raised about the practicality of addressing emergency orders when the legislature is not in session, with suggestions for informal communication channels between legislators and the governor.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee recessed to allow for further drafting and review of amendments. Members agreed to reconvene the next day to vote on the finalized language.

Overall, the meeting focused on refining legislation related to soil health, biostimulants, and the process for managing state emergencies, with significant attention given to balancing executive authority with legislative oversight.
