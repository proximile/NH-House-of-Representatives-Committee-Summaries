The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 11, 2021, focused on **House Bill 25**, which addressed capital budget projects. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Meeting Format**: Due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, the meeting was held electronically via Zoom, with public access provided through the platform or by telephone.

2. **Bill Overview**: The Senate had made significant changes to HB 25, removing $25 million in projects to be funded through ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) or other federal funds. These projects were later funded during a fiscal meeting on June 8th. The Senate added back a similar amount (minus $40,000) for other projects, including smaller Department of Administrative Services (DAS) initiatives and a $4 million Bureau of Elderly and Adult Services modernization project.

3. **Key Projects Discussed**:
   - **Marine Terminal Project**: A $31 million federal grant opportunity was discussed for resurfacing and expanding the terminal, which aligns with the Turning Basin Project.
   - **Rochester Courthouse**: The Senate added design funds, but concerns were raised about the lack of a site. A footnote was proposed to prevent design work until a location is confirmed.
   - **Supreme Court Records Digitization**: Seed money was allocated, with the intent to fund future bienniums once initial work is completed.

4. **Reporting Requirements**: The House proposed adding a reporting requirement for all federal funds allocated to capital projects, ensuring transparency and oversight. The Senate agreed to this addition.

5. **Next Steps**: The committee aimed to finalize amendments for sign-off by the following Thursday, June 17th, at 4 p.m. House and Senate members were encouraged to coordinate signatures as needed.

The meeting concluded with appreciation for the collaborative effort and the shared goal of ensuring taxpayer money is used effectively and transparently.
