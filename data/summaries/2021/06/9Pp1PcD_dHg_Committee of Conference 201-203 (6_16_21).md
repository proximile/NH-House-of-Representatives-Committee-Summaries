**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting on June 16, 2021**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 16, 2021, focused on discussions surrounding three key bills: **House Bill 334**, **House Bill 180**, and **House Bill 239**. Each bill addressed distinct but significant legislative issues, ranging from firearm background checks to human trafficking and the unsolicited disclosure of intimate images. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key discussions and outcomes.

### **House Bill 334: Abolishment of the Gun Line and Budgetary Adjustments**
The committee deliberated on **House Bill 334**, which centered on the abolishment of the state’s gun line—a system responsible for firearm background checks—and associated budgetary adjustments. Key points included:

1. **Alignment with Senate Bill 141**: The amendment to HB 334 aimed to align with **Senate Bill 141**, which had already passed both chambers and was awaiting the governor’s signature. SB 141 sought to abolish the gun line, and HB 334’s amendment proposed removing three positions tied to the gun line and reducing the Department of Safety’s budget by approximately $400,000.

2. **Budget Reallocation**: The amendment included technical corrections to reallocate funds, with $100,000 appropriated to county sheriff’s offices and $400,000 removed from the Department of Safety’s budget to reflect the elimination of the gun line positions.

3. **Legal and Operational Safeguards**: The committee debated the potential consequences if SB 141 was vetoed or failed to take effect. Provisions in HB 334 would ensure the gun line remained operational in such scenarios to avoid legal issues, such as lawsuits from individuals unable to purchase firearms legally.

4. **Support and Opposition**: Some representatives supported the amendment as a fiscally responsible measure, arguing that retaining funding for an abolished gun line was unnecessary. Others expressed concerns about the state’s role in firearm background checks and the value of maintaining the gun line.

5. **Outcome**: A motion was made and seconded to adopt the amendment to HB 334, which included the budgetary adjustments and alignment with SB 141. The committee moved to vote on the amended version of the bill.

### **House Bill 180: Increasing Penalties for Human Trafficking**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 180**, which aimed to increase penalties for individuals involved in human trafficking, particularly concerning minors. Key discussions included:

1. **Age Differences**: Debate focused on cases where the victim is between 13 and 16 years old and the perpetrator is under 20. The committee considered whether a **three-year age difference** should be a mitigating factor.

2. **Legal Consent**: Members emphasized that minors under 16 cannot legally consent to sexual acts, even in trafficking scenarios, and advocated for **stricter penalties** for those who exploit children.

3. **Defense Limitations**: The committee debated whether a perpetrator’s **lack of knowledge** of the victim’s age should be a valid defense. They agreed to include language in the bill stating that neither lack of knowledge nor the victim’s consent would be a valid defense.

4. **Human Trafficking Impact**: Members highlighted the lifelong trauma experienced by trafficking victims and stressed the need for **harsher penalties** for those who traffic or exploit children.

### **House Bill 239: Unsolicited Disclosure of Intimate Images**
The committee addressed **House Bill 239**, which focused on the unsolicited disclosure of intimate images, particularly to minors. Key points included:

1. **Intent to Harass**: The original requirement to prove intent to harass was deemed difficult to enforce, leading the committee to propose **removing this requirement** to make the law more effective.

2. **Penalty Levels**: The amendment proposed classifying the first offense as a **misdemeanor (class A)** and elevating subsequent offenses to a **class D felony**. Sending unsolicited images to minors would be classified as a **class B felony**.

3. **Sex Offender Registry**: The committee debated whether first-time offenders should be placed on the **sex offender registry**, particularly in cases involving minors. They agreed that sending such images to minors would warrant registry inclusion.

4. **Focus on Minors**: Members emphasized the need to **protect children**, who cannot legally consent to receiving such images, while expressing concerns about inadvertently penalizing adults in consensual situations.

### **Overall Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on **protecting minors** and addressing complex legislative issues, such as firearm background checks, human trafficking, and the unsolicited disclosure of intimate images. The discussions underscored the need for **clear legal language**, **fiscal responsibility**, and **enforceable penalties** to ensure effective and fair outcomes. The committee proposed **compromise amendments** to balance enforcement with fairness, reflecting a commitment to addressing these critical issues comprehensively.
