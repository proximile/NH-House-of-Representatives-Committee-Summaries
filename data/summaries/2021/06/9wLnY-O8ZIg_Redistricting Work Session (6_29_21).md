The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting, held on June 29, 2021. Key points discussed include:

1. **Workload and Public Hearings**: The committee discussed the upcoming workload, particularly the scheduling of public hearings. It was noted that public hearings historically occurred in October, but there was debate about their timing relative to the release of census data in mid-August. Some members felt hearings before or immediately after the data release might not be productive.

2. **Public Participation**: There was discussion about making public hearings more accessible, including the possibility of using Zoom for remote participation. However, concerns were raised about ensuring consistent technology across counties and managing public input effectively.

3. **Redistricting Software**: The committee talked about the software used for redistricting, including copyright and licensing issues. Some members suggested making a version of the software available to the public to foster understanding and engagement, though logistical challenges were acknowledged.

4. **Maps and Data**: The importance of having maps and data ready for public hearings was emphasized. Members suggested providing draft maps to the public for feedback and using existing data to train on the software before the new data is released.

5. **Timeline and Deadlines**: The committee highlighted November 18th as the deadline for completing redistricting work. They discussed the need to work backward from this date to schedule hearings and other tasks.

6. **Committee Input and Feedback**: Members stressed the importance of gathering input from constituents and bringing it back to the committee. They also discussed the role of individual representatives in engaging with their communities.

7. **Retirement Tribute**: The meeting concluded with a tribute to Pam Smarlett, a long-time staff member involved in election-related work, who was retiring after 32 years. Committee members expressed gratitude for her contributions.

Overall, the meeting focused on planning for the redistricting process, ensuring public participation, and addressing logistical challenges related to data, software, and scheduling.
