The transcript captures a portion of a New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 17, 2021, focusing on House Bill 187 (HB 187) and its amendments. The discussion revolves around the legislature's authority to terminate a state of emergency or specific emergency orders issued by the governor or the commissioner of health and human services.

Key points from the meeting:

1. **Senator Bradley's Amendment**: Senator Bradley introduces an amendment to HB 187, which mirrors provisions already in HB2 (the state budget bill). The amendment includes:
   - **Section 8**: Notification requirements.
   - **Section 9**: Allows the legislature to terminate a state of emergency or specific emergency orders by a majority vote of both the Senate and the House.

2. **Clarifications and Concerns**: Representative Weber raises concerns about the inclusion of "state of emergency" language in the amendment, as it could potentially allow the legislature to terminate all emergency orders tied to a state of emergency proclamation. She suggests removing the words "a state of emergency or" to focus solely on individual emergency orders issued under the chapter.

3. **Clerk's Objection**: The clerk of the house initially deems the amendment non-germane, but after further discussion, it is clarified that the amendment is relevant to the bill.

4. **Final Agreement**: The committee agrees to adopt the Senate's version of the bill with the proposed amendment, which removes the phrase "a state of emergency or" from Section 9. This ensures the legislature can terminate specific emergency orders without necessarily ending the entire state of emergency.

The meeting concludes with the committee reaching a consensus on the amendment and agreeing to proceed with the revised version of HB 187.
