The transcript from the NH House of Representatives meeting on June 15, 2021, focuses on discussions regarding **House Bill 533**, which involves changes to background investigations and the allocation of responsibilities between the **Lottery Commission** and the **Attorney General’s Office**. Key points include:

1. **Background Investigations**: The bill shifts the responsibility for conducting background investigations from the Attorney General’s Office to the Lottery Commission. Concerns were raised about ensuring the Lottery Commission has the necessary tools, such as subpoena power, to effectively carry out these investigations.

2. **Costs and Fees**: The Lottery Commission has the authority to set its own fees, and it was suggested that application fees could be adjusted to cover the costs of investigations. There was discussion about whether the statute needed explicit language to allow the Lottery Commission to charge back investigation costs.

3. **Sports Betting and Tier 2 Bets**: The conversation also touched on **sports betting**, particularly **Tier 2 bets**, which are currently limited to mobile platforms but could be expanded to physical locations. The House and Senate disagreed on whether to limit the number of physical sportsbook locations to **10** or make it **unlimited**. The House argued for maintaining the 10-location limit to assess market demand and risks before expanding further.

4. **Market Interest**: It was noted that only a few locations (e.g., Seabrook, Manchester) have actively pursued sportsbook licenses, and others (e.g., Salem, Berlin, Nashua) have shown interest but not yet committed. The House emphasized a cautious approach, suggesting that the market should develop before removing limitations.

5. **Consensus and Process**: The committee worked collaboratively, and while there were differing opinions, there was a consensus to proceed with the changes proposed by the Senate, with the understanding that further adjustments might be needed.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing regulatory responsibilities, market demand, and legislative oversight in the context of sports betting and background investigations.
