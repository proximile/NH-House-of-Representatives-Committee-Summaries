The transcript documents a New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 16, 2021, focusing on House Bill 2 and various amendments. Key discussions and decisions include:

1. **Amendment on Mandatory Ultrasounds**: Senator Rosenwald proposed an amendment to remove the requirement for mandatory ultrasounds before abortions in New Hampshire, arguing it defies medical standards, increases costs, and creates unnecessary barriers, particularly for low-income residents. The amendment was not seconded and did not proceed.

2. **Sununu Youth Services Center Amendment**: A detailed amendment was discussed to develop a plan for the closure and replacement of the Sununu Youth Services Center. The committee debated membership composition, funding, and facility requirements, including capacity for up to 18 youth and flexibility in design. The amendment was adopted with modifications.

3. **Dental Benefits in Medicaid**: Senator Bradley advocated for including dental benefits in Medicaid, emphasizing its public health benefits and cost savings. However, the House expressed concerns about the financial commitment, noting the lack of a public hearing and the potential cost of up to $11 million annually.

4. **Emergency Powers Amendment**: An amendment to RSA 445, concerning emergency powers, was debated. Key changes included extending the duration of emergency orders from 21 to 30 days, allowing the legislature to terminate emergency orders by a majority vote, and exempting legislators from travel restrictions during emergencies. The amendment was adopted after clarifying that it does not override constitutional quorum requirements.

5. **Broadband Funding**: The committee agreed to backdate broadband eligibility criteria to January 1, 2021, ensuring rural areas can access federal ARPA funds for improved broadband infrastructure.

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene the next morning, allowing time for final technical adjustments by the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA).
