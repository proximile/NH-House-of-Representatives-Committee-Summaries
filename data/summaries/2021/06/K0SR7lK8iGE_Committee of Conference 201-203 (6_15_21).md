The transcript captures discussions during a New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 15, 2021, focusing on several bills. Key highlights include:

1. **House Bill 224**: The committee discussed amendments related to civil liability for damage or obstruction to highways and employer access to motor vehicle records. Senator Waters proposed changes to the civil liability section, which were debated and ultimately accepted. The committee agreed to align the language with HB 2 (the state budget bill) and added a new section (Section 3) addressing pending claims. The effective date was set to 60 days after passage.

2. **House Bill 235**: The committee addressed a bill initially concerning groundwater withdrawals and PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) remediation funds. The Senate conceded to the House position, removing an amendment and allowing the bill to proceed as originally drafted.

3. **House Bill 271**: The committee reviewed an amendment to RSA 485-H, which governs PFAS remediation loan programs. The amendment expanded the program to include grants and clarified that municipalities could apply for funds even if they did not operate a public water system. It also allowed municipalities to assist private well owners affected by PFAS contamination. Minor drafting errors were corrected, and the effective date was changed to take effect immediately upon passage.

Throughout the meeting, procedural details were clarified, and votes were taken to finalize the amendments. The committee members expressed appreciation for the collaborative effort in addressing these issues. The meeting concluded with motions to adjourn.
