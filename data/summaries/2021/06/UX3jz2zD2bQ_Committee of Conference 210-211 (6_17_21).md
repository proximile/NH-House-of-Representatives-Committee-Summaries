The transcript captures a Committee of Conference meeting in the New Hampshire House of Representatives on June 17, 2021, focused on finalizing House Bill 2 (HB2). Key points include:

1. **Breaks and Scheduling**: The meeting began with a break until 11:00 AM, followed by another break until 1:00 PM to allow members to work on paperwork, attend meetings, and have lunch. Republican House members planned to caucus at 12:30 PM.

2. **Amendment Discussions**: The committee reviewed several amendments to HB2, particularly focusing on emergency powers. Amendments 2041H and 2042S were debated, with changes proposed to the duration of a state of emergency (from 30 to 21 days) and the process for legislative oversight. The committee emphasized transparency, accountability, and constitutional checks and balances.

3. **Voting and Technical Changes**: The committee voted on amendments, with some confusion over the process. Technical changes to dates in the bill (e.g., shifting January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2022) were approved unanimously. The committee ultimately adopted HB2 as amended.

4. **Acknowledgments and Closing**: Members thanked staff and colleagues for their hard work, particularly the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) team, budget director Matt Malou, and committee chairs. The meeting concluded with a sense of accomplishment, having produced a fiscally balanced budget with bipartisan agreement.

The meeting adjourned after finalizing HB2, with plans to distribute copies of the amended bill and surplus statement.
