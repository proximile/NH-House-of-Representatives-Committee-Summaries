The transcript from the NH House of Representatives meeting on June 17, 2021, focuses on the Committee of Conference's discussion regarding **House Bill 291**. Key points of the conversation include:

1. **Disagreements Between House and Senate**: The Senate was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the original House bill, particularly regarding data distribution. The House intended for election-related data to go to the **Secretary of State** and the **Attorney General (AG)** for review, rather than directly to senators or representatives, to avoid inappropriate data sharing and potential misuse.

2. **Fiscal Concerns**: The Senate's amendments to the bill generated a **fiscal note** from the AG's office, estimating implementation costs at **$500,000**. There was confusion and miscommunication about the bill's intent, leading to this unexpected cost projection.

3. **Data Privacy and Absentee Ballots**: Concerns were raised about the privacy of voter data, particularly absentee ballots sent to **common addresses** (e.g., college students in apartment buildings). Participants debated whether such data should be disclosed under RSA 91A and how it might impact investigations into potential election irregularities.

4. **Legislative Goals**: The committee acknowledged the importance of the bill's intent—to ensure election integrity—but struggled with the language and scope. Some members emphasized that the **Secretary of State** should routinely evaluate election data, with the AG stepping in only if red flags arise.

5. **Proposed Next Steps**: Given the time constraints, several members suggested **working over the summer** to refine the bill and address concerns from both the House and Senate, as well as the AG's office. They aimed to create a version that balances election security, data privacy, and fiscal responsibility.

Overall, the meeting highlighted significant disagreements and communication gaps, with a focus on improving the bill's language and ensuring it aligns with its original intent.
