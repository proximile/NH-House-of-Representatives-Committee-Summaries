The transcript captures several committee of conference meetings in the New Hampshire House of Representatives on June 14, 2021, focusing on reconciling differences between House and Senate versions of various bills. Key discussions include:

1. **HB 315**: The committee recessed due to unresolved questions from a previous committee of conference on Senate Bill 91, which impacted the discussion. The meeting was adjourned to resume the next day.

2. **HB 542 (Religious Liberty Act)**: The committee debated amendments made by the Senate, particularly the removal of sections that could allow discrimination under the guise of religious freedom. The Senate focused on ensuring religious services are considered essential during emergencies, like COVID-19. Discussions centered on definitions, state action, and immunity waivers, with compromises proposed to clarify language and protect religious liberties without enabling discrimination.

3. **HB 108 (Right to Know Law)**: The Senate added provisions allowing remote public meetings and protecting attorney-client privilege. The House opposed continuing remote meetings without further study, citing concerns about accessibility and disenfranchisement. A compromise was proposed to establish a study committee while maintaining some flexibility for remote participation.

4. **HB 566**: The Senate deleted part two of the House bill, focusing instead on aligning it with HB 108. The committee agreed to accept the Senate's version, removing certain sections to avoid redundancy.

Throughout the meetings, lawmakers emphasized the importance of public participation, clarity in legislation, and balancing emergency provisions with long-term policy goals. Compromises were proposed to address concerns from both chambers, with a focus on protecting rights while ensuring practical and inclusive governance.
