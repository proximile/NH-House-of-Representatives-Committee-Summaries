### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (June 15, 2021)  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 15, 2021, focused on **election-related legislation**, addressing two key areas: **House Bill 291** (absentee ballot procedures and voter registration data access) and **changes to the primary election date** alongside redistricting concerns. The discussions highlighted the challenges of balancing transparency, privacy, election integrity, and logistical coordination.  

#### **House Bill 291: Absentee Ballot Procedures and Voter Registration Access**  
1. **Absentee Ballot Procedures**:  
   - The **House version** of the bill modified RSA 657.15, requiring the Secretary of State to analyze absentee ballot request data and produce a report.  
   - The **Senate version** removed some provisions and shifted the responsibility for investigating absentee ballot misuse to the Attorney General’s office.  
   - Concerns were raised about the Attorney General’s access to the centralized voter registration database, particularly regarding the exposure of sensitive information for individuals under protective orders.  

2. **Proposed Compromise**:  
   - A potential solution emerged to merge the House and Senate versions: the Secretary of State would conduct initial analyses, with cases of potential misuse referred to the Attorney General for further investigation.  
   - The House emphasized **routine checks** on absentee ballots, while the Senate focused on **investigating misuse** only when evidence arises.  

3. **Public Access to Voter Lists**:  
   - The House version allowed public inspection of absentee ballot lists **60 days after an election**, with protections for individuals under protective orders. The Senate removed this provision.  
   - Concerns were raised about making voter lists publicly available, as it could expose individuals who are not at their primary residence during the election period.  

4. **Electronic Access to Voter Lists**:  
   - Both chambers discussed ensuring electronic access to voter lists without charge, as mandated by RSA 91A (public records law).  
   - The House version prohibited clerks from requiring advance payment for electronic copies, while the Senate emphasized access through the centralized voter registration database.  

5. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee agreed to work on a **merged version** of the bill, combining elements of both the House and Senate versions, and to reconvene for further discussion.  

#### **Primary Election Date Change and Redistricting**  
1. **Primary Date Change**:  
   - The House proposed moving the primary from the **second week of August to the first week** to give winning candidates more time to consolidate support before the general election.  
   - The Senate favored an **effective date of January 2023**, while the House pushed for **January 2022** to implement the change for the next election cycle.  
   - Concerns were raised about the **redistricting timeline** and potential legal challenges if the primary date was moved too soon.  

2. **Redistricting Challenges**:  
   - Delays in redistricting, particularly in cities like Manchester, could impact the ability to finalize district maps in time for the 2022 election.  
   - The House suggested **trigger language** allowing the Secretary of State to adjust the filing period or primary date if redistricting isn’t completed on time.  

3. **Access to Voter Lists**:  
   - Discussions centered on ensuring timely access to **absentee ballot lists** for candidates, with some clerks requiring prepayment or providing lists only in paper form.  
   - The House proposed language to mandate **electronic delivery** of lists when available, in compliance with RSA 91A.  

4. **Compromise and Next Steps**:  
   - The House and Senate agreed to move the primary to the **first week of August** but retained the **effective date of January 2023** to allow more time for redistricting.  
   - The House planned to use a **retained bill** to address any issues arising from the redistricting process and potentially adjust the primary date for 2022 if feasible.  

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
The meeting underscored the complexities of coordinating election changes with redistricting and the need for flexibility to avoid legal and logistical challenges. Legislators worked to balance **transparency** and **privacy** in voter data access, ensure **election integrity** through absentee ballot oversight, and address the practical realities of redistricting. The committee’s efforts to merge House and Senate versions of bills and establish compromise solutions reflected a commitment to finding common ground on critical election-related issues.
