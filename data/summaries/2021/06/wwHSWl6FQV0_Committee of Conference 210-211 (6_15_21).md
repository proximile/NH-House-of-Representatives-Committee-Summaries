### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (6/15/21)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 15, 2021, focused on reconciling differences between the House and Senate versions of key legislation, particularly the state budget bill (HB2) and policies related to child behavioral health, the Sununu Youth Services Center, and other critical issues. The meeting highlighted the collaborative yet contentious process of addressing complex legislative priorities, balancing fiscal responsibility with effective public policy. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

#### **1. Sununu Youth Services Center Closure and Juvenile Justice Reform**
The closure and replacement of the Sununu Youth Services Center, a juvenile detention facility, was a central topic of discussion. Both the House and Senate agreed on the need to close the center but debated the timeline and funding mechanisms:
- **Closure Timeline**: The House proposed closing the center by **October 1, 2022**, while the Senate suggested a later date of **March 1, 2023**.
- **Committee Oversight**: A committee was established to oversee the closure, replacement, or repurposing of the facility. The House version included a broader mandate for the committee to seek expert advice and consider repurposing the existing facility rather than building a new one.
- **Funding**: The Senate appropriated **$10.4 million for FY 2022** and **$9.922 million for FY 2023** for the center’s operation. The House shortened the funding timeline to align with its proposed October 2022 closure, potentially freeing up funds for new facility construction.
- **Juvenile Justice Reform**: The House emphasized the importance of **HB 254**, which limits juvenile incarceration to serious violent crimes and introduces a "system of care" for less severe offenders. The Senate had not yet reviewed HB 254, leading to debates about whether it should be included in the budget or addressed separately in the next legislative session.

#### **2. Child Behavioral Health and Medicaid**
The committee addressed concerns related to child behavioral health and Medicaid:
- **Data Collection and Privacy**: Representatives raised concerns about the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) collecting extensive data beyond the Medicaid population, emphasizing the need for robust privacy and security protections.
- **Program Redundancy**: Discussions highlighted potential redundancies in reports related to child behavioral health and the state health assessment commission.

---

#### **3. Abortion Funding and Family Planning**
The committee debated amendments related to abortion funding and family planning services:
- **House Amendment**: Representative Edwards proposed an amendment to ensure financial and physical separation between abortion services and state family planning funds, including provisions for contract terminations and incentives for clinics.
- **Senate Amendment**: Senator Bradley introduced an alternative amendment emphasizing no public funding for abortion services, requiring financial record inspections, and imposing penalties for non-compliance. The Senate’s amendment passed **7-1**, overriding the House’s position.

---

#### **4. Child Care Services**
The Senate proposed shifting child care payments from attendance-based to enrollment-based. The House, led by Representative Edwards, recommended removing this provision from HB2 due to implementation challenges, including IT system limitations and funding issues. The House suggested addressing the matter in a separate policy bill next session.

---

#### **5. Renewable Energy and Other Budgetary Issues**
- **Renewable Energy Fund**: An amendment was adopted to ensure the Renewable Energy Fund could continue operations during budget gaps by seeking fiscal committee approval, preventing interruptions in rebate and grant programs.
- **Site Evaluation Committee**: The House agreed to remove the Department of Energy commissioner from the committee to avoid potential tie votes, deferring further policy discussion to the next session.
- **Medical Insurance Subsidy Trust**: The committee unanimously supported a comprehensive review of the Medical Insurance Subsidy Trust account, including fund transfers and compliance with state and federal laws.

---

#### **6. Legislative Process and Amendments**
The meeting underscored the legislative process of amending bills, with discussions on:
- **Nullifying Prior Legislation**: Examples included nullifying **Senate Bill 85** and incorporating new language to address evolving priorities.
- **Funding and Policy Alignment**: The House and Senate worked to reconcile differences in funding priorities and program scopes, ensuring alignment with broader legislative goals.

#### **7. Other Key Discussions**
- **Body-Worn Cameras**: Adjustments were made to funding for body-worn cameras for the Department of Corrections.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the complexities of reconciling differing legislative priorities, particularly regarding the Sununu Youth Services Center’s closure, juvenile justice reform, and funding for critical programs. The discussions emphasized the need for compromise and careful consideration of policy changes to ensure effective outcomes. The committee resolved many differences but deferred complex issues, such as child care payment reforms and HB 254, to future policy discussions or separate legislation. The meeting concluded with an agreement to reconvene the following day to finalize amendments and address remaining issues.
