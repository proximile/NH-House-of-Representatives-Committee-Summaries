**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (June 8, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened electronically on June 8, 2021, to discuss revenue projections, budget adjustments, and the impact of various economic factors on the state’s finances. The meeting, held via Zoom due to the COVID-19 state of emergency, focused on refining revenue estimates for fiscal years 2021 (FY21), 2022 (FY22), and 2023 (FY23) across multiple funds, including the General Fund, Education Trust Fund, Highway Fund, and Fish and Game Fund. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Revenue Projections and Methodology**
1. **Base Year Debate**: The committee grappled with whether to use FY21 as a baseline for future projections, given its anomalous nature due to COVID-19-related federal stimulus, Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, and other economic interventions. Some members advocated for using FY19 and FY20 data instead, as FY21 was considered an outlier.
2. **Business Taxes**: The committee tentatively agreed on a FY21 business tax revenue estimate of $985 million, higher than the Senate’s $963.2 million but lower than initial projections. They acknowledged uncertainties around PPP refunds, which are expected to reduce revenues by $25.4 million in FY22 and $44 million in FY23, and the impact of the single sales factor, which could lead to additional revenue losses.
3. **Final Adjustments**: After extensive debate, the committee settled on revenue projections of $998 million for FY22 and $993.7 million for FY23, factoring in PPP refunds and the single sales factor. They emphasized the need for caution due to ongoing economic recovery and stimulus impacts.

### **Revenue Streams and Adjustments**
1. **Meals and Rooms Tax**: The committee aligned with Senate estimates, considering pent-up demand and stimulus effects. They also discussed a Senate proposal to divert 30% of this revenue to a dedicated fund for local municipalities, which would reduce the general fund’s reported revenues.
2. **Tobacco and Liquor Taxes**: Adjustments were made to tobacco tax projections due to slowed sales, while liquor tax estimates were revised to account for potential transfers to the Medicaid expansion fund.
3. **Education Trust Fund**: A decision was made to transfer mortgage payments from the Lottery Commission to the Education Trust Fund, adding $200,000 annually.
4. **Highway and Fish & Game Funds**: Minor adjustments were made to highway fund projections, while fish and game revenue estimates saw a slight increase.

### **Federal Stimulus and Economic Impact**
1. **ARPA and Economic Boost**: The committee considered the ongoing effects of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which is expected to continue stimulating the economy through FY22 and possibly beyond. This led to discussions about whether to taper revenue growth projections in FY23.
2. **Inflation Concerns**: While inflation was briefly mentioned as a potential factor affecting revenue growth, it was deemed too speculative to incorporate into immediate decisions.

### **Committee of Conference and Final Votes**
1. **Auditor Positions**: The committee deferred a debate on including two high-level auditor positions to the Committee of Conference, with the House supporting inclusion and the Senate advocating for removal.
2. **Final Position**: The committee unanimously adopted the discussed figures as its official position for the upcoming Committee of Conference, ensuring alignment with Senate numbers where appropriate.

### **Challenges and Next Steps**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of forecasting revenues in an uncertain economic climate, balancing accuracy with prudence. The committee acknowledged the need for clear communication with the Senate to avoid confusion over adjustments. Moving forward, they planned to continue refining estimates for other revenue sources and prepare for the Committee of Conference.

### **Conclusion**
The June 8, 2021, meeting underscored the Ways and Means Committee’s efforts to navigate unprecedented economic conditions, incorporate federal stimulus impacts, and refine revenue projections for the state’s upcoming budget. Through detailed discussions and collaborative decision-making, the committee sought to ensure fiscal responsibility while addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic and economic recovery.
