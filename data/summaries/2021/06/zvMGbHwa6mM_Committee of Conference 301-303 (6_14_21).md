The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 14, 2021, focused on House Bill 187, which pertains to the emergency powers of the Commissioner of Health and Human Services and the membership of the Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services. The discussion centered on two main points of disagreement:

1. **Oversight Committee Membership**: The House version of the bill proposed two Senate members on the Oversight Committee, while the Senate amended it to three. The committee discussed the practicality of having three members, considering attendance issues and the ability to form a quorum. It was noted that the House can appoint alternates, which could help ensure sufficient attendance for committee votes. The Senate preferred retaining three members, and the House seemed open to this.

2. **Emergency Order Oversight**: The bill aimed to provide a mechanism for the legislature or the Oversight Committee to review and potentially halt emergency orders issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services. There was debate over the balance of power between the executive branch and the legislature, with concerns raised about legislative bodies without expertise potentially blocking science-based emergency responses. The committee discussed the need for a high threshold (e.g., a supermajority) to override emergency orders and the possibility of reducing the 90-day review period to make it more manageable.

The committee also referenced House Bill 417, which addresses the governorâ€™s emergency powers, suggesting that the resolution of HB 417 might influence the final language of HB 187. The meeting ended with an agreement to reconvene the next morning to continue discussions and find mutually acceptable language.
