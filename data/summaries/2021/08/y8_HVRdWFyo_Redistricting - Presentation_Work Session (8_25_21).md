**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Redistricting Meeting (August 25, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on August 25, 2021, focused on the redistricting process, featuring presentations, software demonstrations, and planning for public engagement. The session centered on the use of redistricting software, the legal framework for redistricting, and the logistical steps necessary to ensure fair and representative district maps. Here are the key points:

---

### **1. Redistricting Software Demonstration and Usage**
- **Software Overview**: Joel Anderson, a former state employee and nonpartisan expert, demonstrated redistricting software he developed a decade ago. The software assists in creating legislative and floterial districts (overlay districts used to balance population deviations) while ensuring districts are contiguous and meet federal "one person, one vote" requirements.
- **Functionality**: The software allows users to create, save, and adjust district maps, generate potential solutions, and calculate population deviations. It provides tabular data for compliance with legal standards and enables interactive adjustments to district lines.
- **Installation**: The software is Windows-compatible and includes three files: a license agreement, a house redistricting file, and a congressional redistricting file. Installation is straightforward, with shortcuts created on the desktop.
- **Limitations**: The software cannot generate solutions for certain counties (Coos, Grafton, Rockingham, and Stratford) due to computational constraints. It also does not account for natural boundaries (e.g., rivers) or school districts, focusing solely on population numbers.

### **2. Census Data and Legal Framework**
- **2020 Census Data**: The committee unanimously agreed to use the 2020 census data as the foundation for redistricting, as required by law. The ideal population per representative is **3,443.8225**, with deviations ideally kept within **±5%** to comply with federal requirements.
- **Challenges**: Some cities, such as Franklin, Claremont, and Somersworth, face delays in completing their redistricting efforts, which could impact the committee’s work. Portsmouth’s redistricting will require legislative action due to a recent change in state law.

---

### **3. Public Engagement and Listening Sessions**
- **Listening Sessions**: The committee plans to hold public listening sessions in each county to gather input on redistricting. These sessions are scheduled for September and early October, with committee members tasked with identifying accessible and central locations.
- **Website for Public Input**: A website will be created to allow public comments and map submissions. Public hearings will also be held after maps are drawn to gather feedback.

---

### **4. County-by-County Redistricting Process**
- **Example: Sullivan County**: Joel Anderson walked through the process of creating districts for Sullivan County, demonstrating how towns are grouped to meet population requirements and how the software suggests potential maps that comply with deviation limits.
- **Floterial Districts**: These districts are used when towns cannot be perfectly grouped due to population constraints. They combine multiple towns to ensure equal representation, though only the underlying districts have deviation calculations.

---

### **5. Timeline and Next Steps**
- **Deadline**: The committee aims to finalize redistricting plans by November 18, 2021.
- **Technical Assistance**: Joel Anderson will assist with technical questions about the software but will not help create maps, maintaining his nonpartisan role.
- **Thumb Drive Distribution**: Committee members received thumb drives containing the software and census data for independent use. Updates will be provided as cities finalize their ward redistricting.

---

### **6. Key Considerations and Challenges**
- **Mathematical Focus**: Redistricting is primarily a mathematical exercise to ensure equal representation, but factors such as school districts, transportation routes, and natural boundaries may influence final decisions.
- **Software Updates**: The software uses exact population numbers without rounding until the end of calculations, ensuring accuracy in deviation measurements.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting emphasized the importance of adhering to census data, leveraging technology to streamline the redistricting process, and engaging the public to ensure fair representation. The committee is focused on meeting legal requirements, addressing technical challenges, and finalizing district maps by the November deadline. Public input and transparency remain central to the process, with listening sessions and a dedicated website planned to gather feedback.
