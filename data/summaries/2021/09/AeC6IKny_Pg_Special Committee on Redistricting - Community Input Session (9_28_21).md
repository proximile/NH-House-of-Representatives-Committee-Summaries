**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting - Community Input Session (September 28, 2021)**

The **New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting** held a **Community Input Session** on **September 28, 2021**, at the Grafton County Courthouse. The session aimed to gather public feedback on the redistricting process, which occurs every 10 years following the federal census. Attendees included committee members from both the House and Senate, as well as residents from various communities across New Hampshire. The meeting was recorded and made available online for public access.

### Key Themes and Testimonies:

1. **Canaan’s Representation**:
   - Multiple speakers, including residents and officials from Canaan, emphasized the need for Canaan to have its own representative in the legislature. They argued that the current district setup does not adequately address the town's unique issues, such as water and sewer affordability, education taxes, and diversity. They stressed the importance of fair representation and problem-solving over partisan politics.

2. **Fair and Transparent Process**:
   - Several speakers, including Darla Bruno and Mary Heckon Phillips, called for a fair, transparent, and non-partisan redistricting process. They urged the committee to avoid gerrymandering, ensure districts are logically drawn, and provide opportunities for public input before and after maps are drawn.

3. **North Country Collaboration**:
   - Representatives from the North Country highlighted the importance of networking and collaboration among communities to address shared issues. They emphasized the strength of working together to solve regional problems.

4. **Constitutional Compliance**:
   - Speakers referenced the New Hampshire Constitution, particularly Article 9 and Article 11, which require equitable representation and adherence to principles of equality in districting. They argued that the current system often violates these principles by creating districts with unequal population sizes and fragmented communities. **Gail Kinney** and **Mike Sampson** specifically criticized the 2011 redistricting process for ignoring constitutional requirements that towns like Canaan have their own representative districts.

5. **Concerns About Gerrymandering**:
   - Many expressed concerns about partisan gerrymandering, which they argued undermines democracy by favoring one party over another. **Paul Phillips** criticized the 2011 redistricting process, citing examples of partisan gerrymandering in congressional, state senate, and floaterial districts. He emphasized the need for districts that reflect geographic, social, and economic communities of interest.

6. **Community of Interest**:
   - Speakers stressed the importance of keeping communities of interest together in the same district. This includes shared school districts, public utilities, and regional planning areas. They argued that current districts often split these communities, making it difficult for representatives to effectively serve their constituents.

7. **Accessibility and Inclusion**:
   - Several speakers called for greater accessibility in the redistricting process, particularly for those who cannot attend in-person meetings due to health, childcare, or transportation issues. They suggested using remote access tools like Zoom to ensure broader participation.

8. **Historical Context**:
   - Some speakers referenced past redistricting efforts, noting that previous maps had worked better by keeping communities together. They urged the committee to revisit these earlier models to create more cohesive and representative districts.

9. **Litigation and Costs**:
   - Concerns were raised about the potential for costly litigation if the redistricting process is not transparent or fair. Speakers cited examples from other states where secretive processes led to expensive legal battles, and they urged New Hampshire to avoid this outcome.

10. **Equity for Rural Communities**:
    - **Susan Duncan**, a former state senate employee, highlighted the challenges faced by northern New Hampshire communities, which are often overlooked due to their low population density. She called for more equitable representation and smaller districts to better serve rural areas.

11. **Call for Independent Redistricting Commission**:
    - Some speakers advocated for an independent redistricting commission to draw the maps, arguing that this would reduce partisanship and ensure a fairer process.

### Committee Response:
The committee acknowledged the importance of public input and reiterated its commitment to transparency and fairness in the redistricting process.

### Overall:
The testimonies highlighted a strong desire for fair, transparent, and community-focused redistricting that avoids partisan manipulation and ensures equal representation for all residents. The speakers urged the committee to prioritize the voices of the people and adhere to constitutional principles in their decision-making. The session underscored the community’s desire for fair, transparent, and constitutionally compliant redistricting that ensures equitable representation for all New Hampshire residents, particularly those in rural and underserved areas.
