**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting Community Input Session (9/22/21)**

On September 22, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting held a community input session at the Stratford County Courthouse to gather public feedback on the redistricting process, which occurs every ten years following the federal census. The session underscored the community’s strong desire for a fair, transparent, and inclusive redistricting process that respects local ties, ensures equitable representation, and avoids partisan bias. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key themes and concerns raised during the session:

### **1. Transparency and Timeliness**
- **Early Release of Draft Maps**: Multiple speakers urged the committee to release redistricting plans well in advance to allow sufficient time for public review, court scrutiny, and for potential candidates to understand district boundaries. Criticism was directed at the previous redistricting process, which allowed only 24 hours for public reaction.
- **Public Feedback**: Participants emphasized the importance of holding additional public hearings once draft maps are available to ensure meaningful community input before finalization.

### **2. Fair Representation and Anti-Gerrymandering**
- **Fair and Unbiased Maps**: Speakers stressed the need for district maps that reflect New Hampshire’s political and geographic diversity, warning against gerrymandering. They advocated for districts that encourage collaboration and compromise among representatives.
- **Historical Gerrymandering**: The history of gerrymandering in New Hampshire, particularly in Executive Council District 2, was cited as a significant issue undermining public trust. Some called for an independent commission to oversee redistricting to reduce partisan influence.

### **3. Community of Interest**
- **Preserving Local Ties**: Many participants highlighted the importance of preserving communities of interest, such as shared school districts, emergency services, and cultural ties, when drawing district lines. They argued that current district alignments often dilute local representation and ignore geographic and economic connections.
- **Town and School District Boundaries**: Residents from towns like Somersworth, Dover, Madbury, Rollinsford, and Stratford expressed dissatisfaction with current district alignments, advocating for districts that respect natural community boundaries to ensure effective local representation.

### **4. Accessibility and Inclusion**
- **Remote Participation**: Concerns were raised about the lack of remote participation options, which disenfranchises those unable to attend in-person meetings due to transportation, work, or disability issues. Virtual participation options were suggested to ensure broader public engagement.
- **In-Person Engagement**: One speaker emphasized the necessity of representatives presenting redistricting maps in person to voters, particularly for elderly and young parents who may not access online resources.

### **5. Youth Engagement and Future Representation**
- **Youth Involvement**: A speaker highlighted the need for greater youth engagement in the redistricting process, noting that many young people feel disconnected from government and are leaving the state due to a lack of representation and affordability.

### **6. Proposed Solutions and Technological Tools**
- **Alternative Maps**: The Open Democracy Mapathon group presented alternative maps designed to be fair, compact, and reflective of communities of interest, contrasting them with the current gerrymandered executive council map.
- **Algorithmic Solutions**: Jim Vershuren, a retired computer science professor, introduced software he developed to generate potential redistricting maps that meet constitutional requirements, such as ensuring towns with sufficient population have their own representatives. He emphasized the importance of minimizing violations of constitutional requirements and the need for clear criteria in selecting redistricting plans.

### **7. Technical and Legal Considerations**
- **Constitutional Requirements**: Representative Timothy Horrigan discussed the technical aspects of redistricting, including the use of software and the need for flexibility in deviation from ideal population numbers. He also highlighted the importance of considering communities of interest and avoiding non-contiguous districts.
- **Historical Lessons**: Jack Gale shared a cautionary tale from Massachusetts, where redistricting led to fragmented representation and loss of trust. He urged the committee to honor the ideals of fairness and transparency to avoid similar issues.

### **8. Legislative Acknowledgment**
- **Committee Response**: Committee members acknowledged the complexity of the redistricting process and thanked participants for their input. They clarified procedural issues and encouraged further online submissions, emphasizing their commitment to a transparent and inclusive process.

### **Conclusion**
The session highlighted widespread public demand for a redistricting process that prioritizes fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. Speakers called for early release of draft maps, preservation of communities of interest, and measures to ensure accessibility for all residents, including remote participation options. The committee was urged to avoid gerrymandering, engage youth, and leverage technology to create viable and compliant district maps. Ultimately, the community’s input emphasized the importance of a redistricting process that upholds democratic principles and ensures equitable representation for all New Hampshire residents.
