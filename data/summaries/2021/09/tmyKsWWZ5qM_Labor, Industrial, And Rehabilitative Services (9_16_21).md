The transcript from the NH House of Representatives meeting on Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services (9/16/21) appears to be highly repetitive and lacks substantive content. The speaker repeatedly apologizes and expresses gratitude, frequently stating, "I'm sorry" and "Thank you." They also repeatedly affirm that something is a "good thing," "very good thing," "great thing," or "very important thing to do," but without specifying what that thing is. The transcript does not provide any clear discussion, debate, or decision-making related to the meeting's agenda. It concludes with the speaker indicating they will get started and see participants next time, but no meaningful information is conveyed.
