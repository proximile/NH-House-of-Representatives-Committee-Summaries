The transcript from the NH House of Representatives meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (9/14/21) appears to be a repetitive and fragmented exchange. The speaker repeatedly says "Thank you" and "I'm sorry," along with phrases like "She's a beautiful girl" and "I think it's a good question." The content lacks substantive discussion or specific details about the meeting's agenda, suggesting it may be an error, placeholder, or non-verbal communication (e.g., acknowledgments or interruptions) rather than a meaningful dialogue.
