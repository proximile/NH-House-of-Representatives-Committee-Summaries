**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting Work Session (October 20, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting convened on October 20, 2021, to advance the redistricting process for state representative, congressional, and county commissioner districts. The meeting focused on public engagement, map drafting, logistical planning, and addressing technical and procedural challenges. Key highlights from the session include:

### **Public Input and Accessibility**
- The committee completed county-based public input sessions, with members attending at least one session. Issues with accessibility and audio quality during these hearings were noted, prompting discussions on improvements for future sessions.
- To ensure broad public participation, the committee planned additional public input sessions during the week of November 8th, including a potential evening session off-site to accommodate individuals unable to attend during the day.
- Public feedback emphasized a preference for minimizing floaterials (shared representatives) in favor of smaller, more localized districts, even if it complicates population balancing.

### **Map Drafting and Review**
- Representative McGuire presented initial draft maps for Belknap, Grafton, and Merrimack counties, highlighting challenges in achieving equal population sizes and minimal deviations, particularly in Belknap County.
- The committee stressed the need for further refinement of the maps and emphasized the importance of submitting draft maps to staff at least 24 hours before meetings to ensure proper review and preparation.
- Technical difficulties, such as printing and accessibility issues for members without mapping software, were addressed, with the committee chair committing to providing staff support to streamline these processes.

### **Legislative and Logistical Planning**
- The committee outlined a timeline for finalizing redistricting maps, with detailed discussions scheduled for November 3rd and 4th, executive sessions on November 16th and 17th, and a goal to report out by November 18th.
- House Bill 55, which addresses the election of state party convention delegates, was discussed. Representative Barry argued that the current system, which involves state funding for private party delegate elections, is problematic and potentially unconstitutional. He proposed amending the bill to remove state involvement, leaving delegate selection to the parties themselves.

### **Website and Public Engagement**
- Committee members were reminded to check the redistricting website for public submissions and updates on redistricting bills, such as HB 51 and HB 52. Issues with file uploads (e.g., requiring PDF format) were noted.
- The committee emphasized the importance of making the redistricting process transparent and accessible to the public, including providing maps and information on the website ahead of public hearings.

### **Key Challenges and Solutions**
- Balancing equal population sizes with minimal floaterials remained a significant challenge, particularly in counties with uneven population distributions.
- The committee prioritized collaboration and public engagement, acknowledging the need for precise map drafting to meet legal and logistical requirements.
- Technical issues, such as map sharing and printing, were addressed with proposed solutions to ensure smoother workflows and accessibility for all members.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committeeâ€™s commitment to a transparent, inclusive, and efficient redistricting process. By addressing public feedback, refining draft maps, and resolving logistical and technical challenges, the committee aimed to meet its November deadlines and ensure fair representation for New Hampshire residents.
