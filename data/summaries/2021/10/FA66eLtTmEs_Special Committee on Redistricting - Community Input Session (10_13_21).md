The transcript is from a **Special Committee on Redistricting Community Input Session** held in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, on October 13, 2021. The meeting was convened to gather public feedback on the redistricting process, which occurs every 10 years following the federal census. Key points from the session include:

1. **Introduction and Process**: The meeting was hosted by members of the NH House and Senate Redistricting Committees. It was recorded and broadcasted locally. The session aimed to collect input on redistricting for congressional, executive council, state senate, state representative, county commissioner, and state party convention districts.

2. **Public Concerns**: Several representatives and residents voiced concerns about the current redistricting system, particularly the use of **floterial districts** (multi-town districts). They argued that these districts are confusing, reduce voter engagement, and create unequal representation. Speakers emphasized the need for **fair maps**, **transparency**, and **single-member districts** to ensure equal representation.

3. **Sullivan County Specifics**: Attendees highlighted the unique geographic and economic connections between towns in Sullivan County. They suggested that districts should align with major transportation routes (e.g., I-91, Route 12A, Route 11) and shared community interests. Concerns were raised about towns being grouped in ways that do not reflect their natural affiliations.

4. **Gerrymandering and Partisanship**: Multiple speakers expressed concerns about **gerrymandering** and the need to avoid partisan manipulation in redistricting. They urged the committee to create **competitive districts** that reflect New Hampshire’s status as a **purple state** (evenly split between Democrats and Republicans).

5. **Census Data and Representation**: Representatives shared census data for their districts and discussed population deviations. They advocated for districts with equal population sizes and minimal deviations to ensure fair representation.

6. **Proposals for Change**: Suggestions included creating **single-member districts** for towns like Grantham, Newport, and Sunapee, and eliminating floterial districts. Speakers also recommended grouping towns with shared economic, educational, and governmental interests.

7. **Call for Transparency**: Attendees urged the committee to hold additional public meetings once draft maps are created to ensure community input is considered before final decisions are made.

8. **Closing Remarks**: The committee thanked attendees for their input and acknowledged the complexity of the redistricting process. They emphasized the importance of creating fair and impartial districts that reflect the needs of all New Hampshire residents.

Overall, the session highlighted the community’s desire for a **transparent**, **non-partisan**, and **equitable** redistricting process that ensures fair representation for all voters.
