The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting held a community input session on October 12, 2021, in Cheshire County. The purpose of the meeting was to gather local knowledge and feedback on redistricting efforts. Committee members, including Senators and Representatives, introduced themselves and outlined their roles. The session emphasized the importance of understanding local perspectives on what works well, what doesn’t, and what changes might be needed in district boundaries.

Key points from the meeting:

1. **Constitutional and Legal Framework**: Several speakers clarified misconceptions about the New Hampshire Constitution’s redistricting requirements. They emphasized that towns are not automatically entitled to their own representative districts unless their population is within a "reasonable deviation" from the ideal population for a district. Historical context from the 2006 constitutional amendment and 2011 redistricting was discussed.

2. **Cheshire County Representation**: Concerns were raised about Cheshire County being split across multiple Senate districts, diluting its influence. Suggestions were made to consolidate the county into two Senate districts to better represent its shared interests, such as school districts and economic ties.

3. **Executive Council Districts**: The current Executive Council District 2, which spans from the Vermont border to the sea, was criticized for its lack of geographic and community coherence. Participants urged the committee to create districts with more geographic commonality.

4. **Community of Interest**: Speakers stressed the importance of maintaining districts that reflect shared community interests, such as towns connected by the Connecticut River. They argued that districts should be based on natural geographic boundaries and common economic or social ties rather than political advantage.

5. **Public Transparency**: Participants emphasized the need for transparency in the redistricting process, urging the committee to share proposed maps publicly and allow for further community feedback before finalizing decisions.

6. **District Success Stories**: Representatives from Cheshire District 1 highlighted the effectiveness of their current district, which includes four towns along the Connecticut River. They argued that the district’s shared interests and geographic cohesion make it a model for successful redistricting.

7. **Avoiding Gerrymandering**: Multiple speakers expressed concerns about gerrymandering and urged the committee to prioritize fair representation over political advantage. They called for an independent redistricting process in future cycles.

The meeting concluded with gratitude to the hosts and staff for facilitating the session, and the committee encouraged continued public input through their website and local representatives. The session’s recording was made available on YouTube for public access.
