**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting Work Session (September 30, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting convened a work session on September 30, 2021, to address the redistricting process for the state’s House of Representatives. The meeting focused on technical, legal, and procedural aspects of redistricting, emphasizing fair representation, public input, and adherence to constitutional requirements. Key discussions and decisions from the session are summarized below:

---

### **Roll Call and Safety Concerns**
The session began with a roll call, confirming the attendance of 15 committee members. Representative Weber raised concerns about the seating arrangement, noting that it did not allow for adequate social distancing. The committee discussed adjusting seating for future meetings to ensure safety.

---

### **Redistricting Software and Technical Challenges**
Committee members shared feedback on the redistricting software provided on thumb drives. Issues included compatibility with Apple computers and difficulties in mapping specific counties, particularly Merrimack County due to population discrepancies in Concord wards. The committee acknowledged the need to address these technical challenges to ensure accurate and efficient redistricting.

---

### **Number of Representatives**
The committee debated whether to adjust the number of representatives from the current 400, as allowed by the state constitution (375-400). Representative Barry presented a detailed analysis, suggesting that 391 representatives would provide the most proportional distribution across counties. However, after discussion, Representative Smith moved to maintain the number at 400 for the 2020 redistricting cycle, a motion that passed unanimously.

### **Methodology for Redistricting**
David Andrews from Open Democracy Action proposed an alternative methodology for calculating "floaterial" districts—districts that combine towns or wards to meet population requirements. He critiqued the current "component method" as overly restrictive and introduced an "alternative component method" that would allow more towns to have their own districts while still adhering to constitutional requirements. The committee discussed the distinction between "necessary" and "unnecessary" violations of the New Hampshire Constitution, with necessary violations occurring when towns must be combined due to population size, and unnecessary violations arising when towns that could have their own districts are combined.

---

### **City Wards and Population Equalization**
The committee addressed challenges related to city wards, particularly in Manchester, Concord, and Nashua, where ward populations are significantly unequal. They debated whether to assume cities would equalize their ward populations or proceed with current data. Ultimately, the committee decided to assign equal populations to each ward for mapping purposes, assuming cities would complete their redistricting processes appropriately.

---

### **Legal and Constitutional Considerations**
The committee acknowledged the tension between U.S. constitutional law and New Hampshire’s constitution regarding population deviations in districts. They emphasized the importance of minimizing deviations while adhering to legal requirements to ensure fair representation.

---

### **Public Input and Transparency**
Throughout the session, the committee underscored the importance of transparency and public input in the redistricting process. They recognized the complexity of redistricting and the need to balance mathematical efficacy with fair representation. The committee also highlighted the need to finalize redistricting maps by November 18, 2021, to meet legislative deadlines, while noting that some cities, like Rochester, were on track to complete their redistricting by November, while others might not finalize their ward lines until January 2022.

---

### **School Districts and Communities of Interest**
Representative Marjorie Smith raised the importance of considering school districts and communities of interest when combining towns. She suggested that high school districts, in particular, should be a factor in redistricting decisions to ensure that communities with shared interests remain together in the same district.

---

### **Next Steps**
The committee agreed to update their mapping software with equalized ward populations and send a letter to cities, urging them to complete their redistricting processes promptly. They also planned to schedule additional meetings to review maps and incorporate public feedback.

---

### **Historical Context**
The committee reviewed the history of constitutional amendments related to the number of representatives, noting that previous attempts to reduce the number had been defeated. This historical context informed their decision to maintain the current number of representatives.

---

### **Conclusion**
The work session highlighted the complexity of the redistricting process, emphasizing the need to balance legal requirements, public input, and practical considerations. The committee committed to ensuring fair and proportional representation for New Hampshire citizens while addressing technical challenges and fostering transparency throughout the process.
