The transcript is from a New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting community input session held on October 7, 2021. The session was chaired by Representative Steven Smith, who opened the meeting by explaining that the session would be recorded and made publicly available. He emphasized that this was not a typical legislative meeting and thanked the county commissioners and court system for allowing the use of the courthouse for the session.

Several representatives and senators introduced themselves, including Karen McGuire, Marjorie Smith, Connie Lane, Matt Wilhelm, and Senator Greg, who outlined their roles and committees. Senator Greg also reminded attendees to remain respectful during testimonies.

The session focused on gathering public input on the redistricting process, which occurs every 10 years following the federal census. The committee explained that redistricting would affect congressional, executive council, state senate, state representative, county commissioner districts, and state party convention delegates. Attendees were encouraged to provide local knowledge and insights to help shape the redistricting process.

Several individuals spoke during the session, including Representative Hatch, who highlighted the unique characteristics of Coos County and the importance of considering local community ties in redistricting. Edith Tucker, another speaker, emphasized the shared economic and social challenges faced by towns in her district, particularly in the tourism and forestry industries.

Senator Erin Hennessey also spoke, reiterating the importance of maintaining strong representation for Coos County, given its rural nature and distinct needs compared to the southern part of the state.

The session concluded with a brief recess to allow for additional attendees, and the committee thanked everyone for their participation and input. The meeting was set to be uploaded online for public access.
