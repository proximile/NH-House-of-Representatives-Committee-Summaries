**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting - Community Input Session (10/19/21)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on Redistricting held a community input session on October 19, 2021, to gather public feedback on the redistricting process. The session, recorded and made publicly available, highlighted widespread concerns and recommendations from residents and organizations across the state. Key themes emerged from the discussions, emphasizing the need for transparency, fairness, and respect for local representation.

### **Key Concerns and Recommendations:**

1. **Partisan Gerrymandering and Transparency**:
   - Multiple speakers criticized the 2011 redistricting process for being secretive, partisan, and undemocratic, leading to gerrymandered districts that favored one political party. They urged the committee to ensure a fair, transparent, and nonpartisan process in 2021.
   - Residents called for greater public involvement, including access to software algorithms, census data, and committee meetings. They also requested that draft maps be shared with the public for review before finalization.

2. **Restoration of Local Representation**:
   - **Meredith and Guilford**: Residents from Meredith advocated for the restoration of their town’s independent voting district, which was combined with Guilford in 2011. They argued that the two towns share no common interests and that Meredith historically had its own representation for over 200 years.
   - **Belmont, Gilmanton, and Alton**: Residents from these towns expressed concerns about district fragmentation and the need for exclusive representation to address their unique needs.
   - **Laconia**: A suggestion was made to grant Laconia an additional representative due to its population size and distinct issues.

3. **Community of Interest Mapping**:
   - Representatives from organizations like Open Democracy Action and the Mapathon Coalition highlighted efforts to create fair maps based on communities of interest, such as shared schools, healthcare regions, and municipal services. They offered technical support to the committee to ensure fair and competitive districts.

4. **Historical and Legal Context**:
   - Several speakers referenced New Hampshire’s long tradition of town meetings and democratic governance, urging the committee to honor this legacy by ensuring fair and impartial redistricting.
   - The committee was reminded of constitutional requirements for districts to be contiguous and for towns to have their own representatives if they meet population thresholds. Federal voting rights laws, including the principle of "one person, one vote," were also discussed.

5. **Impact on Democracy**:
   - Many speakers stressed the importance of fair redistricting for preserving democracy, voter trust, and representation. They warned that continued gerrymandering would undermine public confidence in the electoral system.

6. **Requests for Additional Public Input**:
   - Several individuals requested a second round of public input sessions after draft maps are released to allow for further community feedback.

### **Committee Process and Structure**:
- The session was facilitated by senators and House members, including Senator James Gray (Chair of the Senate Special Committee on Redistricting) and Senator Regina Birdsell. House members also introduced themselves and their roles.
- The committee thanked staff and organizations for facilitating the sessions statewide and emphasized the importance of public input in shaping the redistricting process.

### **Conclusion**:
The meeting underscored the critical need for transparency, fairness, and adherence to legal and constitutional standards in the redistricting process. Residents and organizations urged the committee to prioritize local representation, respect communities of interest, and ensure that the final maps are legally sound and reflective of New Hampshire’s democratic traditions. The call for additional public input sessions highlighted the community’s commitment to active participation in shaping fair and equitable districts.
