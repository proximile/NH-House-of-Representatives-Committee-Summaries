### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (October 22, 2021)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on October 22, 2021, to address a wide range of fiscal and policy issues, including funding allocations, audits, cybersecurity, mental health care, and public health initiatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Approval of Minutes and Funding Allocations**
- The meeting began with the approval of the September 17, 2021, meeting minutes, amended to include updates on the Department of Education’s voucher program, including student enrollment numbers and the impact of mask mandates.
- **Homeless Services**: Senator Rosenwald inquired about the $6 million allocated for homeless services, which Deputy Director Chase clarified was designated for COVID-related shelter expenses rather than increasing reimbursement rates.
- **Long-Term Care**: Rosenwald also questioned the $11.5 million allocated for long-term care. Chase explained the amount was based on the number of long-term care beds in the state and a per-bed stipend.
- **Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERA)**: The committee discussed the progress of the ERA program, which had spent approximately $50 million of its $180 million allocation. Concerns were raised about the federal government reclaiming unused funds.
- **EMS Training**: Senator Daniels questioned the effectiveness of a $371,000 grant for EMS training, emphasizing the need for measurable outcomes like reduced ambulance wait times rather than just the number of providers trained. The Department of Safety highlighted the program’s focus on expanding mobile integrated healthcare (MIH) and inter-facility transport services.
- **Fish and Game Grant**: A grant for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department to develop a boat landing, picnic area, and temporary staff housing on Great Bay was discussed.
- **ARPA Funding**: The committee approved a $100,000 ARPA funding request from the Department of Environmental Services.

#### **2. Fiscal Audits and Cybersecurity**
- **Vaccine Registry**: The committee discussed the state’s immunization information system and the opt-out process for vaccine recipients. Concerns were raised about ensuring providers comply with privacy laws and adequately inform patients about their rights.
- **Department of Labor Audit**: The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) presented a financial audit of the Department of Labor, identifying 10 areas for improvement, including outdated IT systems (e.g., the AS400 computer system), payroll procedures, and financial reconciliations. The department agreed with the findings and is working on remediation.
- **Cybersecurity**: The committee emphasized the shared responsibility for cybersecurity between the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) and individual agencies. Concerns were raised about the lack of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and the need for regular testing of continuity of operations plans. The Department of Labor acknowledged the need for improved IT planning and expressed confidence in recent strategic efforts.
- **Legislative Action**: The audit suggested legislative action to resolve conflicting statutes and embed strategic IT planning into legislation to ensure long-term upgrades and accountability.
- **Education Freedom Account Program**: An update on the Education Freedom Account (voucher) program was expected but rescheduled for the November meeting.

#### **3. Hampstead Hospital Acquisition and COVID-19 Vaccine Funding**
- **Hampstead Hospital Acquisition**:
  - The state is considering purchasing Hampstead Hospital, the sole provider of inpatient children’s psychiatric services in New Hampshire, to address critical gaps in mental health care. The hospital currently operates 45 beds but has the potential to expand to 111 beds.
  - The purchase would be funded with $15 million in ARPA funds, and the state plans to partner with a third party to manage the hospital, similar to the New Hampshire Hospital model.
  - Concerns were raised about the rapid pace of the decision, the lack of a detailed operating budget, workforce retention, and the hospital’s COVID-19 vaccination policy for employees. Despite these concerns, the committee unanimously approved the allocation, emphasizing the importance of addressing the state’s mental health crisis.
- **COVID-19 Vaccine Funding**:
  - The committee discussed allocating $4.68 million in ARPA funds to support voluntary school-based vaccination clinics and other immunization programs. The program is designed to enhance vaccine accessibility without mandates.
  - Concerns about data privacy and the state’s vaccine registry were addressed, with officials clarifying that the registry operates on an opt-out basis and individuals can withdraw their data at any time.
  - The discussion acknowledged that COVID-19 is likely to become endemic, requiring ongoing vaccination efforts similar to annual flu shots.
