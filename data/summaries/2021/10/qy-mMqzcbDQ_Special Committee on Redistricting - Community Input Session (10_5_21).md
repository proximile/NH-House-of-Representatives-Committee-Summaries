On October 5, 2021, the **New Hampshire Special Committee on Redistricting** held a public input session at the Rockingham County Superior Court in Brentwood, NH. This session was part of the redistricting process following the 2020 Census, which determines legislative and congressional districts.

### **2. Public Concerns and Advocacy for Fair Representation**
- **Town-Specific Representation**: Multiple residents from towns such as Deerfield, Candia, Hampstead, Chester, Atkinson, and Kingston expressed concerns about losing dedicated representatives.
