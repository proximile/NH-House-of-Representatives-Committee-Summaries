### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Hearing on Education and Vaccine Mandates (11/16/21)

On November 16, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives held a public hearing focused on two major issues: **COVID-19 vaccine mandates** and **local education freedom accounts (EFAs)**. The hearing featured extensive testimony from healthcare workers, educators, business owners, and concerned citizens, reflecting deep divisions over personal freedoms, public health, and educational policy. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and debates.

---

#### **1. COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates and HB 255**
The hearing prominently addressed **HB 255**, an amendment aimed at prohibiting mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations in New Hampshire. The amendment sought to protect individuals who object to vaccination for reasons of personal conscience, religious belief, or medical concerns, including prior recovery from COVID-19.

##### **Key Arguments in Support of HB 255**:
- **Personal Freedoms**: Many speakers emphasized the importance of individual rights, bodily autonomy, and informed consent. They argued that vaccine mandates infringe on constitutional rights and New Hampshire’s “Live Free or Die” ethos.
- **Vaccine Safety Concerns**: Testifiers raised questions about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, citing concerns about adverse effects (e.g., myocarditis, blood clots, menstrual irregularities) and the lack of long-term safety data. Some highlighted personal stories of vaccine injuries or adverse reactions.
- **Natural Immunity**: Several speakers argued that natural immunity from prior COVID-19 infection provides stronger and longer-lasting protection than vaccines, citing studies to support their claims.
- **Economic and Social Impact**: Small business owners and healthcare workers warned of the consequences of mandates, including job losses, workforce shortages, and societal division. They expressed frustration with the lack of transparency in exemption processes and the financial burdens imposed by federal mandates.
- **Government Overreach**: Many accused federal and state governments of overreach, using emergency powers to enforce mandates without sufficient legislative oversight. They called for protecting individual rights and resisting federal overreach.

##### **Key Arguments Against HB 255**:
- **Public Health Concerns**: Opponents, including healthcare professionals and public health advocates, argued that vaccines are critical for reducing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting public health. They emphasized that mandates have historically been effective in controlling infectious diseases.
- **Employer Rights**: Some contended that private businesses and organizations should have the right to set their own vaccination policies to protect employees and customers.
- **Misalignment with Education Committee**: Critics noted that the amendment was unrelated to education and introduced late in the legislative process, bypassing normal procedures.
- **Scientific Evidence**: Opponents countered that vaccines are a critical tool in combating the pandemic and that mandates are necessary to protect public health.

##### **Broader Themes**:
- **Personal Rights vs. Public Health**: The debate centered on the balance between individual freedoms and collective responsibility in addressing the pandemic.
- **Scientific and Ethical Concerns**: Both sides referenced studies and data to support their positions, though interpretations of the evidence differed.
- **Constitutional Principles**: The amendment was framed as a defense of state sovereignty and individual rights, particularly the right of conscience.

#### **2. Local Education Freedom Accounts (HB 607)**
The hearing also addressed **HB 607**, which proposes a **localized version of the state’s Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) program**. The bill allows school districts to create their own EFA programs if approved by a **60% supermajority vote** at the district level. Key points included:

##### **Overview of HB 607**:
- The program uses **local funds** and keeps all state and federal funding with the district.
- Students remain enrolled in their resident school district, and special education services continue to be provided by the district.
- The **income eligibility cap** (300% of the federal poverty level) was removed, making the program accessible to all families regardless of income.
- The amendment clarified that **tutoring costs** are allowable expenses under the program, including non-certified tutors.

##### **Debate and Concerns**:
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about the bill’s potential impact on local school budgets, particularly the loss of local funds if students opt for private or homeschool options. They also questioned the **constitutionality** of using public funds for religious education and the **lack of a fiscal note**.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill provides families with more educational options and keeps state and federal funding intact for districts. They emphasized that it is **enabling legislation**, giving local districts the choice to adopt the program.

##### **Outcome**:
- The committee voted to pass the bill as amended (Amendment 2250), with a divided vote reflecting the contentious nature of the proposal.

#### **3. Executive Session on HB 255**
Following the public hearing, the committee held an executive session to deliberate on HB 255. Key discussions included:

##### **Amendment Details**:
- The amendment would prohibit any entity in New Hampshire from compelling individuals to receive a COVID-19 vaccine if they object based on personal conscience, religious beliefs, or medical reasons.
- It does not prevent entities from implementing other safety protocols, such as masking or distancing.

##### **Federal vs. State Law**:
- Lawmakers debated the potential conflict between the amendment and federal mandates, particularly the OSHA rule requiring vaccinations for employees of large companies.
- Some argued that the amendment would support New Hampshire’s lawsuit against federal mandates, while others expressed concerns about nullifying federal law, which could lead to legal challenges.

##### **Impact on Businesses and Healthcare**:
- Discussions highlighted the challenges businesses and healthcare facilities might face if the amendment passed, particularly in balancing employee rights with public health concerns.
- Some lawmakers emphasized that accommodations, such as reassigning unvaccinated workers to lower-risk roles, would still be possible under federal law.

##### **Outcome**:
- The committee moved to vote on the amendment, with discussions indicating strong support for its passage. However, the process involves further steps, including potential review by the full House, Senate, and governor.

#### **Overall Themes and Conclusions**
The hearing reflected deep divisions over **COVID-19 vaccine mandates** and **education policy**, with passionate arguments on both sides. Key themes included:
- **Personal Rights vs. Public Health**: The debate centered on the balance between individual freedoms and collective responsibility.
- **Scientific Evidence and Ethical Concerns**: Both sides referenced studies and data to support their positions, though interpretations of the evidence differed.
- **Government Overreach and State Sovereignty**: Many speakers accused federal and state governments of overreach, calling for protecting individual rights and resisting federal mandates.
