The **New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting Public Input Session**, held on November 10, 2021, provided a platform for residents, advocates, and experts to voice their concerns and feedback on proposed redistricting maps for congressional and state legislative districts. The session, which was live-streamed and emphasized transparency, revealed widespread opposition to the majority (Republican) redistricting plan, with speakers accusing it of gerrymandering and undermining fair representation. Key themes and takeaways from the testimonies include:

### 1. **Concerns Over Gerrymandering**  
   - **Partisan Manipulation**: Numerous speakers criticized the majority map for being blatantly partisan, arguing that it was designed to favor Republican candidates by packing Democratic-leaning voters into specific districts. This practice, they claimed, would reduce electoral competition, diminish voter choice, and create predetermined outcomes.  
   - **Erosion of Democracy**: Testifiers framed gerrymandering as an attack on democratic principles, allowing politicians to choose their voters rather than the other way around. They warned that this would lead to decreased voter participation, further political polarization, and a loss of trust in the electoral process.  

### 2. **Support for Fair and Non-Partisan Redistricting**  
   - **Minority Proposal**: Several speakers supported the minority (Democratic) redistricting plan, which they described as fairer and more in line with constitutional requirements. This plan made minimal changes to ensure equal population distribution and kept communities of interest intact.  
   - **Independent Commission**: Many called for the establishment of an independent redistricting commission to eliminate partisan bias and ensure that maps are drawn fairly, transparently, and without political manipulation.  

### 3. **Impact on Communities**  
   - **Splitting Communities**: Testifiers from towns such as Hudson, Nashua, Deerfield, and Concord highlighted how the proposed maps would split towns, counties, and school districts, disrupting communities of interest and diluting their political influence. They argued that these changes would harm local governance and representation.  
   - **Historical Boundaries**: Speakers emphasized the importance of preserving historical boundaries and maintaining compact, contiguous districts that reflect shared social, economic, and geographic ties.  

### 4. **Legal and Constitutional Concerns**  
   - **Violations of the New Hampshire Constitution**: Several speakers, including attorneys, warned that the proposed maps violated constitutional provisions, particularly those requiring towns with sufficient population to have their own districts. They argued that the maps disproportionately affected minority groups and could lead to costly legal challenges.  
   - **“One Person, One Vote”**: Critics contended that the maps failed to uphold the principle of equal representation, with some districts being significantly over- or under-populated.  

### 5. **Technical and Ethical Issues**  
   - **Flawed Methodology**: Experts in mapping and planning pointed out technical flaws in the majority map, such as high population deviations, non-contiguous districts, and a lack of compactness. They stressed the importance of adhering to ethical redistricting standards.  
   - **Cost and Voter Education**: Concerns were raised about the financial burden of informing voters about district changes and the potential for expensive lawsuits if the maps were challenged.  

### 6. **Bipartisan Opposition**  
   - **Unified Call for Fairness**: The testimony reflected bipartisan opposition to the majority map, with both Democrats and Republicans urging the committee to reject partisan gerrymandering and adopt fair, nonpartisan redistricting that serves the interests of all New Hampshire citizens.  

### 7. **Process Improvements**  
   - **Transparency and Collaboration**: While some speakers commended the committee for allowing public input, they urged further improvements, such as clearer redistricting standards, greater collaboration between parties, and more opportunities for public engagement.  

### Specific Criticisms of the Proposed Maps  
   - **Congressional Redistricting**: The proposed Republican congressional map would move **75 towns and over 365,000 people** into new districts, a significant departure from historical redistricting practices. Critics argued that this was designed to ensure Republican control of one congressional district at the expense of fair representation.  
   - **State Legislative Maps**: Speakers pointed out specific issues, such as the splitting of towns, the creation of non-contiguous districts, and the disproportionate representation of certain areas.  

### Calls to Action  
   - **Reject Partisan Maps**: Testifiers implored the committee to reject the proposed Republican maps and return to the drawing board to create fair, competitive, and constitutionally compliant maps.  
   - **Uphold Democratic Principles**: Speakers emphasized the need for transparency, fairness, and adherence to democratic principles in the redistricting process to ensure that all New Hampshire residents are equitably represented.  

### Conclusion  
The public input session highlighted significant dissatisfaction with the proposed redistricting plans, with speakers from across the political spectrum calling for fair, nonpartisan maps that prioritize competitive elections, preserve communities of interest, and uphold constitutional and democratic principles. The committee was urged to reconsider its approach and adopt redistricting practices that reflect the will and interests of all New Hampshire citizens.
