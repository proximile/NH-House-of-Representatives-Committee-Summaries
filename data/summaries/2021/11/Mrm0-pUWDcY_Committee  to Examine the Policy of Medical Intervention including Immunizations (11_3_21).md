**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee Meeting on Medical Intervention and Immunizations (11/3/21)**

On November 3, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee convened to examine policies related to medical interventions, including immunizations. The meeting focused on the intersection of state laws, federal mandates, ethical considerations, and local decision-making in the context of public health. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Purpose and Goals of the Committee**
The committee’s primary goal was to explore the intersections of state laws and agency rules regarding medical interventions and immunizations. The aim was to identify areas that may require legislative action, including strengthening, weakening, or maintaining existing policies. The committee also sought to clarify ambiguities in terminology, such as the lack of a clear definition of "medical intervention" in New Hampshire law.

### **2. Key Issues and Discussions**
#### **a. Vaccination Clinics and Consent**
- Representatives discussed whether vaccinations are administered with freely given consent or if coercion is involved, particularly in employment contexts. It was clarified that individuals attending vaccination clinics do so voluntarily, and no one is forced to receive a vaccine.
- Concerns were raised about the ethical obligation of medical professionals to ensure consent is free from coercion, especially when livelihoods are at stake. The broader implications of mandates on workforce retention were also considered.

#### **b. Informed Consent**
- The importance of informed consent in medical procedures was emphasized, including the need for patients to understand treatments, risks, and alternatives. Exceptions for emergencies were noted.
- The committee debated the ethical implications of vaccine mandates, particularly when individuals feel pressured to vaccinate due to employment or other external factors.

#### **c. Local Authority and Policies**
- The Department of Education clarified that decisions on masking and vaccination policies are left to local school boards, based on state statutes and administrative rules. There was no evidence of local municipalities requiring vaccinations beyond public health mandates.
- The New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA) highlighted that schools require parental consent for medical interventions, except in emergency first aid situations. Immunization requirements and exemptions, including religious and medical exemptions, were also discussed.

#### **d. State and Federal Law Conflicts**
- The committee examined potential conflicts between state and federal laws, particularly regarding vaccine mandates. The supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution was referenced, with the state required to follow federal laws unless challenged in court.
- Specific legislative bills, such as HB 220 (related to COVID-19 vaccine mandates), were discussed in the context of state enforcement of federal mandates.

#### **e. Role of DHHS and Public Health Authority**
- Representatives from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) explained their authority under RSA 141-C, which includes issuing isolation and quarantine orders and requiring treatment for communicable diseases like tuberculosis.
- DHHS officials clarified their role in public health interventions, emphasizing that they provide vaccines but do not administer them. Medical providers are overseen by the Office of Professional Licensure.

#### **f. Ethical and Legislative Considerations**
- The committee debated the ethical implications of mandates and the need to balance individual rights with public health priorities.
- Potential legislative actions were discussed to address tensions around mandates, informed consent, and the role of local authorities in medical interventions.

---

### **3. Future Considerations and Next Steps**
The committee identified several areas for further exploration and potential legislative action:
- Clarifying the definition of "medical intervention" in state law.
- Evaluating the ethical and legal implications of vaccine mandates, particularly in employment and educational settings.
- Strengthening informed consent protocols to ensure individuals fully understand the risks and benefits of medical procedures.
- Addressing conflicts between state and federal laws, particularly in the context of public health mandates.
- Gathering public input through scheduled sessions to inform future policy decisions.

### **4. Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing individual rights, informed consent, and public health mandates. The committee emphasized the importance of local decision-making and the need for legislative clarity to address ongoing tensions. Future discussions will focus on gathering additional information and public input to guide potential policy changes.

This comprehensive summary highlights the committee’s commitment to exploring these critical issues while ensuring transparency, ethical considerations, and respect for individual autonomy in the context of medical interventions and immunizations.
