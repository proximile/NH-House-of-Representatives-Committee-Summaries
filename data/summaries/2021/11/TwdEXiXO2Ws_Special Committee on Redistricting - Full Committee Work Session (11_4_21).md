**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on Redistricting Work Session (November 4, 2021)**

On November 4, 2021, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on Redistricting convened a work session to review and discuss proposed redistricting maps for congressional and state legislative districts. The committee focused on population balance, competitiveness, adherence to constitutional requirements, and the need for fair and equitable representation. The session was marked by detailed discussions on proposed maps, historical context, community interests, and the importance of transparency and public input.

### Congressional Districts
The committee reviewed two proposed congressional district maps. The first proposed minimal changes, moving only the town of Hampstead from Congressional District 1 (CD1) to Congressional District 2 (CD2) to address population imbalances. The second map proposed more significant changes, aiming to reunite towns in the southern tier of the state, which would require redistributing populations from the seacoast region. 

Debate ensued over the merits of these changes. Some representatives argued that the current maps have facilitated competitive elections and questioned the need for dramatic alterations. Others supported the new maps, emphasizing the importance of reuniting communities and addressing population shifts. Concerns were raised about breaking up regions like the seacoast, which share economic and cultural ties, with representatives stressing the need to consider "communities of interest" in redistricting.

The committee also discussed the historical development of New Hampshire's congressional districts, noting their origins in the late 19th century and past efforts to dilute certain voting blocs. While the current proposals were not intended to replicate such efforts, the competitive nature of the state's congressional districts remained a recurring theme. Representatives debated whether the proposed maps would maintain or disrupt New Hampshire's reputation for competitive elections.

### State Legislative Districts
The committee reviewed proposed maps for several counties, focusing on House and Congressional districts. Key highlights include:

- **Rockingham County**: A replacement map was reviewed after a Portsmouth ward was discovered to be omitted. The map and data were updated for accuracy.
- **Cheshire County**: Representative Marjorie Smith presented a proposal aiming for smaller, single-seat districts to improve representation. The plan included 18 districts (14 base and 4 floaterials) and increased the number of single-seat districts from 11 to 15, with a total deviation of 7.6%.
- **Carroll County**: Representative Turcotte presented a map with 8 districts and 2 floaterials, with a total deviation of 4.47%. The map emphasized creating districts for towns with sufficient population for their own representatives.
- **Grafton County**: Representative Bergeron presented a map with 15 districts (14 base and 1 floaterial) and 26 seats, prioritizing single-seat districts and achieving a total deviation of 7.48%. An alternative map by Representative Fellows was also discussed.
- **Hillsborough County**: Representative Wilhelm presented a map with 46 districts (38 base and 8 floaterials) and 123 seats, aiming to keep Manchester and Nashua separate from other towns. Representative Turcotte presented an alternative map with 45 districts and a total deviation of 9.95%.
- **Strafford County**: Representative Marjorie Smith presented a map with 25 districts (18 base and 7 floaterials) and 38 seats, separating Dover, Somersworth, and Rollinsford and keeping Rochester distinct. The total deviation was 9.85%.
- **Sullivan County**: Representative Steve Smith presented a map addressing the county's challenging geography, giving Grantham and Sunapee their own representatives, keeping Claremont together, and reducing the size of floaterials. The map aimed to address public feedback and improve representation.

### Minority-Majority Districts
The committee discussed compliance with federal laws regarding minority-majority districts. Representative Barry analyzed census data and found that Manchester Ward 5 was the most racially diverse area, but no single voting location had a majority-minority population. While the committee considered potential future changes, no guidance was issued on drawing lines based on race.

### Transparency and Public Input
Throughout the session, the committee emphasized the importance of transparency and public involvement. Plans were made to post the proposed maps online and hold public input sessions the following week. While acknowledging the inherently political nature of redistricting, some representatives stressed the need to prioritize fair representation over partisan advantage.

### Next Steps
The committee planned to reconvene the following Tuesday to continue reviewing maps and incorporate public feedback. The session concluded with a focus on creating fair and equitable districts that adhere to constitutional and statutory requirements while addressing the needs of New Hampshire's diverse communities.

This work session highlighted the complexities of redistricting, balancing historical context, community interests, and the practical challenges of achieving population balance and fair representation.
