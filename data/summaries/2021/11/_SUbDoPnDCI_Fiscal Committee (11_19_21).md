### **COVID-19-Related Funding and Discussions**  
- The committee approved $8 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for at-home COVID-19 testing, ensuring compliance with federal requirements.  
- Questions were raised about COVID-19 test result accessibility and reporting. HHS clarified that test results are reported to the state but not the federal government in identifiable form.  
- The vaccine registry system was discussed, with emphasis on its role in tracking vaccine supply, expiration dates, shipment, consumption rates, and waste rates. Concerns about privacy and the need for a privacy impact assessment were addressed, with HHS committing to explore the latter.  

### **Federal Medicaid and Education Funding**

### **Workforce Development**

- The committee also discussed broader workforce shortages, particularly in the healthcare sector, and the challenges of hiring and retaining staff.  

### **Privacy and Data Collection**

- Legislators emphasized their role in protecting constitutional rights and freedoms, expressing concerns about government overreach and the potential erosion of individual liberties.
