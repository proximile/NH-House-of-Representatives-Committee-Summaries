**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee Meeting on Medical Intervention Policies, Including Immunizations (November 4, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee convened on November 4, 2021, to examine policies related to medical interventions, particularly immunizations and vaccine mandates, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting featured extensive discussions on the ethical, legal, and public health implications of vaccine mandates, informed consent, employer responsibilities, and the challenges faced by healthcare systems, businesses, and families. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions:

### **Public Health and Vaccination Policies**
1. **Vaccine Development and Safety**:  
   - Dr. Kristen Johnson, a pediatrician, emphasized the rigorous process of vaccine development, approval, and the role of expert committees in creating the recommended vaccine schedule. She highlighted the safety and efficacy of vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, and their role in reducing severe illness and hospitalizations.  
   - The v-safe program was noted as a tool for real-time feedback on vaccine side effects, improving data collection compared to traditional methods.

2. **Pediatric Vaccination and School Safety**:  
   - Dr. Johnson advocated for ongoing immunization requirements for school attendance, stressing the importance of maintaining a safe school environment, especially for vulnerable populations.  
   - The committee discussed the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines for children aged 5 to 11 under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and the urgency of vaccinating this age group given the rise in pediatric cases in New Hampshire.

3. **Vaccine Registries and Privacy**:  
   - The importance of medical record-keeping and the role of vaccine registries were discussed, with emphasis on patient opt-out options and privacy concerns.

### **Employer and Business Challenges**
1. **Employer Vaccine Mandates**:  
   - Representatives from the Business and Industry Association (BIA) and the New Hampshire Retail Association (NHRA) testified about the challenges businesses face in implementing vaccine mandates. They highlighted the need for flexibility, clarity, and consistency in regulations, particularly in balancing employee safety, customer expectations, and federal mandates.  
   - Employers expressed concerns about liability risks, whether they mandate vaccines or not, and the financial burden of testing unvaccinated employees.

2. **Federal Vaccine Mandates**:  
   - Both BIA and NHRA criticized the federal vaccine mandate for employers with 100 or more employees, questioning its necessity given declining COVID-19 cases and inconsistencies, such as exemptions for smaller businesses.

3. **Religious and Medical Exemptions**:  
   - The committee discussed the complexities of handling religious and medical exemptions, noting the risk of civil rights lawsuits for employers who deny exemptions. Clarity in state laws regarding exemptions was recommended.

### **Healthcare System and Workforce**
1. **Vaccine Mandates in Healthcare**:  
   - Steve Ahnen, President of the New Hampshire Hospital Association, testified in support of vaccine mandates for healthcare workers, citing the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. He emphasized the role of vaccines in protecting patients, staff, and the community.  
   - Ahnen also highlighted the strain on hospitals due to the pandemic, including workforce shortages and the need to manage both COVID and non-COVID patients.

2. **Breakthrough Cases and Booster Shots**:  
   - Legislators questioned the effectiveness of vaccine mandates given breakthrough cases. Ahnen explained that while breakthrough cases occur, vaccinated individuals are far less likely to experience severe illness or hospitalization.  
   - The potential need for booster shots and their inclusion in existing mandates was discussed, though no decisions had been made.

### **Ethical and Legal Considerations**
1. **Informed Consent and Ethical Concerns**:  
   - The committee raised concerns about informed consent, particularly in the context of vaccine mandates. Discussions focused on the ethical implications of coercion, such as job loss, and whether healthcare providers should administer vaccines under such conditions.  
   - Strong opposition to federal vaccine mandates was expressed, with concerns about personal autonomy, religious beliefs, and workforce disruptions.

2. **State vs. Federal Authority**:  
   - The committee explored ways for New Hampshire to push back against federal mandates, including passing state laws expressing opposition to mandates, even if unenforceable, to strengthen legal challenges.

### **Impact on Vulnerable Populations**
1. **Pediatric Cancer Patients and COVID-19 Outcomes**:  
   - A study of pediatric cancer patients in Alabama showed significant impacts of COVID-19 on cancer treatment, with Hispanic patients experiencing lower cancer outcomes. The discussion underscored the importance of vaccination for high-risk populations.

2. **Remote Learning and Mental Health**:  
   - Families with high-risk children often chose remote learning and isolation, which had significant mental health and educational impacts. These consequences were noted as challenging to measure but a growing concern.

### **Future Actions and Recommendations**
- The committee expressed interest in further discussions on informed consent, the ethical responsibilities of healthcare providers, and the intersection of existing laws and regulations.  
- Plans were made to hold additional public hearings, gather more data, and possibly draft recommendations or legislation to address vaccine mandates and related issues.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of vaccine policies, balancing public health needs with individual rights, and the challenges faced by employers, healthcare systems, and families. The committee emphasized the need for clarity, consistency, and ethical considerations in crafting policies related to medical interventions and immunizations. Future discussions will focus on addressing these issues while supporting public health and protecting individual freedoms.
