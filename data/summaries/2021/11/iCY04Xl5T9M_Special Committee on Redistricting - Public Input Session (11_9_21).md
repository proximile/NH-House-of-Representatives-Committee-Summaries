**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting Public Input Session (November 9, 2021)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Redistricting held a public input session on November 9, 2021, to gather feedback on proposed redistricting maps for the state’s House, Senate, and Congressional districts following the 2020 Census. The session highlighted widespread public concern about the fairness, transparency, and partisan influence in the redistricting process, with numerous speakers voicing opposition to perceived gerrymandering and advocating for fair, nonpartisan solutions. Key themes and points from the session include:

---

### **1. Concerns About Gerrymandering**
Multiple speakers criticized the proposed Republican redistricting plans, particularly the congressional maps, for blatant partisan gerrymandering. They argued that the maps were designed to create one safe Democratic district and one safe Republican district, eliminating competitive elections and disenfranchising voters. Speakers emphasized that gerrymandering undermines democracy by predetermining election outcomes and silencing the voices of constituents.

---

### **2. Importance of Local Representation**
Many speakers stressed the need to maintain localized representation, particularly for towns that qualify for their own representatives under the New Hampshire Constitution. They criticized the majority maps for combining towns into multi-town districts, which they argued dilutes local representation and makes it harder for representatives to address the unique needs of their communities. Smaller, contiguous districts were advocated to ensure representatives can better serve their constituents.

---

### **3. Fairness, Transparency, and Nonpartisan Solutions**
Speakers called for a fair, transparent, and nonpartisan redistricting process, urging the committee to prioritize the interests of all voters over partisan gains. They referenced town votes and petitions from over 70 New Hampshire towns supporting fair redistricting and highlighted the overwhelming public demand for equitable maps. Some speakers suggested adopting maps proposed by nonpartisan groups like the Mapathon Project, which were praised for maintaining communities of interest and minimizing unnecessary splits.

---

### **4. Congressional Redistricting Critiques**
The proposed congressional redistricting plan faced significant criticism for shifting large portions of the population into different districts, effectively creating one safe district for each major party. Speakers argued that this would eliminate competitive elections and reduce voter engagement. They called for maps that reflect the will of the people rather than partisan strategies.

---

### **5. Constitutional and Legal Compliance**
Several speakers raised concerns about the proposed maps’ compliance with the New Hampshire Constitution and federal laws, such as the Voting Rights Act. They argued that the maps failed to adhere to constitutional principles, such as ensuring towns with sufficient populations have their own representatives, and raised potential legal issues, including racial gerrymandering in Nashua and population deviations in Claremont and Manchester.

---

### **6. Specific Map Critiques**
Detailed feedback was provided on specific maps, particularly in counties like Hillsborough, Sullivan, Rockingham, Belknap, and Carroll. Speakers highlighted issues such as deviations from population equality, the splitting of communities with shared interests, and the creation of awkwardly shaped districts. Towns like Rochester, Pelham, and Durham were specifically mentioned, with speakers emphasizing the importance of keeping historically and culturally connected communities together.

---

### **7. Public Engagement and Process Transparency**
Some speakers expressed frustration with the lack of transparency in the committee’s process, including the criteria used for drawing maps and the limited opportunities for public input. They called for more inclusive and accessible public hearings and urged the committee to prioritize the voices of constituents in their decision-making.

---

### **8. Moral and Democratic Principles**
Several speakers framed their opposition to the proposed maps in moral terms, arguing that gerrymandering undermines democracy and violates constitutional principles. They urged the committee to reconsider the maps to ensure fairness, uphold the integrity of the electoral process, and reflect the values of the Granite State.

---

### **9. Support for Minority Maps**
Some speakers supported the minority (Democratic) maps, which they argued better maintained competitive districts, minimized unnecessary governmental influence, and adhered more closely to constitutional principles.

---

### **Conclusion**
The session reflected strong public opposition to perceived partisan gerrymandering and a widespread call for fair, transparent, and nonpartisan redistricting. Speakers emphasized the importance of local representation, competitive elections, and adherence to constitutional and legal standards. The committee was urged to prioritize the interests of all Granite Staters, regardless of political affiliation, in their final decisions. The session concluded with the committee thanking participants for their input and encouraging continued communication as the redistricting process moved forward. The next public input session was scheduled for November 10, 2021.
