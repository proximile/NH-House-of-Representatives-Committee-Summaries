**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting Work Session (November 3, 2021)**

On November 3, 2021, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting convened a work session to review and finalize proposed redistricting maps for county commissioner and state representative districts across various counties. The committee focused on ensuring compliance with constitutional and legal standards, particularly regarding population deviation, while preparing for upcoming public input sessions. Key highlights from the meeting include:

### **Purpose and Goals**
The primary objective of the work session was to review and refine redistricting maps to meet constitutional requirements, such as equal population distribution and contiguity. The committee aimed to present these maps for public feedback during sessions scheduled for November 9 and 10, emphasizing transparency and fairness.

### **County-by-County Review**
The committee reviewed proposed maps for several counties, focusing on population deviations, district configurations, and geographic considerations:

- **Belknap County**: Two maps were discussed, with deviations of 5.4% and 7.0%. One map prioritized keeping Laconia intact, while the other emphasized geographic balance.
- **Coos County**: Two maps were presented, with deviations of 1.7% and 6.2%. One grouped northern towns together, while the other created compact districts, including Berlin and Lancaster.
- **Merrimack County**: Two maps were reviewed, with deviations of 5.6% and 2.7%. One made minimal changes by relocating Wilmot, while the other focused on keeping cities like Concord and Bow together.
- **Carroll County**: A single map with a 5.8% deviation divided the county into three districts based on geographic regions.
- **Cheshire County**: A map with a 7.5% deviation kept Keene intact while adding surrounding towns like Roxbury and Marlborough.
- **Grafton County**: Lebanon was maintained as a single city, with adjacent towns grouped based on population.
- **Sullivan County**: Minimal population changes led to retaining existing maps or making minor adjustments, particularly in Claremont and Newport.
- **Rockingham County**: Towns like Raymond and Londonderry were grouped based on existing configurations and high school attendance patterns. Several floats (additional seats) were proposed to balance populations.

### **Key Discussions**
1. **Incumbency**: The committee debated whether protecting incumbents should factor into redistricting. While some members saw it as a positive consideration, others emphasized that constitutional compliance and fair representation should take precedence over political considerations.
2. **Public Access**: Concerns were raised about the redistricting websiteâ€™s functionality, which hindered public access to maps. Efforts were underway to resolve the issue before the public input sessions.
3. **Redistricting Criteria**: The committee reiterated the importance of adhering to core constitutional and legal requirements, such as equal population distribution and contiguity, rather than peripheral factors like communities of interest or incumbency.
4. **District Configurations**: Discussions included single-seat vs. multi-member districts, the use of floats to balance populations, and grouping towns with shared interests, such as school districts.

### **Upcoming Work**
The committee planned to review maps for the remaining counties and congressional districts in subsequent sessions. They also focused on finalizing maps for public review and ensuring transparency by uploading them to the public website.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded on a collaborative note, with committee members acknowledging the complexity of redistricting and the importance of adhering to constitutional requirements. The focus remained on creating fair, legally compliant maps ready for public input and feedback. The committee planned to reconvene the following day to continue its work and finalize the redistricting process.
