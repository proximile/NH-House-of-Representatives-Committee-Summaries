The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on December 6, 2021, focused on updates and discussions related to the Seacoast Cancer Cluster Investigation and environmental contamination issues, particularly concerning the Coakley Landfill and PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Bedrock Investigation Update**: The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES) provided an update on the ongoing bedrock investigation at the Coakley Landfill. A pump test was conducted in spring 2021 to study groundwater movement, and a final report is expected by the end of December 2021. The results will be presented in detail at the next meeting on January 24, 2022.

2. **PFAS Contamination**: DES discussed PFAS sampling in private wells, surface water, and groundwater near the Coakley Landfill. A PFAS compound, PFOSA, was initially detected in a private well but later determined to be a false positive due to matrix interference. DES emphasized the challenges of detecting PFAS at low concentrations and the need for accurate testing methods.

3. **Five-Year Review**: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) completed its fifth five-year review of the Coakley Landfill site in September 2021. The review concluded that the current remedy is protective of human health and the environment but recommended further actions, including completing bedrock investigations, conducting a background study for arsenic and manganese, and continuing PFAS sampling.

4. **Surface Water Treatment**: DES provided an update on efforts to treat PFAS in Barry's Brook, as mandated by House Bill 494. A pilot study using bioabsorbent media was unsuccessful, and a new report on alternative treatment methods is expected in the first quarter of 2022.

5. **Cancer Registry Update**: Whitney Hammond from the New Hampshire Division of Public Health provided an update on the state cancer registry. No new cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) or pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) have been reported since the 2016 study, which identified higher-than-expected rates of these pediatric cancers in the Seacoast area. The commission discussed the need for broader cancer investigations and potential legislative action to address cancer clusters and environmental contaminants.

6. **Future Meetings and Recommendations**: The commission discussed future meetings, including a detailed presentation on the bedrock investigation on January 24, 2022, and potential discussions on PFAS and other contaminants in February. The commission aims to develop substantive policy recommendations based on empirical data by June 2022, with potential new legislation proposed in the fall of 2022.

Overall, the meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to address environmental contamination and cancer clusters in the Seacoast region, with a focus on gathering data, improving testing methods, and developing actionable recommendations for the state.
