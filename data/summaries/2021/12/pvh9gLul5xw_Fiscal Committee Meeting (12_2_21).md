The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on December 2, 2021, focused on the allocation and management of federal and state funds related to COVID-19 response efforts. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **FEMA Funds and Transfers**: The committee discussed the transfer of $26.5 million between different budget categories and the acceptance of $43.5 million in FEMA funds. These funds were initially managed under emergency powers during the COVID-19 state of emergency, but now require fiscal and executive council approval since the emergency order has ended.

2. **Historical Context**: Mike Kane, the Legislative Budget Assistant, provided a recap of how FEMA funds were managed during the state of emergency, emphasizing that over $212 million in FEMA funds were authorized for use by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) during 2020 and 2021.

3. **Voting on FIS 21-362**: The committee voted to approve the transfer and acceptance of FEMA funds, with a vote of 9 in favor and 1 opposed. Senator Guida opposed the measure, citing concerns about the virus being weaponized and the futility of trying to stop its spread.

4. **ARPA Funds for Hospital Capacity**: The committee also discussed and approved FIS 21-363, which involved accepting and expending $20.4 million in ARPA funds to increase hospital bed capacity and flexibility. The funds would be used to address the current 91% hospital capacity by moving patients to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, ambulatory surgical centers, and rehab centers. The vote was unanimous, 10-0.

5. **Strike Teams and Staffing**: A significant portion of the discussion revolved around the use of strike teams to address staffing shortages in long-term care facilities. The strike teams would be contracted at rates between $200 and $300 per hour per person, with the goal of opening up additional beds in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

6. **Concerns and Questions**: Committee members raised several questions about the transparency of federal fund allocations, the impact of vaccine mandates on staffing, and the need for better communication and updates on how federal funds are being used. There was also a request for a detailed analysis of the trends in COVID-19 cases, particularly with the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants.

7. **Future Meetings**: The next Fiscal Committee meeting was scheduled for December 17, 2021, at 10:00 AM.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the challenges of managing COVID-19 response funds and the need for continued flexibility and transparency in addressing the ongoing pandemic.
