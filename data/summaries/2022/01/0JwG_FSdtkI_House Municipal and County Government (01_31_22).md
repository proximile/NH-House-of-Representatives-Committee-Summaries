**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 31, 2022: House Municipal and County Government**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 31, 2022, covered a wide range of topics related to municipal and county governance, including property tax exemptions, veterans' benefits, elderly tax relief, property assessments, and the governance of Gunstock Mountain Resort. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **Property Tax Exemptions and Assessments**
1. **Residency and Income Requirements**:
   - Representatives debated changes to residency requirements for property tax exemptions, questioning the rationale for reducing the residency requirement from three to five years to one year. It was noted that the previous requirement lacked empirical evidence, and the new change was similarly subjective.
   - Adjustments to income ranges for property tax exemptions were based on inflation rates since 2008, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
   - A five-year marriage duration requirement for property tax exemptions was discussed to prevent incentivizing marriages for legal purposes rather than genuine relationships.

2. **House Bill 1342**:
   - This bill proposes adding an override provision to municipal charter provisions for tax caps, particularly addressing issues in Nashua where the lack of an override led to legal challenges. The bill also clarifies language and ensures a two-thirds super-majority vote for overrides.
   - Public testimony opposed the bill, with critics arguing that Nashua has a spending problem rather than a revenue issue and that the bill is vindictive toward certain officials.

3. **House Bill 1350**:
   - This bill allows residents to petition for a full re-evaluation of property for tax purposes. The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) opposed the bill, citing redundancy and lack of clarity, as there are already four existing avenues for such petitions.
   - Jim Micho, Chief Assessor of Hudson, explained the statutory requirement for communities to reassess property every five years and the challenges of maintaining equitable assessments.

### **Veterans' and Elderly Tax Relief**
1. **House Bill 1056: Veterans' Tax Credits**:
   - The bill proposes increasing the minimum veterans' tax credit from $50 to $200 and raising the optional tax credit upper limit from $750 to $900. It also removes the 90-day active service requirement for eligibility.
   - The changes aim to address inflation, create fairness, and ensure all veterans are treated equally, regardless of service duration. The bill includes a three-year phase-in period to mitigate costs.
   - Concerns were raised about the financial impact on smaller towns and whether the removal of the 90-day requirement could include individuals who served only briefly.

2. **House Bill 1057: Elderly Tax Exemptions**:
   - This bill lowers the eligibility age for elderly tax exemptions from 65 to 60, reduces the residency requirement from three consecutive years to one year, and updates income and asset criteria to reflect inflation since 2008.
   - The changes aim to help more elderly residents afford to stay in their homes by reducing property tax burdens. The bill includes a three-year phase-in period for communities to adjust.
   - Concerns were raised about the combined inclusion of age reduction and residency changes, as well as potential impacts on younger residents.

### **Veterans' Benefits and Definitions**
1. **House Bill 1375**:
   - This bill expands the definition of a veteran to include those discharged under honorable conditions, aligning state law with federal standards. This allows veterans with general discharges to access state benefits, such as property tax credits and veterans' cemetery eligibility.
   - The bill is supported by the New Hampshire Division of Veterans Services and the State Veterans Advisory Committee, who argue that veterans who served honorably should not be excluded from benefits.

### **Governance of Gunstock Mountain Resort**
1. **House Bill 1078**:
   - This bill proposes increased financial oversight of Gunstock Mountain Resort, a county-owned ski area, by requiring it to present an annual budget to the Belknap County delegation.
   - **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including Gunstock’s Vice Chairman, General Manager, and CFO, strongly opposed the bill, arguing that it would undermine the resort’s successful, independent operations. Gunstock operates as a self-sustaining business, generating all revenue from customers without taxpayer funding. The ski industry requires rapid decision-making, which the bill would hinder.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued for transparency, citing past financial struggles at Gunstock and the need to prevent future issues.
   - Public sentiment overwhelmingly opposed the bill, with over 3,000 petition signatures and testimonies highlighting Gunstock’s importance as a tourism and economic driver for Belknap County.

2. **Historical Context**:
   - Gunstock was established as an independent entity in 1959 to keep politics out of its management. The bill threatens this independence by making it a de facto county department, similar to the county nursing home, which has faced financial challenges.

### **Property Data and Reassessment**
- Representatives discussed property data collection and reassessment processes in towns like Derry and Hudson. The goal is to confirm and correct property data rather than reassess to full market value. Some communities opt for more frequent reassessments than the statutory requirement of every five years to reflect changes in property values accurately.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Property Tax and Exemptions**: Discussions focused on balancing fairness, affordability, and administrative feasibility for property tax exemptions and assessments.
- **Veterans' and Elderly Benefits**: Bills aimed to address inflation and rising costs, particularly for vulnerable populations, while minimizing the tax burden on others.
- **Gunstock Mountain Resort**: The debate centered on balancing financial oversight with preserving the resort’s successful, independent operations. Opponents argued that the bill would harm Gunstock’s competitiveness and financial stability, while supporters emphasized the need for transparency and accountability.
- **Next Steps**: Committees planned to hold executive sessions and finalize bills within the following weeks, with possible amendments to address concerns.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of municipal and county governance, particularly in balancing operational autonomy with financial accountability. The discussions underscored the importance of addressing inflation, supporting vulnerable populations, and ensuring transparent governance while preserving the success of key economic drivers like Gunstock Mountain Resort.
