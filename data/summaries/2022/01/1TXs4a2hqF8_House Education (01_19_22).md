The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 19, 2022, to discuss several education-related bills, focusing on teacher certification, student safety, curriculum standards, and public health initiatives. The meeting highlighted key legislative proposals and debates surrounding their potential impact on New Hampshire’s education system.

### **Teacher Certification and Background Checks**
1. **Teacher Certification and Education Rules**:
   - A bill was introduced requiring educators to complete a course on state education rules as part of their certification process, with a proposed implementation date of January 1st. Concerns were raised about the necessity of teachers knowing all state rules, particularly those unrelated to their curriculum. The discussion also addressed challenges for out-of-state educators needing to meet New Hampshire’s requirements.

2. **Criminal Background Checks**:
   - The committee discussed the importance of thorough criminal background checks for educators, including screening for offenses like homicide, child pornography, and felonious sexual assault. House Bill 1234 proposed adding human trafficking to the list of disqualifying offenses for educators, ensuring consistency with employment and credentialing standards.
   - Questions were raised about background checks for charter school teachers, with clarification that all employees, regardless of credentialing status, are subject to checks under RSA 189-13a. The committee also addressed background checks for bus drivers, substitute teachers, and students in teacher preparation programs.

### **Student Safety and Legislative Oversight**
1. **Transportation of Pupils**:
   - A bill was discussed to remove mileage requirements for using contract carriers (e.g., coach buses) for school activities, allowing schools to use them for shorter trips like field trips, provided they are approved by the district.

2. **Legislative Oversight Committee**:
   - A bill to repeal the Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program was introduced, part of a broader effort to eliminate outdated or unnecessary legislation.

### **Curriculum and Civil Rights Education**
1. **HB 1632 - Civil Rights Education**:
   - Representative Jordan Ellery introduced HB 1632, inspired by a program developed by Dr. Matthew Daniels and Ambassador Young, aiming to teach students about race relations, acceptance, and equality. The program emphasizes judging individuals by character rather than skin color, aligning with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s principles.
   - Opposition from education leaders, including Megan Tuttle (NEA-NH) and Deborah Howes (AFT-NH), argued that the bill could exacerbate fears under the state’s banned concepts law and disrupt social studies curricula.

2. **HB 1190 - Rulemaking by the State Board of Education**:
   - Representative Hobson introduced HB 1190, requiring that federally mandated curricula or programs be accompanied by adequate fiscal notes to prevent unfunded mandates, particularly in areas like special education.

### **Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)**
1. **HB 1639 - Changes to YRBS**:
   - Representative Boehm proposed shifting the YRBS from an opt-out to an opt-in system, citing concerns about parental rights and the survey’s content, including questions on sexual behavior and drug use.
   - Opponents, including the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and public health organizations, argued that an opt-in system would reduce participation rates, making the data less reliable and jeopardizing public health initiatives and federal funding.
   - Testimonies highlighted the survey’s role in addressing youth mental health, substance abuse, and violence prevention, with concerns raised about the potential harm of survey content and the lack of follow-up support for students.

### **Alternative Learning and Credit Programs**
1. **HB 1329 - Alternative Programs for Credit**:
   - This bill would allow students to earn credits for courses taken outside traditional high schools, provided they meet state board-approved competencies. The discussion emphasized competency-based learning and paralleled efforts in Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential erosion of local control, as the bill allows the state board to override local school boards in determining credit eligibility. The Learn Everywhere Program, which enables students to earn credits for learning outside the classroom, was highlighted as a model for other states.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Student Safety**: The committee emphasized the importance of thorough background checks and consistent policies to protect students in educational settings.
- **Curriculum Standards**: Debates centered on the integration of civil rights education, the impact of banned concepts laws, and the need for unfunded mandates to be accompanied by adequate funding.
- **Public Health and Data Collection**: The YRBS discussion highlighted the tension between parental rights and the need for reliable data to inform public health initiatives.
- **Innovative Learning**: The committee explored ways to expand learning opportunities through alternative programs like Learn Everywhere, while maintaining accountability and competency standards.

The meeting concluded with discussions on potential amendments and further hearings, underscoring the committee’s commitment to balancing innovation, safety, and accountability in New Hampshire’s education system.
