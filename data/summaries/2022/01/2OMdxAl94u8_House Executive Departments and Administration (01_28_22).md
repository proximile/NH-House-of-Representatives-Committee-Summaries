The NH House of Representatives meeting focused on two main bills: **House Bill 1192** and **House Bill 1563**, with additional discussion on **House Bill 1566**.

### **House Bill 1192: Acupuncture Licensing**
- The subcommittee discussed **HB 1192**, which addresses acupuncture licensing and qualifications.
- A related **Senate Bill 282** was mentioned, which deals with similar issues and has been amended to align closely with HB 1192.
- The subcommittee decided to **hold off on proceeding with HB 1192** until the Senate acts on SB 282. They plan to revisit the bill after seeing the Senate's decision, potentially amending it to match SB 282 if necessary.

### **House Bill 1563: State Employee Deferred Compensation Plan**
- **HB 1563** would require state employees to be automatically enrolled in a deferred compensation plan, with the option to opt out.
- There was significant debate over whether this should be mandatory or optional. Some members argued that employees should have the freedom to choose, while others believed automatic enrollment would encourage better retirement savings.
- Concerns were raised about the financial burden on employees, especially those with high-interest loans, and the potential penalties for early withdrawal from the plan.
- The subcommittee voted **4-1** to **recommend interim study (ITL)** for HB 1563, effectively putting it on hold.

### **House Bill 1566: Prescription Drug Affordability Board**
- **HB 1566** involves the **New Hampshire Prescription Drug Affordability Board**, with a proposed amendment (**Amendment 0041H**) to allow the board to hire staff and create a dedicated fund for fees.
- Some members raised concerns about the board's authority, including its ability to collect and sell data, assess fees, and operate with limited oversight.
- A motion was made to **abolish the board**, with arguments that its functions could be handled by existing state departments and that the board's creation lacked proper public scrutiny.
- The subcommittee voted **3-2** to **recommend abolishing the board**, with the amendment still adopted.

### **Key Outcomes:**
1. **HB 1192** was held pending Senate action on SB 282.
2. **HB 1563** was recommended for interim study (ITL).
3. **HB 1566** saw a motion to abolish the Prescription Drug Affordability Board, which passed 3-2, while the amendment to allow hiring staff and creating a fund was adopted. 

The meeting highlighted debates over government mandates, employee rights, and the role of state boards in regulating healthcare and retirement plans.
