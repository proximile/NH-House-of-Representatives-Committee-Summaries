**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (01/11/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 11, 2022, focused on a range of legislative topics, including prescription drug affordability, open-source software, state holidays, election day, biofuels, and cybersecurity. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **House Bill 1566: Prescription Drug Affordability Board**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to revise **RSA 21bb**, which established the Prescription Drug Affordability Board in 2020. The board’s role is to set spending targets for prescription drugs, collect drug price data, and assess fees from stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain.
- **Amendments**: Proposed changes include clarifying the **appointment and pay grade of the executive director** and establishing a **non-lapsing fund** to support the board’s operations. The board is self-funded through assessment fees, not the general treasury.
- **Concerns**: Discussions highlighted the need to **fast-track the bill** to meet the intended commemoration date (April 14th). Concerns were also raised about the **executive director’s pay grade** and whether it had been reviewed by the **Joint Committee on Employee Classification (JCC)**. The committee deferred finalizing the bill until these issues were addressed.
- **Next Steps**: The bill was assigned to **Representative Le’s subcommittee** for further review.

### **Open-Source Software Bills (House Bill 1273 & House Bill 1581)**
- **House Bill 1273**: This bill promotes the use of **open-source software (OSS)** in state government, ensuring software remains free and accessible. It includes provisions for **non-compete clauses** and the **right to examine source code**.
  - **Testimony**: **Representative Gallagher** and other experts emphasized the benefits of OSS, including **cost savings**, **transparency**, **security**, and avoiding **vendor lock-in**. OSS was also noted for its ability to extend the life of older hardware and support local developers.
  - **Opposition**: **Commissioner Dennis Goulet** of the Department of Information Technology opposed the bill, citing potential **increased costs**, **cybersecurity risks**, and **loss of federal funding**. He argued that the state already uses OSS where appropriate and that procurement processes already consider open-source solutions.
- **House Bill 1581**: This bill requires state agencies to consider OSS when acquiring new software, reinstating a similar law removed in 2018.
  - **Support**: Testifiers highlighted OSS’s flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with federal initiatives like **code.gov**. Bipartisan support was evident, with representatives emphasizing transparency and long-term savings.
- **Next Steps**: Both bills were assigned to **Representative Yakubovich’s subcommittee** for further review.

### **House Bill 1213: Establishing Election Day as a State Holiday**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes making Election Day a state holiday to encourage voter participation.
- **Discussions**: The bill has been introduced multiple times, with previous attempts narrowly failing. Concerns were raised about the **costs** and **productivity impacts** of making Election Day a holiday, as well as the **definition of a state holiday**. Some representatives argued against mandating businesses to provide time off, citing existing absentee voting options.
- **Next Steps**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further consideration.

### **House Bill 1123: Increased Use of Biofuels**
- **Purpose**: The bill encourages the use of **biodiesel** and **renewable diesel** in state applications such as heating and transportation.
  - **Benefits**: Biodiesel, derived from renewable resources like recycled cooking oil and soybean oil, is cleaner-burning, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and can be used in existing diesel engines and heating systems without modification.
  - **Challenges**: Issues include **distribution**, **public awareness**, and **cost differentials**. While biodiesel is competitively priced with petroleum diesel, demand remains low in New Hampshire.
  - **State Agency Role**: The bill directs state agencies to support biofuel use, but concerns were raised about the **vague language** (e.g., use of "shall") and lack of clear compliance parameters.
- **Next Steps**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review and clarification.

---

### **House Bill 1037: Governor’s Duties During a State of Emergency**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to simplify **RSA 21-P:43a** by removing phrases like "for informational purposes only" and "in order to ensure transparency."
- **Discussions**: Some representatives questioned the necessity of removing the transparency clause. The committee considered an amendment to retain the transparency language while removing other unnecessary phrases.
- **Next Steps**: The bill was held for further review.

---

### **House Bill 10002: State-Owned Take-Home Vehicles**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposed studying the feasibility of state-owned take-home vehicles.
- **Outcome**: The committee moved to kill the bill, noting that a recent study had already been conducted, concluding no significant financial impact.

---

### **Cybersecurity Discussions**
- The committee discussed the **log4j vulnerability** and its impact on state systems. **Commissioner Goulet** outlined ongoing efforts to improve **municipal cybersecurity**, including **tabletop exercises**, **cyber awareness training**, and **grant funding** from Homeland Security.

---

### **General Themes**
- **Transparency and Cost Savings**: Many bills emphasized transparency and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the context of open-source software and biofuels.
- **Bipartisan Support**: Several bills, including those related to OSS and biofuels, garnered bipartisan support, reflecting shared concerns about transparency, environmental impact, and long-term savings.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Discussions frequently addressed the fiscal implications of proposed legislation, with a focus on avoiding unnecessary costs and ensuring practical implementation.

### **Next Steps**
- Subcommittees were assigned to further review **House Bill 1566**, **House Bill 1273**, **House Bill 1581**, **House Bill 1213**, and **House Bill 1123**. The committee also decided to kill **House Bill 10002** due to redundancy.

The meeting underscored the House’s focus on addressing critical issues such as healthcare affordability, technological transparency, election accessibility, environmental sustainability, and cybersecurity, while balancing fiscal responsibility and practical implementation.
