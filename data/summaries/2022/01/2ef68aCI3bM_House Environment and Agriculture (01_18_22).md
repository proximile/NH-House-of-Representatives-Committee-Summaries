**Summary of the NH House Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (January 18, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 18, 2022, to discuss several bills addressing solid waste management, recycling, landfill regulation, and environmental protection. The meeting highlighted the state’s pressing waste management challenges and the need for updated policies to promote sustainability, accountability, and resource conservation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills covered during the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Landfill Accountability**
- **House Bill 1111**: Proposed establishing a commission to study Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which shifts the financial burden of waste management from municipalities to producers. Supporters argued that EPR could reduce landfill use, lower municipal costs, and encourage sustainable product design. Testimonies emphasized the growing waste management challenges faced by New Hampshire towns, including rising disposal costs and increasing waste volumes.
- **House Bill 1121**: Aimed to require private landfill operators to post surety bonds to cover potential damages caused by landfill operations. Proponents argued this would protect residents and businesses from environmental contamination costs. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of obtaining such bonds and the clarity of the bill’s language, with the Department of Environmental Services (DES) expressing confusion over enforceability.

#### **2. Landfill Permit Moratorium**
- **House Bill 1420**: Proposed a moratorium on issuing new landfill permits until the state’s Solid Waste Management Plan is updated. The current plan, last updated in 2003, is outdated and non-compliant with state law. Supporters argued that permitting new landfills could undermine waste diversion goals, while opponents raised concerns about the bill’s broad language potentially affecting recycling, transfer stations, and composting facilities. An amendment was introduced to narrow the bill’s scope to new landfills only, excluding expansions of existing facilities.

#### **3. Disposable Wipes Labeling and Disposal**
- **House Bill 1134**: Proposed establishing a commission to study the proper labeling and disposal of disposable wipes, which cause significant issues in wastewater and septic systems. Testimonies highlighted the environmental and financial impacts of non-biodegradable wipes labeled as “flushable.” The bill aims to recommend labeling standards, public education efforts, and disposal solutions to mitigate the problem.

#### **4. Landfill Siting and Groundwater Protection**
- **House Bill 1049**: Proposed a study committee to examine landfill siting criteria and methods for reducing pressure on landfill capacity. Supporters emphasized the need to protect land and water resources.
- **House Bill 1454**: Aimed to update landfill siting regulations by requiring a site-specific groundwater flow test to ensure contaminants do not reach nearby water bodies within five years. The bill seeks to replace the current 200-foot setback rule with a more scientifically grounded approach. Testimonies highlighted the importance of protecting New Hampshire’s water resources, but concerns were raised about the technical feasibility and enforcement of the proposed regulations.

#### **5. Bottle Redemption Program**
- **House Bill 1652**: Proposed a 10-cent bottle deposit and redemption program to incentivize recycling, reduce litter, and promote environmental and economic benefits. Supporters argued the bill would reduce solid waste, lower municipal costs, and protect New Hampshire’s tourism industry. Concerns were raised about the high redemption rate target (90%), enforcement costs, and the impact on municipal transfer stations that generate revenue from recycling. DES expressed concerns about the resources needed to implement the program effectively.

### **Common Themes and Challenges**
1. **Environmental Protection**: Many bills focused on reducing landfill use, protecting water resources, and promoting sustainable waste management practices.
2. **Accountability**: Legislation aimed to hold landfill operators accountable for environmental damages and ensure producers bear the costs of waste management.
3. **Regulatory Gaps**: Testimonies highlighted the need to update outdated regulations, such as the Solid Waste Management Plan, and address inconsistencies in landfill siting and permitting.
4. **Implementation Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the feasibility, funding, and enforcement of proposed measures, particularly for the bottle redemption program and landfill siting regulations.

### **Next Steps**
The committee concluded with calls for further discussion and refinement of the proposed legislation. Amendments were suggested to address concerns about scope, feasibility, and economic impact. The committee plans to continue deliberations, with potential executive sessions scheduled for the following week.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing New Hampshire’s waste management challenges through updated policies, increased accountability, and sustainable practices. While there was broad support for the environmental goals of the proposed bills, stakeholders emphasized the need for careful consideration of implementation, funding, and regulatory details to ensure effective and equitable solutions.
