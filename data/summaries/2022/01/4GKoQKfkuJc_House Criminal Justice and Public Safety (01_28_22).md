### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Criminal Justice and Public Safety (01/28/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 28, 2022, to discuss several bills addressing issues ranging from littering fines and land posting to cannabis legalization and the recording of public officials. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **HB 1571: Increasing Fines for Littering**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes a 20% increase in littering fines, with a portion of the revenue directed to the Fish and Game Department to support conservation efforts.
- **Discussion**:
  - Representatives debated the effectiveness of higher fines as a deterrent and the potential impact on tourism.
  - Concerns were raised about the bill's wording, particularly the use of percentage-based fines instead of fixed amounts.
  - The fiscal impact was estimated at less than $5,000 annually for Fish and Game.
  - Questions arose about whether illegal dumping on private or public land should be treated the same as littering, with suggestions to focus on larger environmental violations.

#### **HB 1108: Alternative Method for Posting Land**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows landowners to use purple paint stripes as an alternative to traditional "no trespassing" signs.
- **Discussion**:
  - Proponents argued that the purple paint method is more durable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly than plastic signs, which are labor-intensive to maintain and can damage trees.
  - Opponents raised concerns about the lack of recognition of purple paint in the Northeast, potential confusion with trail markings, and accessibility for colorblind individuals.
  - The bill does not eliminate traditional sign-posting but offers an alternative, addressing privacy concerns by making personal information on signs optional.

#### **HB 1468: Cannabis Legalization**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to remove cannabis from current statutes, effectively legalizing it.
- **Discussion**:
  - Representative Tony Lebranch introduced the bill but acknowledged that HB 1598, another cannabis legalization bill, was more comprehensive and recommended HB 1468 be deemed "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL).
  - Representative Sue Hamola opposed legalization, citing negative consequences in states like Colorado and Washington, including increased traffic deaths, youth usage, and organized crime.
  - Representative True supported legalization but preferred HB 1468 over bills that earmarked funds for state-run programs.

#### **HB 1175: Recording Public Officials**
- **Purpose**: The bill would allow individuals to record public officials performing their duties, aligning with federal court rulings.
- **Discussion**:
  - Supporters, including Lori Ordolano and Ralph Wenberber, emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability.
  - Opponents raised concerns about unintended consequences, such as recording minors in classrooms or discouraging personal interactions with constituents.
  - The committee voted to ITL the bill due to its broad language and potential risks to privacy in sensitive environments.

#### **HB 1282: Communication Records and Search Warrants**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to protect customer information from being shared with government entities without a valid warrant.
- **Discussion**:
  - Benjamin Gotti, Senior Assistant Attorney General, explained that the bill would replace administrative subpoenas with search warrants for accessing digital content, particularly in cases involving the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC).
  - Representatives debated the time and process involved in obtaining warrants versus subpoenas, with concerns about the impact on time-sensitive investigations.
  - The bill ultimately passed, with a focus on protecting constitutional rights while addressing law enforcement needs.

#### **Animal Welfare and Liability**

  - The bill addresses situations where dog owners fail to provide information after their dog injures someone. An amendment proposed making it a misdemeanor to leave the scene without providing information.
  - Angela Ferrari, representing Dog Owners of the Granite State, opposed the bill as written, citing concerns about the term "negligent" poisoning being too broad.
