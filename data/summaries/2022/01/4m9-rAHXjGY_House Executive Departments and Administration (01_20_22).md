**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration (01/20/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives committee meeting on January 20, 2022, focused on a series of bills related to professional licensing, administrative reforms, and regulatory oversight. The discussions centered on improving efficiency, ensuring public safety, and addressing workforce challenges while balancing professional autonomy and state oversight. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and bills discussed:

---

### **Key Themes**
1. **Streamlining Licensing and Regulatory Functions**:  
   Several bills proposed transitioning certain licensing boards (e.g., medical technicians, midwives, court reporters) from independent regulatory bodies to advisory roles. The goal was to shift administrative responsibilities to the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** while retaining professional expertise. This move aimed to address issues such as board quorum shortages, meeting delays, and inefficiencies in licensing and disciplinary actions.

2. **Public Safety and Professional Standards**:  
   Ensuring public safety was a recurring concern, particularly in healthcare fields like audiology, respiratory care, and midwifery. Representatives debated the necessity of licensing certain professions, with some advocating for reducing over-regulation while others emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards to protect the public.

3. **Workforce Challenges and Quorum Issues**:  
   Many licensing boards, especially in healthcare, struggled to meet due to workforce shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed solutions included adopting advisory models, hybrid meetings, and contingency plans to ensure timely licensing and regulatory oversight.

4. **Professional Autonomy vs. State Oversight**:  
   Bills affecting professions like midwifery and speech-language pathology sparked debates about the balance between professional autonomy and state oversight. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of preserving self-regulation and expert input in regulatory decisions.

5. **Licensing Necessity and Over-Regulation**:  
   Some representatives questioned the need for licensing certain professions, citing New Hampshire’s unique requirements (e.g., medical technicians) and the burden of over-regulation. Discussions highlighted the potential for reducing or eliminating unnecessary licensing requirements.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 1059**  
- **Purpose**: Addresses licensing boards that fail to meet quorum requirements, leading to automatic license issuance without proper qualification review.  
- **Concerns**: Public safety risks from unqualified individuals receiving licenses, particularly in healthcare fields.  
- **Proposal**: Allows the OPLC to deny licenses if applicants clearly do not meet qualifications, even if the board cannot meet.  

#### **House Bill 1018**  
- **Purpose**: Moves the Board of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy to an advisory model to address quorum issues and streamline licensing.  
- **Benefits**: Leverages board expertise without requiring frequent meetings, ensuring timely licensing and public protection.  

#### **House Bill 1061 (Midwifery Oversight)**  
- **Purpose**: Shifts regulatory authority from the New Hampshire Midwifery Council to the OPLC executive director.  
- **Concerns**: Opponents argued this undermines midwifery autonomy, removes professional input, and risks anti-competitive behavior.  
- **Testimony**: Strong public support for midwives, with calls to reject the bill and preserve the council’s 30-year history of self-regulation.  

#### **House Bill 1030 (Military Training Equivalency)**  
- **Purpose**: Includes the Coast Guard, Air Force, and Marine Corps in military medical training equivalency for Licensed Nursing Assistant (LNA) licensure.  
- **Goal**: Ensures flexibility to adapt to future changes in military occupational skills.  

#### **House Bill 1427 (Speech Pathology and Audiology Licensing)**  
- **Purpose**: Clarifies that both audiologists and hearing aid dealers should be represented on the licensing board.  
- **Concerns**: Board size and potential for tied votes.  

#### **House Bill 1016 (Speech-Language Pathologist Licensing)**  
- **Purpose**: Addresses dual licensing of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and speech-language specialists (SLSs), with proposals to consolidate oversight under the OPLC.  
- **Concerns**: Allowing individuals with only undergraduate degrees to be licensed as SLPs could lower professional standards and complicate Medicaid reimbursement.  
- **Amendment**: Broad support for phasing out the SLS license and consolidating licensing under the OPLC to align with national standards.

### **Key Outcomes and Next Steps**
- **Subcommittee Review**: Several bills, including those affecting midwifery and speech-language pathology, were referred to subcommittees for further refinement.  
- **Amendments**: Proposed amendments aimed to preserve professional autonomy, ensure public safety, and streamline licensing processes.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing public safety, professional autonomy, and administrative efficiency in occupational licensing. While there was consensus on the need to address quorum issues and streamline regulatory functions, debates over the necessity of licensing certain professions and the balance of state oversight versus professional input highlighted the complexity of these reforms. The committee’s next steps will involve refining bills through subcommittee review and addressing stakeholder concerns to ensure effective and equitable regulatory frameworks.
