**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Criminal Justice and Public Safety (01/14/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 14, 2022, to discuss several bills aimed at improving law enforcement accountability, transparency, and public safety. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including police misconduct, encryption of police communications, the use of force, and access to arrest records. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Police Misconduct and Accountability**
Several bills addressed police misconduct and accountability, with a focus on enhancing transparency and public trust:

1. **House Bill 1031**:
   - Establishes a **Law Enforcement Conduct Review Committee** to oversee complaints of police misconduct, ensuring **transparency** and **accountability**.
   - Creates a **central repository** for sustained findings of misconduct, with provisions for public disclosure while protecting officers from **frivolous claims**.
   - The bill was developed through a **unanimous consensus** by a study commission involving diverse stakeholders, including law enforcement, the ACLU, and public defenders.
   - Concerns were raised about the **composition of the Review Committee**, which is slightly weighted toward law enforcement, potentially appearing biased. A minor **housekeeping amendment** was requested to clarify language.

2. **House Bill 1682**:
   - Allows for the **suspension of an officer's certification** during an investigation, with a hearing before the council. If misconduct is sustained, the officer loses their license and cannot act in any law enforcement capacity.
   - The ACLU proposed amendments to enhance **transparency**, including making evidence public earlier in the process and maintaining a public website with sustained misconduct findings.
   - Law enforcement associations, including the New Hampshire Police Association and the Chiefs of Police Association, expressed support for the bill, emphasizing its role in building trust and accountability.

### **Police Communication Encryption**
**House Bill 1031** also sparked debate over the **encryption of police communications**:
   - Supporters argued that unencrypted communications are essential for **public transparency**, allowing citizens and media to monitor police activity.
   - Opponents, including law enforcement representatives, argued that encryption is necessary to protect **real-time information** and **officer safety**, citing examples like the Boston Marathon bombing where unencrypted communications led to misinformation.
   - Concerns were raised about the **cost** of implementing encrypted systems and ensuring **interoperability** with other agencies. The committee ultimately voted to recommend further study rather than immediate legislation.

---

### **Recording Custodial Interrogations**
**House Bill 1540** focused on requiring the **electronic recording of custodial interrogations** in their entirety:
   - Advocates, including the Innocence Project, highlighted that recording interrogations can prevent **false confessions**, which have played a role in nearly a third of wrongful convictions overturned by DNA evidence.
   - Concerns were raised about the **cost** and **feasibility** for smaller law enforcement agencies, though advocates noted that many agencies already use affordable handheld devices or body cameras.
   - Opponents, including the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, raised concerns about **privacy rights**, the **chilling effect** on interrogations, and the logistical challenges of long-term storage.

---

### **Use of Force**
**House Bill 1483** sought to modify the language around the use of **deadly force** by police officers:
   - The bill proposed removing the justification for using deadly force to affect an arrest, particularly in cases where the suspect is fleeing without posing an immediate threat.
   - Law enforcement officers testified that the current "reasonably believes" standard is essential for making split-second decisions in high-stress situations, emphasizing that officers act based on the information available at the time.
   - The committee voted **14-3** to recommend the bill as **inexpedient to legislate**, citing concerns that it would set an impossible standard for officers.

---

### **Access to Arrest Records**
**House Bill 1539** aimed to allow individuals to request the removal of their **arrest records** from public-facing websites if charges were dropped:
   - Supporters argued that public access to arrest records can harm individuals’ reputations, job prospects, and personal life, even if charges were dropped.
   - Concerns were raised about the bill's language, particularly the use of the term "computer system," which could imply altering internal records rather than just the public website.
   - An amendment to clarify that the removal applies only to public-facing records failed with **4 yes votes and 13 no votes**. The committee ultimately voted **10-7** to recommend the bill as **inexpedient to legislate**, citing concerns about practicality and implications.

---

### **Liquor Commission Investigators’ Authority**
**House Bill 1475** addressed the jurisdiction of **Liquor Commission investigators**:
   - The bill sought to clarify their authority, ensuring they can act in emergencies and assist other law enforcement agencies without jurisdictional limitations.
   - Chief Mark Armaganian of the Liquor Commission emphasized the importance of Liquor investigators being able to respond to life safety situations, such as overdoses or traffic accidents, without legal ambiguity.
   - The bill was described as a "housekeeping" measure to correct an oversight in the 1990s legislation that granted Liquor investigators the powers of sheriffs.

---

### **Key Outcomes and Themes**
- **Transparency vs. Safety**: Many discussions centered on balancing **public transparency** with **officer safety**, particularly in the context of police communication encryption and the use of force.
- **Accountability**: Bills like **HB 1031** and **HB 1682** emphasized the need for **accountability** in law enforcement, with mechanisms for reviewing misconduct and ensuring due process.
- **Practical Challenges**: Concerns about **cost**, **implementation**, and **logistical challenges** were raised repeatedly, particularly in relation to recording interrogations and encrypting communications.
- **Public Trust**: Enhancing **public trust** in law enforcement was a recurring theme, with efforts to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in policing practices.

### **Final Recommendations**
- **HB 1031**: Recommended for further study, particularly regarding encryption.
- **HB 1483**: Recommended as **inexpedient to legislate** (14-3).
- **HB 1539**: Recommended as **inexpedient to legislate** (10-7).
- **HB 1475**: Supported as a housekeeping measure to clarify Liquor investigators’ authority.

The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing public safety, transparency, and the practical realities of law enforcement, with ongoing discussions expected as these bills progress.
