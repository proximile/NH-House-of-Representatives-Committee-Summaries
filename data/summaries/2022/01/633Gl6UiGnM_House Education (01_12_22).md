**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/12/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 12, 2022, to discuss several key bills aimed at improving education, nutrition, and funding in the state. The meeting centered on the following major topics:

### **1. Farm to School Reimbursement Program (HB 1657)**
The committee extensively discussed **HB 1657**, which proposes a **Farm to School Reimbursement Program** to incentivize schools to purchase locally grown produce. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to support local agriculture, improve school nutrition, and strengthen regional food systems by offering reimbursement grants to schools. Schools would receive $1 for every $3 spent on New Hampshire products and $1 for every $6 spent on New England products, capped at $1,200 per school.
- **Benefits**: The program is expected to enhance students’ access to fresh, nutritious foods, support local farmers, and provide educational opportunities about local agriculture. It aligns with national Farm to School initiatives and addresses supply chain disruptions.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the feasibility of implementation, the role of distributors, and the potential for out-of-state processing of local products. Fiscal considerations included a $600,000 program budget and $180,000 for staffing.
- **Support**: Testimonies from stakeholders like Chris Farrell (Fresh Picks Cafe) and Stacy Purcell (NH Farm to School Program) highlighted the program’s potential to benefit students, farmers, and local economies. The committee expressed bipartisan enthusiasm for the bill.

### **2. Nutritional Standards for School Meals (HB 1561)**
**HB 1561** proposes adopting science-based nutritional standards for school meals to address inadequate nutrition and reduce diet-related diseases. Key points included:
- **Provisions**: The bill emphasizes reducing processed meats and added sugars while increasing whole grains, legumes, and vegetables. It also mandates the Department of Education to develop a nutrition curriculum.
- **Benefits**: Proponents argue that the bill will improve public health, educational outcomes, and reduce long-term healthcare costs. A Rockefeller Foundation report estimates that every dollar invested in school meals generates $2 in economic benefits.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the feasibility of implementation, particularly in light of COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions. The bill’s impact on non-public schools, which are not currently subject to state nutritional standards, was also discussed.
- **Support**: The American Heart Association testified in favor of the bill, emphasizing the importance of reducing sodium and added sugars in school meals.

### **3. Education Freedom Account Program (HB 1684)**
The committee discussed **HB 1684**, which seeks to establish a budget for the **Education Freedom Account (EFA)** program, providing funds for students to attend private, charter, or home schools. Key points included:
- **Costs**: The program’s estimated annual cost of $75 million far exceeds initial projections, with concerns about its impact on the state budget and the education trust fund.
- **Impact**: While the program has benefited over 1,800 students, 83% of participants were already in private or home schools, increasing state costs. HB 1684 proposes a funding cap, potentially defunding current participants.
- **Arguments**: Supporters argue the program provides educational opportunities for low-income families and students with special needs, while critics emphasize the state’s constitutional obligation to support public schools and the program’s lack of fiscal oversight.
- **Concerns**: The bill’s retroactive implications and its potential to limit educational choices for families were contentious issues.

### **4. Foundation Opportunity Budget Program (HB 1680)**
**HB 1680** proposes a **Foundation Opportunity Budget Program** to reform public education funding and address inequities. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to create a fairer funding system by allocating state resources based on district needs, particularly those with higher poverty rates or lower property tax bases.
- **Provisions**: It includes a 10-year phase-in period, transition grants, and a focus on accountability through regular reviews of student outcomes.
- **Challenges**: The bill lacks a permanent revenue source, and concerns remain about whether it fully meets the state’s constitutional obligation to fund an adequate education.
- **Support**: Testimonies from experts like Bill Ardinger and Jeff McLynch highlighted the urgency of reform and the need for a sustainable, data-driven funding model.

### **5. Unified Co-Curricular Activities (HB 1624)**
**HB 1624** proposes a $50,000 grant program to support unified co-curricular activities (e.g., sports, theater) for students with disabilities. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to cover one-time startup costs for inclusive programs, with schools responsible for ongoing expenses like coaching stipends.
- **Support**: The bill received bipartisan support and builds on previous efforts to promote inclusive activities that benefit both special needs and regular students.

### **6. Annotated Education Laws**
The committee discussed the importance of receiving annotated education laws in physical book format and proposed amendments to include digital access via portable storage devices. Concerns were raised about the $10,000 fiscal note and the accessibility of laws and rules online.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a strong focus on improving education, nutrition, and funding in New Hampshire. Key themes included supporting local agriculture, enhancing school nutrition standards, addressing inequities in education funding, and promoting inclusive programs for students with disabilities. While there was bipartisan enthusiasm for many of the proposals, concerns about fiscal impact, implementation feasibility, and constitutional obligations were prominent in the discussions. The committee plans to form subcommittees to further review and refine the bills.
