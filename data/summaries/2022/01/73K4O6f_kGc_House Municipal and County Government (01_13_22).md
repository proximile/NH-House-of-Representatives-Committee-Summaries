**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 13, 2022**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on January 13, 2022, to discuss several bills and amendments, focusing on regional planning, workforce housing, cybersecurity, and governance reforms. The meeting highlighted efforts to address representation, affordability, efficiency, and security across municipalities and counties.  

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**  

#### **1. Regional Planning Commissions (RPCs) and House Bill 1275**  
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 1275** and **Amendment 0037**, which aim to adjust representation on Regional Planning Commissions (RPCs) based on population growth, particularly in larger cities like Nashua and Manchester.  
- **Amendment 0037**: Proposes increasing Nashua’s representation from 4 to 6 seats and Manchester’s from 4 to 7 seats on their respective RPCs. The amendment seeks to balance proportional representation for larger cities while ensuring smaller towns retain their voice.  
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned whether adding more members would make decision-making unwieldy and whether larger cities could dominate smaller towns.  
- **Federal Funding**: RPCs play a critical role in allocating federal funding, especially with over $1 billion in anticipated infrastructure investments. Fair representation is essential for equitable decision-making.  
- **Testimony**: Michael Tardiff, Executive Director of the Central New Hampshire Regional Planning Commission, supported maintaining baseline representation for smaller communities while acknowledging the need for proportional adjustments.  
- **Future Considerations**: The committee requested further clarification on the role of counties in RPCs and the potential impact of the amendment on smaller towns.  

#### **2. Workforce Housing and Property Tax Exemptions**  
The committee explored a proposed property tax exemption aimed at promoting workforce housing affordability.  
- **Proposed Exemption**: The exemption would reduce the tax burden for eligible individuals, enabling more people to enter the private housing market.  
- **Cost and Impact**: The exemption would be funded through a nominal tax increase (approximately 8%) for non-eligible taxpayers, resulting in minimal increases for most (e.g., $56/month for a $400,000 home).  
- **Implementation**: Towns could use the exemption to meet workforce housing requirements without new development, as it applies to existing homes.  
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about practicality, particularly regarding fluctuating incomes and property values. Local select boards would have flexibility in determining eligibility based on average household income.  

#### **3. House Bill 1397: Rockingham County Elected Officials’ Terms**  
**HB 1397** proposes extending the term length for Rockingham County elected officials (County Attorney, Sheriff, Treasurer, and Register of Deeds) from two to four years.  
- **Rationale**: Longer terms would reduce the constant campaign cycle, allow officials to focus on their duties, and provide stability in county operations.  
- **Support**: Kathy Stacy, Rockingham County Register of Deeds, testified in favor, emphasizing the administrative nature of her role and the challenges of campaigning every two years.  
- **Broader Implications**: Some representatives suggested the bill should apply statewide, as the issues are not unique to Rockingham County.  

#### **4. House Bill 1029: Claremont Police Commission Authority**  
**HB 1029** addresses a legislative oversight from **HB 88**, which inadvertently omitted granting the Claremont City Council the authority to remove members of the Police Commission.  
- **Purpose**: The bill is a "housekeeping" measure to align the city council’s authority to both appoint and remove police commissioners, as originally intended.  
- **Outcome**: The committee will hold an executive session in two weeks.  

#### **5. House Bill 1046: Sullivan County Commissioner Elections**  
**HB 1046** proposes changing the election process for Sullivan County Commissioners from an **at-large** system to a **district-based** system.  
- **Purpose**: The current system is seen as inefficient and disadvantageous to candidates from smaller towns. Seven other counties already use district-based elections.  
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Association of Counties argued that the at-large system ensures all voters have a say in countywide decisions.  

#### **6. House Bill 1277: Cybersecurity Reporting Requirements**  
**HB 1277** requires municipalities to report cybersecurity incidents to the state’s IT commissioner when they occur within their information systems.  
- **Amendment**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association suggested clarifying that only incidents within municipal systems, not private or business systems, need to be reported.  
- **Testimony**: IT Commissioner Dennis Goulet emphasized the importance of timely reporting to mitigate threats and protect state systems connected to municipal networks.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to incorporate the NHMA’s amendment and will revisit the bill in the coming weeks.  

### **Additional Notes**  
- **HB 1112**: Standardizes competitive bidding rules across all counties but faced opposition from the New Hampshire Association of Counties, which argued that smaller counties lack the resources to comply.  
- **Procedural Discussions**: The committee addressed rules preventing members from testifying on bills they sponsor and held a brief recess for lunch.  

### **Overall Focus**  
The meeting centered on balancing representation for larger cities with the needs of smaller towns, addressing housing affordability, improving governance efficiency, and enhancing cybersecurity coordination. The committee’s discussions reflected a commitment to equitable decision-making, practical solutions, and legislative oversight to address emerging challenges in New Hampshire’s municipalities and counties.
