**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (January 11, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 11, 2022, to discuss several bills related to clean energy, energy efficiency, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The meeting featured detailed testimonies, debates, and technical insights on the proposed legislation, with a focus on balancing climate action, economic benefits, and the interests of ratepayers.

### Key Bills Discussed:

1. **House Bill 1506-fn**:
   - **Objective**: This bill proposes the creation of a revolving clean energy fund to provide low or zero-interest loans for clean energy projects, including alternative fuel vehicles, energy efficiency improvements, and microgrids.
   - **Details**: The fund would be self-sustaining, requiring no state money, and would prioritize 40% of its resources for low-income and vulnerable communities.
   - **Sponsor’s Perspective**: Prime sponsor Representative Rebecca McWilliams highlighted the bill’s goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting municipalities and nonprofits in transitioning to cleaner technologies.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the fund’s administration, potential conflicts between priorities, and the need for additional staffing.

2. **House Bill 1601-fn**:
   - **Objective**: This bill seeks to increase funding for energy efficiency programs by allocating 15% of the proceeds from RGGI auctions to the energy efficiency fund, up from the current flat $1 per allowance.
   - **Sponsor’s Perspective**: Prime sponsor Representative Peter Sapsis argued that this change aligns with RGGI’s original intent to fund energy efficiency and ensures the fund grows as RGGI allowance prices rise.
   - **Support and Criticism**: Testimonies highlighted the success of the New Hampshire Saves program, which has provided significant economic benefits and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Critics, however, argued that reducing rebates would harm ratepayers.

3. **House Bill 1621**:
   - **Objective**: Sponsored by Representative John Mann, this bill proposes a gradual reduction of RGGI rebates to utility customers over several years, with the goal of phasing them out entirely by 2028.
   - **Sponsor’s Perspective**: Mann argued that the rebates are minimal (around $1 per month) and that investing in energy efficiency would provide greater long-term benefits.
   - **Department of Energy’s Stance**: The Department of Energy remained neutral on the bill but provided technical details about its potential impact.

### Key Themes and Discussions:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Multiple speakers emphasized the importance of energy efficiency measures in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving costs for homeowners and businesses. The New Hampshire Saves program was frequently cited as a successful example of such initiatives.
- **RGGI Funding**: There was significant discussion about how RGGI funds should be allocated. Some advocated for more investment in efficiency programs, while others defended the current rebate structure, highlighting the importance of financial relief for ratepayers.
- **Climate Change**: The urgency of addressing climate change was a recurring theme. Many speakers stressed the need for immediate action and the role of energy efficiency and clean energy projects in mitigating climate impacts.

### Testimonies and Technical Insights:

- **Representative Samsuch** and others provided detailed arguments for redirecting RGGI funds to energy efficiency programs.
- **Representative Mann** presented HB 1621, explaining its goal of phasing out rebates to increase funding for efficiency initiatives.
- **Representatives from the Department of Environmental Services (DES) and the Department of Energy** offered technical insights into RGGI auctions, revenue distribution, and the potential impacts of the proposed changes.

### Conclusion:

The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on these bills in subsequent sessions. The committee also addressed housekeeping matters, including scheduling future meetings and office logistics. The overarching focus remained on finding a balance between investing in energy efficiency and clean energy projects to combat climate change and ensuring that the interests and financial well-being of ratepayers are adequately addressed.
