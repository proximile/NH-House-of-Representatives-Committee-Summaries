**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (01/25/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 25, 2022, to discuss a range of legislative proposals addressing environmental, agricultural, and animal welfare issues. The meeting featured detailed debates on key bills, with a focus on aligning state regulations with federal standards, addressing contamination, supporting agricultural practices, and protecting animal welfare. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Environmental and Agricultural Legislation**

1. **Hazardous Waste Terminology Alignment**:  
   A proposal was introduced to align New Hampshire’s hazardous waste terminology with federal standards, aiming to reduce confusion for businesses operating across state lines and improve compliance with EPA regulations.

2. **PFAS Contamination and Remediation**:  
   The committee discussed the pervasive issue of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, particularly in Southern New Hampshire. Efforts are underway to study PFAS in biosolids and groundwater, with a focus on ensuring safe drinking water. Soil remediation remains challenging due to limited effective technologies.  
   - **House Bill 1547**: This bill, amended to address PFAS in soil, requires the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to establish soil remediation standards by November 1, 2023, based on a U.S. Geological Survey study. It also updates the Groundwater Protection Act to hold responsible parties accountable for contamination.

3. **Soil Conditioners and Fertilizers (House Bill 1168)**:  
   The committee proposed a study to clarify New Hampshire’s laws on soil conditioners and fertilizers, addressing ambiguities in definitions and registration fees. The bill aims to align state regulations with the National Organic Program and modern scientific understanding of soil health.

4. **Landfill Management and Waste Reduction (House Bill 1049)**:  
   An amended bill focused on landfill bonding, setbacks from water bodies, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) programs to reduce landfill pressure. The amendment passed unanimously, emphasizing the need for scientific assessments and waste reduction strategies.

### **Agricultural Support and Initiatives**

1. **Organic Farming Tax Credit (House Bill 1412)**:  
   A bill proposing a tax credit for USDA organic certification fees aims to lower financial barriers for small-scale organic farmers and promote sustainable agriculture. Questions were raised about its applicability to low-income farmers and its potential impact on traditional farming.

2. **Capital Improvement Grants for State Fairs (House Bill 1584)**:  
   This bill seeks to establish a $250,000 capital improvement fund for state fairs, addressing aging infrastructure and declining revenues. State fairs are vital to New Hampshire’s rural lifestyle and agricultural heritage, contributing significantly to the economy. The bill includes a 15% cost-sharing requirement and emphasizes local control.

3. **Raw Milk Ice Cream Legislation (House Bill 1187)**:  
   A debate over allowing the production of raw milk ice cream highlighted concerns about foodborne illness risks. The bill was deemed redundant, as a similar Senate bill with labeling requirements had already passed.

4. **Pollinator-Friendly Solar Fields (House Bill 1517)**:  
   A proposal to promote pollinator-friendly vegetation under solar panels faced feasibility concerns, including scalability and cost. The sponsor requested the bill be deemed "inexpedient to legislate" for further refinement.

### **Animal Welfare Legislation**

1. **Companion Animals During Emergencies (House Bill 1186)**:  
   This bill ensures companion animals are sheltered with their owners during evacuations, closing loopholes in the federal PETS Act. An amendment clarified the definition of "community shelter" and classified disaster animal response team (DART) volunteers as emergency workers. The bill received strong support, emphasizing the emotional bond between pets and their owners.

2. **Prohibiting Declawing of Cats (House Bill 1226)**:  
   The committee engaged in extensive debate over banning non-therapeutic declawing of cats, with exceptions for medical necessity.  
   - **Supporters** argued that declawing is inhumane, likening it to amputating human fingers, and causes long-term pain and behavioral issues for cats. They highlighted alternatives like claw clipping and scratching posts.  
   - **Opponents** contended that declawing should remain a decision between veterinarians and pet owners, particularly in cases where it might prevent abandonment or euthanasia.  
   - The bill proposes making declawing a Class B misdemeanor, with veterinarians held legally liable for performing the procedure without medical justification. The judicial branch requested an effective date of January 1, 2023, to allow time for system updates.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

1. **Regulatory Alignment and Clarity**:  
   Multiple bills aimed to align state regulations with federal standards and address ambiguities in existing laws, particularly in hazardous waste management, soil health, and organic farming.

2. **Environmental Protection and Public Health**:  
   The committee emphasized the need to address PFAS contamination, improve soil and water quality, and reduce landfill pressure through scientific and evidence-based approaches.

3. **Agricultural Support**:  
   Efforts to support organic farming, state fairs, and sustainable agricultural practices were highlighted, with a focus on reducing financial barriers and preserving New Hampshire’s rural heritage.

4. **Animal Welfare**:  
   The meeting featured strong advocacy for protecting companion animals during emergencies and banning inhumane practices like declawing, balancing ethical concerns with practical considerations.

5. **Legislative Process**:  
   Amendments were proposed to clarify language and address concerns, with bipartisan support for many measures. The committee emphasized the importance of education, local control, and scientific evidence in shaping legislation.
