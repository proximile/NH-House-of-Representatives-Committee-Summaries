- **Support**: Proponents argued that these measures would address public concerns about election integrity and prevent irregularities.

#### **2. Recall Provisions for Local Officials (HB 1485)**
- **Purpose**: To introduce a recall mechanism for municipal officials, particularly those with terms of three years or more.
- **Proposals**:
  - A petition requiring signatures from 10% of registered voters to initiate a recall election.
  - A minimum voter turnout of 20% for the recall to be valid.
  - Safeguards to prevent officials from resigning and being reappointed to circumvent the recall process.
- **Concerns**:

- **Proposals**:

  - Existing mechanisms (e.g., the oath of office) already address these issues.
- **Support**: Proponents argued it would provide recourse in cases of serious negligence.

#### **4. Overvotes and Machine-Generated Reports (HB 1470)**

- **Proposals**:

- **Support**: The Windham election controversy, where machine errors led to significant overvotes, was cited as a key reason for this bill.

#### **5. Absentee Ballot Procedures and Verification**

- **Proposals**:
  - A "cure" period for absentee ballots that do not meet residency or identification requirements, allowing voters to correct deficiencies by the close of polls on election day.

- **Purpose**: To modernize ballot security and ensure consistency in election processes.
