### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 25, 2022  
**House Executive Departments and Administration Committee**  

The January 25, 2022, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives focused on several bills addressing retirement benefits and employment policies for public employees, particularly law enforcement officers and firefighters. The discussions highlighted challenges related to recruitment, retention, and financial security for public safety personnel, as well as proposed legislative changes to improve the retirement system. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

### **Key Issues and Challenges**
1. **Recruitment and Retention**: Public safety agencies face significant challenges in attracting and retaining qualified personnel due to demanding job conditions, inadequate retirement benefits, and competition from other states. High turnover rates result in substantial training costs and strain on local budgets.  
2. **Retirement System Inequities**: Changes made to the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) in 2011, particularly the exclusion of certain compensation from retirement calculations, have disproportionately affected public safety employees hired after that date, leading to reduced benefits and dissatisfaction.  
3. **Financial Security for Retirees and Beneficiaries**: Ensuring retirees have accurate and timely information to make informed decisions about survivorship benefits and other retirement options is critical for their financial well-being.  
4. **Employment of Retirees**: Policies governing the employment of retired police officers and firefighters, including limits on working hours and the treatment of special duty pay, have raised concerns about fairness, system liabilities, and opportunities for active officers.

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **House Bill 1587: Average Final Compensation (AFC) for Group 2 Members**  
- **Purpose**: Adjusts the AFC calculation for police and firefighters (Group 2 members) to include compensation over base pay during their highest five earning years when averaging their entire career earnings. This addresses inequities stemming from the 2011 changes that excluded such compensation.  
- **Impact**: The bill aims to restore fairness and ensure public safety employees receive the retirement benefits they were promised when hired. Testimonies highlighted that the current system has led to significant financial losses for retirees, with some losing up to $1,300 per month in benefits.  
- **Support**: Strong backing from firefighter and police associations, who argue the changes are essential to address recruitment and retention challenges in public safety.  

#### **House Bill 1557: Survivorship Benefits**  
- **Purpose**: Modifies the process for selecting survivorship benefits under the state retirement system. Currently, retirees have 120 days after retirement to make decisions, but delays in receiving final compensation figures complicate this process. The bill proposes allowing retirees to make these decisions within 120 days of receiving their final compensation numbers.  
- **Importance**: Ensures retirees have accurate financial information to make informed decisions affecting their families' financial security.  

#### **House Bill 1497: Pre-Selection of Survivorship Options**  
- **Purpose**: Allows members to pre-select survivorship options before becoming eligible for service retirement. This ensures that if a member dies while still working, their spouse or beneficiary would receive 100% of their pension, rather than the current 50% benefit.  
- **Current Limitation**: Pre-selection is currently only available to members eligible for service retirement. The bill seeks to expand this option to allow earlier designation.  

#### **House Bill 1549: Employment of Retired Police Officers**  
- **Purpose**: Clarifies that retired police officers can work up to 1,352 hours per year (approximately 26 hours per week) without affecting their pension benefits. This limit applies to both regular and special duty hours.  
- **Concerns**:  
  - Potential unintended consequences, such as municipalities hiring retirees for detail work instead of active officers, reducing opportunities for active officers to accrue retirement benefits.  
  - Opposition from the New Hampshire State Permanent Firefighters Retirement Association, which argues the bill could exacerbate the unfunded liability of the retirement system.  
- **Support**: Emphasizes the need to allow retirees to continue working without jeopardizing their benefits, particularly in areas with seasonal demands, such as summer policing at Hampton Beach.  

#### **House Bill 1563: Automatic Enrollment in Deferred Compensation Plan**  
- **Purpose**: Proposes automatic enrollment in the stateâ€™s deferred compensation plan for new state employees, with contributions starting at 2% and escalating annually unless employees opt out.  
- **Goal**: Encourages retirement savings by making it easier for employees to participate, with the flexibility to adjust or opt out if needed.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Fairness and Equity**: Many of the bills aim to address perceived inequities in the retirement system, particularly for public safety employees hired after 2011, who have been disproportionately affected by changes to AFC calculations and survivorship benefits.  
2. **Financial Security**: Ensuring retirees and their families have access to accurate information and adequate benefits is a recurring theme, with a focus on survivorship options and deferred compensation plans.  
3. **Recruitment and Retention**: Enhancing retirement benefits and addressing system inequities are seen as critical to attracting and retaining qualified personnel in public safety roles.  
4. **Balancing Interests**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance the needs of retirees, active employees, and the financial health of the retirement system, particularly regarding the employment of retirees and the treatment of special duty pay.
