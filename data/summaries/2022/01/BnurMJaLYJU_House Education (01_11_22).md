### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. House Bill 1218: Merger of Granite State College (GSC) and the University of New Hampshire (UNH)**
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes merging GSC with UNH to address declining enrollment, rising costs, and demographic challenges by streamlining operations and leveraging UNH’s resources.
   - **Benefits**: The merger aims to reduce duplication, enhance marketing, improve online education delivery, create cost savings, and maintain open access and affordability for GSC students.
   - **Challenges**: Declining student populations, increasing capital costs, and the need for workforce-focused education were identified as critical issues.
   - **Implementation**: The merger will involve transitioning leadership roles, integrating information systems, and reducing staff through attrition. GSC degrees will be issued under UNH, ensuring equal recognition.
   - **Support**: The bill received unanimous support from the Public Higher Education Study Committee and the university system trustees. Testimonies emphasized its strategic importance in addressing financial and demographic challenges.

#### **2. House Bill 1530: Bachelor’s Degrees at Community Colleges**
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to allow community colleges to award bachelor’s degrees to address workforce needs and improve educational access.
   - **Discussion**: Representatives highlighted the potential benefits of collaboration between community colleges and universities to maximize resources and avoid redundancy. The bill was seen as a catalyst for discussions on educational pathways and career preparation.

#### **3. House Bill 1575: Tuition Waivers for Children of Deceased Disabled Veterans**
   - **Purpose**: The bill extends tuition waivers to children of 100% disabled veterans who die before their children can attend college.
   - **Support**: Representatives expressed strong support for ensuring these children are not penalized. Amendments were discussed to include community colleges in the waiver program.

#### **4. House Bill 1574: In-State Tuition for Students Voting in New Hampshire**
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes granting in-state tuition to students who vote in New Hampshire, arguing it is fair for those who consider the state their domicile.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents raised concerns about potential revenue loss for the University System of New Hampshire (USNH), estimated at $140 million annually, and the risk of students registering to vote solely for tuition benefits.

#### **5. House Bill 1648: Mental Health Support for College Students**
   - **Purpose**: The bill requires public colleges and universities to implement peer support groups and develop policies for students with mental health conditions.
   - **Support**: Proponents emphasized the need for accessible mental health resources on campuses, citing rising mental health struggles among students.
   - **Concerns**: Community colleges expressed concerns about feasibility due to limited resources and infrastructure. The University System acknowledged the importance of mental health support but raised concerns about the bill’s prescriptive nature and financial burdens.

#### **6. House Bill 1313: Extending Anti-Discrimination Protections to Postsecondary Institutions**
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prohibit instruction that certain individuals are inherently superior or inferior based on characteristics like race, gender, or sexual orientation, similar to provisions in HB2 for K-12 education.
   - **Concerns**: Critics, including the ACLU of New Hampshire and NEA New Hampshire, argued that the bill’s vague language would restrict academic freedom, create a “chilling effect,” and hinder discussions on racism, sexism, and historical discrimination. Representatives also highlighted contradictions with existing statutes protecting academic freedom in higher education.

#### **7. House Bill 1685: School Facility Planning and Development Program**
   - **Purpose**: The bill establishes a program to assist public school districts and charter schools with facility improvement projects, including a revolving fund and loan program.
   - **Discussion**: Charter school advocates emphasized the challenges smaller schools face in accessing funding for facility improvements. Concerns were raised about funding sources, eligibility, and potential overlap with existing infrastructure programs.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
   - **Equity and Access**: Discussions across multiple bills focused on ensuring equitable access to education, particularly for underserved populations, including children of veterans, charter school students, and those seeking mental health support.
   - **Financial and Operational Challenges**: Declining enrollment, rising costs, and limited resources were recurring themes, particularly in discussions about the GSC-UNH merger, mental health support, and charter school funding.
   - **Academic Freedom**: House Bill 1313 sparked significant debate over the balance between anti-discrimination protections and academic freedom in higher education, with critics arguing that the bill’s vague language could stifle critical discussions on race, gender, and history.
   - **Collaboration and Efficiency**: Several bills, including the GSC-UNH merger and community college bachelor’s degrees, emphasized the need for collaboration and efficiency in addressing the state’s educational challenges.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a strong focus on addressing the financial, operational, and equity challenges facing New Hampshire’s educational institutions. While there was broad support for measures aimed at improving access and efficiency, debates over academic freedom and the feasibility of mental health mandates highlighted the complexities of implementing educational reforms. The committee moved to recommend **House Bill 1218** (GSC-UNH merger) OTP (Ought to Pass), while other bills, particularly **House Bill 1313**, faced significant opposition due to concerns about their impact on academic freedom and legal feasibility.
