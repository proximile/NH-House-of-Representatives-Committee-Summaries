The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 12, 2022, addressed a wide range of environmental, recreational, and public health issues, focusing on several key bills and topics. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing environmental protection, public health, economic interests, and regulatory frameworks. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the meeting:

---

### **1. PFAS Contamination and Water Quality**
- **Health and Regulation Concerns**: PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination in drinking water, particularly in private wells, was a major focus. PFAS compounds, linked to adverse health outcomes, are difficult to regulate individually due to their sheer number. The EPA is assessing their toxicity collectively, but there is no scientific basis for class-based standards yet.
- **Legislative Proposals**: 
  - **House Bill 1618** proposed adding PFBA and PFBS to the list of regulated substances and setting cumulative standards for six PFAS compounds. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) opposed the bill, citing lack of scientific justification and unnecessary costs ($12 million).
  - **House Bill 1452** sought to rename DES to the Department of Environmental Protection and grant it oversight of private wells. DES opposed the name change due to costs and confusion but was neutral on private well oversight, emphasizing voluntary collaboration with property owners.
- **Public Health and Costs**: Concerns were raised about cancer clusters in areas like Merrimack, NH, and tenant rights in cases where landlords refuse water testing. DES announced a $5 million rebate program for homeowners with contaminated wells, offering up to $1,500 for remediation systems.

### **2. Drone Use in State Parks and Trails**
- **Current Restrictions**: Drones are restricted in state parks, but a bill proposed allowing their use under certain conditions to promote tourism and STEM fields.
- **Privacy and Safety**: The bill included provisions to protect privacy (e.g., prohibiting spying without consent) and ensure safety, requiring FAA compliance and notification before use.
- **Concerns**: The Division of Parks and Recreation opposed the bill, citing negative impacts on recreational experiences, wildlife, and private land access. Enforcement challenges and federal preemption (FAA controls airspace) were also discussed.

### **3. Submerged Logs and Environmental Management**
- **House Bill 1451**: Addressed the recovery of submerged logs, a valuable resource with environmental and economic significance. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department opposed the bill, citing habitat and water quality concerns. Logs provide critical habitat for fish and stabilize riverbeds.
- **Proposed Process**: A permitting system, modeled after Michigan’s program, was suggested for log recovery, with fees for commercial sales.
- **Challenges**: Ownership of submerged logs is complex, with some logs potentially belonging to the federal government. Existing statutes (e.g., RSA 482-A) already regulate log removal.

### **4. Cyanobacteria Blooms and Public Health**
- **House Bill 1066**: Proposed a **Cyanobacteria Study Commission** to address the growing issue of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) blooms, which pose significant health risks (e.g., neurological and liver damage) and threaten tourism and recreation.
- **Public Water Supply**: Cyanotoxins can contaminate water supplies, though New Hampshire has not yet experienced severe impacts. The commission would explore better tracking, public education, and mitigation strategies.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Collaboration across agencies and stakeholders is needed to address nutrient runoff, septic systems, and other contributing factors.

---

### **5. Perkins Pond Houseboat Ban**
- **House Bill 1220**: Proposed banning houseboats on Perkins Pond, a fragile, shallow body of water in Sunapee, due to environmental concerns (e.g., waste dumping and water quality degradation).
- **Community Support**: The Perkins Pond Protective Association unanimously supported the bill, citing decades of efforts to protect the pond, including a $3 million sewer system.
- **Legal Issues**: Current statutes prohibit sewage dumping, but enforcement is challenging. Houseboats also violate local zoning ordinances.

---

### **6. Voluntary Donation Program for Non-Motorized Boats**
- **House Bill 1528**: Created a voluntary donation program for non-motorized boat users (e.g., kayaks, canoes) to support public boat access sites, which are currently funded by motorboat registration fees.
- **Funding Gap**: Non-motorized boat users do not contribute to site maintenance despite extensive use. The program mirrors the successful **Hike Safe Card** model, with donations supporting access improvements and leveraging federal matching funds.

---

### **7. Prime Wetlands and Regulatory Concerns**
- **House Bill 1227**: Proposed expanding the definition of **Prime Wetlands** to include narrow wetland channels and tributaries.
- **Support for Protection**: Many acknowledged the importance of wetlands for wildlife habitat and water quality.
- **Opposition**: The **New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association**, **Home Builders Association**, and **Department of Transportation** opposed the bill, citing increased costs and delays for forestry, development, and infrastructure projects.
- **Call for Scientific Review**: Some suggested a scientific review to identify the most valuable wetlands for protection, rather than relying on the current designation process.

---

### **8. Winnipesaukee River Basin Funding**
- **House Bill 1339**: Proposed updating the funding model for the Winnipesaukee River Basin program, shifting cost distribution among member communities to reflect current usage rather than 1980s predictions.
- **Unanimous Support**: All 10 member communities supported the changes, which would have impacted communities pay 50% of repair costs, with the other 50% distributed based on infrastructure usage.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Environmental Protection**: The meeting emphasized the importance of safeguarding New Hampshire’s natural resources, from wetlands and water bodies to state parks and trails.
- **Public Health**: Addressing PFAS contamination and cyanobacteria blooms was a priority, with calls for science-based standards and collaborative solutions.
- **Economic and Regulatory Balance**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance environmental protection with economic interests, particularly in forestry, development, and tourism.
- **Community Involvement**: Local organizations and residents played a significant role in advocating for environmental protection, as seen in the Perkins Pond and cyanobacteria discussions.
- **Legislative Next Steps**: Many bills were proposed for further review and amendment to address concerns about scope, implementation, and fiscal impact.

Overall, the meeting underscored the interconnectedness of environmental, public health, and economic issues in New Hampshire, with a focus on developing thoughtful, science-based policies that protect natural resources while supporting community and economic interests.
