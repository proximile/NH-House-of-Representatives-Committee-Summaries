The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee held a meeting on January 12, 2022, to discuss several bills related to transportation and infrastructure. Here are the key points from the meeting:

1. **House Bill 1038**: The bill seeks to name a bridge in Londonderry in honor of Robert J. Prowse, a World War II veteran and influential engineer. The bridge was previously named after Prowse but was dismantled during an I-93 renovation. The new bridge would retain his name if the bill passes. The committee decided to delay the executive session until they receive written approval from the town of Londonderry.

2. **House Bill 1456**: This bill aims to extend the eligibility period for names to be added to the Hampton Marine Memorial to include veterans from Operation Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and the wars on terrorism following 9/11. The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill with an amendment changing the effective date to upon passage.

3. **House Bill 1553**: The bill addresses the issue of roadside memorials, proposing a 90-day limit for their presence before removal by the Department of Transportation (DOT). The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill, citing public safety concerns.

4. **House Bill 1572**: The bill proposes changes to the Harbor Dredging and Peer Maintenance Fund and appropriates funds for dredging Rye Harbor and Seabrook-Hampton Harbor. The committee voted unanimously to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, as the DOT indicated no additional funds were needed for the projects.

5. **House Bill 1217**: This bill would require state agencies to report on abandoned or vacant state-owned properties to create a centralized database. The committee voted unanimously to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, noting that existing statutes already address the sale and use of state property.

6. **House Bill 1211**: The bill mandates the installation of electronic tolling (AET) on New Hampshire turnpikes by July 1, 2035. The committee voted unanimously to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, preferring to address AET through the 10-year highway plan process.

7. **House Bill 1449**: This bill proposes a toll booth exemption for funeral processions traveling to the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery in Boscowin. The committee voted 17-1 to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, citing implementation challenges and the move toward electronic tolling.

8. **House Bill 1593**: The bill requires the DOT to install sound barriers along Interstate 95 in Portsmouth. The committee voted unanimously to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, as the DOTâ€™s 10-year plan already includes funding for sound barriers in the requested areas.

The committee also discussed future meetings, including a session on the 10-year transportation plan and funding availability. The chair emphasized that no executive sessions would be held the following day, allowing more time for thoughtful consideration of contentious bills.
