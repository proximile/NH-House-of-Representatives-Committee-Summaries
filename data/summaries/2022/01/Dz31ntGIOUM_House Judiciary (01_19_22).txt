The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss several key bills addressing a range of issues, from housing discrimination and athlete agent regulations to construction debris management and municipal immunity. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 1013: Virtual Meetings for the Rare Disease Advisory Council**
This bill proposes allowing the **New Hampshire Rare Disease Advisory Council** to conduct meetings **virtually** due to the health vulnerabilities of its members, many of whom are immunocompromised and unable to attend in-person meetings. The council, established in 2019, has struggled to achieve a quorum since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The bill aims to enable the council to continue its work by approving minutes and conducting business remotely.

- **Support:** Representative Gary Woods, co-sponsor, emphasized the council’s inability to meet in person and the need for virtual meetings to continue its mission. Dr. Sai Sharala, representing the Department of Health and Human Services, supported the bill, highlighting the importance of flexibility for immunocompromised members.
- **Opposition:** Laurie Ortolano, representing **Right to Know New Hampshire**, opposed the bill, arguing that public meetings should maintain a physical location to ensure transparency and public access.

### **House Bill 1023: Removal of Registration Requirement for Athlete Agents**
This bill seeks to **remove the registration requirement** for **athlete agents** in New Hampshire while maintaining accountability for agents who harm athletes or institutions. The bill also strengthens athletes' rights to sue agents for damages.

- **Sponsor Testimony:** Representative Josh Ocala explained that the bill aims to remove barriers to entry for athlete agents, particularly for smaller-scale opportunities like local sponsorships, while preserving legal recourse for athletes and schools.
- **Concerns from UNH:** Tom Cronin and Sean Green from the **University of New Hampshire** urged caution, noting the evolving NCAA rules around **name, image, and likeness (NIL)** agreements. They recommended retaining certain regulations, such as record-keeping and civil penalties, to protect athletes from bad actors.

### **House Bill 1291: Prohibition of Discrimination Against Section 8 Voucher Holders**
This bill aims to prevent landlords from denying housing to tenants solely because they hold Section 8 housing vouchers. The bill includes exceptions for cases where rent exceeds housing authority limits or the property fails to meet quality standards.

- **Support:** Advocates argued that the bill is crucial for addressing homelessness and housing instability, especially for vulnerable populations like people with disabilities, veterans, and low-income families. Testimonies highlighted the long waiting periods for vouchers and the stigma associated with Section 8 tenants.
- **Opposition:** Landlords testified that the Section 8 program imposes additional burdens, including extra paperwork, inspections, and delays, which make it less attractive than renting to non-voucher tenants.

### **House Bill 1034: Municipal Immunity**
This bill seeks to clarify municipal immunity based on a 2007 Supreme Court decision (Everett v. General Electric). The bill aims to define when municipal employees or officials are immune from liability, focusing on discretionary versus ministerial actions.

- **Concerns:** The New Hampshire Municipal Association and others highlighted concerns about limiting immunity and potential increased liability for municipalities.

### **House Bill 1036: Right-to-Know Law**
This bill proposes changes to the right-to-know law, specifically requiring notification of individuals whose reputations may be affected in non-public meetings.

- **Support:** Testimonies emphasized the need for transparency, particularly in cases where public bodies discuss citizens' reputations without their knowledge.
- **Concerns:** The New Hampshire School Boards Association raised concerns about the implications for student disciplinary matters and the distinction between meetings and hearings.

### **House Bill 1544: Prohibition of Construction and Demolition Debris in Landfills**
This bill aims to prohibit the placement of construction and demolition (C&D) debris in landfills, facing significant opposition from industry representatives and state officials.

- **Opposition:** Industry representatives highlighted the lack of sufficient C&D processing facilities in New Hampshire and the necessity of landfills for residuals. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) also opposed the bill, stating that a zero-tolerance policy for C&D in landfills is not feasible under current infrastructure.
- **Proposed Penalties:** The bill includes high penalties ($20,250 to $25,000) for violations, which industry representatives argued are disproportionate.

### **House Bill 1315: Sports Officials Liability**
This bill aims to provide legal protection to sports officials from civil liability for negligent acts, provided they act in good faith and within their duties.

- **Support:** Supporters argued that officials face increasing threats and lawsuits, which deter people from volunteering.
- **Opposition:** Opponents, including the New Hampshire Association for Justice, argued that immunity could remove accountability and responsibility from officials.

### **House Bill 1425: Eminent Domain**
This bill seeks to amend state emergency statutes to require documented inability to obtain alternative resources before taking private property during a state of emergency.

- **Proposals:** The bill proposes increased compensation for property takings and the right of first refusal for the original owner to repurchase the property.

### **Conclusion:**
The discussions highlighted the need for balancing individual rights with practical challenges faced by municipalities, landlords, and public bodies. The committee will continue to evaluate the proposals before making recommendations, reflecting ongoing adjustments to state regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and evolving NCAA policies.
