**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Municipal and County Government (01/24/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 24, 2022, to discuss and vote on several bills and amendments related to municipal and county government. The meeting focused on disaster preparedness, financial assistance for smaller municipalities, competitive bidding, regional planning, property tax exemptions, county officers' terms, and cybersecurity. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Disaster Preparedness and Relief**
1. **Municipal Disaster Relief Fund (House Bill 1665)**:
   - Introduced by **Representative Judy Aron**, the bill proposes the creation of a **Municipal Disaster Relief Fund** to provide immediate financial assistance to municipalities, especially smaller towns, recovering from natural disasters. The fund would act as **gap funding** before federal aid (e.g., FEMA) becomes available.
   - **Funding Mechanism**: The fund would be supported by annual contributions from municipalities (e.g., 0.5% of their budgets) and state contributions, functioning as a **risk pool**.
   - **Need for the Bill**: Representative Aron highlighted the severe flooding in July 2021, which caused millions of dollars in damage to towns like Acworth in Sullivan County. Small towns often lack the resources to address such emergencies and must take out loans or overspend their budgets for temporary repairs.
   - **Committee Discussions**: Concerns were raised about the bill’s language, including the contribution percentage, damage threshold for accessing funds, the need for permanent fixes, and the opt-in/opt-out mechanism for municipalities. Proposed amendments will address these issues, such as correcting the contribution percentage, lowering the damage threshold, and refining language regarding engineers and rule-making.
   - **Support**: Representatives Jess Edwards and Ken Weiler expressed strong support for the bill, emphasizing the importance of immediate disaster response and a sustainable funding mechanism.

2. **General Disaster Preparedness**:
   - Representatives discussed the need for better disaster preparedness, particularly for flooding and other natural disasters. Suggestions included using an indexed scale for disaster relief funding based on municipal budgets and geographical risks.

### **Support for Smaller Municipalities**
- Several bills aimed at providing financial assistance to smaller municipalities during natural disasters were debated. The **New Hampshire Municipal Association** supported these bills, emphasizing the challenges smaller towns face in accessing funds during emergencies.

---

### **Competitive Bidding in Counties**
- A bill regarding competitive bidding in counties was debated. Some representatives argued that it would burden smaller municipalities, while others believed it would ensure transparency and consistency across counties.

---

### **Regional Planning Commissions**
- A bill related to municipal representation on regional planning commissions was discussed. Some representatives felt it would dilute the votes of smaller communities, while others supported it for fairer representation based on population.

---

### **Property Tax Homestead Exemption**
- A bill proposing a property tax homestead exemption was debated. Supporters argued it would encourage homeownership, while opponents raised concerns about its complexity and potential financial burden on non-exempt taxpayers.

---

### **County Officers' Terms**
- An amendment to extend the terms of county officers (e.g., county attorney, sheriff) from two to four years was passed unanimously. The rationale was to reduce disruption and allow more time to address ongoing issues.

---

### **Cybersecurity Incidents**
- A bill requiring immediate reporting of cybersecurity incidents was passed unanimously. Representatives emphasized the importance of quick action to mitigate damage from cyber threats.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the House’s focus on addressing the financial and administrative challenges faced by municipalities and counties, particularly in disaster preparedness and recovery. **House Bill 1665** emerged as a critical initiative to establish a sustainable funding mechanism for small towns recovering from natural disasters. While there is broad support for the bill, amendments will be drafted to address concerns raised during the committee discussions. Other key outcomes included extending county officers' terms, improving cybersecurity reporting, and debating competitive bidding and property tax exemptions. The discussions underscored the need for fairness, transparency, and consistency in legislation affecting municipalities and counties.
