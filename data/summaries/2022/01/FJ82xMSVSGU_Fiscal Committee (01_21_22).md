### **Approval of Minutes and Initial Discussions**
The meeting began with the approval of minutes from previous meetings (December 2nd, December 17th, and December 23rd), with some abstentions. The committee then moved to discuss several agenda items, including funding initiatives, healthcare infrastructure, and federal allocations.

### **Key Initiatives and Funding Approvals**
1. **Child Care Initiative for Military Families**: Major General David Mikulitis presented a $290,000 proposal aimed at reducing stressors for military families, particularly during drill weekends. The initiative seeks to address issues like hazardous alcohol misuse and improve retention, especially among women in the military. The committee unanimously approved the initiative.

2. **Child Nutrition Program**: Tammy Valencorp and Kelly Rambo from the Department of Education discussed the child nutrition program, which is currently funded by a USDA waiver allowing free meals for all students until June 30, 2022. The committee approved additional funding to cover increased reimbursement requests from schools.

3. **Prescription Drug Affordability Board**: Robert Berry discussed the establishment of a board to increase transparency in drug pricing. Concerns about the timing of fee collection and rule approval led to the item being tabled, with an 8-2 vote.

### **Healthcare and Mental Health Infrastructure**
1. **Psychiatric Care and IMD Waiver**: The committee discussed the long-term goal of expanding psychiatric care, focusing on acute care through the IMD waiver. The state aims to attract private entities to provide acute care while continuing to serve the chronically ill population at New Hampshire Hospital.

2. **Mental Health Hospital Proposal**: A significant portion of the meeting focused on allocating $15 million in ARPA funds to HCA Healthcare for a 96-bed mental health hospital in Epping. The project aims to address the ER boarding crisis by adding 38 new beds for adults, geriatric patients, and adolescents. Concerns were raised about Medicaid costs and the lack of communication with the Epping planning board.

3. **Medicaid Model Review**: The committee reviewed a proposal to evaluate New Hampshire’s Medicaid model, assessing whether it meets beneficiary needs and if alternative community-based care models could be more effective.

### **Homelessness and Housing**
1. **Homeless Veterans**: Representative Edwards inquired about federal funds to address veteran homelessness. Chris Santaniello from the Department of Health and Human Services explained that funding primarily comes through the VA and HUD, with plans to follow up for more information.

2. **Afghan Resettlement and Shelter Rates**: The committee discussed the state’s role in housing Afghan refugees, clarifying that funds are used only for federally vetted legal refugees. The committee also addressed low shelter reimbursement rates and the need for a long-term strategy to address homelessness.

3. **Youth Homelessness**: A demonstration project to address youth homelessness was discussed, with challenges in accurately counting homeless youth due to their reluctance to be identified. The project aims to develop a community plan for housing and support services.

### **COVID-19 Response and Test Kits**
1. **ARPA Funds for Test Kits**: The committee approved $12,012,000 in ARPA funds to purchase at-home COVID-19 test kits. Dr. Jonathan Ballard emphasized the importance of rapid tests in keeping businesses and schools open. The revenue from selling these kits will be credited back.

2. **Health Insurance and PFAS**: The committee reviewed reports on health insurance improvements and the impact of PFAS on New Hampshire.

### **Litigation and Budget Transfers**
1. **Litigation Expenses**: The Attorney General’s office requested $2,853,691 for general litigation expenses, primarily due to the YDC criminal investigation, a major antitrust case, and federal court cases.

2. **Budget Transfers**: The Department of Health and Human Services requested authorization to transfer $19,053,889 between class lines to address emerging needs since the budget was passed.

2. **Lottery Commission**: The audit resulted in a clean opinion, with the commission reporting an additional $45 million in revenue.
