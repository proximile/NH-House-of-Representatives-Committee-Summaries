### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 18, 2022:  
**House Children and Family Law Committee**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 18, 2022, focused on several key issues related to family law, judicial discretion, and the family court system. The discussions centered on proposed legislative changes aimed at addressing systemic problems, ensuring fairness, and protecting the rights of children and families. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and themes from the meeting:  

---

### **1. Judicial Discretion and Rule Waiving (Segments 1/7, 2/7, 5/7)**  
- **Judicial Discretion**: A significant portion of the meeting addressed the extent of judicial discretion in family court, particularly the ability of judges to waive court rules. Supporters of limiting this discretion argued that it leads to arbitrary and unfair decisions, while opponents warned that it could hinder judges’ ability to manage complex cases effectively.  
- **Proposed Legislation**: Bills like **HB 1265** aimed to eliminate or restrict judicial discretion in waiving family court rules, ensuring uniform application of rules to protect litigants’ rights.  
- **Due Process Concerns**: Testimonies highlighted cases where judges’ discretion resulted in denied evidence, biased decisions, and prolonged litigation, violating due process under the 5th and 14th Amendments.

### **2. Family Court System Reforms (Segments 2/7, 3/7, 7/7)**  
- **HB 1346**: This bill proposed establishing a commission to study the family court system, focusing on improving operations and addressing systemic issues. Testimonies emphasized the need for greater transparency, accountability, and oversight, particularly regarding guardians ad litem (GALs) and judicial misconduct.  
- **Guardians ad Litem (GALs)**: GALs, who represent children’s best interests, were criticized for bias, lack of accountability, and excessive fees. **HB 1515** aimed to regulate GALs’ appointment, billing, and conduct, ensuring fairness and transparency.  
- **Judicial Misconduct**: Cases like the **Judge Introcaso scandal**, where a judge falsified documents, underscored the need for reforms to address judicial misconduct and ensure accountability.

### **3. Appeals and Recourse in Family Court (Segments 2/7, 5/7)**  
- **De Novo Appeals**: Discussions centered on allowing de novo appeals to the superior court, providing litigants with a more effective recourse when family court judges make errors. Supporters argued this would address the limitations of the current appeals process, which often fails to correct injustices.  
- **Transcript Costs**: **HB 1551** aimed to reduce the cost of court transcripts, which are often prohibitively expensive and create barriers to justice, particularly for low-income litigants.

### **4. Child Testimony and Counseling (Segments 4/7, 6/7)**  
- **Child Testimony**: **HB 1550** proposed allowing children aged 12 or older to testify in family court cases. Concerns were raised about the emotional toll on children, potential manipulation, and the adversarial nature of cross-examination. Opponents argued that existing practices, such as judges speaking to children in chambers, are more protective.  
- **Court-Ordered Counseling and Reunification Therapy**: Testimonies highlighted concerns about parents being denied the right to choose counselors for their children and the harmful effects of court-ordered reunification therapy, particularly in cases of abuse or alienation. **HB 1253** aimed to give parents more control over counseling decisions and ensure therapists are licensed and trained appropriately.

### **5. Excessive Court Filings and Evidence Submission (Segments 4/7, 5/7)**  
- **Excessive Filings**: **HB 1458** sought to empower judges to penalize parties for filing excessive or harassing motions, particularly in family court cases. Testimonies highlighted cases where one party used frequent, frivolous filings to harass the other, causing financial and emotional strain.  
- **Evidence Submission**: **HB 1142** addressed the right of parties to present evidence and testimony in family court. While some argued that unlimited evidence could make hearings unmanageable, others emphasized the need to ensure due process and prevent judges from ignoring critical evidence.

### **6. Financial and Emotional Toll of Family Court (Segments 3/7, 6/7, 7/7)**  
- **Financial Burden**: Testimonies highlighted the high costs of court-ordered services, including counseling, GAL fees, and transcripts, which create significant financial strain for families.  
- **Emotional Impact**: Many speakers shared personal stories of prolonged court battles, biased decisions, and the emotional toll on children and families, emphasizing the need for reforms to reduce unnecessary litigation and protect families’ well-being.

  - Ensuring transparency and accountability in judicial and GAL practices.
