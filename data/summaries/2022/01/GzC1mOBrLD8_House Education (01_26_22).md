### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/26/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 26, 2022, featured extensive discussions on charter school policies, special education services, transportation, and funding. The meeting centered on several bills aimed at addressing operational challenges, ensuring equitable access to education, and clarifying legal responsibilities for charter schools. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and issues discussed:

---

### **1. Charter School Enrollment and Fees**
   - **Enrollment Preferences**: Representatives debated giving priority to in-state students in charter school enrollment lotteries to prevent out-of-state students from displacing local students. This would ensure New Hampshire families have equitable access to charter schools.
   - **Application and Additional Fees**: Concerns were raised about non-application fees (e.g., for supplies or extracurricular activities) that could create financial barriers for families. Proposed legislation aimed to prohibit fees as a condition for enrollment while allowing optional charges for specific activities.
   - **HB 1193**: This bill addressed concerns about out-of-state students crowding out NH residents and sought to prioritize local enrollment.

---

### **2. Charter Conversion Schools**
   - **HB 1132**: This bill proposed simplifying the process for converting traditional public schools into charter schools by reducing voting requirements (e.g., eliminating the need for two-thirds teacher approval or superintendent consent). Instead, a majority vote by the school board and community would suffice.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents raised issues about the potential loss of teacher input, impacts on labor agreements, and the challenges of sustaining conversion charter schools, especially in small towns with single public schools.
   - **Funding and Oversight**: Questions were raised about how special education services would be managed, the impact on teacher retirement benefits, and whether public oversight of budgets and school boards would remain intact.

---

### **3. Special Education Services**
   - **HB 1074**: This bill addressed concerns about charter schools not receiving timely notifications for Individualized Education Program (IEP) meetings. It proposed requiring prior notice for subsequent IEP meetings to improve coordination between charter schools and resident districts.
   - **HB 1428**: This bill aimed to ensure timely provision of special education services by allowing charter schools to hire or contract specialists if the resident district failed to provide services within two weeks of the school year starting. The resident district would remain financially responsible.
   - **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned whether these bills were redundant, as federal and state laws already mandate notification and service provision. Others emphasized the need for clarity and better communication to address gaps in service delivery.

### **4. Charter School Transportation**
   - **HB 1212**: This bill addressed transportation for charter school students on days when traditional public schools are closed (e.g., snow days, professional development days). Proponents argued it was necessary to ensure access to transportation, while opponents raised concerns about increased costs for school districts and logistical challenges.
   - **HB 1453**: This bill sought to ensure that charter school students receive transportation under the same terms and conditions as public school students, prohibiting the use of transfer stations or depots unless they are also used for public school students. Rural representatives expressed concerns about feasibility in geographically dispersed areas.
   - **General Concerns**: The misalignment of school calendars between charter and public schools was a recurring issue, with discussions focusing on fairness, safety, and the financial burden on districts.

---

### **5. Funding and Facilities**
   - **HB 1499**: This bill proposed allowing charter schools to access state school building aid, which is currently restricted. Charter schools that own their buildings would be eligible for aid at a 30% rate, with higher rates based on factors like median family income.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the financial responsibility of charter schools for their share of construction costs and the potential risks to the state if a charter school closes. Supporters argued that the bill would promote fairness and equity, as charter schools serve a significant number of low-income students but have limited access to capital funding.

---

### **6. Broader Implications and Challenges**
   - **Teacher Unions and Retirement**: Discussions touched on the ability of charter school teachers to unionize and participate in the state retirement system. Charter school teachers can opt into the state retirement system, but their collective bargaining units may differ from those in traditional public schools.
   - **Local Control and Accountability**: Concerns were raised about the transition from elected school boards to boards of trustees in conversion charter schools, particularly regarding budget approval and taxation.
   - **Historical Context**: Representatives noted that New Hampshire has had only one conversion charter school in the past, which closed due to declining enrollment and operational costs, highlighting the challenges of sustaining such schools.

---

### **7. General Observations**
   - Many of the issues raised in the bills are already addressed by federal and state laws, leading to questions about the necessity of the proposed legislation.
   - The Department of Education provided technical clarifications but remained neutral on most bills, emphasizing the need for better communication and coordination between charter schools, resident districts, and state agencies.
   - The discussions highlighted the complexities of charter school policies, with a focus on balancing increased educational options with the practical and legal implications for students, teachers, and communities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the ongoing challenges and opportunities in charter school policy, with a strong emphasis on equity, fairness, and the need for clear guidelines to ensure that all students, particularly those with disabilities, receive timely and appropriate services. The debates reflected a mix of support for expanding educational options and concerns about the financial, logistical, and legal impacts of the proposed changes. Further discussions and potential amendments were anticipated as the committee worked to refine the legislation.
