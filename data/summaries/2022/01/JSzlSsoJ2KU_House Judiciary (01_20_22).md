### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (January 20, 2022)

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee meeting on January 20, 2022, addressed a wide range of bills, focusing on issues such as governmental records, housing, employment, landowner liability, religious freedom, and public participation. The committee heard extensive testimony from stakeholders, including representatives, legal experts, advocacy groups, and members of the public. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills covered during the meeting:

---

### **Governmental Records and School Transparency**
1. **House Bill 1147 (Governmental Records)**:
   - **Purpose**: To make specific school records (e.g., curricular materials, reading lists, student surveys) available upon request.
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire School Boards Association and Right to Know New Hampshire argued the bill is unnecessary, as these records are already public under existing laws (RSA 91-A and RSA 186:11). Concerns were raised that the bill could complicate the Right to Know Law and was perceived as a reaction to debates over critical race theory and DEI in schools.

2. **House Bill 1603 (School Records and Right-to-Know Law)**:
   - **Purpose**: To clarify that certain school records (e.g., attendance, disciplinary records) are governmental records under the Right-to-Know Law.
   - **Testimony**: Supporters argued the bill provides clarity for school administrators, while opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, contended that existing laws already cover these records. An amendment was proposed to avoid cluttering the Right-to-Know statute.

### **Housing and Rental Application Fees**
1. **House Bill 1408 (Refund of Residential Tenancy Application Fees)**:
   - **Purpose**: To require landlords to refund application fees if the applicant is not selected, addressing the financial burden on low-income renters.
   - **Testimony**: Tenant advocates highlighted the struggles of low-income renters, while landlords argued that fees are necessary to cover costs like background checks. Suggestions included standardizing application fees and reducing penalties for non-compliance.
   - **Key Issues**: Balancing tenant protections with landlord rights, addressing fraud, and ensuring transparency in the rental process.

### **Employment and Personnel Records**
1. **House Bill 1322 (Personnel Records Sharing)**:
   - **Purpose**: To allow governmental agencies to share personnel records for hiring purposes.
   - **Support**: Proponents, including Sheriff Bill Wright, argued it would prevent problematic employees from moving between agencies unnoticed.
   - **Opposition**: Right to Know New Hampshire raised concerns about broad language and potential harm to individuals’ employment prospects, suggesting the bill belongs in employment statutes rather than the Right to Know Law.

---

### **Landowner Liability and Recreational Use**
1. **House Bill 1579 (Landowner Liability for Recreational Activities)**:
   - **Purpose**: To protect landowners and their agents from liability related to recreational use of their property, particularly for activities like rail trail development.
   - **Support**: Landowners, foresters, and trail developers emphasized the economic and social benefits of keeping land open for recreation. Proposed amendments extended liability protections to contractors working on the land.
   - **Opposition**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Association for Justice, argued the bill could lead to negligence and reduce accountability, particularly for contractors.

### **Religious Freedom and Land Use**
1. **House Bill 1021 (Religious Land Use)**:
   - **Purpose**: To prevent local governments from imposing discriminatory land use regulations on religious institutions.
   - **Support**: Religious advocates shared stories of zoning challenges faced by churches, with legal experts comparing the bill to Massachusetts’ successful Dover Amendment.
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association raised concerns about ambiguity in defining "religious purposes."

2. **House Bill 1519 (Religious Belief and Anti-Discrimination)**:
   - **Purpose**: To define religious belief based on individual conscience rather than formal religious systems, aligning anti-discrimination statutes with the state constitution.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued the bill protects individuals from discrimination based on personal religious beliefs, especially in light of COVID-19 restrictions.
   - **Amendment**: Suggested protections in the education section to prevent discrimination against students based on religious beliefs.

### **Public Participation and Transparency**
1. **House Bill 1195 (Public Comment Periods at Public Meetings)**:
   - **Purpose**: To require public comment periods at the beginning of public meetings, particularly for school boards.
   - **Support**: Advocates argued it would ensure meaningful public input before votes are taken.
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire School Boards Association and Municipal Association argued the bill is overly broad and could create administrative burdens. Amendments were proposed to allow public comment at both the beginning and end of meetings.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Discussions on governmental records and public comment periods highlighted the importance of transparency while balancing administrative efficiency.
- **Housing and Tenant Protections**: Bills addressing rental application fees reflected the need to protect low-income renters without overburdening landlords.
- **Landowner Liability**: The debate over landowner liability underscored the tension between protecting landowners and ensuring public access to recreational land.
- **Religious Freedom**: Bills on religious land use and anti-discrimination emphasized the need to protect religious practices from discriminatory regulations and policies.
