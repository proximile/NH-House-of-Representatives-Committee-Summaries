### Summary of the New Hampshire House Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee Meeting (01/25/22)

The New Hampshire House Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee convened on January 25, 2022, to discuss and vote on several bills related to wildlife management, hunting, and marine resources. The meeting included executive sessions, debates, amendments, and votes on key legislation, highlighting the committee’s efforts to balance environmental conservation, public interests, and the regulatory authority of the Fish and Game Department.

#### Key Bills and Discussions:

1. **House Bill 1297 (Recreational Scuba Diving and Lobster Taking)**  
   - **Amendment**: Representative Spelaine proposed an amendment to allow the Fish and Game Department to regulate lobster seasons and bag limits through rulemaking rather than hardcoding them into law. The amendment passed unanimously (19-0).  
   - **Debate**:  
     - **Supporters** argued that scuba divers already take crabs similarly and noted that neighboring states allow this practice without significant issues.  
     - **Opponents** raised concerns about harm to lobster habitats, declining juvenile populations, enforcement challenges, and safety risks for divers near commercial traps.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill passed with an **11-8 vote** on an OTPA (Ought to Pass with Amendment) motion, but a minority report was requested.

2. **House Bill 1299 (Fish and Game Permit Appeals Process)**  
   - **Amendment**: An amendment extended the response time for permit applications to 60 days, which passed unanimously (19-0).  
   - **Debate**:  
     - **Supporters** emphasized the need for timely responses and a fair appeals process for citizens.  
     - **Opponents** expressed concerns about default approval if Fish and Game fails to respond, risks of invasive species, and whether the Fish and Game Commission is the appropriate body for appeals.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill passed on an OTPA motion, but some members suggested it should go to interim study for further review. A minority report was requested, with Representative Harvey tasked with drafting it.

3. **House Bill 1356 (Gray Squirrel Hunting Season)**  
   - **Amendment**: The bill aimed to remove the hunting season for gray squirrels, allowing them to be hunted year-round.  
   - **Debate**:  
     - **Proponents** argued that gray squirrels are a nuisance and cause damage to property and agriculture.  
     - **Opponents** felt that setting hunting seasons should be the responsibility of Fish and Game, not the legislature.  
   - **Outcome**: The amendment passed 12-7, and Representative Reid was tasked with drafting a minority report.

4. **House Bill 1323 (Hike Safe Program Fees)**  
   - **Amendment**: The committee unanimously supported an amendment to allow the executive director of Fish and Game to set fees for the Hike Safe program rather than having them hard-coded in statute.  
   - **Outcome**: The amendment passed 19-0, providing flexibility for the program’s future.

5. **House Bill 1631 (Discounted Hunting Licenses for Disabled Individuals)**  
   - **Debate**: The bill proposed discounted hunting licenses for disabled individuals but faced concerns about its financial impact on Fish and Game.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee recommended the bill as "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), citing the department’s reliance on license fees for funding. Members suggested the legislature should fund such discounts rather than burdening Fish and Game.

#### Additional Notes:
- The committee voted on several other bills, including **HB 1308** and **HB 1323**, with some passing unanimously and others with narrower margins.  
- Minority reports were requested for several bills, reflecting the committee’s divided opinions on key issues.  
- The meeting highlighted ongoing challenges with Fish and Game’s funding model and the appropriate role of the legislature versus Fish and Game in setting wildlife management policies.  

#### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on balancing wildlife conservation, public interests, and the financial sustainability of the Fish and Game Department. While several bills advanced with amendments, significant debates and minority reports indicated differing perspectives on how best to achieve these goals. The committee also emphasized the need for further study and potential legislative action to address ongoing issues with Fish and Game’s funding and regulatory authority.
