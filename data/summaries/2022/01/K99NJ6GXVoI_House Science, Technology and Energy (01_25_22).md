The January 25, 2022, meeting of the New Hampshire House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee covered a wide range of legislative bills and discussions related to energy policy, renewable energy, microgrids, climate change, and the reorganization of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and the Department of Energy (DOE). Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. House Bill 1628: Microgrid Projects**
- **Original Focus**: The bill initially aimed to direct the DOE to generate a report on a specific microgrid project at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in collaboration with regional utilities.
- **Amendment**: Representative Peter Somssich proposed broadening the bill to require the DOE to compile a comprehensive report on **all existing and developing microgrid projects** in New Hampshire by November 1, 2022. This change was motivated by the realization that other businesses in the state already have microgrids and that the UNH project has stalled.
- **Discussion**: The committee discussed the regulatory framework for microgrids, including their approval by the PUC, and the potential role of utilities like Eversource in sharing information on microgrid projects. Representative Thomas raised the issue of **wind turbines**, suggesting they should be considered if the bill expands further.

#### **2. House Bill 1250: Climate Change and Rate-Setting**
- **Proposal**: The bill, introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, would require the PUC to consider the impact of climate change when making rate-setting decisions, aiming to incentivize cleaner energy sources.
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned how the PUC would implement this requirement, given New Hampshire’s deregulated energy market and the PUC’s focus on transmission and distribution rather than generation. Gallagher acknowledged the need for amendments to provide clearer criteria, such as CO2 reduction metrics.
- **Next Steps**: Gallagher was advised to work with committee members to draft amendments for future subcommittee or executive sessions.

#### **3. House Bill 1459: Solar Panel Recycling**
- **Proposal**: The bill, modeled after similar legislation in Washington State, establishes a fund for recycling photovoltaic solar panels, shifting the cost burden from homeowners and businesses to manufacturers.
- **Discussion**: Committee members raised concerns about the bill’s potential impact on the solar industry, the logistics of recycling, and whether the program could be expanded to include other types of electronic waste. The sponsor, Representative Fred Platt, emphasized the need to focus on solar panel waste first.
- **Next Steps**: The committee scheduled an executive session for February 7th to further discuss the bill.

#### **4. House Bill 1645: Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and REC Sweeping**
- **Proposal**: The bill aims to stop the practice of **REC sweeping**, where utilities claim RECs from small renewable energy systems without compensating the owners.
- **Concerns**: REC sweeping is seen as a **property rights issue**, potentially violating state takings laws. Supporters argue that eliminating REC sweeping would strengthen the REC market and ensure fair compensation for renewable energy producers. Utilities, however, warned that it could increase compliance costs and potentially raise rates for customers.
- **Next Steps**: A subcommittee was formed to review the bill and develop amendments.

#### **5. House Bill 1258: DOE Reorganization and PUC Restructuring**
- **Proposal**: The bill addresses **technical and housekeeping changes** resulting from the reorganization of the PUC and the creation of the DOE in HB 2 (the state budget bill). It clarifies jurisdictional boundaries between the DOE and PUC, particularly in areas like utility assessments, state land crossings, and community power aggregation.
- **Discussion**: There was ongoing ambiguity about which agency (DOE or PUC) is responsible for certain regulatory functions, leading to confusion for utilities and stakeholders. The committee emphasized the need for a clear separation of roles between the DOE (executive branch) and the PUC (regulatory body).
- **Next Steps**: A subcommittee was proposed to further review HB 1258 and develop formal amendments.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Microgrids and Energy Resiliency**: The discussion on HB 1628 highlighted the importance of microgrids in enhancing energy resiliency, with a focus on gathering comprehensive data on existing and developing projects in New Hampshire.
2. **Climate Change and Energy Policy**: HB 1250 sparked debate on the role of the PUC in addressing climate change, with a need for clearer criteria and amendments to ensure effective implementation.
3. **Renewable Energy and RECs**: HB 1645 addressed the contentious issue of REC sweeping, emphasizing property rights and the need for a fair and robust REC market.
4. **Solar Panel Recycling**: HB 1459 underscored the growing concern over solar panel waste and the need for a proactive recycling program, though questions remain about its scope and impact on the solar industry.
5. **DOE and PUC Reorganization**: HB 1258 highlighted the complexities of restructuring the PUC and DOE, with a focus on maintaining independence, avoiding duplication of efforts, and ensuring clear regulatory responsibilities.

### **Next Steps**
- **Subcommittees**: Several subcommittees were formed to further review and amend bills, including HB 1250, HB 1459, HB 1645, and HB 1258.
- **Executive Sessions**: The committee scheduled executive sessions to discuss amendments and refine the language of the bills.
- **Future Meetings**: The committee planned to reconvene to hear additional testimony and continue discussions on pending legislation.

Overall, the meeting reflected the committee’s efforts to address critical energy and environmental issues while navigating complex regulatory and jurisdictional challenges. The discussions underscored the need for detailed and well-crafted legislation to ensure effective implementation and alignment with New Hampshire’s energy and environmental goals.
