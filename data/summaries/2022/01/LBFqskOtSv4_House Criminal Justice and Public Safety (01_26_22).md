### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee (January 26, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 26, 2022, to discuss several bills related to firearms, hunting, and public safety. The meeting featured extensive debates, testimonies, and votes on key legislative proposals, reflecting deep divisions over issues such as gun rights, public safety, and state sovereignty. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **House Bill 1310: Prohibition on Discharging Firearms Near Buildings and Livestock**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 1310**, which sought to prohibit the discharge of firearms in the direction of buildings, livestock, or pets during hunting. The bill was introduced in response to an incident where a hunter shot a turkey near a barn and livestock, raising safety concerns for a farmer.

- **Support**: The bill’s sponsor argued that existing laws do not adequately address safety concerns near structures or animals, even if the shot is deemed safe. Amendments were suggested to exclude hunting dogs from the definition of "pets."
- **Opposition**: Hunters, the Sportsmen's Alliance, and law enforcement officials opposed the bill, citing its vagueness, redundancy with existing laws (e.g., the 300-foot rule and reckless conduct statutes), and potential to restrict hunting opportunities. Farmers and landowners also raised concerns about its impact on property rights and predator control.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **11-9** to recommend the bill be **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**, effectively killing it.

#### **House Bill 1636: Constitutional Carry on Snowmobiles and ATVs**
**House Bill 1636** aimed to align New Hampshire's constitutional carry law with Fish and Game regulations, allowing individuals to carry firearms on snowmobiles and ATVs without a concealed carry license.

- **Support**: Proponents, including Representative John Burt and organizations like the NRA and Gun Owners of America, argued that the bill ensures consistency with constitutional carry principles and the right to self-defense. They emphasized that the current law is unenforced and redundant.
- **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about accidental discharges, but supporters countered that such incidents are rare.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **10-6** in favor of the bill, recommending it ought to pass.

#### **House Bill 1668: Background Checks for Commercial Firearm Sales**
**House Bill 1668** proposed requiring background checks for all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, flea markets, and online.

- **Support**: Advocates, including Representative Catherine Rogers, argued the bill closes a "loophole" in federal law, preventing felons and domestic abusers from obtaining guns without background checks. They cited data showing New Hampshire is a net exporter of guns and has a high "time-to-crime" rate for firearms.
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including the NRA and Gun Owners of America, claimed the bill is duplicative of federal law, infringes on private transactions, and would not prevent criminals from obtaining guns. They also argued it could delay law-abiding citizens' access to firearms for self-defense.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **10-6** to recommend the bill be **ITL**.

#### **House Bill 1178: Prohibition on Enforcing Federal Gun Laws**
**House Bill 1178** sought to prohibit the state from enforcing federal statutes, regulations, or executive orders that restrict or regulate the right to keep and bear arms.

- **Support**: Proponents, including Representative Burt and gun rights organizations, argued the bill protects Second Amendment rights and prevents state resources from being used to enforce federal overreach. They emphasized state sovereignty and the financial burden of enforcing federal laws.
- **Opposition**: The Department of Justice, State Police, and some lawmakers raised concerns about the bill’s impact on federal-state cooperation, particularly in drug investigations and active shooter scenarios. They also warned of potential loss of federal grant funding and constitutional issues related to federal preemption.
- **Outcome**: The bill sparked a divided debate, with no final vote reported in this segment.

#### **House Bill 1151: Restrictions on Carrying Firearms at Public Events**
**House Bill 1151** proposed prohibiting the open carrying of firearms within 100 feet of public events such as parades, protests, and rallies.

- **Support**: Proponents argued that openly carrying firearms at public events can intimidate participants and escalate tensions, potentially leading to violence. They emphasized that the bill does not infringe on the right to self-defense, as concealed carry remains permitted.
- **Opposition**: Opponents contended that the bill infringes on the constitutional right to bear arms and that the mere presence of a firearm does not constitute a threat. They raised concerns about the bill’s practicality and potential for abuse.
- **Outcome**: The committee considered a motion to **ITL** the bill, signaling opposition to its passage.

#### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Gun Rights vs. Public Safety**: The meeting highlighted the ongoing tension between protecting Second Amendment rights and ensuring public safety, particularly in contexts like hunting, public events, and federal-state cooperation.
2. **State Sovereignty**: Several bills, such as HB 1178, underscored debates over state sovereignty and the role of state resources in enforcing federal laws.
3. **Redundancy and Vagueness**: Many bills were criticized for being redundant with existing laws or overly vague, leading to concerns about enforceability and unintended consequences.
4. **Impact on Hunting and Property Rights**: Bills like HB 1310 raised questions about the balance between hunting traditions, property rights, and public safety.
5. **First Amendment Concerns**: HB 1151 sparked debates about the interplay between First Amendment rights (free speech and assembly) and Second Amendment rights (gun ownership).

#### **Final Outcomes**
- **Passed**: HB 1636 (Constitutional Carry on Snowmobiles and ATVs) was recommended to pass.
- **Defeated**: HB 1310, HB 1668, and HB 1151 were recommended to be **ITL**, signaling their likely failure in the full House.
