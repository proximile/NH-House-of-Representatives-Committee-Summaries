The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 25, 2022, covered a wide range of healthcare-related bills, focusing on issues such as healthcare reimbursement, mental health services, Medicaid access for immigrants, data privacy, therapeutic cannabis, and federal vaccine mandates. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Healthcare Reimbursement and Direct Payment Models (House Bill 1044)**
- **Overview**: House Bill 1044 proposed changes to healthcare reimbursement and charity care policies, including allowing facilities to operate on a **direct payment model**, where patients pay out-of-pocket without involving insurance.
- **Key Points**:
  - Debates centered on the percentage of care paid at the **charge master rate** versus discounted rates for self-pay, Medicare, and Medicaid patients.
  - Concerns were raised about the potential for direct payment facilities to **"skim off" high-revenue patients**, negatively impacting critical access hospitals that rely on Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements.
  - The bill aimed to promote **consumer-driven healthcare** by leveraging New Hampshire’s healthcare pricing transparency website to help consumers compare costs.
  - Historical context was provided, linking the bill to the 2011 phase-out of the **Certificate of Need (CON) board**, which previously regulated healthcare facility expansion.
  - The bill exempted direct payment facilities from charity care requirements, sparking concerns about access for low-income patients.
- **Outcome**: The committee requested additional research on how other states handle direct payment models and their impact on healthcare costs and access.

### **Secure Psychiatric Hospital Advisory Committee (House Bill 1391)**
- **Overview**: The bill sought to establish an advisory committee for the creation of a new secure psychiatric hospital, separate from the current facility located within a prison.
- **Key Points**:
  - The current facility was deemed **non-therapeutic** for civilly committed patients.
  - Concerns were raised that the advisory committee was unnecessary, as the project was already underway with secured funding.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **20-0** to recommend the bill as **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**, as the project was progressing without the need for additional oversight.

### **Medicaid Access for Mental Health Services (House Bill 1526)**
- **Overview**: The bill aimed to address the **"in and out" Medicaid program** for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness by raising the income threshold for eligibility.
- **Key Points**:
  - Approximately 2,500 individuals rely on community mental health centers, which face over $7 million in bad debt due to gaps in Medicaid coverage.
  - Raising the income threshold from $591 to $901 per month would allow an estimated 30-40% of individuals to qualify for continuous Medicaid coverage.
  - The fiscal impact was estimated at $5.4 million annually, with implementation proposed for 2023.
- **Outcome**: The bill received strong support from stakeholders for its potential to reduce administrative burdens and improve access to care.

### **Medicaid Access for Immigrants (House Bill 1578)**
- **Overview**: The bill proposed eliminating the five-year waiting period for lawfully residing immigrant children and pregnant women to access Medicaid and CHIP.
- **Key Points**:

### **Therapeutic Cannabis for Migraines (House Bill 1619)**
- **Overview**: The bill sought to add **migraine headaches** as a qualifying condition for New Hampshire’s therapeutic cannabis program.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill was introduced to address stigma and access issues for individuals with migraines, who currently must qualify under the broader **"chronic pain"** category.
  - The Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board (TCMOB) noted that migraines could already qualify under existing definitions but acknowledged the need for clarity.
  - The bill required revisions to accurately reflect migraines as a standalone condition.
- **Outcome**: The committee emphasized the importance of an evidence-based approach to adding new conditions to the program.

### **Developmental Disability Services (House Bill 1480)**
- **Overview**: The bill aimed to clarify that **familial dysautonomia (FD)**, a rare genetic disorder, qualifies for developmental disability services.
- **Key Points**:
