The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on January 20, 2022, addressed a range of legislative proposals focused on housing affordability, corporate welfare, waste management, tax policy, and broadband infrastructure. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and bills covered during the meeting:

---

### **Housing Affordability and Limited Equity Cooperatives**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1407-fn**, which initially aimed to promote affordable housing through the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP). However, due to concerns about feasibility and funding, the bill was amended to establish a study committee. The study would explore the potential of **limited equity cooperatives**, a model where renters collectively own their buildings and build equity. This concept, implemented in other states, could stabilize rents and provide affordable housing for underserved populations, including low-income residents and individuals with disabilities. Stakeholders like the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund expressed interest, but further analysis is needed to address financial and operational challenges.

### **Corporate Welfare and Wage Policies**
**House Bill 1478**, the **"Stop Corporate Welfare Act"**, sparked significant debate. The bill targets large employers (over 100 employees) paying wages below $15/hour by imposing a 0.5% increase in the **Business Profits Tax (BPT)** unless they raise wages. Proponents argued that this would reduce taxpayer subsidies for low-wage workers (e.g., Medicaid, food stamps) and incentivize livable wages. However, opponents raised concerns about the bill’s constitutionality, potential harm to industries like retail and hospitality, and the risk of job losses or reduced hours. Advocacy groups such as Granite State Taxpayers and the NH Retail Association opposed the bill, calling it a distortion of the tax code.

### **Waste Management and Manufacturer Responsibility**
**House Bill 1338** proposed a tax on manufacturers based on the cost of disposing of single-use products and packaging materials. The bill aimed to address the "externalization" of waste disposal costs, which currently fall on taxpayers. Taxes would vary by material, with higher rates for harder-to-recycle or toxic substances like styrofoam. Revenue would support municipalities in covering waste disposal costs. While the idea was seen as innovative, concerns were raised about its complexity, particularly in taxing foreign manufacturers and ensuring administrative feasibility. The committee concluded that further study was necessary before implementation.

### **Tax Policy and Telecommunications**
**House Bill 1494** focused on tax exemptions for telecommunications companies, particularly regarding property taxes on polls, conduits, and rights-of-way. Proponents argued that the bill would create tax equity among competitors, citing historical inequities in the industry. However, opponents, including the NH Municipal Association, warned that the bill could reduce property tax revenue for towns, shifting the burden to other taxpayers. The committee also discussed **House Bill 1450**, which sought to prioritize agricultural conservation under LCHIP. While supporters emphasized the importance of preserving farmland, opponents questioned the need for additional funding and representation within LCHIP.

### **Broadband Infrastructure Expansion**
The committee revisited **House Bill 1494** in the context of broadband infrastructure. The bill aims to reduce taxes on broadband suppliers to incentivize expansion, particularly in underserved rural areas. Industry leaders, including Comcast, highlighted the high costs of deploying broadband in low-population areas and argued that tax relief would make expansion economically viable. While the bill is projected to reduce municipal tax revenue by $2.5–$3.5 million annually, proponents emphasized the long-term benefits of improved broadband access for education, telehealth, and economic growth. Concerns were raised about the potential loss of municipal revenue and whether tax savings would directly translate into expanded broadband access.

### **Small Business Support**
Another bill discussed aimed to support small businesses by providing a five-year exemption from the **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)** and a deferral of the **Business Profits Tax (BPT)** for new LLCs with payrolls under $100,000. The goal is to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation by easing the financial burden on startups in their early stages.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Need for Further Study**: Many bills, such as those on limited equity cooperatives and broadband expansion, were deemed to require additional research and stakeholder input before implementation.
2. **Balancing Equity and Impact**: Discussions highlighted the importance of balancing tax equity, economic impact, and conservation priorities while addressing corporate welfare and housing affordability.
3. **Stakeholder Concerns**: Testimonies from industry representatives, advocacy groups, and municipalities underscored the complexities of crafting effective legislation that minimizes unintended consequences.
4. **Focus on Long-Term Benefits**: Several bills emphasized long-term goals, such as improving broadband access, preserving farmland, and supporting small businesses, even if they involve short-term trade-offs.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to reconvene for further discussions and work sessions to refine the bills, address fiscal and constitutional concerns, and gather additional public input. The meeting underscored the importance of careful deliberation and stakeholder collaboration in shaping policies that address critical issues in New Hampshire.
