The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 31, 2022, focused on several critical issues related to education funding, property tax relief, accountability measures, and the alignment of educational pathways between community colleges and four-year institutions. The discussions highlighted the complexity of these issues, with a strong emphasis on equity, constitutional obligations, and practical impacts on students, families, and municipalities.

### **Education Funding and Property Tax Relief**
1. **Statewide Education Property Tax and Adequacy Formula**:
   - The committee discussed the **adequacy formula** for funding public schools, which includes weights for student populations such as free and reduced-price lunch, special education, and English language learners. Concerns were raised about the high cost of special education and the potential over-identification of students for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to secure additional funding.
   - The **statewide education property tax** and its impact on homeowners and renters were major points of discussion, particularly in northern New Hampshire, where property valuations often outpace incomes. Proposals included a **statewide relief program** to provide uniform property tax relief rather than relying on municipal opt-ins.

2. **House Bill 1680**:
   - This bill introduces a new **education funding formula**, including an **opportunity grant** and a **transition grant** to ease municipalities into the new system over an eight-year period. The total state funding under the bill is estimated at $1.059 billion, with a net change of $107 million compared to current law.
   - **Swept funds** were reclassified as **municipal grants**, with municipalities retaining 3% of these funds. However, some communities, like Bedford, may lose funding due to CPI adjustments.
   - The bill also includes a **10-year phase-in** for the new funding formula, with concerns raised about its **constitutionality** and its ability to close the **opportunity gap** for students in lower-performing districts.

3. **House Bill 680 (HB680)**:
   - HB680 focuses on **accountability measures** and **school improvement plans**, particularly for underperforming schools (bottom 20%). The bill emphasizes support for school districts to improve student outcomes rather than punitive measures.
   - It introduces a **foundation opportunity budget** to ensure equitable funding across districts and includes **property tax relief** measures, such as raising the eligibility threshold for homestead exemptions and capping relief at $1,000 per homeowner, with a total program cap of $25 million.

### **Accountability and School Improvement**
- The committee reviewed sections of HB680 related to measuring student performance using statewide assessments, attendance, and graduation rates. There was a strong emphasis on **community involvement** in school improvement plans, with input from parents, stakeholders, and advisory councils.
- Concerns were raised about placing too much blame on teachers in underperforming schools, with recognition that external factors like poverty and health issues significantly impact student performance.

### **Aligning Educational Pathways**
1. **Transfer Credits and Competency-Based Education**:
   - The committee discussed the importance of aligning **competencies** rather than specific courses to ensure seamless transfers from community colleges to four-year institutions. There was a push for **stackable credits** and clear transfer pathways to prevent students from retaking courses.
   - A significant debate centered around whether students transferring with an **associate degree** should automatically be granted **junior standing**. Concerns were raised about meeting specific program requirements, especially in competitive fields like nursing and engineering.

2. **Student and Family Impact**:
   - The conversation underscored the importance of making higher education affordable and accessible, retaining students within the state, and providing clear guidance on transfer pathways to avoid extending students' time to degree completion.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee plans to continue discussions with university and community college representatives to refine language and ensure that transfer agreements are clear, fair, and supportive of students' educational goals.
- Further reviews of HB680 and HB1680 will include deeper statistical analysis of district budgets and student outcomes, as well as exploration of additional property tax relief measures for renters and farmers.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing equity, constitutional requirements, and practical impacts in education funding and policy. Key themes included the need for equitable funding, support for underperforming schools, property tax relief for low-income homeowners, and streamlined educational pathways to benefit students and families across New Hampshire.
