### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee Meeting (January 13, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee convened on January 13, 2022, to discuss several key election-related bills and proposals. The meeting focused on two primary themes: **Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)** and **election integrity**, with discussions also touching on ballot initiatives, voting machines, absentee ballots, and youth voting.

### **1. Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)**  
Multiple bills were discussed, including **HB 1482** (mandating RCV for federal and state elections by 2027) and **HB 1264** (enabling municipalities and state parties to adopt RCV for local and primary elections). Key points included:  

- **Mechanics of RCV**: RCV allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate achieves a majority (50%+1) in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and votes are redistributed based on voters’ next preferences. This process continues until a candidate secures a majority.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Reduces negative campaigning, as candidates seek second and third preferences.  
  - Eliminates the "spoiler effect," allowing voters to support third-party or independent candidates without fear of wasting their vote.  
  - Ensures winners have broad support, increasing voter engagement and representation.  
  - Successfully implemented in Maine, Alaska, and cities like New York, with high voter satisfaction.  
- **Concerns**:  
  - Complexity and potential voter confusion, necessitating robust voter education efforts.  
  - Constitutional issues, particularly under New Hampshire’s **plurality provision**, which applies to certain state races.  
  - Costs associated with software upgrades and longer counting times.  
- **Implementation**: The bill proposes a phased rollout, starting with municipal and primary elections in 2023, federal elections in 2025, and statewide elections in 2027.

### **2. Ballot Initiative Process (CACR 17)**  
The committee discussed a proposed constitutional amendment to allow voters to place questions on the statewide ballot through a petition process. Key points included:  

- **Process**: Petitions would require signatures from 5% of registered voters. If approved by a majority, the measure would become law within a year.  
- **Purpose**: Addresses issues with bipartisan support that struggle to pass through the legislature, such as cannabis legalization.  
- **Concerns**: Potential for ballot clutter, confusion between local and statewide issues, and the legislature’s ability to reverse voter-approved measures.

### **3. Election Integrity and Voting Machines**  
Several bills addressed concerns about electronic voting machines and proposed a return to hand-counting ballots. Key points included:  

- **House Bill 1064**: Proposes eliminating voting machines in favor of hand-counting. Supporters argued that machines are prone to errors, citing discrepancies in Windham’s 2020 election results. They emphasized the transparency and accuracy of hand-counting.  
- **Opposition**: Critics highlighted logistical challenges, increased costs, and the potential for human error in hand-counting. The Secretary of State’s office defended voting machines as generally accurate and efficient.  
- **House Bill 1157**: Seeks to codify a prohibition on voting machines being connected to the internet, reducing vulnerabilities.  
- **House Bill 1247**: Addresses issues with folded absentee ballots, which have caused overvotes and miscounts. The bill proposes handling absentee ballots separately to prevent errors.  
- **Public Testimony**: Many citizens expressed distrust in electronic voting machines, calling for greater transparency, accountability, and audits to restore confidence in election integrity.

### **4. Youth Voting (CACR 15)**  
The committee discussed a bill to allow 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the general election to vote in primary elections. This aligns New Hampshire with 23 other states and aims to increase youth participation in the electoral process.  

---

### **5. Paper Ballots (CACR 19)**  
The committee considered a constitutional amendment requiring all elections to be conducted using paper ballots. While New Hampshire already uses paper ballots by law, supporters argued that enshrining this requirement in the constitution would enhance election security and auditability.  

---

### **6. Public Testimony and Procedural Notes**  
The meeting included extensive public testimony, with speakers from diverse backgrounds advocating for or against the proposed reforms. Key themes included:  

- **Bipartisan Support for RCV**: Both Republicans and Democrats highlighted RCV as a nonpartisan reform that could reduce polarization and improve representation.  
- **Election Integrity**: Many speakers emphasized the need for secure, transparent, and accurate elections, with calls for audits, hand-counting, and safeguards against fraud.  
- **Voter Education**: Several participants stressed the importance of educating voters and election officials to ensure the successful implementation of new voting methods.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored a robust debate over the future of New Hampshire’s election system, with a focus on enhancing voter engagement, ensuring election integrity, and addressing practical and constitutional challenges. The committee plans to continue discussions on these issues, particularly the phased implementation of RCV and the potential return to hand-counting ballots. The session highlighted the complexity of balancing efficiency, accuracy, and public trust in the electoral process.
