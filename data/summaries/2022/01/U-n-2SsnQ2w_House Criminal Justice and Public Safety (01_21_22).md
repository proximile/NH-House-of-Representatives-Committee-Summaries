### **Criminal Justice and Public Safety Bills**

1. **House Bill 1388 (Cyber Flashing)**:
   - **Purpose**: Criminalizes the unsolicited sending of intimate images (cyber flashing) as a misdemeanor, addressing digital harassment.
   - **Support**: Advocacy groups, including the NH Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, emphasized the harm caused by such actions, particularly in grooming processes. Studies show nearly 20% of women have received unsolicited explicit images.
   - **Concerns**: Committee members raised questions about enforcement, accidental disclosures, and the potential for misuse in cases of dissolved relationships.
   - **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously with 20 votes in favor, after addressing drafting errors.

2. **House Bill 1176 (Decriminalization of Indoor Prostitution)**:
   - **Purpose**: Proposes removing criminal penalties for indoor prostitution.
   - **Opposition**: Law enforcement and human trafficking task force members argued that decriminalization could endanger trafficking victims, reduce access to protections, and make New Hampshire a destination for sex tourism.
   - **Support**: Some advocates distinguished between consensual sex work and trafficking, emphasizing the need to avoid criminalizing individuals in the sex trade.
   - **Outcome**: The bill faced strong opposition from stakeholders.

3. **House Bill 1067 (Statute of Limitations for Felony Assaults Against Children)**:
   - **Purpose**: Extends the statute of limitations for felony assaults against children, starting the clock only after the victim turns 18.
   - **Process**: A drafting error regarding class B felonies was addressed, and the bill was amended to limit its scope to class A felonies.
   - **Outcome**: The bill passed with a majority vote.

4. **House Bill 1340 (Definition of Domestic Violence)**:
   - **Purpose**: Seeks to narrow the definition of domestic violence, requiring proof of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.
   - **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including the NH Judicial Branch, law enforcement, and advocacy groups, strongly opposed the bill. They argued it would limit access to protective orders, disrupt ongoing efforts by the Domestic Violence Task Force, and harm victims.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate (ITL) and referred for interim study.

5. **House Bill 1400 (Marijuana Smell as Probable Cause)**:
   - **Purpose**: Prohibits law enforcement from using the smell of marijuana as probable cause for a search.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that the smell alone is insufficient evidence of a crime, especially given marijuana’s decriminalization and medical use.
   - **Opposition**: Law enforcement expressed concerns that it would hinder drug-related investigations.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was discussed, but no final decision was noted in the transcript.

6. **House Bill 1598 (Cannabis Legalization)**:
   - **Purpose**: Legalizes and regulates cannabis, with provisions for protecting user privacy, directing profits to public health and safety, and penalizing the provision of cannabis to minors.
   - **Support**: Bipartisan efforts, including funding for law enforcement training, public schools, and juvenile behavioral health, were highlighted.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the impact on existing medical cannabis distributors, but it was clarified that the bill would not affect their operations.
   - **Outcome**: The bill passed with a vote of 17-4.

### **Immigration Enforcement Bill**

1. **House Bill 1266 (Enforcement of Federal Immigration Laws)**:
   - **Purpose**: Prohibits jurisdictions in New Hampshire from enacting policies that discourage the enforcement of federal immigration laws.
   - **Opposition**:
     - Immigrant advocates argued the bill would erode trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement, discourage crime reporting, and lead to racial profiling.
     - Personal testimonies highlighted the fear and instability experienced by immigrants, particularly in mixed-status families.
   - **Support**: Proponents, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), argued the bill is necessary to ensure cooperation with federal immigration authorities and prevent sanctuary policies.
   - **Concerns**:
     - Legal experts raised constitutional issues, including violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.
     - The bill’s focus on immigration detainers was criticized, as detainers are not warrants and can lead to prolonged detention without probable cause.
   - **Outcome**: Strong opposition was expressed, with calls for a more humane and equitable approach to immigration policy.
