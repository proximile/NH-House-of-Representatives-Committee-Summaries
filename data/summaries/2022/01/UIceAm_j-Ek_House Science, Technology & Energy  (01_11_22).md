On January 11, 2022, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened to discuss **House Bill 1285**, which addresses the establishment of a multi-use energy data platform. The meeting began with logistical announcements from Chair Representative Michael Vose, including reminders about microphone etiquette and public participation procedures. The agenda focused on public hearings for several bills, with HB 1285 taking center stage.

### Overview of HB 1285
Representative Kat McGee, the bill’s sponsor, introduced HB 1285 as a resolution to a conflict between existing statutes regarding oversight of the energy data platform. The bill proposes shifting responsibility for setting privacy and security standards from the **Department of Energy** back to the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**, as the PUC has already conducted extensive work on the issue through an adjudicative proceeding involving multiple stakeholders, including utilities. McGee emphasized that the platform would aggregate energy usage data (not personal customer data) to support informed energy policy and management decisions, addressing the current fragmentation and inaccessibility of such data.

### Testimony and Perspectives
**Griffin Roberge** from the Department of Energy testified that the bill is a **technical fix** to correct statutory references and align oversight with the PUC. He noted that the PUC had initiated proceedings on the platform, with a settlement agreement filed in April 2021, but no order had been issued. Roberge called for a holistic review of the statute to ensure all necessary changes are made.

**Donald Crease**, the Consumer Advocate, supported the bill, stating it would clarify the process and expedite the settlement agreement’s approval. He highlighted the platform’s potential to provide consumers with access to their energy usage data, enabling them to share it with third-party service providers to save money and improve energy efficiency. Crease also noted that New Hampshire has been a national leader in developing such platforms, though Maine has since surpassed the state in implementation.

**Kelly Buchanan** of Clean Energy NH also testified in favor of the bill, emphasizing the collaborative nature of the settlement agreement and the need to prevent further delays. She provided examples of how the platform could streamline access to energy data for businesses seeking energy audits and weatherization services.

### Key Discussions and Concerns
Committee members raised several questions and concerns during the hearing:
- **Privacy and Security**: Representatives inquired about data privacy and security, particularly with the increasing use of smart meters. Crease assured that the statute includes strong privacy protections, and consumers must grant explicit permission for their data to be shared with third parties.
- **Oversight Debate**: There was discussion about whether oversight should remain with the PUC or revert to the Department of Energy. Supporters of the PUC’s oversight, including Crease, cited its role in ensuring the platform’s costs are reasonable relative to its benefits.
- **Technical and Functional Details**: Questions were raised about how the platform would function without smart meters, whether the Department of Energy could still use existing data, and the potential for the platform to enhance community resilience and address climate change.

### Conclusion
The public hearing on HB 1285 concluded with broad support for the bill as a means to streamline the implementation of the energy data platform while addressing privacy and security concerns. The committee planned to reconvene later in the day for additional hearings. Overall, the meeting focused on the technical and procedural aspects of the bill, with stakeholders emphasizing its importance for improving energy data accessibility, consumer benefits, and policy decision-making.
