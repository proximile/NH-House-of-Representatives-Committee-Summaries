### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (01/26/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on January 26, 2022, to discuss and vote on a wide range of bills and issues. The meeting included detailed debates on fiscal responsibility, taxation, legal standing, and the allocation of federal and settlement funds. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. State Standing, Litigation, and Supreme Court Case**
- **Legal Standing**: Members emphasized the importance of establishing clear state interests to support claims of standing in court, particularly in cases involving other states. They stressed the need for the attorney general to engage in litigation when necessary.
- **Supreme Court Decision**: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case involving New Hampshire, which was described as a rare example of original jurisdiction. Members speculated that political pressure may have influenced the decision.

#### **2. Taxation and Revenue Concerns**
- **Business Taxes (BPT and BET)**: Several bills related to business taxes were debated, with concerns raised about potential revenue losses, economic volatility, and the impact of federal stimulus programs. Members cautioned against further tax cuts without a clear understanding of future financial stability.
- **Broadband Tax Exemption**: A bill proposing a tax exemption for broadband services was discussed, with members questioning its effectiveness in incentivizing broadband expansion in underserved areas. An amendment was proposed to allow local municipalities to negotiate tax breaks in exchange for infrastructure investments.
- **Meals and Rooms Tax Reduction**: A bill to reduce the meals and rooms tax and increase revenue sharing with municipalities was recommended for interim study.
- **Communication Service Tax**: A bill proposing to reduce and eventually repeal the communication service tax by 2025 was also recommended for interim study.

#### **3. FRM Victims Compensation Fund**
- The committee discussed the termination of the FRM Victims Compensation Fund, which was established to reimburse victims of a financial fraud case. Updates were provided on the fund’s administration and distribution process. Members raised concerns about the fund’s constitutionality and potential legal challenges.

#### **4. Allocation of ARPA and Opioid Settlement Funds**
- **ARPA Fund Creation**: A bill proposed creating a fund for ARPA monies to support dollar-to-dollar matching grants for workforce development, without additional cost to New Hampshire taxpayers.
- **Opioid Settlement Funds**: The discussion focused on ensuring fair distribution of opioid settlement funds, addressing concerns about "double dipping" or "triple dipping" by municipalities receiving funds from multiple sources. An amendment was proposed to clarify the allocation formula and ensure funds are distributed based on the most recent census data.
- **Detox Facilities and Workforce Development**: Members highlighted the lack of detox facilities in certain counties and emphasized the need for funds to address opioid addiction treatment, particularly medical-assisted treatment over residential treatment.

#### **5. Other Bills and Technical Adjustments**
- **House Bill 1063**: A technical bill from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) was amended to reduce postage costs by eliminating unnecessary notifications for full refunds. The bill passed unanimously.
- **House Bill 1228**: A bill repealing inactive dedicated funds and revising reporting requirements passed unanimously.
- **House Bill 1338**: A bill proposing a study on taxing manufacturing based on disposal costs was deemed unworkable and voted ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) unanimously.
- **House Bill 1407**: A bill promoting affordable housing through the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP) was considered inappropriate for LCHIP and voted ITL unanimously.
- **House Bill 1525**: A bill establishing a county nursing home capital reserve fund was recommended for interim study due to concerns about funding and applicability.
- **House Bill 1541**: A bill establishing a deferral from business taxes for startups was deemed unnecessary and voted ITL unanimously.

#### **6. Remote Worker Taxation (House Bill 1097)**
- The committee discussed a bill addressing the taxation of New Hampshire residents working remotely for out-of-state employers. While Massachusetts’ emergency order taxing remote workers has been lifted, there was debate on whether the bill should be passed to prevent similar actions by other states in the future. The committee considered amendments to make the bill more enforceable.

#### **7. Agricultural and Community Resources**
- The committee briefly touched on bills related to agricultural resources under LCHIP and the establishment of a National Service Alumni Attraction and Retention Fund.
