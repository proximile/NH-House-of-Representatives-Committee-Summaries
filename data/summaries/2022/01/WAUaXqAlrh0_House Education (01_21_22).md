### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. House Bill 1661: CTE Programs and Calendar Alignment**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses challenges in CTE programs, particularly around calendar alignment between sending schools and CTE centers.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - An amendment proposes increasing non-conforming instructional days from 5 to 10 to provide flexibility for CTE students.

#### **2. House Bill 1283: Taxability of EFA Payments**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to repeal a line in state law stating that funds in Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs) are not taxable income.  
- **Sponsor**: Representative Luno argued that the state should not provide potentially misleading information about federal tax liability, given the complexity of federal tax law and unclear guidance.  
- **Testimony**: No EFA families have been taxed on these funds, but the issue remains unresolved at the federal level.  
- **Opposition**: Critics argue the language is consistent with other states' ESA programs and that repealing it could create unnecessary confusion.  

#### **3. House Bill 1114: Directory of Education Service Providers**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires scholarship organizations managing EFAs to create a public directory of education service providers, including accreditation, services for students with disabilities, and school performance data.

- **Concerns**: Opponents question the feasibility of collecting such data, especially from private providers.  
- **Potential Amendments**: Discussions focused on making the directory more flexible and applicable to different types of providers.  

#### **4. House Bill 1513: Definition of a Child with a Disability**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to align New Hampshire's definition of a child with a disability with federal law, extending special education services to students through age 21.  
- **Sponsor**: Representative Bill Boyd emphasized the need for equitable access to services across school districts and smoother transitions for aging-out students.  
- **Support**: Parents and advocates, including the Disability Rights Center, highlighted the importance of extending services to support independence and success.  
- **Opposition**: Chris Biso of the NH Association of Special Education Administrators raised budget concerns, suggesting delayed implementation to allow schools to adjust their budgets.  

#### **5. House Bill 1355: Reporting Misuse of EFA Funds**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires the scholarship organization managing the EFA program to report suspected cases of fraud or misuse of funds to the Attorney General.  
- **Sponsor**: Representative David Luno stressed the need for accountability to protect students and taxpayers.  
- **Concerns**: Representatives questioned the removal of terms like "intentional and substantial" from the bill, fearing potential overreporting and its impact on families.
