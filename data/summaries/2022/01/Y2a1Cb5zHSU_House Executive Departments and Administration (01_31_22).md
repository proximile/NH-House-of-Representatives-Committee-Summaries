**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Executive Departments and Administration, 01/31/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 31, 2022, focused on a range of bills addressing public safety, professional licensing, building codes, and small business regulations. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing safety, economic impact, and regulatory efficiency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and discussions:

---

### **House Bill 1159: Victims of Communism Memorial Day**
- **Purpose**: Designate November 7th as a day to commemorate the victims of communism.
- **Discussion**: Proponents argued that communism has caused immense global suffering and that the day would serve as a reminder to prevent such ideologies from resurfacing. Opponents, while acknowledging the importance of remembrance, felt that grassroots efforts and gubernatorial proclamations would be more effective than a statutory memorial day.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **12-5** to deem the bill **"inexpedient to legislate"**, meaning it will not move forward.

---

### **House Bill 1549: Retirement Limits for Police Officers**
- **Purpose**: Exclude special duty hours (e.g., directing traffic) from counting toward retirement limits for retired police officers.
- **Discussion**: Supporters argued that special duty hours do not contribute to retirement benefits and should not count against retirement caps. Opponents raised concerns about financial implications for the pension system and potential double-dipping.
- **Outcome**: The committee unanimously voted **17-0** to deem the bill **"inexpedient to legislate"**, citing the need to maintain the integrity of the pension system.

### **House Bill 1552: Assessing Certification Board**
- **Purpose**: Create an independent **Assessing Certification Board** under the Office of Professional Licensing and Certification (OPLC) to oversee assessor certification and discipline, moving these responsibilities from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA).
- **Discussion**: Proponents argued that this would improve transparency and accountability, similar to the real estate appraiser board. However, concerns were raised about the transition period, potential decertification of assessors, and the need for a grandfather clause.
- **Outcome**: The bill was sent to a subcommittee for further review and refinement.

### **House Bill 1681: Building and Fire Code Updates**
- **Purpose**: Update the state’s building and fire codes to the 2018 editions, incorporating amendments from the Building Code Review Board.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Transition period allowing builders to choose between old and new codes.
  - Eliminating sprinkler requirements for one- and two-family homes.
  - Relaxing **arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI)** requirements.
  - Addressing inspection frequency and fall protection requirements.
- **Discussion**: Stakeholders, including the State Fire Marshal and building officials, supported the updates but raised concerns about inconsistent inspection coverage and safety risks. An oversight regarding the exclusion of the **State Fire Code** was noted, and an amendment is being prepared.
- **Outcome**: The bill was discussed in detail, with plans to amend it to include the State Fire Code.

### **House Bill 314: Homestead Food Operation Licensure**
- **Purpose**: Increase the gross sales threshold for homestead food operations from $20,000 to $35,000, providing more flexibility for small-scale food producers.
- **Discussion**: The increase reflects rising costs and economic challenges faced by homesteaders, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill does not alter the types of foods covered or regulatory oversight by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
- **Outcome**: The bill was moved to the consent calendar with unanimous support.

### **House Bill 1191: Plumbing and Gas Fitting Exemptions**
- **Purpose**: Allow homeowners to perform plumbing and gas fitting work in two-family dwellings.
- **Discussion**: Opponents, including trade professionals and the New Hampshire Building Officials Association (NHBOA), raised safety concerns, particularly for tenants in multi-family units. They emphasized the importance of permits, inspections, and licensed work to prevent hazards like carbon monoxide poisoning and gas explosions.
- **Outcome**: Calls were made to limit homeowner-performed work to single-family detached dwellings to avoid risks to tenants.

### **House Bill 1312: Grease Trap Regulations**
- **Purpose**: Address grease trap requirements for small businesses, particularly food establishments, by adopting the **International Plumbing Code (IPC)** as a standard.
- **Discussion**:
  - Small business owners, such as Balthazar’s Ice Shack, testified about the financial burden of installing large grease traps despite minimal grease output.
  - The Department of Environmental Services (DES) defended the regulations, emphasizing the need to protect groundwater and septic systems.
  - Confusion arose over the IPC’s applicability to interior plumbing versus exterior wastewater systems, which DES regulates.
- **Outcome**: The committee discussed the need for clearer communication and collaboration between DES, the Building Code Review Board (BCRB), and plumbing professionals to create more reasonable regulations for small businesses.
