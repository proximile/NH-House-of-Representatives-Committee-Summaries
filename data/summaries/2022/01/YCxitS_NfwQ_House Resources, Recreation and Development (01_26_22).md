The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Resources, Recreation, and Development held a meeting on January 26, 2022, to discuss several bills addressing key issues related to watercraft, mooring permits, off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs), and snowmobiles. The meeting focused on six primary bills, each addressing distinct challenges and opportunities in these areas.

### **Watercraft and Mooring Legislation**

1. **House Bill 1438: Mooring Permits**  
   - **Prime Sponsor**: Representative Peter Teroshan  
   - **Purpose**: The bill allows mooring permit holders to temporarily transfer their mooring to another person for up to 30 days at no cost, aiming to increase the utilization of coastal moorings and boost local tourism and economic activity.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Transfers are temporary and do not involve permanent ownership changes.  
     - Enforcement relies on an honor system and existing monitoring mechanisms.  
     - The bill applies only to coastal moorings, not inland ones.  

2. **House Bill 1641: Vessel Registration Fees**  
   - **Prime Sponsor**: Representative Douglas Trottia  
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes changing boat registration fees from a flat fee based on boat length to a mill rate system based on the boat’s value, similar to vehicle registration fees.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - **Opposition**: The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the New Hampshire Marine Trades Association (NHMTA), and the Marine Patrol testified against the bill, citing affordability concerns and potential negative impacts on recreational boating and tourism.  
     - **Concerns**: The proposed mill rate (18 mills) would significantly increase registration costs, potentially deterring out-of-state boaters and harming local marine businesses.  
     - **Recommendations**: Stakeholders suggested forming a working group to explore more balanced solutions rather than implementing the proposed mill rate system.  

3. **House Bill 1316: E-Foil Safety Regulations**  
   - **Prime Sponsor**: Representative Suzanne Gottling  
   - **Purpose**: The bill directs the Director of the State Police, in consultation with the Bureau of Marine Patrol, to develop safety requirements for e-foils and electric hydrofoil surfboards.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - E-foils, powered by lithium-ion batteries, can travel at speeds of 25-30 mph and pose safety and environmental concerns.  
     - The bill aims to establish safety rules, including mandatory life jacket use, to mitigate risks such as collisions and conflicts with other watercraft.  
     - Captain Tim Dunleavy of the Marine Patrol supported the bill, noting that e-foils are likely to be federally classified as boats, triggering existing boating regulations.  

4. **House Bill 1317: Annual Report on Watercraft Technology**  
   - **Prime Sponsor**: Representative Suzanne Gottling  
   - **Purpose**: The bill requires the Director of the State Police, in consultation with the Bureau of Marine Patrol, to report annually to the legislature on new developments in electric and gasoline-powered recreational watercraft.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The report would provide legislators with timely information to address emerging safety and environmental challenges related to new watercraft technologies, such as e-foils and wake boats.  
     - The goal is to enable proactive regulation and avoid being "blindsided" by new technological advancements.  

### **OHRV and Snowmobile Legislation**

5. **House Bill 1554: Online Payment of Fees and Fines**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to modernize the registration process for OHRVs and snowmobiles by enabling online payment of registration fees and fines.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The focus is on **renewals only**, as initial registrations require verification (e.g., VIN numbers).  
     - Fish and Game supports the bill with an amendment to delay implementation until **September 1, 2025**, allowing time to secure a new vendor contract.  
     - Online payment of fines was debated, with Fish and Game suggesting it may require decriminalizing certain violations or creating an internal hearings process.  
     - Stakeholders, including the NH Off-Highway Vehicle Association and NH Snowmobile Association, support the bill but emphasize the need for a dual system (online and in-person) to accommodate last-minute registrations.  

6. **House Bill 1498: Safety Training Program**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes establishing a safety training program for OHRV and snowmobile riders, particularly targeting new and younger riders.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The program aims to reduce accidents, improve trail safety, and foster respect for private landowners.  
     - Fish and Game supports the bill but recommends an **interim study** to refine the program’s components, including online and in-person training.  
     - Stakeholders, including the NH Snowmobile Association and NH Off-Highway Vehicle Association, support the concept but emphasize the need for further refinement to address specific challenges.  
     - The bill would require out-of-state riders to complete safety training if they register their vehicles in New Hampshire.  

### **General Themes and Outcomes**
- **Modernization and Convenience**: Several bills (e.g., HB 1438, HB 1554) focus on modernizing systems and processes to improve convenience for users while addressing enforcement and logistical challenges.  
- **Safety and Regulation**: Bills like HB 1316, HB 1498, and HB 1554 emphasize the importance of safety training and regulations to mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies and recreational activities.  
- **Economic and Environmental Impacts**: Stakeholders expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of proposed fee changes (HB 1641) and the need for proactive regulation of new technologies (HB 1317) to avoid negative environmental and safety consequences.  
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Across all bills, there was a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement, with representatives from various associations and agencies testifying and providing recommendations for amendments or further study.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing modernization, safety, and economic considerations in legislation related to watercraft, mooring permits, and OHRVs. While some bills, such as HB 1438 and HB 1554, are likely to move forward with amendments, others, like HB 1641 and HB 1498, were recommended for further study and stakeholder input to address concerns and refine proposals. The committee’s approach reflects a commitment to proactive regulation and collaboration with stakeholders to address emerging challenges in recreation and resource management.
