**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Finance Committee, January 26, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 26, 2022, convened by the House Finance Committee, addressed several critical pieces of legislation, including **House Bill 103** (establishing a dental benefit for adult Medicaid recipients) and **House Bill 1677** (compensating victims of abuse at the Youth Development Center, YDC). The discussions were marked by detailed debates on fiscal implications, legal considerations, and program implementation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **1. House Bill 103: Adult Dental Benefit for Medicaid Recipients**
- **Purpose and Implementation**: HB 103 aims to establish preventive and restorative dental services for adult Medicaid recipients, with the goal of improving oral health and reducing costly emergency care. The bill outlines a roadmap for implementation, including issuing RFPs, applying for CMS waivers, and launching the program by April 1, 2023.
- **Fiscal Considerations**: While the bill is expected to generate cost savings by reducing emergency room visits, these savings are relatively small compared to the program’s administrative costs. Actuarial analysis by Milliman provided low cost estimates, prompting questions about how these figures were derived, particularly in comparison to private insurance rates.
- **Amendments and Repeals**: The committee debated amending the bill to clarify language around diagnostic and preventive services, referencing the CDT (Code of Dental Terminology) code set for specificity. There was also discussion about repealing portions of a 2019 law (HB 692) to avoid redundancy and ensure HB 103 is the primary legislation.
- **Work Group**: The importance of retaining the work group established by the 2019 law was emphasized, as it has been instrumental in stakeholder collaboration and program development.
- **Provider Participation**: Building a robust network of dental providers was highlighted as critical to the program’s success, with attention to challenges like Medicaid patient no-show rates and the need for care coordination.
- **Effective Dates**: The bill’s effective date was adjusted to July 1, 2022, for funding appropriations to align with the fiscal year, while other sections would take effect upon passage.

### **2. House Bill 1677: Compensation for YDC Abuse Victims**
- **Scope and Appropriation**: HB 1677 proposes a $100 million fund to compensate victims of abuse at the YDC, primarily focusing on sexual abuse claims. There was debate about expanding the scope to include physical abuse, though concerns about legal and logistical challenges, such as statute of limitations issues, were raised.
- **Claims Process**: The bill establishes a claims verification process, with an administrator reviewing claims and making settlement offers. Disputed cases would go to arbitration with a neutral arbitrator. Claimants must waive their rights to pursue litigation before knowing how their claims will be evaluated, raising concerns about fairness.
- **Transparency and Auditing**: Provisions were included to ensure transparency, such as clear accounting codes to differentiate bureaucratic expenses from claimant payouts, enabling auditing of expenditures.
- **Contingency Fees**: Attorneys representing claimants can receive up to 25% of settlements for administrative resolutions and up to 33% for arbitrated cases. Discussions centered on whether these fees are appropriate and whether they incentivize arbitration over administrative resolution.
- **Timelines and Notice**: The bill sets a one-year window for filing claims, with a cutoff date of January 8, 1980, for incidents. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of public notice to potential claimants, especially those in penal institutions or hard-to-reach populations. Suggestions included expanded notice efforts, such as posting information in correctional facilities and broader media outlets.
- **Waiver of Rights and Recognition of Wrongdoing**: The bill requires claimants to waive their rights to seek additional monetary relief from the state or its employees. Some representatives pushed for stronger language acknowledging the state’s responsibility for wrongdoing at YDC, without admitting legal liability that could jeopardize ongoing criminal cases.
- **Criminal Referrals**: The bill includes provisions for referring claimants who submit false claims to law enforcement. Suggestions were made to add similar language for employees suspected of violations to ensure accountability.

### **3. Key Cross-Cutting Themes**
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Both bills involved significant financial commitments, with discussions focusing on cost estimates, funding appropriations, and the potential need for additional resources.
- **Transparency and Fairness**: Ensuring transparency in claims processes and protecting victims’ privacy were recurring themes. Amendments were proposed to balance public disclosure under the Right to Know Law with the need to safeguard sensitive information.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The importance of retaining work groups and engaging stakeholders, including victims’ counsel, advocacy groups, and providers, was emphasized to ensure effective program implementation.
- **Legal and Logistical Challenges**: Both bills raised legal and logistical concerns, such as the waiver of rights, statute of limitations issues, and the neutrality of administrators and arbitrators.

### **4. Next Steps**
- **Amendments and Finalization**: The committee worked on specific amendments for both bills, with plans to share finalized drafts with stakeholders for review. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for February 11 to discuss the finalized amendments and move the bills forward to the full Finance Committee.
- **Preparation and Implementation**: For HB 103, the focus was on preparing for the program’s launch, including issuing RFPs and applying for CMS waivers. For HB 1677, the emphasis was on ensuring a fair and efficient claims process, with the Attorney General’s office committed to providing proposed amendments by February 7.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the House Finance Committee’s commitment to addressing critical issues—expanding access to dental care for Medicaid recipients and providing justice for victims of abuse at the YDC—while balancing fiscal responsibility, transparency, and fairness. The collaborative effort and detailed discussions reflected the complexity of the issues and the importance of careful legislative planning to ensure successful outcomes.
