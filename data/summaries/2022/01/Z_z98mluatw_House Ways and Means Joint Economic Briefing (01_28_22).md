### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Joint Economic Briefing (01/28/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on January 28, 2022, for a joint economic briefing to review the state’s financial condition, economic recovery, and workforce development strategies. The meeting featured presentations from key state officials, including Michael Kane (Legislative Budget Assistant), Commissioner Lindsey Stepp (Department of Revenue Administration), and representatives from various state agencies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and insights from the briefing:

---

### **State Financial Condition and Revenue Management**
1. **Strong Fiscal Position**:  
   - New Hampshire ended FY21 with a $200 million surplus, significantly higher than the projected $51 million deficit. This allowed a $141 million transfer to the Rainy Day Fund, bringing its balance to $257.8 million.  
   - FY22 revenue collections are ahead of projections, particularly in business taxes, but March, April, and June remain critical months for tax collections.  
   - Unbudgeted appropriations, such as litigation costs and education-related expenses, are being closely monitored.  

2. **Revenue Trends and Challenges**:  
   - **General Fund**: Strong performance, but the Education Trust Fund lags slightly.  
   - **Meals and Rentals (M&R) Tax**: Boosted by tourism and consumer spending, though staffing shortages and inflation pose risks.  
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax (RETT)**: Significant growth in FY21 due to a hot housing market, but rising interest rates and low inventory are concerns.  
   - **Tobacco Tax**: Revenue increases are attributed to cross-border purchases following bans on flavored tobacco in neighboring states.  
   - **Interest and Dividends Tax (IND)**: Revenue has fluctuated due to federal tax law changes, but the tax is set to be fully repealed by 2026.  

3. **Federal Stimulus Funds**:  
   - New Hampshire received $1.2 billion from the CARES Act and $497 million from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). Funds have been allocated to business support, workforce development, broadband expansion, and rental assistance.

### **Economic Recovery and Workforce Development**
1. **Economic Recovery Strategy**:  
   - The state has developed a long-term economic recovery plan, focusing on high-growth sectors like healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing.  
   - Programs like the Main Street Relief Fund and the Self-Employed Livelihood Fund provided critical support to small businesses during the pandemic, helping reduce unemployment from a peak of 16% in April 2020 to much lower levels by late 2021.  

2. **Workforce Challenges**:  
   - Labor shortages persist, exacerbated by demographic trends, early retirements, and childcare issues.  
   - New Hampshire has seen significant net in-migration, with people moving from densely populated areas to take advantage of remote work opportunities and the state’s quality of life. However, housing shortages could constrain this growth.  

3. **Tourism and Workforce Integration**:  
   - Tourism, which saw record-breaking visitor spending in 2021, is being leveraged to attract and retain workers. The state’s outdoor recreation opportunities and safe reputation are key selling points.

### **Housing and Real Estate**
1. **Housing Market Trends**:  
   - New property listings, pending sales, and inventory for single-family homes and condos decreased from November 2020 to November 2021, while median sales prices increased.  
   - Affordability has declined, with the affordability index for single-family homes at its lowest in December 2021.  

2. **Supply Chain and Construction**:  
   - Supply chain disruptions and rising material costs have created a backlog in new home construction, further exacerbating housing shortages.  

---

### **Business Taxes and Medicaid Enhancement**
1. **Business Taxes**:  
   - The Business Enterprise Tax (BET) and Business Profits Tax (BPT) have seen volatile revenue trends due to federal stimulus programs and the pandemic. Recent legislative changes have increased filing thresholds and reduced tax rates.  

2. **Medicaid Enhancement Tax**:  
   - Hospitals filed strong non-binding estimates for FY22, indicating robust revenue projections.  

---

### **State Treasury and Financial Management**
1. **Unclaimed Property**:  
   - The state returned $6.3 million in unclaimed property in FY21, with $67 million returned over the past decade.  

2. **College Savings and Disability Accounts**:  
   - New Hampshire’s 529 college savings plan is the fourth largest in the country, with $21 billion in assets. Tax-advantaged savings accounts for individuals with disabilities have grown to 577 accounts with $5 million in assets.  

3. **Debt and Bonding**:  
   - The state maintains a strong debt profile, with $1 billion in bonds outstanding. Plans to issue more bonds in March 2022 will support capital projects.

### **Labor Market and Unemployment**
1. **Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund**:  
   - The removal of surcharges on employer tax rates has allowed the fund to grow to a more solvent level. Tax rate reductions are expected in 2023 and 2024.  

2. **Labor Market Trends**:  
   - New Hampshire’s labor market is strong, with high job openings and accelerated job growth in 2021. However, quit rates are high in hospitality, retail, and healthcare due to burnout.  
   - Labor force participation remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly among older and younger workers.  

3. **Impact of COVID-19 Variants**:  
   - The Omicron variant temporarily reduced labor force participation, slowing economic activity in sectors like hospitality and retail.

### **Future Outlook**
1. **Economic Forecast**:  
   - Job growth is expected to slow in 2022 due to labor constraints but will rebound in 2023. The state anticipates returning to pre-pandemic employment levels by the end of 2022 and trend growth by late 2023 or early 2024.  

2. **Strategic Investments**:  
   - Federal funds are being allocated to critical infrastructure projects, including broadband expansion, water, and sewer systems, to support economic growth.
