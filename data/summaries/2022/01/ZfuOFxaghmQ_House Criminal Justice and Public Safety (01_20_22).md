The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 20, 2022, focused on two major topics: **psilocybin therapy** and **cannabis legalization**. The discussions were divided into four segments, each addressing various aspects of these issues, including public safety, economic benefits, regulatory concerns, and public health implications.

### **Psilocybin Therapy (HB 1349):**
The meeting began with a discussion on the therapeutic use of psilocybin, particularly for treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, and end-of-life care. Advocates emphasized that psilocybin therapy is intended for **regulated, supervised sessions** rather than recreational use. Oregon’s regulated psilocybin therapy program was highlighted as a model, with strict licensing for facilitators, therapists, and testing centers. The FDA is currently in **Phase II clinical trials** for psilocybin, and it is not yet approved for prescription use.

### **Cannabis Legalization (HB 1598):**
The bulk of the meeting centered on **HB 1598**, a bill proposing the legalization of recreational cannabis in New Hampshire. Representative Daryl Abbas introduced the bill, which suggests a **state-run cannabis retail system**, modeled after the state’s liquor sales, to avoid over-taxation and black market competition. The bill aims to generate revenue for **drug treatment programs** and **property tax reduction**, with the first $25 million in net revenue allocated to substance abuse and mental health programs.

#### **Support for Legalization:**
- **Economic Opportunities:** Advocates highlighted the economic benefits, including job creation, business opportunities, and tax revenue. They argued that legalization would provide prosperity for residents.
- **Reduction in Black Market:** Proponents believe that a well-regulated market with low taxes and barriers to entry can reduce the influence of the illicit market.
- **Racial Disparities:** The ACLU pointed out racial biases in marijuana enforcement, noting that Black individuals are disproportionately arrested for possession. Legalization is seen as a way to address these disparities.
- **Consumer Safety:** Supporters argued that legalization ensures safer, regulated products, reducing the risks associated with unregulated cannabis, such as contamination with fentanyl.
- **Public Support and Precedent:** Supporters noted growing public support for legalization and that New Hampshire is surrounded by states where marijuana is already legal.

#### **Opposition to Legalization:**
- **Public Safety Concerns:** Law enforcement officials, including Chief John Bryfonsky, argued that legalizing cannabis would lead to increased impaired driving, motor vehicle collisions, and fatalities. They cited examples from other states where legalization has resulted in higher cannabis-related incidents.
- **Youth Use and Health Risks:** Opponents raised concerns about the potential increase in youth cannabis use and associated health risks, including behavioral disorders and chronic marijuana use disorder. Medical and psychiatric associations strongly opposed legalization due to its negative effects on youth development.
- **Black Market Persistence:** Critics argued that legalization would not eliminate the illicit market, as seen in states like Oregon and California, where illegal cannabis production continues to thrive despite legalization.
- **Financial Burden:** Opponents claimed that the costs of regulating cannabis (e.g., law enforcement, public health) would outweigh the revenue generated, citing examples from states like Colorado and California.
- **Impact on Communities:** Opponents highlighted the negative experiences of states that have legalized marijuana, such as increased hospitalizations for THC ingestion and impaired driving incidents.

### **Proposed Amendments and Neutral Perspectives:**
- **Free Market Competition:** Some advocates suggested amending the bill to allow private retail competition rather than limiting sales to state-run stores.
- **Edibles and Cultivation:** Recommendations included allowing cultivators to sell directly to consumers and expanding access to edibles, which are considered a safer consumption method.
- **Learning from Other States:** Organizations like Americans for Prosperity urged lawmakers to learn from the successes and failures of other states to create an effective legal market in New Hampshire.

### **Constitutional Amendments and Public Testimony:**
Several **Constitutional Amendment Resolutions (CACRs)** were discussed, including proposals to establish a right to possess and cultivate cannabis for personal use. Representative Andrew Prout argued that a CACR could bypass potential gubernatorial vetoes and allow voters to decide directly. Public testimony included advocates and experts emphasizing the need for regulation, public safety, and the alignment of state laws with public sentiment.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting reflected deep divisions over the potential risks and benefits of marijuana legalization in New Hampshire. Opponents stressed the dangers to youth and public health, while supporters advocated for regulation, decriminalization, and economic benefits. The bill remains contentious, with significant concerns about its impact on vulnerable populations and the state’s ongoing substance use crisis. The discussions also underscored the need for careful regulation to balance revenue generation, public health, and market competition.
