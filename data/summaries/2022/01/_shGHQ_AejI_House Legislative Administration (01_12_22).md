The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 12, 2022, focused on a series of legislative proposals and constitutional amendments (CACRs) addressing judicial accountability, legislative structure, electoral processes, and gender neutrality. The discussions centered on balancing accountability, representation, and the integrity of the state’s political systems. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key topics debated:

### Judicial Accountability and Recall
1. **CACR 27 (Recall of State Court Judges)**:  
   This proposal sought to allow voters to recall judges through a petition and vote process, providing an alternative to impeachment. Proponents argued that the current Judicial Conduct Committee (JCC) is overly protective of judges and lacks transparency, resulting in few removals or suspensions. Critics, including the New Hampshire Bar Association, opposed the measure, warning that it could politicize the judiciary and undermine judicial independence. They emphasized that existing mechanisms, such as appeals and the JCC, adequately address judicial misconduct.

2. **CACR 26 (Recall Procedures for Elected Officials)**:  
   This amendment aimed to allow the legislature to create a process for recalling elected officials before their term ends. Supporters argued it would provide a remedy for municipalities dealing with disruptive or unfit officials, particularly in local boards with longer terms. Opponents questioned the necessity of such a mechanism, given New Hampshire’s two-year election cycles, and expressed concerns about overturning election results.

### Legislative Structure and Compensation
1. **CACR 29 (Reducing House Size and Increasing Senate Size)**:  
   This proposal aimed to reduce the House of Representatives from 400 to 200 members and increase the Senate from 24 to 35 members. Supporters argued it would improve efficiency, reduce redundancy, and make legislative service more accessible by introducing a nominal salary. Opponents contended it would decrease representation, increase election costs, and diminish the unique grassroots nature of New Hampshire’s legislature.

2. **CACR 13 (Legislator Compensation)**:  
   Sponsored by Representative Deshaies, this amendment proposed reducing legislator pay to two cents per biennium and one cent for special sessions, aligning with the perception of legislators as volunteers. Deshaies argued that the current $200 biennial pay is unnecessary and could be better allocated elsewhere. The committee discussed potential amendments and the implications of reducing pay to zero, including its impact on state health care benefits for legislators.

3. **CACR 25 (Term Limits for Legislators)**:  
   Sponsored by Representative LaBranche, this amendment would limit legislators to 15 terms in either the House or Senate. LaBranche argued it would bring fresh perspectives to the legislature, while opponents, including Dan Itza, contended that term limits deprive voters of their choice and undervalue legislative experience.

### Electoral and Representation Reforms
1. **CACR 31 (Lowering Age Requirements for State Senate)**:  
   This measure aimed to lower the minimum age to run for state Senate from 30 to 25. Supporters highlighted that 25-year-olds can serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and noted that New Hampshire is an outlier with its higher age requirement. Critics questioned whether younger candidates would have the necessary experience and raised concerns about potential personal conduct issues.

2. **CACR 24 (Election of the Attorney General)**:  
   Sponsored by Representative Sober, this amendment proposed changing the appointment process of the Attorney General from being appointed by the governor and executive council to being elected by the general court or the people. Sober cited past failures, such as the FRM scandal, as reasons for the change. The committee debated the merits of legislative versus popular election and the potential for increased accountability.

3. **CACR 26 (Party List Proportional Representation)**:  
   Sponsored by Representative LaBranche, this amendment proposed adopting party list proportional representation for 100 of the 400 House seats to increase political diversity and reduce polarization. Critics, including Dan Itza, argued that this would create unaccountable representatives and dilute local representation.

### Gender Neutrality and Constitutional Language
1. **CACR 23 (Gender-Neutral Language in the Constitution)**:  
   Sponsored by Representative LaBranche, this amendment aimed to make the New Hampshire Constitution gender-neutral by replacing gendered pronouns with the title of the position (e.g., "the governor" instead of "he or she"). LaBranche noted that a similar amendment failed by a narrow margin in 1998. Supporters argued that this change reflects modern gender equality, while opponents questioned its necessity and practicality.

### Procedural Matters and Public Testimony
The meeting also included discussions on procedural matters, amendments, and public testimony on each proposed constitutional amendment. The committee carefully considered the implications of each proposal, including their impact on legislative diversity, judicial accountability, voter choice, and the integrity of New Hampshire’s political processes.

In summary, the meeting highlighted a range of debates on how to modernize and improve New Hampshire’s legislative and judicial systems while preserving the state’s unique political traditions. The discussions reflected a balance between enhancing accountability, increasing representation, and maintaining the integrity of the state’s governance structures.
