The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 20, 2022, featured extensive discussions on a range of educational policies, bills, and programs. The debates highlighted ongoing tensions between state oversight, local control, parental involvement, and the need for flexibility in education, particularly in the context of alternative learning programs, curriculum transparency, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **1. Learn Everywhere Program and Competency-Based Education**
The **Learn Everywhere Program** was a central focus, with discussions centered on its role in providing students with alternative learning opportunities outside traditional classrooms. The program allows students to earn high school credits through third-party providers, such as the New Hampshire Academy of Science and the Seacoast Science Center, which are rigorously vetted by the Department of Education and the State Board of Education. Supporters, including Drew Klein, Chairman of the State Board of Education, emphasized the program’s alignment with New Hampshire’s **competency-based education system**, where students demonstrate mastery of skills rather than earning credits through seat time. Critics raised concerns about **local control**, arguing that school districts should have the authority to approve or reject credits from alternative programs. The debate underscored the need to balance statewide consistency with local autonomy, ensuring equitable access to educational opportunities while maintaining rigorous standards.

### **2. Curriculum Transparency and Parental Involvement**
Several bills addressed **curriculum transparency** and **parental involvement** in education. **House Bill 1015** sought to expand existing laws by requiring schools to provide parents with **two weeks’ notice** of all curriculum materials, not just those related to human sexuality education. While supporters argued this would empower parents and ensure transparency, critics, including educators and advocacy groups, raised concerns about the **practicality** and **workload burden** on teachers. They noted that spontaneous lessons, such as those based on current events or guest speakers, would be difficult to plan with such advance notice. Additionally, the bill’s vague definition of "objectionable" material was criticized for potentially leading to conflicts and restricting teachers’ flexibility. The discussion highlighted the need to balance **parental rights** with **educational flexibility**.

### **3. Remote Learning and Local Control During COVID-19**
The impact of **remote learning** during the COVID-19 pandemic was a recurring theme. **House Bill 1113**, sponsored by Representative Marjorie Porter, aimed to give school districts the flexibility to decide on remote or hybrid learning during emergencies, such as staff shortages or outbreaks. Supporters, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association, argued that **local control** was essential for addressing immediate challenges. However, opponents, including Drew Klein, emphasized the **negative academic and psychological impacts** of remote learning, particularly on vulnerable students. The Department of Education’s proposed rule, which mandates that schools remain open to meet the 180-day requirement, was criticized for removing local flexibility. The debate underscored the tension between **public health**, **educational quality**, and **parental choice**.

### **4. Divisive Concepts and Historical Education**
**House Bill 1255**, which aimed to regulate the teaching of certain historical topics, sparked significant debate. The bill sought to prevent teachers from **indoctrinating students** with specific political or social ideologies, particularly those presenting a negative account of U.S. history without global context. Supporters argued it was necessary to ensure balanced teaching, while opponents, including educators and organizations like the ACLU, criticized the bill for being **vague** and **overly broad**. They warned it could have a **chilling effect** on education, discouraging teachers from addressing sensitive but important topics like slavery, systemic racism, and the Civil Rights Movement. Testimonies emphasized the importance of teaching an **honest and robust history** to foster critical thinking and informed citizenship.

### **5. School Emergency Plans and Safety**
The committee also discussed **school emergency operation plans**, which are submitted to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education. Challenges included confusion over roles and responsibilities between the agencies, the lack of enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance, and the need for updated planning templates. Suggestions were made to clarify agency roles, provide outreach to schools, and adjust the submission deadline to improve compliance. Ensuring **school safety** and tying funding to compliance with emergency plan requirements were highlighted as priorities.

### **6. Educator Accountability and Misconduct**
Discussions on **educator accountability** focused on the **Code of Conduct** for credentialed educators, which includes disciplinary actions like reprimands, suspensions, and revocations. Concerns were raised about the lack of accountability for **non-credentialed educators** in charter schools, who are not subject to the same disciplinary measures. The debate highlighted the need for transparency and due process in handling educator misconduct, as well as the importance of codifying the Code of Conduct into law to ensure consistency and accountability.

### **7. Alternative Transportation and Volunteer Drivers**
A bill (**HB 1243**) regarding the use of **volunteer private vehicles** for student transportation was met with opposition from the Department of Safety, citing concerns about **safety**, **liability**, and the lack of training for volunteer drivers. The discussion emphasized the need to balance logistical challenges with student safety.
