The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held several meetings and committee sessions to discuss a range of bills aimed at improving election processes, enhancing voter access, and addressing campaign finance issues. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and bills:

### **Election Process and Voter Access Bills**

1. **HB 1542**:
   - This bill proposes checks and balances to ensure voters are adequately qualified, focusing on voter identification and provisional ballots. Critics argue it could lead to legal challenges, create unnecessary complications, and potentially disenfranchise voters.

2. **HB 1010**:
   - This bill seeks to include municipal voter history in the statewide centralized voter registration database, closing an unintentional loophole. The Secretary of State’s office supports the measure, emphasizing its role in maintaining accurate voter records.

3. **HB 1442**:
   - Introduced by Representative Manny Espithia, this bill aims to provide election instructions and ballots in up to three languages, based on the population of non-English speakers in a district. The goal is to improve access for non-English speakers, particularly in diverse communities like Nashua. Concerns were raised about the cost and practicality of translating ballots and the need for certified translators.

4. **HB 1496**:
   - This bill requires political subdivisions to make voter checklists available in spreadsheet form to any resident at no cost. Supporters argue it enhances transparency and voter integrity, while opponents raise concerns about privacy, potential misuse of data, and the financial impact on towns that currently generate revenue from checklist sales.

5. **HB 1383**:
   - This bill addresses issues with absentee voting processes, aiming to streamline access to absentee voter lists without overburdening clerks. Concerns were raised about miscounts, unsolicited absentee ballots, and signature verification lapses. The Secretary of State noted technical challenges with the current election database, which may delay implementation of the bill’s requirements.

### **Campaign Finance Bills**

1. **HB 1009**:
   - This bill proposes including the date of voter registration in the electronic checklist information available to approved parties. The intent is to provide a more complete picture of voters, though questions were raised about its necessity and potential implications.

2. **HB 1252**:
   - Introduced by Representative Love, this bill seeks to prohibit entities receiving taxpayer-funded grants from donating to PACs or state political campaigns. The goal is to prevent taxpayer money from influencing elections, though questions were raised about its application to federal pass-through funds and non-profits.

3. **HB 1326**:
   - Sponsored by Representative Reed, this bill addresses permissible campaign contributions by business organizations and labor unions, ensuring both can only donate from segregated funds, not general funds. The discussion included concerns about the definition of “business organization” and its application to non-profits.

4. **HB 1394**:
   - Introduced by Representative LeBranch, this bill aims to tighten campaign finance laws by requiring organizations to disclose their donors and close the LLC loophole that allows individuals to exceed donation limits. The bill seeks to increase transparency and limit the influence of dark money in elections.

5. **HB 1423**:
   - This bill proposes a voluntary public funding system for state elections in New Hampshire, establishing a voter-owned election fund. Candidates for governor and executive council could receive public funding if they meet specific criteria, such as collecting a minimum number of small donations from in-state voters. Supporters argue it reduces the influence of big money, increases voter engagement, and levels the playing field for candidates. Opponents raise concerns about costs, incumbent protection, and potential bureaucratic challenges.

### **Key Themes and Concerns**

Throughout the discussions, several recurring themes and concerns emerged:

- **Voter Access and Integrity**: Many bills aimed to improve voter access, particularly for non-English speakers and absentee voters, while others sought to enhance election integrity through transparency and accurate voter records.

- **Cost and Practicality**: Concerns about the financial and logistical implications of implementing new election processes, such as translating ballots and maintaining updated voter databases, were frequently raised.

- **Campaign Finance Transparency**: Efforts to increase transparency and reduce the influence of big money in politics were central to several bills, though questions about their effectiveness and potential unintended consequences were noted.

- **Technical Challenges**: The state’s election system faces technical hurdles, particularly with its database, which could delay the implementation of certain measures, such as timely access to absentee voter lists.

### **Conclusion**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives is actively working on a range of bills to improve election processes, enhance voter access, and address campaign finance issues. While many of these proposals aim to create a more transparent and inclusive electoral system, concerns about costs, practicality, and potential unintended consequences remain central to the ongoing discussions. The committee members’ detailed questions and the public testimony highlight the complexity of balancing these goals with the practical realities of election administration.
