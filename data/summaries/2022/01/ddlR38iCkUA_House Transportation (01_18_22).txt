The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting covered a range of bills primarily focused on transportation, driver education, and vehicle regulations. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

---

### **House Bill 1100**  
The bill proposes reducing the penalty for driving without a license from a misdemeanor to a violation. Advocates argue that the current misdemeanor charge disproportionately affects low-income individuals, immigrants, and young drivers, creating barriers to employment, education, and immigration status. Supporters, including immigrant rights organizations, emphasized that reverting to a violation would reduce unnecessary criminalization. The bill received broad support, with calls for clarity on its broader implications.

### **House Bill 1615**  
This bill addresses the **Driver Education and Driver Training Fund**, which has been diverted to the general fund and the state’s detective bureau since 2011. Testimony highlighted that this diversion has left public schools unable to subsidize driver training, forcing students to pay $400–$700 for private programs. Supporters argued that restoring funding would improve road safety and accessibility. However, concerns were raised about the bill’s impact on the state police’s investigative services bureau, which would lose $1.5 million in funding, potentially leading to layoffs and reduced capacity for critical investigations. The committee voted 14-0 to refer the bill to **interim study** for further examination.

### **House Bill 1208**  
This bill would allow parents to teach their children driver’s education instead of requiring commercial driving school attendance. Proponents argued it would reduce costs, increase accessibility, and provide flexibility for families, especially in rural areas. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Driver Education Teachers Association and AAA Northern New England, raised safety concerns, citing studies showing that parent-taught drivers are more likely to be involved in accidents. The State Police also expressed concerns about administrative burdens and inconsistent education quality. The committee heard extensive testimony, with safety, accessibility, and financial considerations at the forefront of the debate.

### **House Bill 1640**  
The bill proposed allowing individuals to donate motor vehicle fines to charitable organizations instead of paying the state. Multiple state agencies, including the Department of Transportation, Judicial Branch, and DMV, opposed the bill due to significant revenue losses and administrative challenges. The committee voted 13-0 to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** the bill.

---

### **House Bill 1658**  
This bill would allow individuals to retake the written driver’s license test instead of paying the renewal fee, aimed at helping those facing financial hardship. While Representative Abramson, the sponsor, argued it would promote road safety, the DMV opposed the bill due to fiscal impacts and administrative burdens. The committee voted unanimously to recommend **interim study**.

### **House Bill 1462**  
The bill proposed a one-time 45-day extension for motorcycle learner’s permits to provide more time for practice and testing. Representative Yakovovic, the sponsor, explained it addresses issues with permit expiration due to weather or scheduling conflicts. The DMV noted the fiscal impact of reprogramming systems to accommodate the change. The committee voted 13-0 to recommend **passing** the bill.

### **House Bill 1464**  
Representative Donovan Fenton introduced a bill to study the feasibility of increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in New Hampshire. Concerns were raised about the state receiving fewer EVs compared to neighboring states due to lack of incentives. The bill aims to explore ways to promote EV adoption without mandates.

### **House Bill 1110**  
Representative Tom Walsh proposed adjusting the light transmittance allowance for windshield tinting to match the 70% standard already in place for side windows. The bill passed unanimously (13-0) as a housekeeping measure to correct an oversight from previous legislation.

### **House Bill 1489**  
The committee voted 14-0 to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** the bill, effectively recommending it not move forward. No discussion was recorded.
