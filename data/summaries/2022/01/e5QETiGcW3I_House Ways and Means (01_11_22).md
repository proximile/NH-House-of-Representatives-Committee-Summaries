**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (01/11/22)**  

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on January 11, 2022, to discuss several bills addressing funding mechanisms, public policy, and state responsibilities. The meeting focused on leveraging federal funds, addressing workforce shortages, and ensuring the state’s obligations to its citizens. Below is a summary of the key bills and discussions:  

### **Key Bills and Discussions**  

1. **House Bill 1189: Voluntary Donations for Public Projects**  
   - This bill proposes allowing voluntary donations to municipalities or the state to fund projects or reduce taxation. Donors could receive recognition, such as plaques or signs, akin to sponsorships.  
   - The bill aims to encourage private funding for public initiatives, potentially reducing the tax burden. Concerns were raised about the tax deductibility of donations and the risk of corporate influence on public policy.  

2. **House Bill 1228: Repeal of Unused Dedicated Funds**  
   - The bill addresses recommendations from the Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds, proposing the repeal of several unused or outdated funds associated with various state agencies.  
   - The goal is to streamline state finances by retaining only necessary and active funds.  

3. **House Bill 1509: Termination of the FRM Victims Contribution Recovery Fund**  
   - This bill seeks to terminate the fund established to compensate victims of the FRM Ponzi scheme.  
   - Supporters argue the state has a moral obligation to assist victims due to regulatory failures, while opponents question the fund's necessity and the state's liability.  

4. **House Bill 1524: National Service Alumni Attraction and Retention Fund**  
   - The bill proposes using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to create scholarships and bonuses for AmeriCorps alumni and returned Peace Corps volunteers.  
   - The goal is to attract and retain skilled individuals in New Hampshire to address workforce shortages, leveraging federal funds without additional cost to state taxpayers.  

5. **House Bill 1525: County Nursing Home Capital Reserve Fund**  
   - This bill aims to establish a state-funded reserve to assist counties with the high costs of renovating or constructing nursing homes. The fund would be seeded with $25 million from ARPA funds, with annual appropriations of $15 million thereafter.  
   - Discussions highlighted the financial challenges faced by counties like Sullivan County, which is managing a $50 million renovation project for its 90-year-old facility.  
   - The bill includes a $30 million cap, with allocations based on the percentage of long-term care beds in each county. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of efforts, as some counties have already used ARPA funds for renovations.  

6. **House Bill 1565: Opioid Abatement Trust Fund Allocation**  
   - This bill proposes revising the allocation formula for opioid settlement funds, increasing the share for the 23 political subdivisions (10 counties and 13 municipalities) that joined the national opioid litigation.  
   - The current formula deducts the population of participating municipalities from counties’ allocations, which the bill seeks to rectify by increasing the subdivisions’ share from 15% to approximately 53%.  
   - The Attorney General’s office opposed the bill, arguing that the subdivisions did not significantly contribute to the litigation and that funds should be distributed more equitably through the Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission.  
   - Representatives from counties and municipalities emphasized their frontline role in addressing the opioid crisis and the need for timely access to funds.  

### **Key Themes and Concerns**  
- **Leveraging Federal Funds**: Several bills, including HB 1524 and HB 1525, proposed using ARPA funds to address workforce shortages and nursing home infrastructure without additional state costs.  
- **State Responsibility**: Discussions on bills like HB 1509 and HB 1525 reflected debates over the state’s moral and financial obligations to its citizens, particularly victims of fraud and elderly residents in need of quality care.  
- **Fairness and Equity**: The allocation of funds, whether for opioid abatement or nursing home renovations, sparked debates about fairness, with stakeholders advocating for equitable distribution based on need and contribution.  
- **Long-Term Sustainability**: Representatives raised questions about the sustainability of proposed programs, particularly those reliant on federal funds, and their potential impact on taxpayers.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on addressing critical state needs through innovative funding mechanisms while balancing fiscal responsibility and equity. The discussions highlighted the complexities of allocating resources in a way that maximizes impact while addressing the diverse needs of New Hampshire’s communities.
