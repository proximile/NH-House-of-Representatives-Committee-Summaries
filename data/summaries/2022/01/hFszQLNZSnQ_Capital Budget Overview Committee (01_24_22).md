The New Hampshire House of Representatives Capital Budget Overview Committee met on January 24, 2022, to discuss several capital budget-related items. The meeting began with the acceptance of the minutes from the November 9, 2021, meeting. The committee then addressed two main action items:

1. **Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway and Ski Area Capital Improvement Project**: The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources requested approval for a $400,000 project to relocate track ropes and repair bollards for the aerial tramway. This work is required every 12 years by manufacturer code and the New Hampshire Tramway Safety Board. The committee approved the project unanimously after a brief explanation and no discussion.

2. **Transfer of Funds for Security Upgrades**: The Department of Administrative Services sought authorization to transfer $690,000 from a completed Health and Human Services security upgrade project to fund security upgrades in other state-owned buildings, including the installation of central air conditioning in the State House as a security measure. Some committee members expressed concerns about the lack of prior legislative approval for the air conditioning project and suggested referring it to the Facilities Committee for further review. However, the motion to table and refer the item failed for lack of a second, and the transfer was approved by a vote of 5-2.

The committee also reviewed informational items, including quarterly capital budget reports and updates on ongoing projects, such as roofing and boiler projects, which were delayed due to COVID-19 and staffing shortages. The next meeting was scheduled for March 28, 2022, at 10:15 AM, to avoid conflicts with the legislative crossover deadline. The meeting was adjourned after a relatively short session.
