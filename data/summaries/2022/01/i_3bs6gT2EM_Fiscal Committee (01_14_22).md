**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (01/14/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on January 14, 2022, to address critical financial, operational, and oversight matters. The meeting focused on several key areas, including the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC), vital records management, staffing challenges, financial oversight, and the state’s broader fiscal health. Here are the main points discussed:

### **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)**
1. **Staffing and Funding Challenges**:
   - The committee reviewed a request for funding to hire 18 temporary staff for SYSC, driven by severe staffing shortages worsened by COVID-19 and the increased acuity of youth needs. A contract with the staffing agency Maxim is pending approval.
   - SYSC faces difficulties in hiring permanent staff, leading to reliance on temporary workers to ensure safety and care for youth.
   - A budget shortfall of approximately $800,000 was discussed, resulting from reduced revenue from Vermont, which contracts with SYSC to place youth. The department plans to transfer funds to cover this gap.
   - The timeline for closing SYSC and transitioning to a new facility was addressed, with expectations that the closure will not occur before June 2023. Legal and budgetary challenges related to the transition were also highlighted.

2. **Transition to a Treatment-Focused Model**:
   - SYSC is shifting towards a more treatment-focused model for youth counselors, moving away from the use of parole officers. Training for temporary counselors in this new model has already begun, emphasizing clinically oriented mental health treatment.

### **Vital Records Management**
- The committee reviewed the process for accessing vital records data, stressing strict governance and compliance with HIPAA regulations.
- A late-filed bill was introduced to study the flow of birth information from hospitals to the Secretary of State.
- The historical transition of vital records from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to the Secretary of State’s office was discussed, along with ongoing collaboration between the two departments.

### **Financial Oversight and Budget Adjustments**
1. **Staffing Contract Request**:
   - The committee debated a request for over $100,000 to cover a staffing contract. Concerns were raised about why the funds were not included in the current budget, as the department was budgeted for 47 youth counselors but requested funds for 50. The issue was linked to declining revenue from a Vermont contract and unexpected payouts for retiring staff due to previous budget cuts.

2. **Credit Carryover Discussion**:
   - The committee addressed the recurring issue of credit carryover, which involves estimated tax payments made by businesses. While the state does not record this as a liability, the auditing firm KPMG believes it should be. The discussion highlighted implications for the state’s financial statements and the potential impact on the general fund surplus.

3. **IT Project Management**:
   - Concerns were raised about the management of IT projects, with calls for a comprehensive portfolio analysis to ensure responsible allocation of funds.

4. **COVID-19 Relief Funds**:
   - The committee discussed the management and reporting of funds received from the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). A motion was passed to require the Governor's Office of Emergency Relief and Recovery (GOFER) to provide a detailed report and presentation on the expenditure of these funds.

### **State Financial Health and Audit Report**
- KPMG presented the annual comprehensive financial report, noting that the state received an unmodified (clean) audit opinion. The report highlighted the state’s strong financial position, including a rainy day fund balance of $257.8 million.
- The state’s sizable rainy day fund was recognized as a positive factor for maintaining or potentially improving its bond rating.

### **Adjournment**
The meeting concluded with a unanimous motion to adjourn.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the challenges of staffing and funding SYSC, the importance of compliance and efficiency in vital records management, and the need for transparency and accountability in financial oversight. The state’s robust financial health, as evidenced by the clean audit and substantial rainy day fund, provides a solid foundation for addressing these challenges. However, ongoing issues such as the credit carryover and IT project management require continued attention to ensure fiscal responsibility.
