**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Meeting (01/26/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 26, 2022, to address a wide range of issues, including **mental health reimbursement parity**, **cigar bars and liquor sales**, **cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation**, **banking concerns**, and **anti-discrimination legislation**. The meeting highlighted the complexity of these topics and the need for careful consideration to balance regulatory oversight, business needs, and consumer protection.

### **1. Mental Health Reimbursement Parity**
The committee discussed the challenges of ensuring fair reimbursement rates for behavioral health providers under mental health parity laws.
- **Key Issues**: While New Hampshire’s RSA 417-E1 aligns behavioral health reimbursements with Medicare rates, compliance does not guarantee parity. Behavioral health providers, particularly solo practitioners, face low reimbursement rates and administrative burdens.
- **Proposals**: Some members advocated for legislative intervention to set specific reimbursement metrics, while others favored market-based solutions and regulatory oversight by the Insurance Department.
- **Human Impact**: The discussion emphasized the critical importance of access to behavioral health services, with one participant noting that “lives are at stake.”

### **2. Cigar Bars and Liquor Sales**
The committee examined the revenue split requirements for cigar bars, which must derive at least 60% of their revenue from cigar sales and no more than 40% from alcohol.
- **Background**: The 60/40 rule was established to ensure cigar bars remain cigar-focused, but some businesses struggle to meet this threshold due to declining cigar sales and competition from online retailers.
- **Debate**: Some representatives suggested adjusting the ratio to 55/45 or 50/50 to help struggling businesses, while others questioned the lack of empirical evidence to support such changes.
- **Proposals**: The committee considered amending the law to include all tobacco products (e.g., hookah, flavored tobacco) in the revenue calculation, reflecting evolving business models.

### **3. Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Regulation**
The committee discussed New Hampshire’s efforts to position itself as a leader in cryptocurrency innovation by adopting **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 12**, which provides a legal framework for digital assets and blockchain technology.
- **Key Points**:
  - New Hampshire aims to adopt UCC Article 12 to attract cryptocurrency-related industries and ensure regulatory clarity.
  - The New Hampshire Bankers Association supported the revised approach, which aligns with the UCC framework, while expressing concerns about maintaining interstate banking operations.
  - The Bureau of Securities Regulation proposed amendments to exempt blockchain tokens from securities registration, while still enforcing fraud protections.
  - The committee acknowledged the risk of federal preemption, particularly if the SEC classifies certain cryptocurrencies as securities.
- **Future Considerations**: The bill is a work in progress, with potential amendments needed as the UCC finalizes its language and federal regulations evolve.

### **4. Banking and Liquor Enforcement**
The committee addressed enforcement issues related to liquor licensing, particularly for cigar bars, and the fiscal impact of proposed banking regulations.
- **Liquor Enforcement**: Concerns were raised about cigar bars increasingly relying on alcohol sales, deviating from their intended purpose. The committee debated whether to include all tobacco products in the revenue calculation.
- **Banking Regulations**: **HB 1504**, which proposed creating a new division within the banking department, was likely to be killed due to its high fiscal note.

---

### **5. Anti-Discrimination Legislation**
The committee discussed a bill aimed at preventing discrimination by banks and businesses based on social credit scores, political views, and other non-financial criteria.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill was amended to remove penalties, as existing laws already address discriminatory practices.
  - Some members advocated for expanding the bill to include additional protected categories, such as race, gender, and sexual orientation.
  - Concerns were raised about the bill potentially favoring one political ideology over another.
- **PFAS Regulation**: The committee also considered a bill to prohibit the sale of products containing intentionally added PFAS, emphasizing the need for further study and potential labeling.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of the issues at hand, from ensuring mental health parity and regulating cigar bars to navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and anti-discrimination legislation. The committee emphasized the need for further data collection, amendments, and careful consideration before making legislative changes. New Hampshire’s proactive approach to innovation and regulatory clarity was a recurring theme, particularly in the context of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Future meetings were scheduled to finalize amendments and vote on proposed legislation.
