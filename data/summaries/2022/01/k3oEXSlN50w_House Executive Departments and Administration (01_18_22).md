The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 18, 2022, to discuss several bills related to professional licensing, public health, and administrative oversight. The meeting focused on four key pieces of legislation: **House Bill 1062**, **House Bill 1065**, **House Bill 1192**, **House Bill 1429**, and **House Bill 1444**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points raised during the meeting.

### **House Bill 1062: Electrology Advisory Committee Reforms**
This bill addresses the challenges faced by the **Electrology Advisory Committee**, which oversees the licensure and regulation of electrologists. Key issues include quorum problems and low meeting attendance. The bill proposes:
- Eliminating the requirement for committee members to administer exams, allowing the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** to contract out exam services.
- Concerns were raised about the lack of communication with the advisory committee regarding the bill, as well as broader issues with board functionality and fee-setting authority.

### **House Bill 1065: Licensing for Art Therapists**
This bill seeks to establish licensing for **art therapists**, a profession currently protected by title but not licensed in New Hampshire. Key points include:
- Licensing would enable art therapists to receive insurance reimbursement.
- The OPLC advocated for centralized fee-setting to avoid disproportionate costs across boards, ensuring consistency and fairness in the licensing process.

### **House Bill 1192: Acupuncture Licensing and Practice Regulations**
This bill revisits changes to acupuncture licensure, aiming to reduce barriers for practitioners. Key discussions included:
- **Testimony from Licensed Acupuncturists**: Elizabeth Rob and Laura Cooley supported the bill, criticizing the **National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)** for its high costs, anti-competitive practices, and limited pathways to licensure.
- **Supervision of Acupuncture Detoxification Specialists (ADS)**: The bill proposes reducing supervision requirements for ADS practitioners, who are trained in ear acupuncture for substance use disorder treatment. This would improve access to care, particularly during the opioid epidemic.
- **Term Limits for Board Members**: The bill introduces term limits for acupuncture licensing board members, aligning with other state licensing boards.
- **Amendments**: The OPLC suggested amendments to eliminate statutory fees and reduce discretionary authority for the licensing board, aiming to lower barriers for practitioners.

This bill proposes licensing **massage establishments** to enhance regulation and oversight. Key points include:
- **Public Health and Safety**: The bill aims to address unlicensed activities, sanitation concerns, and potential human trafficking in massage establishments.
- **Enforcement**: The OPLC would conduct proactive, unannounced inspections to ensure compliance with health and safety standards.
- **Local Challenges**: Testimony from Derry officials highlighted difficulties in regulating massage establishments without state support, including rapid turnover of businesses and unlicensed operators.
- **Sole Proprietor Exception**: A clause requiring sole proprietors to obtain a license if they offer services without prior appointments was questioned, with requests for further clarification.

### **House Bill 1444: Regulation of Medical Spas**
This bill proposes regulations for **medical spas (med spas)**, which offer cosmetic and medical procedures like Botox and laser treatments. Key discussions included:
- **Support for the Bill**: Proponents, including the **Board of Medicine**, **Board of Nursing**, and **Board of Pharmacy**, argued that med spas require proper oversight to ensure patient safety. Proactive inspections were emphasized as a way to prevent harm before it occurs.
- **Opposition to the Bill**: Med spa providers argued that existing medical boards already regulate the industry and that additional oversight would be redundant and costly. Concerns were raised about the economic impact on small businesses recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Key Issues**: Debates centered on malpractice insurance, inspection processes, and the definition of medical spas. Proponents indicated they would seek amendments to address these concerns.
