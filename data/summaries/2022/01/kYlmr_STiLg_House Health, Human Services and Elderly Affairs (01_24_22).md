The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on **January 24, 2022**, focused on a wide range of issues related to health, human services, and elderly affairs. The discussions centered on several key bills and topics, reflecting the state’s ongoing efforts to address public health, mental health, workforce shortages, and individual rights. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Hospital Visitation Rights (House Bill 1439)**
The meeting opened with discussions on **House Bill 1439**, which seeks to ensure that hospitals and healthcare facilities cannot restrict visitors during public health emergencies unless explicitly required by federal law. The bill was inspired by personal stories of patients dying alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to balance public health safety with the emotional and psychological needs of patients and families, particularly in critical or end-of-life care.
- **Concerns**: Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Hospital Association, raised concerns about the bill’s language and its potential impact on public health protocols. Amendments were proposed to clarify terms like "medically contraindicated" and ensure flexibility for healthcare facilities.
- **Study Committee**: A subcommittee was formed to refine the bill, with a focus on aligning it with federal guidelines while protecting patient and family rights.

### **Embalming Requirements (House Bill 1320)**
Another significant discussion centered on **House Bill 1320**, which proposes the repeal of **RSA 325:40-a**, a law requiring embalming for bodies displayed to the public for more than 24 hours. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to restore consumer choice, allowing families to opt for alternatives like refrigeration or green burials. Proponents argued that embalming is a cosmetic procedure, not a public health necessity.
- **Support**: Advocates, including Representative Jerry Knirk and Anya Nickel, a high school senior, emphasized the environmental, financial, and religious benefits of natural burials. They highlighted that the current law is often misinterpreted, leading to unnecessary costs for families.
- **Opposition**: Funeral directors argued that embalming is essential for preserving bodies during viewings, especially after autopsies or organ donations. They expressed concerns about the psychological impact of viewing unembalmed bodies.
- **Conclusion**: The bill seeks to align New Hampshire with most other states, providing clearer consumer choice while allowing funeral homes to set their own policies.

### **Immunization Registry and Privacy (House Bill 1608)**
The meeting also addressed **House Bill 1608**, which requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to contact individuals whose COVID-19 vaccination data was collected under Emergency Order 76, allowing them to decide whether their data should be retained or deleted. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to address privacy concerns by ensuring individuals are informed and can consent to their data being retained in the state immunization registry.
- **Opposition from DHHS**: DHHS argued that the registry is crucial for public health and vaccine tracking. Implementing the bill would be costly and logistically challenging, with an estimated cost of $6.2 million to contact approximately 790,000 individuals.
- **Amendment Proposal**: Representative Neil Kirk proposed an amendment to erase personally identifiable information while retaining vaccination data for public health purposes, balancing privacy and public health needs.

### **Mental Health Crisis and Services**
Several discussions focused on addressing New Hampshire’s mental health crisis, with proposed legislation aimed at improving access to care and expanding services. Key points included:
- **Mental Health Drop-In Centers (House Bill 1537)**: A pilot program was proposed to establish community-based drop-in centers providing immediate access to mental health resources, reducing the need for emergency room visits. The program would be funded through ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funds.
- **Telehealth and Licensing (House Bill 1405)**: The bill would allow out-of-state mental health providers to offer telehealth services to New Hampshire residents during a mental health emergency, addressing the state’s shortage of mental health professionals. Concerns were raised about the bill’s language, particularly the arbitrary limit of five patients for unlicensed providers.
- **Peer Support Services**: Representatives emphasized the importance of peer support services in mental health care and the need for expansion, particularly for youth.

### **Healthcare Workforce and Licensing**
The meeting also addressed workforce shortages and licensing challenges in the healthcare sector. Key points included:
- **Emergency Licenses**: Discussions focused on extending emergency licenses for healthcare providers, including mental health professionals, to address workforce shortages exacerbated by the pandemic.
- **Background Checks (House Bill 1659)**: The bill aims to expedite the hiring process for healthcare workers by allowing third-party vendors to conduct federal background checks, in addition to state checks. Concerns were raised about the credibility and thoroughness of third-party vendors.
- **Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs)**: Delays in licensing for LNAs were highlighted as a barrier to employment, with calls for expedited processes to address workforce shortages.

### **Other Key Discussions**
- **Service Animals for Diabetes**: A bill was discussed to include diabetes as a condition eligible for service animal assistance, emphasizing the benefits of service animals in detecting low blood sugar levels.
- **Child Care Investigatory Findings**: A bill requiring timely publication of child care investigatory findings was discussed, but unresolved issues delayed its progress.
- **Language Translation for Telehealth**: Amendments were proposed to ensure that facilities providing language translation services for in-person care also do so for telehealth services.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing public health, individual rights, and workforce challenges in New Hampshire. Key themes included the need for clear legislation, collaboration between state agencies, and innovative solutions to address mental health, workforce shortages, and privacy concerns. The discussions underscored the importance of compassionate, patient-centered policies in healthcare and funeral services, as well as the urgency of addressing the state’s mental health crisis.
