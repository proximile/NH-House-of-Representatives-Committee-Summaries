The January 27, 2022, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Consumer Affairs centered on several bills aimed at streamlining regulations, reducing barriers for small businesses, and supporting local agriculture and commerce. The discussions highlighted the challenges faced by food trucks, farmers, liquor stores, and small food vendors, while balancing concerns about public health, local control, and enforcement. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

---

### **Food Truck Licensing and Regulations**
**House Bill 1595** was the focal point of discussions regarding food truck licensing. Currently, food truck operators in New Hampshire face a fragmented system, requiring both a state license and separate permits for each of the 15 self-inspecting municipalities (e.g., Manchester, Concord, Nashua). This patchwork of regulations creates significant barriers for entrepreneurs operating across multiple towns and cities.

- **Proposed Solution**: HB 1595 seeks to create a **statewide food truck license**, eliminating the need for individual municipal licenses. This would streamline the process, reduce red tape, and make it easier for food trucks to operate across the state.
- **Support**: Food truck operators like Olivia Lennox testified in favor of the bill, highlighting the challenges of navigating different municipal requirements. Advocates argued that the bill would lower costs, increase competition, and make food trucks more accessible to consumers.
- **Concerns**: Representatives raised questions about the potential loss of local control in self-inspecting municipalities, the financial implications of the bill (e.g., whether the $225 license fee would cover additional state inspections), and the handling of temporary events and private property operations.
- **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to address concerns from self-inspecting municipalities, ensuring they retain some authority over inspections while reducing redundancy for vendors.

Additionally, **House Bill 1095** addressed regulations for hot dog push carts, allowing vendors to offer condiments like sauerkraut and chili. Currently, push carts are restricted to pre-packaged foods due to health concerns, and the bill seeks to make regulations more reasonable for small vendors while maintaining food safety standards.

### **Supporting Local Farms and Value-Added Products**
**House Bill 1613** aimed to support New Hampshire farmers by lowering barriers to selling value-added products, such as distilled spirits, directly from their farms. The bill proposed a **limited farmer's liquor manufacturing license**, allowing farmers to produce and sell up to 1,000 cases of distilled spirits annually, made from New Hampshire-grown products.

- **Economic Benefits**: Proponents argued that the bill would increase farm profitability, boost local tourism, and create new revenue streams for small farms.
- **Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the enforceability of a **65% local ingredient requirement** and the practicality of the proposed licensing structure. The NH Liquor Commission suggested a tiered licensing system (similar to beer and wine manufacturing) rather than creating a separate farm-specific license.
- **Testimonies**: Farmers and small business owners supported the bill, emphasizing its potential to diversify income and attract visitors to farms.

### **Modernizing Liquor Store Operations**
**House Bill 1583** sought to make state liquor stores more profitable by removing certain restrictions:
- **Opening on Easter**: The bill would allow liquor stores to remain open on Easter, which is currently a mandatory closure day (stores would still close on Thanksgiving and Christmas).
- **Location Flexibility**: It would eliminate the prohibition on locating liquor stores within **200 feet of churches**, chapels, or parish houses, giving the Liquor Commission more flexibility in choosing store locations.
- **Discussion**: Representative Timothy Hogan, the bill’s sponsor, argued that the current restrictions are unnecessary and potentially unconstitutional. Concerns were raised about employee rights, particularly regarding working on religious holidays, and the rationale behind the 200-foot rule.

### **Simplifying Point-of-Sale Systems**
**House Bill 1556** addressed the requirement for **separate point-of-sale (POS) systems** for businesses like brewpubs and convenience stores that sell both food and alcohol. Currently, businesses must use separate POS systems for on-premise and off-premise alcohol sales, which is seen as outdated and burdensome, especially during labor shortages.

- **Proposed Solution**: The bill would allow modern POS systems to handle different tax rates for on-premise and off-premise sales, eliminating the need for separate systems.
- **Support**: Brewery owners and convenience store operators testified in favor of the bill, emphasizing its potential to reduce inefficiencies and improve customer experience.

### **Food Safety Regulations for Small Businesses**
The meeting also addressed broader food safety regulations, particularly for small businesses like hot dog vendors and food trucks. Key points included:
- **Condiment Preparation**: Representatives debated inconsistencies in rules for serving condiments like onions and sauerkraut, with vendors restricted from preparing certain foods unless they have a restaurant license.
- **Commissary Kitchens**: The need for food vendors to partner with commissary kitchens for food preparation and cleanup was emphasized as a way to ensure food safety without requiring full commercial kitchens.
- **Study Bill**: Representative Judy Aron introduced **House Bill 1043**, a study bill to examine state and local food safety regulations, their impact on small businesses, and potential simplifications. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) supported the bill, acknowledging the complexity of regulations and the need to streamline them.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Streamlining Regulations**: Many bills aimed to reduce bureaucratic hurdles for small businesses, including food trucks, farmers, and liquor stores, by modernizing outdated rules and eliminating redundant requirements.
2. **Supporting Local Economies**: Proponents emphasized the economic benefits of supporting local farms, food trucks, and small businesses, which contribute to job creation, tourism, and community vitality.
3. **Balancing Local Control and State Oversight**: Concerns were raised about the potential loss of local control, particularly in self-inspecting municipalities, and the need to balance state-level oversight with local autonomy.
4. **Public Health and Safety**: Throughout the discussions, maintaining food safety and public health standards remained a priority, with proposals to streamline regulations without compromising safety.
