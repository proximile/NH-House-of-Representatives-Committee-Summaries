The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on January 13, 2022, covered a wide range of legislative issues, focusing on judicial efficiency, transparency, and individual rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **1. Probate and Estate Reforms**
- **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution (CACR) 21**: Proposed the elimination of the **Register of Probate**, an obsolete position since court reorganization in 2011. Testimonies from Representative Norman Silber and Judge David King highlighted the role’s historical irrelevance and minimal financial impact (current registers are paid $100 annually). Concerns about record preservation were addressed, and the hearing concluded without further testimony.
- **House Bill 1140 (HB 1140)**: Introduced a simplified probate procedure for small estates (under $25,000), modeled after laws in states like Rhode Island. While the bill aimed to reduce costs and streamline asset distribution, concerns were raised about creditor notification, estate valuation accuracy, and potential family disputes. The Judicial Branch noted that additional resources would be needed if the bill passed.

### **2. Judicial Efficiency and Specialized Dockets**
- **House Bill 1389**: Proposed the creation of a **Land Use Docket** to expedite land use cases, which currently face delays of 1.5 to 3 years. Supporters argued that a specialized judge would improve efficiency and consistency in rulings. However, the bill would require significant funding, including the appointment of a new judge.
- **House Bill 1592**: Allowed parties in family court proceedings to record their own hearings as a backup to official records. Testimonies highlighted issues with missing or altered court records, particularly in cases involving former judge Julian Tricasso, who was removed for misconduct. Opponents, including Richard Head of the Judicial Branch, raised privacy concerns and suggested addressing the issue through the court’s rule-making process rather than legislation.

### **3. Guardianship Reforms**
- **House Bill 1325**: Aimed to ensure that individuals under guardianship retain access to their confidential records, including medical records. Testimonies revealed that wards often lose access to their records without clear justification. Attorney Tasker advocated for revising guardianship laws to make them less restrictive and more respectful of the ward’s rights.
- **Guardianship Concerns**: Discussions highlighted the broad authority granted to guardians, often without specific court findings. Representative Chase inquired whether issues were more prevalent with state-appointed guardians versus family guardians, but Tasker clarified that the problems apply to all types of guardians.

### **4. Transparency and Attorney-Client Privilege**
- **House Bill 1073 (HB 1073)**: Proposed repealing an exemption in the **Right-to-Know Law** that protects attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine. Proponents, including Representative Welper and Lori Ortolano of Right to Know NH, argued that the exemption undermines government transparency and has been abused to withhold public records. Opponents, including the Department of Justice and the NH Municipal Association, emphasized the importance of confidentiality in providing effective legal advice to government entities. The debate highlighted the tension between transparency and the need for candid legal counsel.

### **5. Public Health and Environmental Concerns**
- **House Bill 1042**: Required health advisory notices for renters of vacation or recreational properties near water bodies affected by **cyanobacteria blooms**. Representative Rosemarie Rung explained that these blooms, caused by warmer temperatures and nutrient runoff, pose serious health risks and economic impacts. The bill aimed to inform renters of potential risks by directing them to a NH DES website.

---

### **6. Other Legislative Measures**
- **House Bill 1206**: Ensured that costs for appointing counsel and investigative services for DNA testing are paid by the Judicial Council rather than the judicial branch. This was a cleanup measure following House Bill 270, which expanded post-conviction DNA testing rights.
- **House Bill 1086**: Addressed the concealment of a cause of action by resetting the statute of limitations if fraudulent concealment is discovered later. The bill was modeled after Massachusetts’ statute and aimed to provide justice to fraud victims.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
- **Judicial Efficiency**: Proposals like the Land Use Docket and simplified probate procedures aimed to reduce delays and streamline court processes, but raised concerns about funding and resource allocation.
- **Transparency vs. Confidentiality**: Debates around attorney-client privilege and court recording highlighted the need to balance government accountability with the protection of sensitive legal advice.
- **Individual Rights**: Guardianship reforms and probate changes emphasized the importance of preserving individuals’ access to their records and ensuring fair processes in legal proceedings.
- **Public Health**: The discussion on cyanobacteria blooms addressed both health risks and economic impacts, proposing solutions to inform and protect the public.

The committee concluded hearings on several bills, with further deliberations and potential amendments expected in subsequent sessions.
