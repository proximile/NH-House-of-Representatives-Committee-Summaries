The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 11, 2022, addressed several key bills and issues related to children and family law, focusing on legal age, juvenile justice, mental health care, child support, and shared parenting.

### Key Bills and Discussions:

1. **HB 1568: Legal Age and Developmental Maturity**  
   - This bill proposes raising the legal age for certain decisions to 21, recognizing that while intellectual maturity may be reached by age 16, social, emotional, and executive function maturity continues to develop into the mid-20s.  
   - The discussion emphasized aligning legal frameworks with developmental science to better address the needs of young adults.  

2. **HB 1531: Oversight Commission on Children’s Services**  
   - The bill seeks to update the duties, scope, and membership of the oversight commission within the Office of the Child Advocate to reflect systemic reforms in children’s services.  
   - Key points included the need for clear roles, diverse stakeholder representation, and effective collaboration to improve outcomes for children.  

3. **HB 1465: Juvenile Justice and Legal Representation**  
   - This bill clarifies language in RSA 169b regarding the appointment of counsel for juveniles, presuming indigency and ensuring continuous legal representation throughout court proceedings.  
   - Supporters, including Representative Pat Long and advocates from the Disability Rights Center and NH Legal Assistance, stressed the importance of fair legal protections for juveniles.  
   - Opponents, such as Representative Jess Edwards and the Judicial Branch, raised concerns about unintended consequences and implementation challenges, including the burden on the court system.  

4. **Mental Health Care and Parental Notification**  
   - Testimonies highlighted the challenges children face in accessing mental health care, particularly in cases of divorce or separation where parental consent is required.  
   - The need for timely parental notification in mental health crises and addressing court backlogs to prioritize children’s well-being was emphasized.  

5. **Child Support Payment Enforcement**  
   - Discussions focused on the lack of enforcement of child support payment due dates, leading to significant arrears and financial hardships.  
   - Suggestions included adding explicit due dates to child support orders and lowering enforcement thresholds to ensure timely payments.  

6. **HB 1382: Shared Parenting Presumption**  
   - This bill proposes a presumption of 50-50 shared parenting unless there is clear and convincing evidence of harm to the child.  
   - Advocates argued that shared parenting reduces litigation, false abuse allegations, and parental conflict, benefiting children’s emotional and psychological well-being.  
   - Testimonies highlighted systemic issues in the family court system, including biased guardian ad litem (GAL) recommendations, prolonged litigation, and failures to enforce custody agreements.  
   - Personal stories underscored the emotional harm caused to children when one parent is unjustly excluded from their lives.  

### Key Themes and Concerns:  
- **Developmental Science and Legal Frameworks**: The need to align laws with the developmental stages of young adults and children.  
- **Juvenile Justice Reform**: Balancing the need for fair legal representation with practical implementation challenges.  
- **Mental Health Access**: Ensuring timely access to mental health care for children, particularly in cases of parental disputes.  
- **Child Support Enforcement**: Addressing systemic failures in enforcing child support payments to reduce financial hardships.  
- **Shared Parenting**: Promoting shared parenting as the default in custody cases to protect children’s rights and well-being.  
- **Judicial Discretion and Accountability**: Reducing inconsistent rulings and ensuring fairness in family court proceedings.  

### Suggestions for Further Action:  
- Establishing study committees to explore raising the age of delinquency and incremental juvenile justice reforms.  
- Clarifying due dates on child support orders and lowering enforcement thresholds.  
- Limiting judicial discretion in custody cases to ensure consistency and fairness.  
- Updating outdated statutes to reflect modern family dynamics and prioritize children’s best interests.

By aligning laws with developmental science, improving legal protections for juveniles, ensuring timely access to mental health care, enforcing child support payments, and promoting shared parenting, New Hampshire can better protect the well-being of its children and families. The testimonies highlighted the emotional and financial toll of prolonged legal battles and the need for a more equitable and efficient family court system.
