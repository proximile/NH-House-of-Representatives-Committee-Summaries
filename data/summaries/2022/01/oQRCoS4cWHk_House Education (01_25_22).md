The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 25, 2022, focused on discussing and voting on several bills related to education. Key highlights include:

1. **HB 60FN - School Lunches and Meals for Students Fund**: Representative Timothy Horrigan introduced this bill, which requires all schools to provide breakfast and lunch and reduces co-pays for reduced-price meals to zero for approximately 9,000 students. The bill is designed to be effective until July 1, 2025, with the hope of revisiting the issue in 2024 for a more permanent solution. The bill aims to utilize federal stimulus and pandemic relief funds, with the possibility of state or private funding.

2. **HB 1311 - Prohibiting Employment and Credentialing for Certain Offenses**: This bill, amended to include additional offenses (possession of controlled substances with intent to sell and felony assault), passed with a unanimous vote. It prevents individuals convicted of these offenses from being employed in public schools or granted teaching credentials.

3. **HB 1234 - Criminal Background Checks for Teaching Credentials**: This bill, which adds human trafficking to the list of offenses that disqualify individuals from receiving teaching credentials, also passed unanimously.

4. **HB 1125 - School Emergency Plans**: This bill, amended to ensure that the Department of Education has access to school emergency plans sent to Homeland Security, passed unanimously. The amendment aims to improve collaboration between the DOE and Homeland Security.

5. **HB 1632 - Civil Rights Education**: This bill, which proposes teaching civil rights education in public schools, was sent to interim study with a vote of 10 to 9. Some committee members argued that curriculum decisions should remain at the local level.

6. **Other Bills**: Several other bills were discussed and voted on, including HB 1574 (prohibiting out-of-state tuition for students voting in NH, ITL), HB 1648 (peer support groups for mental health, ITL), HB 1685 (school facility planning, ITL), HB 1676 (incentive grants for school districts, interim study), HB 1561 (school nutrition standards, ITL), HB 1630 (philosophy course requirement, interim study), HB 1243 (alternative transportation, ITL), HB 1058 (time for students to eat lunch, ITL), HB 1144 (labor history education, ITL), and HB 1627 (Education Freedom Account program administrator, OTP).

The committee emphasized the importance of local control over curriculum and scheduling decisions and expressed concerns about overburdening schools with additional mandates. The meeting concluded with plans to continue addressing remaining bills in subsequent sessions.
