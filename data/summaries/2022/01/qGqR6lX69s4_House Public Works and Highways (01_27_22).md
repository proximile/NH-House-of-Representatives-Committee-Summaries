The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on January 27, 2022, addressed a wide range of transportation-related topics, focusing on funding challenges, infrastructure projects, and policy decisions. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### Transportation Funding and Federal Match Challenges
1. **Federal Funds and Toll Credits**: The committee explored the complexities of using federal funds and toll credits for transportation projects. Toll credits, which cannot be used directly for local match requirements within New Hampshire, can be sold to other states for cash. However, declining turnpike revenues have reduced the state’s toll credit balances. The committee discussed establishing a marketplace to sell toll credits, generating revenue for transportation projects.
2. **Municipal Match Requirements**: Municipalities, such as Keene, face challenges in providing the required 20% match for federally funded projects. The committee considered policy decisions to support municipalities using toll credits, though this remains unresolved.
3. **Transit Funding**: Transit agencies struggle to secure the required match for federal funds, especially with increased funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The state provides limited assistance for operating matches, leaving agencies to find the majority of the funding.

### Infrastructure Projects and Policy Discussions
1. **Capital Corridor Rail Project**: The Capital Corridor project, extending commuter rail service from Lowell, Massachusetts, to Manchester, New Hampshire, is in the project development phase. The committee discussed funding options, including federal grants, private sector support, and development around stations, emphasizing the need for a clear financial plan.
2. **Exit Numbering and Federal Compliance**: The committee debated renumbering highway exits to comply with federal guidelines but leaned against it unless mandated by the federal government. Funds allocated for renumbering could be redirected to other projects.
3. **Sound Walls**: Significant discussion focused on sound walls, particularly along I-95 in Portsmouth. The committee reviewed criteria for constructing sound walls, noting the lack of funding for standalone walls (Type 2) and concerns about equity and maintenance. Alternatives like murals and plantings were considered.
4. **Hudson Circumferential Highway**: Representatives from Hudson advocated for reinstating the Hudson Circumferential Highway into the 10-year transportation plan. The project’s high cost and funding challenges were discussed, including the potential use of federal discretionary grants.
5. **Concord Widening Project**: Delays in the Concord widening project, caused by COVID-19 revenue impacts, were addressed. The committee explored accelerating the project using federal funds but noted additional regulatory requirements could complicate matters.

### Legislative Bills and Funding Alternatives
1. **House Bill 1656: Road Usage Registration Fee**: This bill proposed a fee based on vehicle weight and annual miles driven to address declining fuel tax revenues. Concerns about legality, equity, and potential impacts on out-of-state drivers led the committee to recommend the bill as inexpedient to legislate (ITL), suggesting further study.
2. **House Bill 1040: Commission to Study Revenue Alternatives**: The committee amended this bill to broaden its scope beyond electric vehicles, focusing on all revenue alternatives for highway and bridge funding. It was recommended as ought to pass.
3. **House Bill 1432: Prohibiting State Funds for New Passenger Rail Projects**: The committee voted 11-11 on this bill, resulting in no recommendation. Concerns were raised about limiting future legislative flexibility and hindering public-private partnerships.
4. **Other Bills**: House Bills 1585 (removing ramp tolls in Hooksett) and 1675 (surcharge on electric vehicles via E-ZPass) were both recommended as ITL.

### Future Work and Action Items
1. **EV Charging Infrastructure**: The committee discussed the $17.5 million allocated for EV charging infrastructure under federal programs, noting the lack of detailed guidance and the potential role of the Transportation Council in planning deployment.
2. **Resiliency and Climate Change Programs**: New federal programs like PROTECT, aimed at funding resiliency projects such as culvert work and slope stabilization, were introduced. Specific projects will be discussed in future sessions.
3. **Rail and Aeronautics Funding**: The committee clarified that current rail funding is for freight and tourist services, not passenger rail. Aeronautics funding, primarily from the FAA, was also addressed.
4. **Sound Walls and Shoulder Running Projects**: The committee sought more information on the distance of sound walls along I-95 and the potential for shoulder running on other highways.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the complexities of transportation funding, the need for strategic decision-making, and the importance of balancing federal funds, toll credits, and local match requirements. The committee plans to continue discussions on rail, transit, aeronautics, and EV infrastructure, emphasizing the need for detailed information and collaboration to advance transportation initiatives effectively.
