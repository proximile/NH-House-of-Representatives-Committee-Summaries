Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **House Bill 1609: Amendments to the Fetal Life Protection Act**

**Overview and Context**:  
HB 1609 aimed to address perceived inconsistencies in the FLPA, proposing exceptions for cases of **rape, incest, and severe fetal anomalies incompatible with life**. The bill sparked a contentious debate, with arguments centered on **medical ethics, constitutional rights, and the practicalities of implementing new legislation**.

**Key Arguments**:  
1. **Support for HB 1609**:  
   - **Representative Wolf** argued that the current law imposes undue burdens on victims of rape and incest and may violate constitutional rights.  
   - **Representative Kanuck**, a retired surgeon, emphasized the need for medical decisions to be made by parents and providers rather than legislators, particularly in cases of severe fetal anomalies.  

2. **Opposition to HB 1609**:  
   - **Representative Turcotte** and **Representative Love** opposed the bill, stating that current law already allows abortions up to 24 weeks in cases of rape and incest and that removing ultrasound requirements would undermine the FLPA.  
   - Testimonies from organizations like **New Hampshire Right to Life** and individuals like **Laurie Stafford** highlighted the value of life and concerns about medical errors in diagnosing fetal anomalies.  

**Amendment 2022-0048h**:  
An amendment proposed by **Representative Beth Folsom** clarified the ultrasound requirement, specifying that ultrasounds are only required in the last trimester and are abdominal, not transvaginal. The amendment passed with an **11-10 vote**, but the bill as amended faced mixed reactions, with some representatives voting against it due to its limitations, particularly the lack of provisions for **rape and incest**.

**Outcome**:  
The meeting highlighted deep ideological divides over abortion rights, with passionate testimonies from both sides. The amendment clarified certain aspects of the FLPA but left unresolved broader concerns about **mental health impacts** and **healthcare provider recruitment challenges**.

### **House Bill 1022: Ivermectin for COVID-19 Treatment**

**Overview and Context**:  
HB 1022 proposed allowing pharmacists to dispense **ivermectin** through a **standing order**, making it more accessible without a prescription. The bill sparked significant debate over the drug's safety and efficacy for COVID-19 treatment.

**Key Arguments**:  
1. **Support for HB 1022**:  
   - **Representative Leah Cushman** and **Dr. Paul Marik** presented evidence supporting ivermectin's safety and efficacy, citing its widespread use in over 20 countries and its potential to reduce hospitalizations.  
   - Personal testimonies from individuals who claimed ivermectin helped them recover from COVID-19 were shared, emphasizing the need for **patient choice** and early treatment options.  

2. **Opposition to HB 1022**:  
   - Representatives from **Dartmouth-Hitchcock** and the **New Hampshire Hospital Association** opposed the bill, citing a lack of strong evidence supporting ivermectin's efficacy and concerns about bypassing standard medical practices.  
   - Critics highlighted the **FDA and CDC guidelines**, which do not recommend ivermectin for COVID-19, and raised ethical concerns about using unproven treatments.  

**Outcome**:  
The meeting concluded with a call for further research and open debate on ivermectin's role in COVID-19 treatment. The bill's proponents argued for patient autonomy and access to early treatment, while opponents emphasized the importance of evidence-based medicine and medical oversight.
