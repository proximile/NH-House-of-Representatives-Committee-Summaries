**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (01/25/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on January 25, 2022, addressed a range of bills related to transportation, law enforcement, and vehicle regulations. The discussions centered on public safety, administrative efficiency, and the balancing of operational needs with transparency. Here’s a consolidated overview of the key bills and debates:

---

### **Vehicle License Plates and Registration**

   - Proposed allowing certain vehicles (e.g., historic, collectible, or high-value cars) to display only a rear license plate, provided they meet specific criteria and display a windshield decal. 
   - **Support**: Advocates argued that front plates can devalue vehicles and that many states do not require them.

2. **House Bill 1150 (Temporary License Plates)**:
   - Sought to allow New Hampshire residents purchasing a vehicle from another individual to use an existing NH license plate for five days post-sale, addressing delays in obtaining temporary tags.
   - **Concerns**: Law enforcement and the DMV raised issues about validating bills of sale and potential misuse.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)** unanimously (17-0).

3. **House Bill 1437 (Antique Farm Tractor Plates)**:
   - Proposed adding antique farm tractors to the list of vehicles eligible for antique registration plates, resolving confusion among town clerks.

### **Public Safety and Speed Limits**
1. **House Bill 1024 (Local Speed Limits)**:
   - Allowed towns to lower speed limits in densely populated areas from 25 mph to 10 mph for pedestrian safety.
   - **Opposition**: The NH Department of Transportation argued that speed limits should be based on engineering studies, not arbitrary reductions.
   - **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about enforcement and the need for public hearings.

### **Law Enforcement and Vehicle Marking**
1. **House Bill 1445 (Police Vehicle Marking)**:
   - Proposed requiring all police vehicles used for regular law enforcement functions to be fully marked with visible identifiers.
   - **Support**: Advocates emphasized transparency and public safety, noting that unmarked vehicles can confuse citizens.
   - **Opposition**: The NH Association of Chiefs of Police opposed the bill, citing it as an unfunded mandate and highlighting the need for unmarked vehicles in undercover operations.
   - **Testimony**: The NH State Police explained that unmarked vehicles are used for sensitive investigations and already switch to marked plates for regular functions.

### **Other Bills**
1. **House Bill 1158 (Handicapped Placards)**:
   - Aimed to address misuse of removable windshield placards by requiring their removal while driving.
   - **Outcome**: Voted ITL (17-0) as existing laws already cover obstruction of a driver’s view.

2. **House Bill 1214 (Walking Disability Placard Fees)**:
   - Sought to eliminate the $5 fee for walking disability placards, which the DMV had already stopped charging under the ADA.
   - **Outcome**: Voted OTP unanimously (17-0).

3. **House Bill 1461 (Littering Penalties)**:

   - **Outcome**: Passed 16-1 with the amendment.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Public Safety**: Many bills, such as HB 1445 and HB 1024, focused on enhancing transparency and safety, though some faced opposition from law enforcement or state agencies.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Bills like HB 1437 and HB 1214 aimed to streamline processes or align statutes with current practices.
- **Fundraising and Local Control**: Decal plate bills (e.g., HB 1001, HB 1060, HB 1492) were supported as tools for fundraising and community engagement.
- **Operational Needs vs. Transparency**: Discussions on police vehicle marking highlighted the tension between public trust and the operational flexibility of law enforcement.

The committee recommended several bills for passage while others were deemed unnecessary due to existing laws or practical concerns. Bills with fiscal impacts, such as HB 1445 and HB 1461, will likely proceed to the Ways and Means Committee for further review.
