**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (01/27/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 27, 2022, centered on two primary topics: the **"Felonies First" program** and **remote access to public meetings**. The discussions included detailed testimonies, data presentations, and debates on proposed legislative changes, with a focus on improving efficiency, accessibility, and fairness in both the justice system and public governance.

### **Felonies First Program (House Bill 1597)**

1. **Background and Context:**
   - The "Felonies First" program, implemented in 2016, mandates that felony cases begin in superior courts rather than district (circuit) courts. This shift eliminated automatic probable cause hearings, requiring defendants to request them, and aimed to streamline felony case processing.
   - Critics argue that the program has failed to achieve its goals, leading to inefficiencies, increased workloads, and delays in case resolutions.

2. **Key Issues and Testimonies:**
   - **Increased Workload and Delays:** Data presented by Randy Hawks, Executive Director of the New Hampshire Public Defender Program, showed that felony case resolution times have increased by nearly two months since the programâ€™s implementation. Arraignment days in Merrimack County rose by 20%, and bail hearings by 78% between 2016 and 2021.
   - **Impact on Justice System:** The program has caused backlogs in superior courts, with cases taking longer to resolve. This has negatively affected defendants, victims, and court staff. Probation reporting and final orders have been delayed, and recidivism rates may have increased due to slower case processing.
   - **Loss of Local Control:** District courts, which previously handled felony arraignments, were more efficient and better equipped with local knowledge. The shift to superior courts has removed this local element, leading to less personalized and more resource-intensive case resolutions.
   - **Anecdotal Evidence:** Testimonies from defense attorneys and county officials highlighted high turnover rates among prosecutors, inefficiencies in case handling, and increased costs for defendants and the court system.
   - **Declining Crime Rates:** The ACLU noted a steady decline in crime rates from 2017 to 2020, suggesting that court backlogs are not due to an increase in crime but rather inefficiencies in the system.

3. **Proposed Solutions:**
   - **Reverting to Pre-2016 System:** Many stakeholders, including defense attorneys and the New Hampshire Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, supported **House Bill 1597**, which proposes to return felony arraignments and preliminary examinations to circuit courts. They argued this would restore efficiency, fairness, and local control.
   - **Alternative Approaches:** Suggestions included improving the Early Case Resolution (ECR) program, defelonizing drug possession, and adopting a tiered system similar to Massachusetts, where different levels of felonies are handled in different courts.
   - **Opposition:** The New Hampshire Association of Counties opposed the bill, arguing that "Felonies First" has worked well for most counties and that reverting to the old system would lead to duplication of efforts and inefficiencies.

### **Remote Access to Public Meetings (House Bill 1014)**

1. **Background and Proposal:**
   - **House Bill 1014** addresses remote access to public meetings, proposing to remove the requirement for a physical location and include remote participation options (e.g., telephone, video). This aims to increase public participation, especially for individuals with limited time, mobility, or technology access.

2. **Key Issues and Testimonies:**
   - **Support for Remote Access:** Many speakers, including representatives from the New Hampshire Nurses Association and the New Hampshire Municipal Association, supported the bill. They emphasized that remote access increases participation, particularly for working parents, immunocompromised individuals, and those in rural areas with limited broadband access.
   - **Concerns About Eliminating Physical Locations:** Some stakeholders, including New Hampshire Right to Know, argued that physical locations should remain mandatory. They stressed the importance of face-to-face interaction, non-verbal communication, and the ability for the public to physically assemble and demonstrate their concerns.
   - **Hybrid Meetings:** Several speakers advocated for hybrid meetings, combining in-person and remote options to balance accessibility and the benefits of physical interaction. They suggested that public notices should include clear instructions on remote access.
   - **Technological Challenges:** Testimony highlighted issues such as connectivity problems, attention span issues during phone-only meetings, and the lack of non-verbal cues in remote settings. Some speakers noted that telephonic participation can be inadequate for effective communication.
   - **Equity and Accessibility:** The bill was seen as a way to create equity of access for residents across the state, particularly for those in rural areas, immunocompromised individuals, and those with limited access to technology.

3. **Proposed Amendments:**
   - Suggestions included maintaining physical locations, ensuring free access to telephonic participation (e.g., via 800 numbers), and prioritizing in-person public comments over remote ones.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**

1. **Justice System Efficiency:**
   - The "Felonies First" program has been widely criticized for increasing workloads, causing delays, and reducing efficiency in the justice system. Stakeholders called for a return to the pre-2016 system or significant reforms to address these issues.

2. **Accessibility and Inclusion:**
   - Supporters of **House Bill 1014** emphasized the need to ensure all citizens, especially those with disabilities or limited resources, can participate in public meetings. Remote access options were seen as a way to increase participation and equity.

3. **Technical and Practical Concerns:**
   - Both discussions highlighted practical challenges, including technological barriers for remote meetings and the logistical inefficiencies caused by "Felonies First." Amendments and hybrid solutions were proposed to address these concerns.

4. **Balancing Efficiency and Fairness:**
   - The meeting underscored the importance of balancing efficiency with fairness and accessibility, whether in the justice system or public governance. Legislators were urged to consider amendments and alternative approaches to achieve these goals.

The meeting concluded with representatives considering amendments to address these concerns while striving to improve efficiency, accessibility, and fairness in both the justice system and public meetings.
