**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/24/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 24, 2022, to discuss key issues related to education funding, policy reforms, and access to higher education. The meeting centered on **House Bill 1680**, a comprehensive proposal to reform the state’s education funding system, as well as broader discussions on higher education pathways, particularly through community colleges and universities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions:

---

### **Education Funding Reform (House Bill 1680)**
The primary focus of the meeting was **House Bill 1680**, which aims to overhaul New Hampshire’s education funding system to ensure equity, adequacy, and accountability. Key components of the bill include:

1. **Foundation Opportunity Budget**:  
   - The bill introduces a new formula to calculate **adequate education funding** for each district based on student outcomes and district-specific needs.  
   - Factors such as enrollment, free and reduced-price lunch students, special education, and English language learners are weighted to determine funding levels.  
   - The goal is to achieve **statewide average performance levels**, with resources directed toward districts with the greatest needs.

2. **Equity and Accountability**:  
   - The bill emphasizes **outcome-based adequacy**, ensuring that funding is tied to improving student performance, graduation rates, and attendance.  
   - **Accountability measures** require districts to report data and implement improvement plans, with state support for the lowest-performing 20% of schools.  
   - The bill is designed to comply with the **Claremont decisions**, which mandate that the state provide an adequate education for all students.

3. **Transition and Funding Mechanisms**:  
   - A **10-year phase-in** plan is proposed to avoid sudden financial shocks, with **transition grants** provided to districts facing reduced funding.  
   - **Federal ARPA funds** and other resources may be used to support the transition.  
   - The bill also addresses the **statewide education property tax**, ensuring uniform rates and returning excess funds to the state treasury.

4. **Targeted Tax Relief**:  
   - The bill includes provisions for **property tax relief** for low- and moderate-income taxpayers, capping relief at $1,000 per individual.  
   - It aims to resolve the issue of **“donor towns”** by ensuring all taxpayers pay the same rate, with excess funds redistributed to support state education needs.

5. **Historical Context and Data-Driven Approach**:  
   - The bill builds on past studies, including the 2008 Joint Legislative Oversight Committee report, and uses **regression modeling** and 10 years of data to determine funding needs.  
   - Challenges include the lack of granularity in **special education funding** and the heavy reliance on **standardized test scores** in determining adequacy.

### **Access to Higher Education**
The committee also discussed pathways to higher education, particularly through community colleges and universities, with a focus on affordability, transferability, and workforce readiness:

1. **Articulation Agreements**:  
   - Existing agreements between community colleges and universities allow students to transfer credits seamlessly, particularly in liberal arts programs.  
   - Challenges remain in specialized fields like nursing and engineering due to specific prerequisites.

2. **Community College Bachelor’s Degrees**:  
   - The discussion explored the possibility of community colleges offering **baccalaureate degrees**, particularly in fields not covered by the university system.  
   - Concerns were raised about potential overlap with university programs, but the focus remained on expanding access to underserved areas.

3. **Nursing Education**:  
   - The **RN-to-BSN pathway** was highlighted as a collaborative effort between community colleges and universities to increase affordability and access to nursing education.  
   - Differences between two-year (RN) and four-year (BSN) programs were discussed, with an emphasis on workforce needs.

4. **Micro-Credentialing and Stackable Certifications**:  
   - The concept of **micro-credentials** and **stackable certifications** was introduced as a way to provide targeted skills for immediate employment while still contributing to degree attainment.

5. **Collaboration and Innovation**:  
   - The committee emphasized the importance of **collaboration** between institutions to avoid duplication of programs and maximize resources.  
   - There was a call for **innovation** in meeting the diverse educational needs of students, particularly those from economically or geographically disadvantaged backgrounds.

### **Next Steps**
The committee plans to:  
- Review **House Bill 1680** section by section, focusing on costing methods, tax impacts, and constitutional compliance.  
- Hold additional meetings to gather input from community members and educators on innovative solutions to improve educational access and outcomes.  
- Explore policy changes and funding mechanisms to support collaboration between community colleges and universities.
