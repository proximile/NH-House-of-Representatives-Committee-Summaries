### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (01/12/22)

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on January 12, 2022, to discuss a wide range of bills addressing issues such as **law enforcement transparency, victim compensation, domestic violence support, civil asset forfeiture, pet-friendly housing, and housing appeals**. The meeting underscored the committee’s aggressive schedule, with 10 bills on the agenda and 44 bills assigned overall. Key discussions and legislative proposals are summarized below:

---

### **Law Enforcement and Victim Compensation**
1. **House Bill 1006**: Introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, this bill requires police officer associations to clearly disclose their identity and purpose during fundraising calls to prevent public confusion. The committee debated amendments to clarify language and enforcement mechanisms.
   
2. **House Bill 1020**: Presented by Representative Chartier, this bill proposes standardizing emergency lighting on police and fire vehicles to align with federal standards. The committee discussed the need for clarity in the bill’s language.

3. **House Bill 1235**: Introduced by Representative Muse, this bill increases the maximum recovery amount for crime victims from $40,000 to $50,000 and extends the repeal date of the FRM Recovery Fund to July 2024. It also redirects unused FRM funds to the general victims’ compensation fund. Representative Walsh emphasized the need for higher compensation due to rising costs and the appropriateness of supporting FRM investors as crime victims.

### **Domestic Violence Support**
4. **House Bill 1435**: Sponsored by Representative Gay, this bill grants domestic violence victims the right to have a support person present during testimony or depositions. The committee debated the role of the support person, with some members expressing concerns about allowing untrained individuals to participate in court proceedings. Advocates highlighted the psychological impact of **Complex PTSD (CPTSD)** and the need for consistent support systems.

---

### **Civil Asset Forfeiture**
5. **House Bill 1101**: This bill aims to require prosecutors to use state forfeiture laws rather than federal laws in cases involving local or state police, unless it involves a joint federal-state task force. Supporters, including Ross Connolly of Americans for Prosperity, emphasized **due process** and **property rights**, while opponents, such as Captain Joe Ebert of the NH State Police, argued that federal forfeiture programs are necessary for large-scale narcotics cases. The debate centered on balancing law enforcement needs with protecting citizens’ rights.

### **Pet-Friendly Housing**
6. **House Bill 1107**: Introduced by Representative Ellen Reed, this bill proposes a study committee to explore policies prohibiting landlords from arbitrarily denying tenants with pets. Supporters highlighted the **health benefits** of pet ownership and the **emotional toll** of pet relinquishment, while opponents, including the Apartment Association of New Hampshire, raised concerns about property damage, liability, and the financial burden on landlords.

---

### **Housing and Tenant Protections**
7. **House Bill 1133**: This bill prevents evictions solely due to property sales, ensuring tenants can stay until their lease ends if they are current on rent and have no other issues. The bill was inspired by cases where low-income and disabled tenants were abruptly evicted after property sales.

8. **House Bill 1200**: This bill increases the notice period for rent increases from 30 to 45 days. Supporters argued it would help tenants prepare financially and avoid homelessness, while opponents contended it could lead to higher costs for landlords and exacerbate the housing crisis.

---

### **Housing Appeals Board (HAB)**
9. **House Bill 1216** and **House Bill 1254**: These bills address the structure and processes of the Housing Appeals Board (HAB), established in 2020 to expedite housing-related appeals. Supporters, including Chris Norwood of the New Hampshire Association of Realtors and Ben Frost of New Hampshire Housing, argued that the HAB reduces costs and delays in housing development. Critics, such as Alyssa Margolin of Housing Action NH and Daniel Pray of the Amherst zoning board, claimed the HAB undermines local control and lacks legal expertise. The debate highlighted the tension between **local autonomy** and the need for **statewide solutions** to New Hampshire’s housing crisis.
