The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on January 13, 2022, covered a wide range of topics related to infrastructure, transportation, and state-owned property management. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Infrastructure Maintenance and Funding**
1. **Facility Maintenance and Potential Relocation**:
   - The committee discussed the ongoing maintenance and potential relocation of a 60-year-old state building. Issues included the replacement of HVAC systems, boilers, and roofs. The possibility of moving to a nearby state-owned property was explored to reduce costs and improve efficiency, with plans to establish a state-of-the-art emergency communications center.

2. **10-Year Transportation Plan**:
   - The state’s 10-year transportation plan (2023-2032) involves a $4.6 billion investment in roads, bridges, rail, transit, and airports. The plan is fiscally constrained, aligning investments with projected revenues. Key funding sources include federal, state, and local funds, with 83% dedicated to highways and bridges and 17% to rail, transit, and airports.

3. **Revenue Challenges**:
   - Declining revenues from gas taxes, due to the rise of fuel-efficient and electric vehicles, are impacting programs like rural road paving and state bridge aid. The state is leveraging federal funds and toll credits to maximize infrastructure investments, though this reduces the overall program size.

4. **Federal Funding (IIJA)**:
   - New Hampshire will receive over $2 billion from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) over five years, including $1.139 billion for highways, $225 million for bridges, and $17 million for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This represents a significant increase in funding compared to previous allocations.

### **Commuter Rail Expansion**
1. **House Bill 1432**:
   - The committee held a public hearing on HB 1432, which seeks to prohibit the use of state funds for new commuter rail projects. Supporters argued that such projects are financially unsustainable and would burden taxpayers, while opponents highlighted the economic benefits, including job creation, increased housing, and commercial development.
   - Proponents, like Representative Aidan Ankerberg, cited high capital and operating costs and low projected ridership as reasons to oppose rail expansion.
   - Opponents, such as EJ Powers from New Hampshire Businesses for Rail Expansion, emphasized overwhelming public and business support for rail, citing potential economic benefits like 5,600 permanent jobs and $750 million in real estate investment.

2. **Railway Expansion Study**:
   - A $5.4 million study by AECOM Technical Services is evaluating the costs and benefits of rail expansion in New Hampshire. The study is expected to be completed by January 2023 and will inform future legislative decisions. The committee agreed that HB 1432 is premature and should be deferred until the study is finalized.

### **Lakes Region Facility**
1. **House Bill 1032**:
   - This bill aims to repeal a provision in HB2 that gave the governor and executive council sole authority to dispose of the 200-acre Lakes Region Facility in Laconia. The bill seeks to restore local input in decisions about the property, which was formerly the Laconia State School and later a state prison. Local officials are concerned that the state could sell the property for uses that don’t align with community interests, such as a garbage dump or industrial park.

2. **House Bill 1548**:
   - This bill seeks to exclude a 17-acre parcel of the Lakes Region Facility from being sold. The parcel includes the state 911 call center and the Lakes Region Mutual Aid (LRMA) building, which are critical for public safety operations. Relocating these facilities would be extremely costly and disruptive.

### **Public Safety and Economic Development**
1. **Public Safety Concerns**:
   - The committee heard testimony about the critical role of the 911 center and LRMA building in emergency services. Relocating these facilities would burden local taxpayers and potentially dissolve the LRMA district.

2. **Economic and Housing Potential**:
   - The Lakes Region Facility is seen as a valuable asset for Laconia’s future development, particularly for addressing housing shortages and economic growth.

### **Winter Storm Response and Road Conditions**
1. **Winter Storm Challenges**:
   - The committee discussed the difficulties in responding to a recent ice storm, particularly on Interstate 93, where road conditions deteriorated rapidly due to freezing rain and mist.

2. **Road and Bridge Conditions**:
   - Significant progress has been made in improving road and bridge conditions, with 96% of Tier 1 roads (interstates) in good condition. However, future reductions in funding may lead to a decline in road conditions, especially on Tier 3 and 4 roads (regional and local connectors).

### **Next Steps**
- The committee will hold public hearings on the 10-year transportation plan and consider the Lakes Region Facility bills in an executive session. The focus will be on ensuring local voices are heard, protecting public safety operations, and leveraging new federal funding opportunities.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing economic development, infrastructure needs, and taxpayer concerns in New Hampshire, with a strong emphasis on completing the rail expansion study before making legislative decisions.
