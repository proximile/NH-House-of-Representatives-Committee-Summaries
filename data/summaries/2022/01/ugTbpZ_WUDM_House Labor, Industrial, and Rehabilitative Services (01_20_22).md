The New Hampshire House Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on January 20, 2022, to discuss several bills aimed at addressing labor issues, worker protections, and employment practices. The meeting featured extensive testimony from legislators, industry representatives, and stakeholders, with debates centering on fair wages, scheduling protections, workers' compensation, and transparency in hiring processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. House Bill 1053: Unscheduled Work Shifts and Overtime Pay**
- **Purpose**: HB 1053 proposes requiring employers to pay employees **time and a half** for unscheduled work shifts, aiming to compensate workers for the inconvenience of last-minute scheduling changes.
- **Support**: Representative Adjutant, the bill’s sponsor, argued that unscheduled shifts disrupt employees’ personal time and that the bill would incentivize employers to minimize such disruptions.
- **Opposition**: Industry representatives (e.g., tourism, agriculture, retail, and home care) opposed the bill, citing challenges like unpredictable weather, fluctuating demand, and labor shortages. Concerns were raised about the financial burden on small businesses and government-funded programs like Medicaid.
- **Outcome**: The committee heard extensive testimony and will consider potential amendments to address industry-specific concerns.

### **2. House Bill 1385: Prohibiting Credit History Checks in Employment**
- **Purpose**: HB 1385 seeks to prohibit employers from using credit history checks in hiring decisions, except for financially sensitive positions.
- **Support**: Representative Ellen Reed argued that poor credit often results from circumstances like medical bills or divorce, not irresponsibility, and should not disqualify job seekers.
- **Opposition**: Employers, particularly in sensitive industries like nuclear power, raised concerns about the bill’s impact on hiring for security-sensitive roles.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the enforceability of the bill, privacy concerns, and whether credit checks are a reliable indicator of responsibility.

### **3. House Bill 1251: Raising the Subminimum Wage for Tipped Workers**
- **Purpose**: HB 1251 aims to eliminate the subminimum wage for tipped workers, ensuring they receive the full federal minimum wage of $7.25/hour.
- **Support**: Sponsors highlighted the racialized history of tipping and its impact on low-wage workers, particularly women and families. Testimony from service industry workers emphasized financial instability and reliance on tips.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association argued that servers prefer the current system, though proponents cited surveys showing worker support for the change.
- **Broader Implications**: The bill addresses systemic inequalities in wages and worker protections, with bipartisan potential for improving economic conditions.

### **4. House Bill 1094: Work Schedule Notice and Rest Periods**
- **Purpose**: HB 1094 requires employers to provide work schedules at least one week in advance and mandates a 10-hour rest period between shifts on consecutive days.
- **Support**: Representative Ellen Reed emphasized the importance of allowing employees to plan their lives and avoid being constantly on call.
- **Opposition**: The Business and Industry Association and Associated General Contractors argued that the bill would burden industries like construction and agriculture, where schedules are often unpredictable due to weather or project demands.
- **Safety Concerns**: Representative Hattan raised issues about drowsy driving, but opponents argued that most employers already prioritize safety.

### **5. House Bill 1231: Timely Workers’ Compensation Payments**
- **Purpose**: HB 1231 incentivizes timely workers’ compensation payments by requiring payments made more than **60 days after an injury is reported** to be at **100% of the worker's base wage** instead of the standard **60%**.
- **Support**: Representative Max Abramson highlighted the financial hardships faced by injured workers due to delayed payments.
- **Opposition**: The Department of Labor and insurers raised concerns about the bill’s impact on costs and potential unintended consequences, such as penalizing employers for delays caused by disputes or medical record issues.
- **Next Steps**: The committee considered amendments to address technical issues and ensure the bill achieves its intended goal.

### **6. House Bill 1156: Pre-Employment Background Checks**
- **Purpose**: HB 1156 allows candidates for public service positions to receive a copy of their background investigation report upon completion, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Support**: Advocates argued that candidates have a right to know what information is being used against them and to correct any misinformation.
- **Opposition**: Law enforcement officials, including the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, opposed the bill, citing concerns about confidentiality, the chilling effect on witnesses, and the undermining of rigorous hiring processes.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the balance between transparency and the need for thorough vetting in public service hiring, with potential amendments to address concerns.
