### **Child Care and Guardianship Bills**
1. **HB 1364 - Child Care Appeals Process**:  
   This bill proposes the creation of a commission to study and improve the appeals process for child care providers. Testimonies highlighted that the current system often discourages providers from appealing violations due to its complexity and perceived unfairness. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supported studying the issue but did not take a position on the bill. The committee recommended further study for the next year.

2. **HB 1520 - Guardian Ad Litem Itemized Bills**:  
   This bill requires guardians ad litem (GALs) to provide itemized bills to the paying party. Representative Cody Belanger shared a personal experience where he was charged $1,700 without an itemized bill, underscoring the need for transparency. The committee unanimously supported the bill, emphasizing fairness in billing practices.

3. **HB 1518 - Home Studies for Guardianships**:  
   This bill mandates home studies for guardianships to ensure the safety and adequacy of the home environment. Representative Belanger recounted his own guardianship process, where no home study was conducted. The committee discussed potential amendments to clarify the process and associated costs, with plans to revisit the bill with amendments.

4. **HB 1303 - Archaic Language Update**:  
   This bill updates outdated language in RSA 458, replacing the term "habitual drunkards" with "habitually abuses alcohol or drugs." The change modernizes the statute to reflect contemporary issues. The committee unanimously supported the bill, viewing it as a necessary update to outdated legal language.

### **Family Law and Alimony Bills**
1. **HB 1103 - Asset Division in Divorce Cases**:  
   Representative Spillane introduced this bill to address unfair asset division in divorce cases. He shared a personal experience where a judge ordered the sale of his motorcycle to equalize asset values, despite his ability to pay the difference in cash. The bill seeks to prevent judges from forcing the sale of personal items if the party can compensate with cash.

2. **HB 1118 - Parenting Responsibilities After Death**:  
   Representative Griffin proposed this bill to consider the contact a child has had with a surviving parent or guardian and the guardian’s wishes in estate planning when determining parenting responsibilities after a parent or guardian’s death. The bill aims to provide stability for children in such cases.

3. **HB 1305 - Temporary Alimony Modification**:  
   Representative DeSimone introduced this bill to modify the definition of temporary alimony in pending divorce cases. The bill aims to prevent irreparable economic harm to either party by allowing courts to adjust alimony payments based on the circumstances, rather than applying a strict formula.
