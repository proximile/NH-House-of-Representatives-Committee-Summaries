**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/13/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 13, 2022, focused on a range of education-related bills, with discussions centered on **school board governance**, **parental engagement**, **transparency**, **equity in representation**, and **access to educational opportunities**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and bills discussed across all segments:

---

### **1. School Board Governance and Transparency**
Several bills addressed the responsibilities and accountability of school boards, reflecting broader national debates on parental involvement and transparency in education.

- **HB 1137**: This bill aimed to enhance **parental engagement** and **transparency** by requiring school boards to:
  - Review curricula, approve textbooks, and set measurable standards.
  - Ensure compliance with **RSA 91-A** (Right-to-Know Law) for all meetings, including subcommittees.
  - Encourage public attendance and provide multiple opportunities for public input.
  - Develop policies allowing parents to visit classrooms and conduct annual parent surveys.
  - Post key information on district websites, including curricula, student achievement data, and financial records.

- **HB 1169**: Similar to HB 1137, this bill sought to ensure public input during school board meetings by requiring boards to answer public questions and cite specific statutes or administrative rules justifying their decisions.

- **Concerns and Support**:
  - **Supporters** argued that the bills would restore trust between school boards and parents, citing instances of parents being excluded from meetings or denied access to curriculum.
  - **Opponents**, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA), raised concerns about the feasibility of implementing these measures, suggesting they could create unnecessary burdens.

### **2. Cooperative School District Representation and Equity**
Discussions highlighted inequities in representation and financial fairness within cooperative school districts.

- **HB 1646**: Proposed equal representation for each town in cooperative school districts, ensuring that larger towns do not dominate decisions affecting smaller towns. Only sending districts would vote for their representatives.
  - **Opposition**: The NHSBA suggested a comprehensive review of **RSA 195** (the statute governing cooperative districts) instead of piecemeal legislation, proposing a study commission to address broader issues like funding and representation.

- **HB 1399**: Addressed the withdrawal or dissolution of cooperative school districts, ensuring fair market value distribution of assets and liabilities. The bill aimed to prevent districts from forfeiting equity in co-op facilities when withdrawing.
  - **Testimony**: Former school board members shared experiences of the financial penalties of withdrawal, describing the current system as unfair.

- **HB 1366**: Simplified the process for proposing the reapportionment of cooperative school boards by aligning signature requirements with other petitioned articles, making it more accessible for citizens to advocate for changes.

### **3. Transparency in School Budgets**
- **HB 1276**: Proposed including the **cost per student** on school district warrant articles to increase transparency.
  - **Supporters** argued this would help voters understand the financial impact of budgets.
  - **Opponents**, including the NHSBA, raised concerns about the accuracy of cost calculations, particularly for special education and other variable expenses.

---

### **4. Expanding Access to Educational Opportunities**
- **HB 1298**: Sought to expand eligibility for the **Education Tax Credit Scholarship Program** by increasing the family income cap from 300% to 500% of the federal poverty level.
  - **Supporters** argued this would allow more middle-income families to access scholarships for private or alternative education.
  - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the potential impact on low-income families if funding does not increase proportionally.

- **HB 1676**: Proposed **incentive grants** for school districts showing improvement in standardized test scores, using pre-pandemic (2019) scores as a baseline.
  - **Concerns**: Critics questioned whether the program would unfairly advantage well-resourced schools and whether it would effectively incentivize improvement.

### **5. Public Engagement and Accountability**
The meeting highlighted growing frustrations among parents and representatives with school board practices, particularly around **public comment**, **curriculum oversight**, and **transparency**.

- **Public Comment**: Representatives and constituents shared experiences of being excluded from meetings or denied access to curriculum, emphasizing the need for laws to protect parental rights.
- **Curriculum Oversight**: Concerns were raised about school boards lacking awareness of curriculum content, with examples like *The Glass Castle* cited as inappropriate.
- **Behavior and Decorum**: Discussions touched on the need for standards of behavior during school board meetings, balancing public input with maintaining order.

---

### **6. Broader Issues**
- **Petition Signature Requirements**: Representatives discussed the difficulty of gathering signatures for school board petitions, particularly during the pandemic.
- **Statutory Updates**: Calls were made for comprehensive updates to **RSA 195**, which has not been significantly revised since 1963, to address modern educational and demographic realities.
- **Local vs. State Control**: Debates centered on whether issues like public engagement and curriculum oversight should be handled locally or require state-level intervention.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of education governance, with a focus on **equity**, **transparency**, and **parental involvement**. While some bills aimed to address specific issues like cooperative district representation and school budget transparency, others sought to enhance broader accountability and public engagement. The discussions reflected a push for legislative changes to ensure school boards are more responsive to their communities, with differing perspectives on the best approaches to achieve these goals. The committee concluded with plans to consider forming a commission to review **RSA 195** comprehensively, signaling a potential shift toward more systemic reforms in New Hampshireâ€™s education system.
