---

#### **Legislation on Veterans and Military Affairs**
1. **Licensing and Credentialing for Veterans**:  
   The committee reviewed legislation aimed at assisting veterans and their spouses with licensing and credentialing when relocating to New Hampshire. This initiative has been successful in recruiting and retaining veterans, particularly in the National Guard.

2. **Veteran-Friendly Business Network**:  
   The New Hampshire Veteran-Friendly Business Network was highlighted for its efforts to support veterans and their families, including employment opportunities. Service Credit Union was cited as an example of a business actively hiring military spouses.

3. **Collaboration with Community Colleges**:  
   Ongoing and future collaboration with the Community College System of New Hampshire was discussed to upskill and reskill veterans, aiding their transition into the workforce.

4. **Retention and Recruitment Efforts**:  
   A $25,000 budget allocation for retaining and recruiting veterans and National Guard members was confirmed to remain intact, emphasizing the importance of these efforts.

5. **Transition Assistance Program (TAPS)**:  
   The committee is working to integrate New Hampshire’s information into TAPS, a program aiding active-duty military personnel transitioning to civilian life. The state aims to be the first to launch a statewide campaign through TAPS.

6. **House Bill 1256 (Veterans Cemetery)**:  
   This bill, unanimously passed, seeks to recognize the contributions of the New Hampshire Veterans Cemetery workforce and improve its operations.

7. **House Bill 1362 (State Guard Proposal)**:  
   The committee recommended an "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) motion for this bill, which proposed creating a state guard. While the idea had merit, it was deemed unfeasible due to administrative and financial burdens, with local emergency response teams already fulfilling similar roles.

8. **House Bill 1106 (Military Affairs Commission)**:  
   The committee passed an amendment converting a committee related to military affairs and veterans services into a commission. The bill was then passed as amended.

   - While some questioned the need for an additional designation alongside Veterans Day, the bill was seen as a symbolic gesture to remember WWI sacrifices.  

3. **House Bill 1284 (Deportation Impact Study)**:  
   - This bill proposes a study on the effects of deporting primary earners on their U.S. citizen family members.  
   - Discussions highlighted the economic, social, and humanitarian impacts of deportation, including the burden on state resources and the trauma on children.  
   - Amendments were suggested to focus solely on financial costs to New Hampshire taxpayers.

4. **House Bill 1353 (NH Veterans Home Wing Renaming)**:  
   - Proposed by Representative Al Baldasaro, this bill seeks to name a wing of the NH Veterans Home after **Barry Conway**, a former commandant.
