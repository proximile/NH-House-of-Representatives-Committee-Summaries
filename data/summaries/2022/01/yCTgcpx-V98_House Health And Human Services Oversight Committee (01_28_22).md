**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (01/28/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on January 28, 2022, addressed a wide range of issues, focusing on public health preparedness, child welfare, COVID-19 updates, and legislative initiatives. Hereâ€™s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Public Health Preparedness and Funding**
1. **DHHS Performance and Resources**:
   - A representative with extensive experience working with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) praised the department for its competence and lack of corruption but criticized the state for not providing adequate resources to handle future public health challenges, such as potential pandemics or infectious disease outbreaks.
   
2. **Public Health Preparedness**:
   - Concerns were raised about the state's readiness for future health crises, including COVID-19 mutations, avian influenza, and drug-resistant fungi. The need for better prevention, surveillance, and treatment availability was emphasized.

3. **Medicaid and Public Health Funding**:
   - Discussions highlighted the underfunding of regional public health networks and the need for increased resources to support public health initiatives, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. The state relies heavily on federal funds, but more consistent state funding is needed.

4. **Medicaid Unwind and Continuous Coverage**:
   - The committee discussed the end of the federal public health emergency and its impact on Medicaid enrollment. The state is working to ensure that eligible individuals do not lose coverage and that those who are no longer eligible are transitioned to other forms of coverage.

### **Child Welfare and Oversight**
1. **Nashua Children's Home Review**:
   - The Office of the Child Advocate presented a report on concerns about the Nashua Children's Home (NCH), including issues related to trauma-informed care, physical restraints, and compliance with state and federal laws. The report emphasized the need for better practices and accountability in residential care facilities.

2. **Concerns Over Facility Practices**:
   - The facility was criticized for keeping children in residential care longer than necessary, contrary to federal law and contractual obligations. There were reports of interference in planning and transitioning children out of the facility, with the director advocating for longer stays despite concerns.
   - The use of physical restraints was questioned, with data suggesting restraints were often used for non-emergency situations, such as children not following rules, rather than for self-harm or harm to others.

3. **Cultural and Oversight Issues**:
   - The committee expressed concerns about the facility's culture, which did not align with trauma-informed, evidence-based care required by federal law. The director was accused of viewing children who left the facility as "failures," raising questions about the effectiveness of the treatment provided.

4. **Social Media Policy Violations**:
   - A significant issue involved a staff member posting a photo of a child on social media, violating confidentiality and HIPAA regulations. The post, which included inappropriate commentary, was taken down after complaints, but the incident highlighted a lack of initial awareness of privacy laws.
   - Former employees testified about a toxic work environment where concerns were minimized, and staff who raised issues felt intimidated or harassed.

5. **Testimonies from Former Staff**:
   - Former employees, including therapists, shared experiences of feeling unsupported and micromanaged, with clinical decisions being overridden by the executive director. They reported instances of inappropriate treatment of children, including a case where a child was forced to report bowel movements to a male staff member.

6. **Calls for Systemic Change**:
   - The committee acknowledged the need for systemic reform in residential care facilities, emphasizing that firing individuals was not enough to address underlying issues. Recommendations included better oversight, improved staff training, and a shift toward trauma-informed care.

### **Legislative Initiatives and COVID-19 Updates**
1. **Committee Business**:
   - The committee approved the minutes from the December 17th meeting and discussed the establishment of a subcommittee to study House Bill FN.
   - Challenges in staffing committees were highlighted, with many members already serving on multiple committees.

2. **House Bill FN**:
   - Representative Yokela proposed a bill addressing the legality of minors possessing syringes, needles, and injectables like EpiPens without a prescription. The bill aims to prevent unnecessary legal consequences for minors and consider mental health or substance abuse issues instead.
   - A study committee or ad hoc group was suggested to further research and make recommendations on the issue.

3. **COVID-19 Updates**:
   - The state is evaluating COVID-19 data reliability as at-home testing becomes more prevalent. Hospitalizations and fatalities will be emphasized over case counts.
   - One million at-home COVID-19 tests were ordered and will be sold at cost through liquor stores.
   - Strike teams have been deployed to long-term care facilities to move residents out of hospitals and into appropriate care settings.

4. **Mental Health Initiatives**:
   - The department is expecting IMD waiver approval to attract private behavioral health providers and increase inpatient capacity through public-private partnerships.

5. **Syringe Services**:
   - Discussions included the legality of providing syringes to minors and the potential impact on public health. Some states allow syringe services to minors to reduce blood-borne diseases.

6. **Booster Blitz**:
   - The department successfully administered nearly 10,000 booster shots during a recent blitz, despite a snowstorm.

7. **Data Accuracy and Reporting**:
   - Concerns were raised about the accuracy of COVID-19 data, particularly with the rise of at-home testing. The department plans to include disclaimers about the potential underestimation of cases.

8. **Public Health Workforce**:
   - Funding was allocated to support public health workforce needs, including assistance for schools with contact tracing.

9. **Vaccination Efforts**:
   - The state is working to increase booster vaccination rates through mobile clinics, homebound programs, and public messaging. However, New Hampshire ranks low in booster dose administration nationally, partly due to data reporting issues.

10. **Infectious Diseases and Public Health**:
    - Representative Salloway provided a detailed historical perspective on emerging infectious diseases, emphasizing the need for robust public health systems to address evolving microbial threats.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with discussions on improving data accuracy, supporting public health infrastructure, and addressing ongoing challenges related to COVID-19 and mental health services. The committee emphasized the need for increased funding and resources for public health, better preparedness for future health crises, and improved oversight and accountability in child welfare services.
