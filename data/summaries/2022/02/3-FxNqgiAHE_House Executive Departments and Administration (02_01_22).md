**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration (02/01/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 1, 2022, covered a wide range of topics, focusing on bills related to retirement benefits, professional licensing, real estate transactions, Indigenous land acknowledgment, and administrative efficiency. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Retirement Benefits and Public Employee Fairness**
The committee reviewed three bills addressing retirement benefits for public employees:

1. **HB 1330**: Proposed eliminating the licensing requirement for medical technicians, as they are supervised by doctors and cannot work outside hospitals. Debate centered on whether to remove the licensing board entirely, with concerns about the amendment’s scope. The bill passed with amendments.

2. **HB 1497**: Aimed to ensure fairness in retirement system calculations by including current employees and new members. Clarifying language was added to avoid accidental exclusions. The bill passed with amendments.

3. **HB 1587**: Sought to partially restore retirement benefits for Group Two employees (e.g., firefighters, police) by including their highest five earning years in pension calculations. Supporters argued it would improve recruitment and retention, while opponents questioned its fiscal impact. The bill passed with a 3-2 vote and moved to the full committee and finance for further review.

### **Indigenous Land Acknowledgment**
**HB 1357**: Proposed adding a historical footnote in state documents acknowledging that New Hampshire’s land was once occupied by Indigenous peoples, specifically the Penacook and Abenaki tribes. Indigenous representatives testified in favor, emphasizing the bill’s role in reconciliation, education, and restorative justice. The bill was seen as a non-controversial step toward honoring Indigenous history and stewardship.

### **Real Estate Transactions and Consumer Protection**
1. **HB 1344**: Aimed to prevent unauthorized individuals, including real estate brokers, from signing purchase and sale agreements on behalf of property owners without a formal, notarized power of attorney. Supporters highlighted the need to protect vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, from financial exploitation. The bill was presented as a necessary consumer protection measure.

2. **HB 1354**: Addressed deferred payments for inactive real estate agents, ensuring they receive commissions for work done while active, even if they are no longer practicing. The bill was supported by the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) as a “housekeeping” measure to protect agents’ earnings.

### **Professional Licensing and Administrative Efficiency**
1. **HB 1182**: Proposed transitioning the Court Reporters Board from five members to three to address quorum issues. The OPLC supported the bill, noting it would streamline oversight and ensure continuity in licensing and discipline. Transitional language was suggested to allow existing board members to serve out their terms.

2. **HB 1446**: Sought to convert governing boards for recreational therapists and respiratory care practitioners into advisory boards due to quorum issues. The OPLC supported the bill, emphasizing the need for advisory input from professionals while improving administrative efficiency.

3. **HB 1460**: Aimed to eliminate age-based discrimination in occupational licensing, allowing qualified individuals of any age to obtain licenses. Concerns were raised about minors in certain professions, but the sponsor argued that age does not reflect competence. The bill also addressed conflicts with the state’s emancipation law.
