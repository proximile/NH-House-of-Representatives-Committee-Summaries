**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services (February 3, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 3, 2022, to address a range of labor, industrial, and rehabilitative services issues. The meeting featured discussions on unemployment benefits, immigration, workforce challenges, and various labor-related bills. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Immigration and Workforce Challenges**
1. **Immigrant Community Struggles**: Speakers highlighted the difficulties faced by immigrant communities, particularly mixed-status families, where undocumented parents cannot work, leaving the burden on U.S. citizen spouses. Immigrants often take on jobs Americans avoid, such as cleaning, construction, and landscaping. Advocates called for immigration reform and opposed bills that could exacerbate these challenges.

2. **Opposition to HB 1124 (E-Verify)**: HB 1124 proposed mandating the use of **E-Verify**, a federal system to verify work eligibility. Proponents argued it would ensure legal hiring practices, while opponents criticized its high error rates, potential for racial profiling, and burden on small businesses. Immigrant rights advocates emphasized the bill’s negative impact on immigrant workers and the state’s economy, calling for federal immigration reform instead.

### **Unemployment Benefits and Workforce Issues**
1. **HB 1337 (Unemployment Insurance Reforms)**: This bill proposes tying unemployment benefit duration to the state’s unemployment rate, reducing the maximum duration from 26 weeks to 12 weeks during low unemployment periods. Supporters argued it would strengthen the unemployment trust fund, reduce business taxes, and encourage faster re-employment. However, concerns were raised about its impact on seasonal workers, particularly in industries like construction, where layoffs are predictable.

2. **Historical Context and Trends**: New Hampshire’s unemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels (2.6%). The state’s unemployment system, established in 1951, has historically provided up to 26 weeks of benefits, with an average duration of 12 weeks. Stakeholders called for flexibility to address seasonal employment needs and ensure sustainability.

3. **Paid Family Leave Program**: Amanda Sears criticized the governor’s paid family leave program for excluding many workers, particularly those in small businesses. She advocated for a more inclusive program that ensures access to paid leave without fear of retaliation.

4. **Repeal of Granite State Family Leave Plan**: Representative Andrew Prout introduced a bill to repeal this taxpayer-funded program, arguing it could become mandatory and burden local governments. He suggested private insurance as an alternative.

### **Labor-Related Bills and Amendments**
1. **HB 1415 (Pre-Employment Health Screening Reimbursement)**: This bill proposed reimbursing employees for pre-employment health screening expenses, including travel costs. Concerns were raised about duplication of existing laws and potential burdens on employers.

2. **HB 1472 (Anti-Union Activities)**: This bill sought to prohibit employers from requiring employees to watch anti-union videos during training. Supporters argued it would level the playing field for unionization efforts, while the Department of Labor noted it doesn’t change existing penalty provisions.

3. **HB 1207 (Amendment for Voting Time)**: An amendment proposed allowing employees up to two hours off to vote if they lack three consecutive hours off during polling times. The amendment was defeated 11 to 10.

4. **Credit History in Employment**: A bill restricting the use of credit history in employment decisions was debated. An amendment was defeated 11 to 10, and the bill was recommended for further study.

5. **Heat and Cold in the Workplace**: Two bills addressing the impact of extreme temperatures on workers were combined into one. The combined bill was recommended for further study.

6. **Background Checks for Public Servants**: A bill requiring public servants to receive copies of pre-employment background investigations was discussed. Law enforcement officials opposed it, citing confidentiality concerns. The bill was recommended for further study.

7. **Late Payments in Workers' Compensation**: A bill addressing late payments in workers’ compensation was debated, with concerns raised about the lack of data on the issue. The bill was recommended for further study.

- **Worker Protections**: Bills addressing voting time, credit history, extreme workplace conditions, and unionization efforts highlighted the ongoing balance between worker protections and employer responsibilities.
- **Further Study**: Several bills, including those addressing credit history, workplace conditions, and background checks, were recommended for further study, reflecting the need for more data and discussion.

The meeting concluded with the committee scheduling further discussions for the following week, underscoring the complexity and importance of the issues addressed.
