   - **Testimony**:  
     - **Eric Swanson** (physicist) and **Mr. Hancock** (telecommunications expert) testified that 5G operates on **non-ionizing radiation**, which is regulated by the FCC and considered safe. They emphasized its benefits for **broadband access** and **emergency communications**.  
     - **Health advocates**, including **Cecilia Doucette**, raised concerns about **wireless radiation**, citing studies like the **BioInitiative Report** and cases of **microwave radiation syndrome**.  
   - **Debate**: The committee acknowledged the **complexity** of the issue, with conflicting scientific evidence on health risks.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **17-4** to recommend the bill for an **interim study**, allowing further examination of its implications. A subcommittee of eight members was formed to conduct the study.

2. **House Bill 1621: "Reggie Rebate" and RGGI Funds**

#### **Themes and Conclusions**  
The meeting highlighted several recurring themes:  
- **5G Technology**: The debate underscored the **tension between technological progress and public health concerns**, with calls for further research and balanced policy-making.  
- **Energy Efficiency**: Discussions on energy-related bills revealed a focus on **fiscal responsibility** and avoiding **redundancy** with existing programs.  
- **Environmental Initiatives**: Proposals like the Civilian Climate Corps and green bank faced skepticism over their necessity and potential costs.  

Ultimately, the committee recommended **ITL** for all major bills, reflecting a cautious approach to new legislation. However, the decision to conduct an **interim study** on HB 1644 and the filing of **minority reports** indicate ongoing interest in addressing these complex issues. The meeting concluded with reminders about upcoming public hearings and a call for careful driving due to snowy weather.
