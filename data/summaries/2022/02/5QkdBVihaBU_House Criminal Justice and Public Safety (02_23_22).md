**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Criminal Justice and Public Safety (02/23/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 23, 2022, focused on a wide range of bills related to criminal justice and public safety. Key discussions and outcomes included:

---

### **1. DUI and Interlock Device Legislation**
Several bills addressed the use of ignition interlock devices (IIDs) for individuals convicted of driving under the influence (DUI):
- **HB 1246**: Aimed to close a loophole allowing commercial vehicle drivers with out-of-state DUI convictions to operate without an IID in New Hampshire. Law enforcement testified that the bill would strengthen enforcement, but concerns were raised about state vs. federal authority over commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs).
- **HB 1085**: Proposed clarifying language requiring IIDs in any vehicle driven by a DUI offender, removing the ambiguous phrase "on a regular basis." Debate centered on whether IIDs should be required for all vehicles owned by the offender, even if not driven.
- **Enforcement and Calibration**: Discussions emphasized the need for monthly calibration of IIDs to ensure accuracy, with data used as evidence in court. A motion to pass a related bill passed 11-6.
- **Look-Back Period for DUI Offenses**: A bill extending the look-back period for third and fourth DUI offenses from 10 to 20 years was amended and passed unanimously.

### **2. Property Rights and Public Safety**
- **Purple Paint Bill (HB 1108)**: Proposed allowing landowners to use purple paint to mark no-trespassing zones instead of traditional signs. Opponents argued that purple paint is not widely recognized in New Hampshire and could cause confusion. The motion to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate (ITL) passed 12-8.

### **3. Cannabis and Psilocybin Legislation**
- **CACR 20 and CACR 35**: Constitutional amendments to legalize cannabis were debated, with opponents arguing that the issue should be addressed through legislation rather than a constitutional amendment. Both motions to ITL passed.
- **Psilocybin Decriminalization**: A bill to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms was discussed, with some acknowledging potential therapeutic benefits but expressing concerns about moving too quickly. The motion to ITL passed.

### **4. School Board Access and Transparency (HB 1072)**
This bill aimed to grant elected school board members access to school documents and facilities:
- **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about the bill’s broad language, which could allow access to sensitive documents like student IEPs, personnel files, and medical records, potentially violating privacy laws (e.g., FERPA).
- **Access to Facilities**: Concerns were also raised about disruptions to school operations if board members could enter facilities at any time.
- **Opposition**: Organizations like the New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA) and the National Education Association (NEA) opposed the bill, citing its vagueness and potential to undermine privacy and operational efficiency.

---

### **5. Criminal Justice and Parole Reform**
- **HB 1512**: Proposed parole reviews for certain prisoners after 25 years. Supporters argued for second chances, while opponents cited logistical challenges and lack of coordination with corrections officials. The motion to ITL passed 12-8.
- **HB 1145**: A bill to remove self-defense protections, particularly in home invasion cases, was overwhelmingly rejected (19-1) for undermining individual rights.

---

### **6. Other Key Discussions**
- **Poisoning Dogs**: A bill proposing penalties for poisoning dogs was deemed too complex and unclear. The motion to ITL passed.
- **Motor Vehicle Exception to Criminal Restraint**: A bill addressing motor vehicle exceptions to criminal restraint and false imprisonment was introduced but deemed inexpedient to legislate.
- **Marijuana Odor and Probable Cause (HB 1400)**: A bill addressing whether the odor of marijuana can be used as probable cause for a search was debated. The motion to recommend the bill passed, though some argued it was redundant given a prior NH Supreme Court ruling.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the following key themes:
1. **Public Safety vs. Individual Rights**: Discussions often balanced public safety concerns with the need to protect individual rights, particularly in cases like self-defense and cannabis legalization.
2. **Enforcement and Clarity**: Many bills were scrutinized for their enforceability, clarity, and alignment with existing laws, leading to frequent motions to ITL.
3. **Privacy and Transparency**: Bills like HB 1072 sparked debates about the balance between transparency in public institutions and the protection of sensitive information.
4. **Legislative vs. Constitutional Approaches**: Cannabis-related bills raised questions about whether issues like legalization should be addressed through legislation or constitutional amendments.

The meeting underscored the complexity of crafting effective legislation, with many bills requiring further refinement or additional public education before being reconsidered.
