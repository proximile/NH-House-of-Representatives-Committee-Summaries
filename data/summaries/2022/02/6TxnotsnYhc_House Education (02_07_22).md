**Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (02/07/22): Discussion on HB 1680 and Education Funding Reform**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 7, 2022, to discuss **House Bill 1680**, which proposes significant changes to the state’s education funding formula. The meeting highlighted the complexity of education funding reform, with a focus on equity, transparency, and the financial impact on districts and taxpayers. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed:

### **Key Components of HB 1680**
1. **Funding Formula Adjustments**:
   - The bill introduces a new **foundation budget formula** that incorporates weighted factors for student demographics, such as special education and English language learners, as well as district size. This aims to create a more equitable funding model.
   - A **10-year phase-in plan** is proposed, increasing the state’s obligation from 70% to 78% of the adjusted annual foundation opportunity budget.
   - A **5-year transition grant** is included to help districts adjust to the new model, with the grant gradually decreasing over time.

2. **State vs. Local Funding**:
   - The bill ensures the state covers 100% of "swept" funds (local funds retained by the state), improving financial transparency and reporting.
   - The **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)** is restructured, with 97% going to the state education trust fund and 3% retained by municipalities as a collection fee. This change could impact donor towns that currently retain more SWEPT revenue.

3. **Special Education Funding**:
   - Concerns were raised about the **4.29 weight factor** for special education funding. Some members advocated for more granular classifications based on specific student needs rather than a blanket weight.

4. **Hold Harmless Provision**:
   - In the first year, all districts would be **held harmless**, meaning no district would see a reduction in funding. This provision would phase out over five years.

5. **Local Contribution**:
   - The formula includes a **local contribution** based on a $5 per $1,000 tax rate applied to equalized property valuations. Districts unable to meet their foundation budget with this rate would receive additional state funding, while those exceeding it would not receive state aid.

### **Key Discussions and Concerns**
1. **Equity and Fairness**:
   - The committee emphasized the need to address **funding disparities** across districts, particularly for communities with varying property wealth. Some towns may lose SWEPT grants but could gain through state opportunity grants.
   - Comparisons were made to Massachusetts' **Chapter 70 funding model**, which directs state dollars to where they are needed most.

2. **Impact on Communities**:
   - Members stressed the importance of modeling the financial impacts of the bill for each community over a 10-year period to ensure clarity and transparency.
   - Concerns were raised about how the formula would affect **tuitioning students** to out-of-district schools and the need for accurate data to implement the formula effectively.

3. **Constitutional Considerations**:
   - The bill’s alignment with New Hampshire’s constitutional obligation to fund education **adequately and uniformly** was discussed, with a focus on closing opportunity gaps and improving educational outcomes statewide.

4. **Historical Context**:
   - The issue of **equitable school funding** has been a long-standing challenge in New Hampshire, dating back decades. Members underscored the urgency of addressing it now to ensure fairness and equity.

### **Interim Study Recommendation**
- The committee unanimously recommended that HB 1680 be sent to an **interim study** for further analysis. The study would:
  - Examine **student needs-driven costs**, the state property tax, and the impact of court decisions.
  - Refine the formula to ensure it aligns with the bill’s intent.
  - Explore the financial instruments needed to support the transition.

### **Next Steps**
- The interim study will allow the committee to address technical and policy challenges, refine the formula, and ensure it supports fairness and equity across all school districts.
- The committee emphasized the importance of **public communication** to clearly explain the bill’s benefits, particularly its impact on local property taxes and state grants.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of education funding reform and the need for careful analysis to ensure that HB 1680 achieves its goals of equity, transparency, and fairness. By addressing historical disparities and aligning with constitutional obligations, the bill aims to improve educational outcomes for all New Hampshire students. The interim study will play a critical role in refining the proposal and ensuring its successful implementation.
