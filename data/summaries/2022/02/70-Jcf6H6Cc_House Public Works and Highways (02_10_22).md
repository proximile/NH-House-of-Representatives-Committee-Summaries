The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee met on February 10, 2022, to discuss **House Bill 2022**, which pertains to the state’s 10-year transportation plan. Key topics and discussions included:

1. **Stratham’s Traffic Light Project**: Representative Pat Abramny requested acceleration of a traffic light project at NH 108 Bunker Hill Avenue, a long-standing priority for Stratham due to safety concerns. The project is currently scheduled for 2027, but Stratham seeks to move it to 2024 by reallocating funds from another project on Route 33.

2. **Hudson Circumferential Highway**: Representatives Jordan Ulery and Kim Rice emphasized the need for a $1 million feasibility study for the Hudson Circumferential Highway, a project left out of the current 10-year plan despite regional traffic issues. The Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed funding $250,000 in 2024 and $750,000 in 2025 for the study.

3. **Golf Links Road in Coos County**: Representatives and local officials advocated for reinstating funding for Golf Links Road, a critical road for the Balsams resort development. However, the committee did not support adding it to the plan due to funding constraints.

4. **Municipal Bridge Funding**: The committee discussed reallocating federal funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to accelerate municipal bridge projects. The DOT provided a detailed list of projects eligible for federal funding, which will be incorporated into the 10-year plan.

5. **Turnpike System Amendments**: The DOT proposed amendments to RSA 237 to streamline the process for Turnpike System projects, removing outdated language and aligning it with the 10-year plan. The committee approved this amendment.

6. **Other Discussions**: 
   - Representative McConkie proposed an annual report on traffic conditions for Route 153.
   - The DOT addressed concerns about pothole repairs and winter maintenance staffing.
   - The financial impact of removing toll plazas on the Everett Turnpike was discussed, with a total revenue loss of $1.7 million and $6 million in removal costs.

The committee is set to reconvene on February 24, 2022, to finalize amendments and vote on the bill.
