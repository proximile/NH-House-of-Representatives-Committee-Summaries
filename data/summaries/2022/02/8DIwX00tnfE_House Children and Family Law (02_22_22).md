The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Children and Family Law convened on February 22, 2022, to discuss **House Bill 1279**, which pertains to alimony laws. The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by Representative Roy presenting his testimony. He explained that the bill is tied to a previous bill (**House Bill 1278**) regarding alimony termination upon remarriage. The current bill seeks to remove the automatic termination of alimony upon remarriage, requiring courts to assess whether the remarriage actually elevates the recipient's standard of living before terminating alimony. Representative Roy emphasized that this change would prevent individuals from being financially trapped and unable to remarry due to the loss of alimony.

Committee members, including Representatives Ukela and Belangia, asked clarifying questions about the bill's intent and its relationship to the previous bill. Representative Roy noted that he is working on an amendment in collaboration with the judicial branch to ensure the bill does not create unnecessary burdens on the court system.

The hearing concluded without any further testimony, and the committee did not take any immediate action on the bill. The chairperson indicated that further communication would be provided regarding the next steps and any future meetings. Additionally, the committee discussed the status of other bills still pending in the committee and encouraged members to prepare for future discussions and amendments. The session ended with reminders for members to stay safe and announcements about upcoming caucus meetings for Republican members.
