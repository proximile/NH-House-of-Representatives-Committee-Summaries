The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on February 23, 2022, to address a range of issues related to environmental protection, water safety, and recreational regulations. The meeting was divided into three segments, each focusing on distinct topics but unified by themes of public health, environmental stewardship, and practical governance. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions from the session:

### Water Treatment and PFAS Contamination
The committee extensively discussed the issue of **PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)** contamination in drinking water, particularly in smaller water systems, schools, and childcare facilities. Key points included:
- **Water Treatment Methods**: Carbon filters and reverse osmosis were identified as effective methods for removing PFAS, though reverse osmosis was noted for its inefficiency due to water waste. Concerns were raised about newer PFAS compounds and their toxicity, as research remains ongoing.
- **Data Accessibility**: Representative Kelly emphasized the need for **publicly accessible data** on water safety, especially for smaller water systems and rural areas with limited internet access. While the data is already available, there was a call for it to be presented in a more user-friendly format.
- **Parental Notification**: The lack of mandatory notification for parents about water contamination was a recurring concern. The committee stressed the importance of **better communication and transparency** to address public anxieties.
- **Interim Study Proposal**: House Bill 1602, which addresses perfluorinated chemicals in drinking water, was sent to an interim study. This allows time to review progress on water treatment and data accessibility issues, with plans to revisit the bill in the fall if sufficient progress hasn’t been made.

### PFAS Testing in Schools and Childcare Facilities
The committee also focused on the challenges of implementing **PFAS testing** in schools and childcare facilities:
- **Financial and Logistical Concerns**: Small business owners, particularly those running daycare centers and schools, expressed concerns about the financial burden of mandatory PFAS testing. The discussion centered on who should bear the cost and the logistical challenges of widespread testing.
- **Proposed Amendment and DES Proposal**: An amendment (0.585) was proposed to exempt schools on public water supplies from testing requirements. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) suggested a voluntary testing approach for private wells over the next year to gather data without imposing immediate regulatory burdens.
- **Funding and Remediation**: Concerns were raised about **unfunded mandates**, as schools and childcare facilities might have to pay for remediation if PFAS is detected. DES has some funding for initial testing but acknowledged uncertainty about long-term remediation funding.
- **Public Notification and Transparency**: The bill requires parents to be notified within five days of a positive PFAS test, though DES’s proposal does not mandate this. There was a strong push for making PFAS testing results publicly available to ensure transparency.

### Executive Session: Bills and Amendments
In the executive session, the committee addressed multiple bills and amendments, with a focus on environmental, recreational, and safety issues:
- **House Bill 1066**: An amendment was passed to direct DES to develop a plan for addressing cyanobacteria blooms by November 2023, rather than establishing a commission. The bill was approved with the amendment.
- **House Bill 1071**: The bill proposing regulations on wake surfing was deemed “inexpedient to legislate” (ITL) after concerns about enforcement challenges and potential impacts on tourism.
- **House Bill 1109**: The bill addressing off-highway recreational vehicle (OHRV) use on certain roads was amended to clarify the process for towns to authorize or rescind OHRV use. It passed unanimously.
- **House Bill 1128**: The committee voted to send the issue of liability for damages caused by OHRVs on Class VI roads to a commission for further study, passing the motion to ITL.
- **House Bill 1292**: The bill allowing drones on the statewide trail system was unanimously ITL’d due to concerns about private landowner rights and liability.
- **House Bill 1317**: The bill requiring annual reports on electric and gasoline-powered watercraft was ITL’d, with the committee citing redundancy with existing practices.
- **House Bill 1438**: The bill addressing mooring regulations was ITL’d, citing existing programs and liability concerns.
- **House Bill 1532**: The bill permitting a dam on Big Pea Porridge Pond was unanimously ITL’d, with the committee emphasizing the need for better communication and non-legislative solutions.
- **House Bill 1555**: The bill proposing to repeal the permit requirement for campfires at campgrounds was sent to interim study due to fire safety concerns.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to balancing public health, environmental protection, and practical governance. Key decisions included sending House Bill 1602 to interim study, approving House Bill 1066 with amendments, and rejecting several bills due to concerns about enforcement, liability, or redundancy. The committee emphasized the importance of **transparency, data accessibility, and collaboration** in addressing complex issues like PFAS contamination and recreational regulations.
