The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 22, 2022, addressed several key bills, with significant focus on **House Bill 1424** (speed limits on Lake Winnipesaukee) and **House Bill 1000** (anti-profiling for motorcyclists), as well as **House Bill 1643** (driver’s license compliance) and **House Bill 1570** (vehicle registration fees). Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

---

### **House Bill 1000: Anti-Profiling for Motorcyclists**
- **Purpose**: This bill seeks to prevent law enforcement from stopping or profiling motorcyclists solely based on their attire (e.g., leather jackets, vests) or affiliation with motorcycle clubs.
- **Testimonies**: Motorcyclists shared personal experiences of being unfairly targeted, including being pulled over without cause, denied volunteer opportunities, or questioned due to their appearance.
- **Legislative History**: New Hampshire has previously enacted laws to prevent motorcycle-only checkpoints and discriminatory practices, but proponents argue additional protections are necessary.
- **Committee Action**: The committee unanimously voted **14-0** to recommend the bill for passage, emphasizing that discrimination based on appearance is unacceptable.

### **House Bill 1424: Speed Limits on Lake Winnipesaukee**
This bill proposes to adjust or eliminate the speed limit on Lake Winnipesaukee, particularly in the "Broads," a large, open area of the lake. The discussion featured extensive testimony from stakeholders, including residents, business owners, boaters, and environmental advocates.

#### **Key Arguments from Opponents:**
1. **Safety Concerns**: Opponents argued that the current speed limits (45 mph daytime, 30 mph nighttime) have made the lake safer for families, kayakers, and other recreational users. Removing or increasing the limit could endanger these groups and lead to more accidents.
2. **Environmental Impact**: High-speed boats threaten wildlife, particularly loons, and could cause erosion and sediment disturbance, harming the lake ecosystem.
3. **Economic and Recreational Value**: The lake’s reputation for safety and tranquility attracts tourists and supports local businesses. Removing speed limits could deter visitors and harm the economy.
4. **Public Support**: Surveys and past legislative votes show strong public support for maintaining the current speed limits.
5. **Enforcement Challenges**: Marine Patrol is understaffed, and enforcing speed limits is already difficult, especially with increased boat traffic.

#### **Key Arguments from Supporters:**
1. **Freedom and Responsibility**: Supporters argued that responsible boaters should have the freedom to enjoy high-performance boats, especially in the broads.
2. **Economic Contributions**: High-performance boat owners contribute significantly to the local economy through marinas, restaurants, and other businesses.
3. **Lack of Evidence**: Supporters claimed there is no evidence that the current speed limit has improved safety or reduced accidents.
4. **Compromise**: Some suggested maintaining nighttime speed limits while allowing higher speeds during the day in specific areas.

#### **Additional Points:**
- **150-Foot Rule**: Richard Spaulding emphasized the importance of enforcing the 150-foot rule, which prohibits high-speed boating within 150 feet of shore or other vessels.
- **Accident Data**: Most boating accidents are caused by natural hazards or close-quarter maneuvering rather than speed.
- **Marine Patrol Perspective**: Captain Tim Dunleavy noted that while speed is rarely a significant factor in accidents, repealing speed limits would remove a key regulatory tool.

### **House Bill 1643: Driver’s License Compliance**
- **Purpose**: This bill aims to amend **RSA 263:35**, requiring new residents to transfer their out-of-state driver’s licenses to New Hampshire licenses within 60 days. It introduces additional reporting requirements and minor penalties for non-compliance.
- **Key Points**:
  - Addresses the low compliance rate (15.5%) of individuals who registered to vote in the 2016 general election using out-of-state licenses but did not obtain a New Hampshire license.
  - Requires individuals to report changes in personal circumstances within 60 days and introduces a zero-cost form for reporting non-compliance.
- **Opposition Concerns**: Critics argued the bill could lead to ongoing fines, disproportionately affect college students and military personnel, and create enforcement challenges.
- **Support**: Proponents emphasized improving voter registration integrity and addressing non-compliance with residency laws.

### **House Bill 1570: Vehicle Registration Fees**
- **Purpose**: This bill proposes reducing vehicle registration fees by adjusting the millage rate schedule, effectively lowering fees for newer vehicles.
- **Key Points**:
  - Aims to alleviate the financial burden of high registration fees, especially as vehicle prices rise due to inflation.
  - Rolls forward the millage rate schedule by one year, reducing first-year registration fees.
- **Opposition Concerns**: Critics highlighted the significant revenue loss for towns and cities, which rely on registration fees for general funds, potentially leading to property tax increases.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that registration fees function like property taxes and should be tied to actual automotive-related expenses.

### **Overall Themes:**
- **Motorcycle Profiling**: HB 1000 seeks to protect motorcyclists from unfair targeting based on appearance or affiliation.
- **Lake Winnipesaukee Speed Limits**: HB 1424 sparked a heated debate between safety, environmental, and economic concerns versus personal freedom and economic contributions of high-performance boaters.
- **Driver’s License Compliance**: HB 1643 focused on improving compliance with residency and voter registration laws but faced opposition over enforcement and unintended consequences.
- **Vehicle Registration Fees**: HB 1570 aimed to reduce financial burdens on residents but raised concerns about its impact on municipal budgets.

The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing safety, individual rights, economic impacts, and enforcement challenges in New Hampshire’s legislative process.
