**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting on February 8, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 8, 2022, to discuss several key bills related to energy policy, renewable energy, and pipeline safety. The meeting featured extensive debates, public testimonies, and detailed discussions on the following bills and topics:

### **1. Net Metering and Renewable Energy Policies**
The committee focused heavily on **House Bill 1599**, **House Bill 1596**, and **House Bill 1629**, all of which address net metering and renewable energy generation. Key points included:
- **House Bill 1599**: This bill aims to adjust net metering compensation by subtracting the cost of compliance with the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Supporters argued it would eliminate cost-shifting from solar adopters to non-adopters, particularly impacting lower-income individuals. Opponents, including Clean Energy New Hampshire and the Granite State Hydropower Association, contended it was premature and should await the results of the **Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER)** study, expected in spring 2023.
- **House Bill 1596**: The bill proposes increasing net metering limits from 1 to 5 megawatts to encourage private investment in renewable energy and align New Hampshire with neighboring states like Massachusetts and Vermont. Proponents highlighted economic and environmental benefits, while critics raised concerns about cost-shifting, grid stability, and the need for battery storage.
- **House Bill 1629**: This bill seeks to redefine the default service rate for net metering by excluding certain costs (e.g., ISO forward capacity market payments, RPS compliance costs) from the compensation for electricity exported to the grid. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Department of Energy (DOE), argued the bill was premature and could undermine the economics of net metering.

### **2. Local Energy Generation and Opposition**
Representatives discussed the challenges of local energy generation projects, including opposition to trash-to-energy facilities and large-scale solar projects, often referred to as "NIMBYism" (Not In My Backyard). Examples from Northampton, Massachusetts, and Level Maine were highlighted, emphasizing the complexities of balancing renewable energy development with community concerns.

### **3. Municipal Host Bill and Renewable Projects**
The **Municipal Host Bill**, passed in the previous year, allows group net metering for municipalities. Several hydroelectric facilities have already registered as municipal hosts, and ongoing negotiations for additional projects were discussed.

### **4. Natural Gas Pipeline Safety**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 1491**, which focuses on natural gas transmission pipeline safety. The bill requires developers to notify pipeline operators within 1,000 feet of a proposed development to prevent unsafe construction practices. An amendment shifted the notification responsibility from local land use boards to developers, reducing municipal costs. The bill was supported by stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Home Builders Association and TC Energy, as a proactive safety measure.

### **5. Public Testimonies and Stakeholder Input**
Public testimonies were provided by various stakeholders, including municipal representatives, energy advocates, and industry experts. Supporters of net metering bills emphasized the need for fair compensation and incentives for renewable energy, while critics raised concerns about cost-shifting, grid stability, and the need for comprehensive data from ongoing studies like the VDER study.

### **6. Legislative Process and PUC Role**
The role of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in rate-making and the legislative authority to override PUC decisions were discussed. Many stakeholders emphasized the importance of waiting for the completion of the VDER study before making legislative changes.

### **7. Closing Remarks and Future Plans**
The meeting concluded with procedural updates, including plans for upcoming work subcommittee sessions and executive sessions to address remaining bills. The chair thanked committee members for a productive day and reminded them of upcoming events, including the governor’s State of the State address.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Complexity of Net Metering**: The discussions highlighted the complexities of net metering, including cost-shifting, social equity, and the need for data-driven policy decisions.
- **Renewable Energy Development**: There was a strong focus on expanding renewable energy opportunities while addressing community opposition and grid stability concerns.
- **Pipeline Safety**: House Bill 1491 was widely supported as a proactive measure to enhance pipeline safety and prevent conflicts between developers and pipeline operators.
- **Legislative Timing**: Many stakeholders stressed the importance of waiting for ongoing studies, such as the VDER study, to inform legislative decisions.

Overall, the meeting underscored the challenges and opportunities in advancing New Hampshire’s energy policies, with a focus on balancing economic, environmental, and social equity considerations.
