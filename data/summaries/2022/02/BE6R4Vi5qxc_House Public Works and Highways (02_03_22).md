**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (February 3, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Public Works and Highways Committee convened on February 3, 2022, to discuss a wide range of transportation-related topics, focusing on project advancements, federal funding opportunities, public engagement, and policy updates. The meeting highlighted several key initiatives and challenges, emphasizing collaboration with federal and local stakeholders.

### **Key Discussions and Decisions:**

1. **House Bill 2022 and Straw Polls**  
   The session began with a reminder that microphones were live for public viewing. The committee planned to conduct straw polls on proposed amendments to House Bill 2022, with the commissioner expected to provide additional information and address questions from absent members.

2. **Hudson Boulevard Project**  
   The committee revisited the Hudson Boulevard project, designed to alleviate congestion on Route 3A in Hudson. Initially part of a larger circumferential highway plan, the project stalled due to environmental concerns. The town of Hudson is considering a feasibility study to reassess its viability, with costs estimated at up to $1 million. Federal funding was identified as necessary, as turnpike revenues would not be appropriate for this project.

3. **Resiliency and Federal PROTECT Program**  
   The committee reviewed the new federal PROTECT program, which provides $5.8 million in its first year to New Hampshire for improving transportation infrastructure resilience. The Department of Transportation (DOT) plans to allocate these funds to its Culvert Replacement, Rehabilitation, and Drainage Repair (CRDR) program, focusing on smaller projects and larger-scale investments identified through a coastal flood risk tolerance framework.

4. **Capital Corridor Rail Project**  
   The Capital Corridor Rail Project, aiming to establish commuter rail service between Lowell, MA, and Manchester, NH, was discussed. The project development phase is ongoing, with efforts focused on identifying station locations, layover facilities, and service frequency. Financial plans and cost estimates are being refined, with completion targeted for early 2023. The project will likely require competitive federal discretionary grants, though future funding and timing remain uncertain.

5. **Continental Boulevard Maintenance**  
   The committee reviewed the ongoing maintenance costs for Continental Boulevard in Merrimack, which amount to approximately $80,000 annually, primarily for winter maintenance. The road, last resurfaced in 2017, is about halfway through its service life.

6. **Sound Walls and Noise Mitigation**  
   Extensive discussions were held on sound walls, including eligibility criteria and construction processes. The committee considered forming a study committee to review sound wall rules and policies, particularly in areas near highways and schools. The DOT emphasized adherence to federal guidelines for noise mitigation and the importance of equity in sound wall projects.

7. **Toll Removal and Revenue Impact**  
   The committee reviewed the removal of tolls at exits 10, 11, and 12 in Merrimack, including the costs of dismantling toll infrastructure and the resulting revenue loss. The DOT provided detailed estimates and discussed the broader impact on the transportation budget.

8. **Proposed Amendments**  
   - **Amendment 2022-0281H**: Proposed transferring ownership of the state-owned portion of Continental Boulevard in Merrimack to the town by July 1, 2025. The committee approved this in a straw poll.  
   - **Amendment 2022-0261H**: Proposed relocating the mainline toll plaza on the F.E. Everett Turnpike to the vicinity of exit 10 and converting it to all-electronic tolling. This was also approved in a straw poll.

9. **10-Year Transportation Plan**  
   The committee discussed updates to the 10-year transportation plan, including funding allocations for various projects and the need for additional federal funds to address shortfalls. They also considered language updates to RSA 237-2 to reflect the value of projects in the plan.

10. **Public Engagement and Coordination**  
    The committee emphasized the importance of public engagement and workshops for the Hudson Boulevard and Capital Corridor projects. They also discussed coordinating with other agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, to address overlapping needs in transportation and flood protection.

11. **Public Hearing and Executive Session**  
    A public hearing was scheduled for the following week to discuss House Bill 2022 and related bills. The committee also planned an executive session to finalize amendments and address remaining bills by February 24th.

### **Conclusion:**  
The meeting underscored the committeeâ€™s focus on advancing critical transportation projects, leveraging federal funding, and ensuring public and stakeholder input in the planning process. Challenges such as funding uncertainties, environmental concerns, and maintenance costs were acknowledged, with a commitment to addressing these issues through collaborative and strategic efforts. The committee aims to complete its work by early 2023, with a strong emphasis on transparency and accuracy in cost estimates and project planning.
