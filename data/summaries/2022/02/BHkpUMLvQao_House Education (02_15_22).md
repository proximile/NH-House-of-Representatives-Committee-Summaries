The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee met on February 15, 2022, to discuss several key education-related bills, with a primary focus on anti-discrimination protections, education standards, and the controversial Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) program. The meeting included extensive debates, public testimonies, and discussions on the implications of these policies for students, families, and the state’s education system. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Anti-Discrimination Protections (House Bill 1607)**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1607**, which aims to prohibit unlawful discrimination in public and non-public schools that receive public funds. Key points included:

1. **Purpose**: The bill seeks to expand anti-discrimination protections to schools receiving public funds, ensuring no discrimination based on protected classes such as race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and economic status. It aligns with the state board of education’s mission to provide equitable educational opportunities.

2. **Support and Testimonies**:
   - Advocates, including the NEA New Hampshire and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, argued that public funds should not support discriminatory practices. They emphasized the need for consistent anti-discrimination standards across all schools.
   - Personal testimonies highlighted the struggles of transgender students and other marginalized groups facing discrimination in non-public schools.

3. **Concerns and Debates**:
   - Enforcement: Questions arose about whether the state board of education or the Human Rights Commission should handle discrimination claims in schools receiving public funds.
   - Scope: Discussions centered on whether private schools, especially religious or single-gender institutions, should be subject to the same anti-discrimination standards as public schools.
   - Process: Concerns were raised about clarity in the process for parents filing discrimination claims and potential overlaps between state agencies.

4. **Outcome**: The committee explored whether the bill would create redundancy or confusion in enforcement mechanisms, with supporters arguing it is necessary to ensure all students are protected from discrimination when public funds are involved.

### **Education Standards and Adequate Education (House Bill 1671)**
The committee also debated **House Bill 1671**, which focuses on defining the content of an adequate education. Key points included:

1. **Core Academic Focus**: The bill emphasizes core subjects like English, math, science, and social studies, aiming to ensure students receive foundational knowledge and skills for success. It excludes some areas like world languages and computer programming, which are considered less essential for foundational education.

2. **Integrated Education**: Discussions centered on the challenges of integrated education, with concerns about students missing foundational knowledge in subjects like algebra.

3. **Equity Gaps**: Commissioner Frank Edelblut highlighted stagnant student performance and widening equity gaps, arguing that the education system has become a divider rather than an equalizer. The bill seeks to refocus efforts on core academic areas to improve outcomes.

4. **Flexibility and Local Control**: Representatives debated the balance between state standards and local district flexibility, with some advocating for integrating subjects like arts and technology into core areas.

5. **Questions and Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the bill’s potential impact on closing opportunity gaps, particularly in low-income communities, and the lack of collaboration with educators and stakeholders in drafting the bill.

### **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) Program**
The EFA program, which allows families to use state funds for private school tuition or homeschooling costs, was a major point of contention. Discussions included:

1. **Program Overview**: The EFA program provides financial assistance for families to choose alternative educational options, such as private schools, homeschooling, or specialized programs.

2. **Support for EFAs**:
   - Parents and advocates shared personal success stories, emphasizing how EFAs have transformed educational experiences for children with special needs, learning disabilities, or those who struggled in public schools.
   - Supporters argued that EFAs provide low-income families with access to quality education and empower parental choice.

3. **Concerns and Opposition**:
   - Critics raised concerns about the program’s lack of accountability, financial oversight, and potential for fraud. They highlighted that the program has exceeded its budget by over $8 million, with potential taxpayer exposure exceeding $70 million.
   - Opponents argued that EFAs divert funding from public schools, which are already underfunded, and could violate the state constitution by indirectly supporting religious schools.

4. **Proposed Reforms**: Several bills were introduced to address these issues, including setting minimum standards for service providers, requiring criminal background checks, and eliminating the third-party contractor that takes a 10% administrative fee.

5. **Repeal Proposal (House Bill 1683)**: Representative David Luno argued for repealing the EFA program, calling it a "bad voucher program" that lacks accountability and transparency. Supporters of the program urged lawmakers to protect it as a lifeline for families seeking better educational opportunities.

1. **Equity and Discrimination**: The meeting highlighted the importance of ensuring equitable access to education and protecting students from discrimination, particularly in schools receiving public funds.
2. **Education Standards**: Discussions emphasized the need to refocus education on core academic areas while addressing systemic inequities and improving student outcomes.
3. **School Choice and Accountability**: The EFA program sparked intense debate over parental choice, financial accountability, and the role of public schools in serving all students.
4. **Public Testimonies and Personal Stories**: Parents, educators, and students passionately shared their experiences, underscoring the transformative impact of educational choice and the challenges faced by marginalized groups in traditional school settings.
