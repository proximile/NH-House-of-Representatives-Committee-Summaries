**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (February 24, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 24, 2022, to discuss and vote on a wide range of bills related to liquor licensing, insurance, consumer affairs, renewable energy, homeowners associations (HOAs), and small business regulations. The meeting was marked by detailed debates, with a focus on clarity, enforceability, and balancing state oversight with local autonomy and individual rights.

### **Key Discussions and Decisions:**

#### **Liquor Licensing**
1. **HB 1039**: Clarified that beverage manufacturers do not need to operate at off-premise locations and repealed unused multi-year liquor licenses. It also addressed compliance issues for businesses that lose their liquor licenses.
2. **HB 1583**: Removed restrictions on liquor store locations and hours of operation, giving the Liquor Commission discretion over holidays like Easter to avoid offending religious groups.
3. **HB 1613**: Reduced licensing fees for farmers and small businesses, supported by the Liquor Commission for its broad implications for small business growth.
4. **HB 1556**: Addressed the use of separate cash registers for different liquor licenses. The committee opted for an interim study to ensure clarity and avoid unnecessary burdens on businesses.

#### **Insurance**
1. **HB 1558**: Passed unanimously, related to insurance holding companies.
2. **HB 1019**: Proposed replacing certain professional licenses with mandatory liability insurance. The committee voted to indefinitely postpone the bill, deeming it unenforceable and unnecessary.
3. **HB 1559**: Adjusted non-forfeiture amounts for individual deferred annuities to align with national standards, as requested by the Insurance Department.

#### **Renewable Energy and HOAs**
1. **Solar Panels and HOAs**: A bill aimed at preventing HOAs from restricting homeowners from installing solar panels sparked debate. Supporters emphasized the benefits of renewable energy, while opponents highlighted the importance of respecting private property rights and deed restrictions. The bill was seen as enabling legislation rather than a mandate.
2. **PFAS Warning Labels**: A bill requiring warning labels on products containing PFAS was considered but deemed premature. The committee opted to continue studying the issue.

#### **Consumer Privacy and Online Regulation**
1. **Online Consumer Privacy**: A bill addressing the privacy of online consumer information was discussed but ultimately killed due to concerns about enforcement and the complexity of regulating internet service providers.

#### **Small Business Regulations**
1. **Food Truck Licensing (HB 1595)**: The committee debated a bill proposing a statewide food truck license to override local regulations. Concerns about local autonomy and revenue loss led to a preference for an interim study to explore streamlined licensing methodologies.
2. **Pushcart and Hot Dog Stand Regulations (HB 1043)**: The committee recommended killing a bill addressing pushcart regulations, as existing regulations already allowed for the sale of pre-packaged items, making the bill redundant.
3. **Study Committee on Small Business Food Regulations**: The committee considered forming a study committee to examine food-related regulations for small businesses but preferred to keep the study in-house.

#### **Cryptocurrency and UCC Legislation**
1. **HB 1503**: A bill related to cryptocurrency and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was discussed. Concerns about fraud and money laundering were raised, but the committee acknowledged the federal government’s move toward digital currencies. They decided to wait for a revised version of the bill before taking further action.

#### **Paid Family Leave Program**
1. The committee voted to interim study a bill repealing the Granite State Paid Family Leave Program, as a similar bill was being considered in the Labor Committee.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes:**
- **Clarity and Practicality**: The committee emphasized the importance of clear, enforceable legislation, particularly in liquor licensing and small business regulations.
- **Balancing Interests**: Debates highlighted the need to balance state oversight with local autonomy, individual property rights, and community agreements, especially in cases involving HOAs and renewable energy.
- **Interim Studies**: Many complex issues, such as online privacy, PFAS contamination, and food truck licensing, were referred to interim studies for further research and discussion.
- **Efficiency**: Representatives expressed a desire to streamline meetings, aiming to consolidate discussions into a single day to reduce travel and improve efficiency.

The meeting concluded with plans to revisit certain bills in the future, reflecting the committee’s commitment to thoughtful, well-informed decision-making.
