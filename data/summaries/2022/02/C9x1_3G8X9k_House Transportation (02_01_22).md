### **Railroad Safety and Habitual Offender Processes**
1. **House Bill 1160: Obedience to Signals at Railroad Crossings**

   - The bill focuses on "maintenance of way" equipment, excluding recreational rail vehicles.  

2. **House Bill 1239: Virtual Offender Hearings**  
   - Introduced by Representative Tom Walsh, this bill seeks to streamline the habitual offender certification process by allowing notices to be sent via first-class mail instead of in-hand service by law enforcement.  
   - Supporters, including Christopher Casco of the Bureau of Hearings, argued this would expedite the process and reduce law enforcement involvement.  
   - Opponents, such as Merrimack County Attorney Paul Halvorson, raised concerns about proving offenders knowingly violated their status if notices are mailed.

   - Supporters, including the American Friends Service Committee, highlighted benefits such as increased road safety, reduced burden on law enforcement, and improved trust with immigrant communities.  
   - Opponents raised concerns about the bill potentially making New Hampshire a "sanctuary state" and undermining federal immigration enforcement.  

4. **House Bill 1093: Temporary Driver’s Licenses for Asylum Seekers**

5. **House Bill 1024: Local Speed Limits**
