The February 10, 2022, meeting of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee centered on several critical pieces of legislation related to reproductive rights, including **House Bill 1673**, **House Bill 1674**, and **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 18 (CACR18)**. The discussions and testimonies highlighted the deeply polarizing nature of abortion legislation, with strong arguments on both sides of the debate. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

### **House Bill 1673: Repeal of the Fetal Life Protection Act (FLPA)**
The **Fetal Life Protection Act (FLPA)**, enacted in 2021, imposes a **24-week ban on abortions** with limited exceptions and mandates ultrasounds for all abortions. **House Bill 1673** seeks to repeal this law, sparking heated and emotional debates. Key points included:

1. **Support for Repeal**:
   - **Medical and Ethical Concerns**: Providers and advocates argued the FLPA is **cruel, arbitrary**, and **medically unnecessary**, particularly for cases involving **fetal anomalies incompatible with life** or **maternal health risks**. Testimonies highlighted the emotional and physical toll on women forced to carry non-viable pregnancies or seek care out of state.
   - **Impact on Providers**: Doctors expressed concern over **criminal penalties** and **civil liability**, which they argued create a **chilling effect** on providing care and deter recruitment of healthcare providers in New Hampshire.
   - **Equity and Access**: Advocates noted the FLPA disproportionately affects **low-income women**, **rural residents**, and **survivors of domestic violence**, who may lack resources to travel out of state for care.

2. **Opposition to Repeal**:
   - **Protection of Fetal Life**: Opponents argued the FLPA protects **unborn children** at 24 weeks, a point when many can survive outside the womb. Personal stories were shared emphasizing the **value of every life** and opposing late-term abortions.
   - **Moral and Legal Arguments**: Proponents of the FLPA argued that **abortion is a moral issue**, with **New Hampshire Right to Life** representatives stating that the law reflects a **broad consensus** against late-term abortions.
   - **Concerns About Repeal**: Opponents warned that repealing the FLPA would make New Hampshire one of the **most permissive states** on abortion, allowing abortions up to the moment of birth for any reason.

### **House Bill 1674: Access to Abortion Care Act**
**House Bill 1674**, the **Access to Abortion Care Act**, aims to codify abortion rights into state law. Key points included:

1. **Support for Abortion Rights**: Multiple speakers, including representatives, advocates, and constituents, expressed strong support for ensuring access to safe and legal abortion, especially in light of the potential overturning of **Roe v. Wade** by the U.S. Supreme Court.
2. **Personal Stories**: Several individuals shared personal experiences, emphasizing the importance of reproductive choice in their lives.
3. **Economic and Health Impacts**: Testimonies underscored the economic and health impacts of denying abortion access, including increased poverty, financial instability, and health complications for women.
4. **State Values and Bipartisan Support**: Speakers referenced New Hampshire's history of bipartisan support for reproductive rights and argued that protecting abortion access aligns with the state's values of personal privacy and individual liberty.
5. **Opposition to Restrictions**: While some speakers acknowledged existing restrictions, such as New Hampshire's 24-week abortion ban, they stressed that **HB 1674** does not seek to change current laws but rather to enshrine the right to abortion care within the existing legal framework.

### **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 18 (CACR18)**
**CACR18** seeks to enshrine reproductive rights into the New Hampshire State Constitution, protecting the right to make personal reproductive medical decisions, including abortion, without state interference. Key points included:

1. **Introduction of CACR18**: Representative Amanda Elizabeth Toll, the primary sponsor, introduced the resolution, emphasizing that reproductive justice includes the right to make autonomous decisions about reproductive health.
2. **Scope of the Amendment**: CACR18 is broad, covering all reproductive medical decisions, including abortion and sterilization. It is designed to prevent state interference in these decisions and to ensure protections regardless of changes in political control.
3. **Support for Reproductive Rights**: Multiple representatives and advocates spoke in favor of the amendment, highlighting the importance of reproductive freedom, the potential overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, and the need for constitutional protections.
4. **Concerns and Opposition**: Some representatives raised concerns about the broad language of the amendment, potential unintended consequences, and the lack of specificity regarding age and gender.

### **Key Themes and Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the **polarizing nature of abortion legislation**, with strong arguments on both sides. Advocates for reproductive rights emphasized **patient autonomy**, **medical expertise**, and **equity**, while opponents focused on **fetal protection**, **moral considerations**, and **legal enforcement**. The outcome of these bills will have significant implications for abortion access and healthcare in New Hampshire, highlighting the urgent need for legislative action to safeguard reproductive freedom.
