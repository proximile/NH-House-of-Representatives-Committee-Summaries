### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Ways and Means Committee, February 2, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 2, 2022, convened by the House Ways and Means Committee, addressed a wide range of critical issues, including taxation, workforce development, opioid crisis response, and property tax policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Taxation and Interstate Commerce**
- **Remote Work Taxation**: A significant portion of the meeting focused on the taxation of New Hampshire residents working remotely for out-of-state companies, particularly in light of Massachusetts' emergency order taxing such income during the COVID-19 pandemic. The state had previously challenged this policy in the U.S. Supreme Court, but the case was not heard. Representatives debated whether to craft state legislation to protect residents from out-of-state taxation, with concerns about potential legal and administrative challenges. The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and the Attorney General’s office expressed willingness to collaborate on refining the bill’s language.
- **Business Taxes**: There was a discussion about the fiscal implications of reducing the Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET). Some members advocated for a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for further study to understand the long-term impacts of recent tax cuts and stimulus payments on New Hampshire’s economy.

#### **2. Workforce Development and National Service Alumni Fund**
- **National Service Alumni Attraction and Retention Fund**: The committee reviewed **House Bill 1524**, which proposes a fund to attract and retain AmeriCorps and Peace Corps alumni in New Hampshire by providing matching incentives for education awards. The bill requested $750,000 from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) over three years. Concerns were raised about the lack of a clear funding mechanism and potential conflicting obligations for the commissioner. The committee agreed to work on an amendment to clarify the funding cap and align the bill with legislative intent.

#### **3. Opioid Crisis and Settlement Funds**
- **Opioid Abatement Trust Fund**: The committee discussed **House Bill 1565-F**, which pertains to the distribution of funds from opioid-related settlements. Currently, 85% of funds are distributed based on need through a grant system, while 15% is allocated to 23 municipalities that filed lawsuits. A proposed bill seeks to change this to a 60-40 split, increasing the municipalities’ share to 40%. Representatives debated the fairness and effectiveness of the distribution formula, with concerns about "double counting" populations and the need for data-driven decision-making. The Opioid Abatement Commission oversees the distribution process, aiming to allocate funds quickly and fairly to address the crisis.
- **National Settlements**: New Hampshire is part of national settlements with major opioid distributors and manufacturers, expected to bring significant funds over the next 18 years. The state has opted out of some settlements, such as the one with Johnson & Johnson, to pursue independent legal action.

#### **4. Property Tax Exemptions and Car Rental Tax**
- **Property Tax Exemption for Communication Services**: The committee reviewed **House Bill 1494**, which proposes a property tax exemption for certain communication service leases. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on local tax rates and the fairness of exempting phone and cable companies from property taxes on public right-of-ways.
- **Car Rental Tax Repeal**: A bill proposing the repeal of the tax on car rentals under the meals and rooms tax was discussed. Enterprise Rent-A-Car provided data indicating that most rentals are to New Hampshire residents. Representatives considered the economic effects of repealing the tax and compared New Hampshire’s tax rates with those of other states.

#### **5. L-CHIP Program and Low-Wage Employers**
- **L-CHIP Program Expansion**: The committee reviewed a bill to include agricultural resources under the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (L-CHIP). Concerns were raised about the potential risks of expanding the program, with some suggesting it might dilute its effectiveness. Representatives from organizations like the Nature Conservancy and the Forest Society supported keeping the program focused on its current priorities.
- **Business Profits Tax for Low-Wage Employers**: A bill to apply the business profits tax to large employers with low-wage workers was criticized as potentially unconstitutional and administratively burdensome. The discussion highlighted broader issues of low wages and the state’s role in subsidizing workers through social programs.

---

#### **6. ARPA Funds and Transparency**
- **ARPA Funds Allocation**: Representatives sought clarity on how much of the first tranche of ARPA funds has been spent and what remains, particularly in the context of workforce development. There was a call for amendments to provide clearer information on ARPA fund allocation.
- **Public Records and Transparency**: The importance of transparency in public records, particularly regarding the distribution of opioid settlement funds, was emphasized. Representatives stressed the need for public access to information while protecting sensitive personal data.

---

#### **Next Steps and Key Takeaways**
- The committee agreed to work on amendments to clarify funding mechanisms for the National Service Alumni Fund and refine language in bills related to remote work taxation and opioid settlement distribution.
- Further discussions and decisions on these topics will continue in upcoming work sessions, with a focus on ensuring fiscal responsibility, legislative clarity, and equitable distribution of resources.
