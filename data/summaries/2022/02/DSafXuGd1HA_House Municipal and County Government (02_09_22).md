**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee Meeting (02/09/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Municipal and County Government Committee convened on February 9, 2022, to discuss several bills addressing waste management, housing, zoning, and municipal governance. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

---

### **Waste Management and Recycling**
1. **House Bill 1122**:  
   - **Purpose**: This bill focuses on the collection and resale of construction and demolition debris by municipalities to reduce solid waste in landfills, lower construction costs, and generate revenue for transfer stations.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The program is optional, allowing municipalities to decide on implementation with local oversight.  
     - Repurposing debris reduces tipping fees, operational costs, and the need for new landfills while fostering partnerships with local builders.  
     - Concerns were raised about large-scale debris transportation (e.g., rail shipments) and potential conflicts with existing statutes.  
     - The committee discussed innovative waste management solutions, including pyrolysis, composting, and biogas production.  
     - Amendments were proposed to clarify language and ensure the program focuses on local waste.  

2. **House Bill 1172**:  
   - **Purpose**: This bill mandates that public housing residents have access to composting and recycling facilities.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill aims to address environmental and equity issues, particularly for residents lacking transportation or space for composting.  
     - The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) opposed the bill, citing a lack of statewide composting infrastructure and potential unfunded mandates.  
     - Logistical challenges, including definitions of public housing and costs of implementation, were discussed.  
     - Amendments were suggested to align the bill with statewide waste management goals (e.g., RSA 149:17).  

3. **Composting and Recycling in Public Housing**:  
   - Representatives discussed challenges in providing composting and recycling facilities in public housing, emphasizing the need for legislative action.  
   - Successful public-private partnerships, such as **Grow Nashua**, were highlighted as models for other municipalities.  
   - Amendments were proposed to clarify terms like "access" and "facility" in the bill.

### **Housing and Zoning**
1. **House Bill 1087**:  
   - **Purpose**: This bill addresses zoning requirements for single-family housing lots, proposing a reduction in minimum lot size from 1/4 acre to 10,000 square feet in areas with combined water and sewer infrastructure.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill aims to balance housing development with infrastructure limitations.  
     - Concerns were raised about water and sewer capacity in towns already at maximum capacity.  
     - Supporters argued for denser housing to preserve green space and reduce sprawl.  
     - Debate centered on local control versus state mandates, with some representatives advocating for local zoning autonomy.  

2. **House Bill 1098**:  
   - **Purpose**: This bill seeks to limit parking space requirements to one per dwelling unit to reduce housing costs and promote walkable communities.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Supporters argued that excessive parking requirements increase housing costs and limit development options.  
     - Concerns were raised about insufficient parking in existing developments converted to multiple units.  
     - The NH Municipal Association opposed the bill, citing the need for local planning to address community-specific needs.

### **Municipal Governance**
1. **House Bill 1070**:  
   - **Purpose**: This bill addresses default budgets in towns using the SB2 system (official ballot voting), ensuring that reductions to proposed operating budgets also apply to default budgets.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill aims to prevent default budgets from exceeding proposed budgets, addressing concerns about manipulation.  
     - The NHMA opposed the bill, citing technical issues and redundancy in the proposed language.  
     - The Department of Revenue Administration clarified that default budgets are the responsibility of governing bodies, not the DRA.  
     - Debate centered on the legislative body’s ability to influence budgets.

### **General Themes**
- **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Many discussions highlighted tensions between state mandates and local autonomy, particularly in housing, zoning, and waste management.  
- **Environmental and Economic Benefits**: Bills like HB 1122 and HB 1087 emphasized reducing waste, preserving green space, and lowering housing costs.  
- **Equity and Access**: Bills like HB 1172 underscored the importance of providing equitable access to services like composting and recycling, particularly for public housing residents.  
- **Amendments and Next Steps**: The committee proposed amendments to clarify language, address logistical challenges, and align bills with existing laws.
