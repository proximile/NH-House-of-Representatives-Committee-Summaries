### **1. Transition Planning for Students with Disabilities (House Bill 1594)**
**Objective**: Improve transition planning for students with disabilities as they prepare to leave public schools, ensuring they become independent and civically engaged community members.

**Key Points**:
- **Transition Planning**: The bill leverages existing frameworks like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 to create robust transition plans.

### **2. COVID-19 Mandates in Higher Education (House Bill 1223 & House Bill 1233)**
**Objective**: Prohibit higher education institutions receiving state funds from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations or face masks for enrollment or attendance.

**Key Points**:
- **Individual Choice vs. Public Health**: Sponsors argued that vaccination and masking should be individual choices, not mandates, to avoid discrimination and economic losses.
- **Effectiveness of Measures**: Some speakers questioned the effectiveness of vaccines and masks, citing personal experiences with COVID-19 infections despite vaccination.
- **Student Migration**: Concerns were raised about students leaving the state for higher education, though data suggested this was primarily due to high tuition costs, not COVID-19 mandates.
- **University Perspectives**: Representatives from the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH) opposed the bill, emphasizing the importance of mask mandates for maintaining safe and open campuses.
- **Debate**: Supporters of mandates highlighted their role in protecting public health, while opponents argued they infringe on personal freedoms and lack scientific backing.

**Objective**: Address accountability, transparency, and administration of the EFA program, which provides public funds for alternative education options.

**Key Points**:
- **House Bill 1670**: Focuses on terminating EFA participation and ensuring proper use of funds. It requires audits of individual accounts and allows students to reapply if they re-enter the program.
- **House Bill 1669**: Proposes transferring EFA administration from a private scholarship organization to the New Hampshire Department of Education (DOE) for better oversight and alignment with state education goals.
- **House Bill 1637**: Requires parents opting for EFAs to complete a survey explaining their reasons for leaving public schools, aiming to gather data to improve public education.

- **Special Education Considerations**: Discussions highlighted the potential loss of IDEA protections for students with disabilities in private schools or homeschooling under the EFA program.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Emphasized the need for clear information for parents and proper use of public funds.

- **Special Education Rights**: Representative Cornell introduced a bill to clarify that EFA participation may result in forfeiting rights to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) under IDEA.
- **Public vs. Private School Responsibilities**: Testimony highlighted differences in IDEA protections for students in public, nonprofit private, and for-profit schools.
- **Federal Funding**: Discussions included how federal IDEA funds are allocated to private schools and the responsibilities of public school districts to provide equitable services.

### **5. Mask and Vaccine Exemptions for Students**
**Objective**: Address accommodations for students who cannot wear masks or receive vaccines due to health or other reasons.

**Key Points**:
- **Health Concerns**: Testimonies highlighted adverse effects experienced by some individuals post-vaccination, leading to hesitancy and opposition to mandates.
- **Long-Term Safety**: Concerns were raised about the long-term safety of vaccines, particularly the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, though it was clarified as a traditional vector vaccine, not an mRNA vaccine.
- **Accommodations**: Discussions focused on ensuring that students with health conditions are accommodated without compromising public health.
