### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting – House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee (02/02/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 2, 2022, to discuss a wide range of legislative issues, focusing on consumer protection, healthcare, insurance, mental health parity, cryptocurrency regulation, and the regulation of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Consumer Protection and Anti-Discrimination**
- The committee addressed the enforceability of consumer protection laws, particularly around unfair and deceptive practices. Concerns were raised about the Attorney General’s ability to investigate and act on complaints, especially in cases of alleged discrimination by businesses. Proving discrimination without explicit evidence was noted as a significant challenge, and the role of private legal action in such cases was debated.
- **HB 1469**, an anti-discrimination bill, was introduced to protect individuals from discrimination based on political philosophy and other emerging factors. The bill passed narrowly (10-9), despite concerns about its enforceability and the difficulty of proving discriminatory intent.

---

### **2. Health Insurance and Short-Term Plans (HB 1028)**
- The committee extensively debated **HB 1028**, which proposes extending the duration of short-term health insurance plans from 6 months to 18 months, with unlimited renewals. These plans are not subject to Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions or essential health benefits like mental health and maternity care.
  - **Supporters** argued that short-term plans provide affordable options for uninsured individuals, young adults, gig workers, and those in transitional employment.
  - **Opponents**, including organizations like NAMI New Hampshire and the American Heart Association, raised concerns about inadequate coverage, misleading consumers, and the potential for adverse selection, which could drive up ACA premiums.
- The discussion also touched on the need for better consumer disclosures to ensure individuals understand the limitations of short-term plans.

---

### **3. Mental Health Parity**
- The committee reviewed amendments to a mental health parity bill, aiming to ensure equal access and network adequacy for mental health services. The amendments focused on payment issues, access standards, and compliance with state network adequacy laws.
- The committee combined elements of the proposed amendments to ensure mental health services are held to the same standards as physical health services. The amended bill passed unanimously (19-0).

---

### **4. Cigar Bar Regulations**
- The committee considered an amendment to reduce the tobacco sales requirement for cigar bars from 60% to 50% for two years, with a sunset clause. Concerns were raised about the potential for increased alcohol sales and enforcement challenges. The amendment passed with a vote of 15-3, with plans to clarify definitions (e.g., loose tobacco) in the future.

---

### **5. Cryptocurrency Legislation**
- The committee discussed three related bills (**HB 1502**, **HB 1503**, and **HB 1504**) addressing cryptocurrency regulation. **HB 1504**, which proposed creating a new division within the banking department, was deemed unnecessary and recommended for disposal. **HB 1502** was recommended for interim study, while **HB 1503**, focusing on securities and blockchain technology, was prioritized for further work.
- The committee emphasized the urgency of establishing New Hampshire as a leader in cryptocurrency regulation.

---

### **6. Chiropractic Care and Insurance Coverage**
- Chiropractors advocated for reducing co-pays and reclassifying chiropractors from specialists to primary care providers. They argued that lower co-pays would make chiropractic care more accessible, reduce opioid use, and lower overall healthcare costs. Studies were cited showing that access to chiropractic care reduces the likelihood of opioid use and surgery.
- The New Hampshire Hospital Association opposed the bill, arguing that insurers already cover chiropractic care and that the proposed changes were unnecessary.

---

### **7. Insurance Coverage for Experimental Treatments**
- The committee discussed insurance coverage for experimental treatments, including COVID-19 vaccines under emergency use authorization. Michelle Heaton from the Insurance Department clarified that essential health benefits already require insurers to cover medically necessary treatments, including experimental vaccines. Concerns were raised about life insurance coverage for vaccine-related adverse events, but it was noted that the bill did not address life insurance.

---

### **8. Regulation of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) – HB 1580**
- **HB 1580** aims to regulate PBMs by requiring licensure, increasing patient access to pharmacies, and ensuring transparency in drug pricing and reimbursement practices. The bill seeks to protect independent pharmacies from unfair PBM practices, such as gag clauses and clawbacks.
  - **Supporters** argued that the bill is necessary to address rising drug costs and ensure affordable prescriptions.
  - **Opponents**, including the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), argued that many provisions are duplicative of existing laws and could increase costs for employers and families. Federal preemption issues under ERISA were also raised.
- The public hearing concluded with mixed testimony, and the committee will continue to evaluate the bill.

---

### **9. Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders (PANDAS)**
- The committee discussed **HB 1501**, which seeks to extend insurance coverage for PANDAS. Testimonies from affected families highlighted the challenges in diagnosing and treating the condition. The committee decided to hold a subcommittee hearing to further evaluate the bill, particularly regarding the removal of a sunset clause.

---

### **10. Other Bills and Amendments**
- **HB 1237 Amendment (0428H)**: Passed 15-3, adding more tobacco products to the "included items" list.
- **HB 1523**: Deemed inexpedient to legislate (19-0), which would have established a New Hampshire Child Care Fund.
- **HB 1589**: Recommended for interim study (19-0), addressing the sale of products containing PFAS.
- **HB 1591**: Recommended for interim study (19-0), which would eliminate the enforcement division of the Liquor Commission.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Consumer Protection and Enforceability**: Many discussions centered on the enforceability of anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws, with concerns about proving intent and practicality.
- **Healthcare Access and Affordability**: The committee debated expanding access to short-term health plans, chiropractic care, and mental health services, balancing affordability with adequate coverage.
- **Regulation and Oversight**: Bills addressing PBMs, cryptocurrency, and cigar bars highlighted the need for clear regulations and transparency, with some proposals facing industry opposition.
- **Data and Evidence**: Discussions on vaccine adverse events and chiropractic care emphasized the importance of reliable data and evidence in shaping legislation.

The meeting concluded with several bills moving forward for further review or amendment, while others were deferred or deemed inexpedient to legislate. The committee demonstrated a methodical approach to evaluating each proposal, often opting for interim studies when additional information was needed.
