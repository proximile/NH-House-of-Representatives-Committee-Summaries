**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/22/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 22, 2022, to discuss critical issues related to **solid waste management**, **landfill capacity**, and **environmental protection**, with a particular focus on **House Bill 1454**. The meeting included both a full committee discussion and a subcommittee work session, emphasizing the need for a **science-based approach** to landfill siting and the protection of the state’s water resources.

### Key Discussions and Points:

1. **Landfill Capacity and Waste Management**  
   - Representatives examined the **Turnkey Landfill in Rochester**, which processes approximately 60% of its waste from out of state, particularly Massachusetts. Concerns were raised about the environmental and economic impacts of transporting waste across state lines and whether the perceived capacity crisis is genuine or driven by profit motives for private companies like **Casella Waste Management**.  
   - The state’s landfill capacity was reviewed, highlighting that only three **municipally owned landfills** (Nashua, Lebanon, and Conway) accept waste from other towns, while **privately owned landfills** (Mount Carberry, Turnkey, and NCES) handle waste from broader regions. Mount Carberry and Turnkey have expansion plans extending their capacity into the 2040s.  
   - Specific concerns were raised about the **NCES landfill in Bethlehem**, which is nearing capacity and cannot expand due to local zoning restrictions. Its closure could affect 5,000 residents and 50 businesses, potentially increasing costs or diverting waste to other facilities.

2. **Environmental Protection and Water Resources**  
   - The committee emphasized the importance of safeguarding New Hampshire’s **water resources**, including both **surface water** and **groundwater**. Discussions highlighted the interconnectedness of water systems and the need for legislation to prevent contamination from landfills.  
   - **House Bill 1454** proposes replacing the **arbitrary 200-foot setback requirement** from water bodies with a **science-based approach** to landfill siting. This includes **hydrogeological assessments** to determine safe locations for landfills, ensuring the protection of perennial water bodies.  
   - Questions arose about whether to include **groundwater protections** under **RSA 485-C**, which governs drinking water. The **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** noted that existing landfill regulations already include robust groundwater monitoring and remediation systems.  

3. **Legislative Focus and Scientific Approach**  
   - The bill aims to modernize outdated regulations by ensuring that future landfills are sited based on **scientific assessments** rather than arbitrary distances. Advocates, including **Wayne Morrison** and **John Swann**, stressed the need for a science-based setback, citing practices in other states like Maine, which use more conservative methodologies (e.g., six years of travel time for contaminants).  
   - The **public benefit determination** process was discussed, which requires landfill expansions to demonstrate capacity for in-state waste. However, landfills often accept out-of-state waste to maximize revenue. Improved **waste diversion** strategies, such as recycling and organics management, could reduce reliance on landfills.  

4. **Industry Perspectives and Modern Landfill Practices**  
   - **John Gay** from Casella Waste Management provided insights into the extensive **hydrogeological studies** conducted before siting landfills. He emphasized that modern landfills are **double-lined** with advanced monitoring systems to detect and address leaks, significantly reducing environmental risks.  

5. **Next Steps and Legislative Refinement**  
   - The committee planned to consult with the **Office of Legislative Services (OLS)** and DES to refine the bill’s language, ensuring it aligns with existing laws and includes protections for both surface and groundwater.  
   - A final subcommittee work session was scheduled for **March 1st at 10:30 AM**, followed by a full committee meeting at 11 AM to finalize recommendations and move the bill forward. The committee also considered reaching out to a researcher to gather information on similar legislation in other states, particularly Maine.  

### Conclusion  
The meeting underscored the need to balance **environmental protection** with **waste management practices**, ensuring that future landfill siting is guided by **scientific best practices** and prioritizes the preservation of New Hampshire’s water resources. The discussions reflected a commitment to modernizing regulations, addressing capacity concerns, and safeguarding the state’s natural environment.
