The February 9, 2022, New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee meeting centered on three contentious bills related to abortion and reproductive rights: **House Bill 1181**, **House Bill 1477**, and **House Bill 1625**. The discussions highlighted deep divisions over bodily autonomy, fetal rights, free speech, and public safety, with passionate testimonies from both supporters and opponents of the proposed legislation.

### **House Bill 1181: Father’s Right to Prevent Abortion**
**Purpose**: This bill would allow the biological father of an unborn child to petition the court for an injunction to prevent the pregnant person from obtaining an abortion. The injunction must be approved or denied within 24 weeks of gestation, and the father must acknowledge paternity and assume financial responsibilities during the pregnancy. Exceptions are made for cases involving rape, incest, or health risks, and the bill does not apply if the father has a history of sexual or violent crimes.

**Support**:
- Sponsors, including Representative Jeff Greeson, argued that the bill addresses a gap in legal precedent by recognizing the father’s rights while maintaining the pregnant person’s greater rights. They contended that it balances the state’s interest in protecting potential life with individual autonomy and does not conflict with Supreme Court rulings like *Roe v. Wade*.

**Opposition**:
- Critics, including the ACLU of New Hampshire and medical professionals, argued that the bill would create significant barriers to abortion access, particularly for survivors of rape, incest, or domestic violence. Concerns were raised about delays in time-sensitive care, the potential for abusive partners to control reproductive decisions, and the lack of penalties for false paternity claims. Opponents also emphasized that the bill contradicts Supreme Court rulings, such as *Planned Parenthood v. Danforth*, which struck down spousal consent requirements.

### **House Bill 1477: Six-Week Abortion Ban**
**Purpose**: This bill would prohibit abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, typically around six weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or fetal abnormalities.

**Support**:
- Proponents framed the bill as a pro-life measure, arguing that the detection of a heartbeat signifies life and that the bill protects unborn children’s rights. They cited the success of New Hampshire’s Fetal Life Protection Act in reducing abortions and aligned the bill with Christian values.

**Opposition**:
- Medical experts testified that the term "fetal heartbeat" is misleading, as the electrical activity detected at six weeks does not indicate a functional cardiovascular system. Critics argued that the bill effectively bans most abortions, as many people are unaware of their pregnancy at six weeks. Opponents highlighted the disproportionate impact on young girls, low-income individuals, and victims of sexual violence, as well as the potential for increased maternal mortality and the criminalization of healthcare providers.

### **House Bill 1625: Repeal of Buffer Zone Law**
**Purpose**: This bill seeks to repeal New Hampshire’s buffer zone law, which allows for a non-mandatory safety zone of up to 25 feet around reproductive health facilities to protect patients and providers from harassment and intimidation.

**Support**:
- Proponents argued that the buffer zone law violates First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly. They claimed that sidewalk advocates are peaceful and provide alternatives to abortion, such as adoption and counseling. Critics of the law noted that it has never been enforced and that federal laws already protect access to clinics.

**Opposition**:
- Opponents emphasized the need for buffer zones to ensure safe access to healthcare, citing incidents of harassment, intimidation, and physical obstruction at clinic entrances. Planned Parenthood representatives argued that the law balances public safety and patient privacy while respecting First Amendment rights. Testimonies described protesters photographing patients, blocking driveways, and verbally assaulting those entering clinics.

### **Key Themes and Broader Implications**
1. **Bodily Autonomy vs. Fetal Rights**: The debates centered on whether a pregnant person’s right to make medical decisions outweighs the rights of the fetus. Supporters of the bills emphasized protecting fetal life, while opponents argued for preserving reproductive autonomy and privacy.
2. **Impact on Vulnerable Populations**: Opponents highlighted how these bills would disproportionately harm survivors of rape, incest, and domestic violence, as well as low-income individuals and young girls.
3. **Medical and Legal Concerns**: Medical professionals criticized the lack of scientific basis for terms like "fetal heartbeat" and warned of the logistical challenges and health crises that could arise from restrictive abortion laws. Legal experts pointed out that the bills conflict with established Supreme Court precedents.
4. **Free Speech vs. Safe Access**: The debate over the buffer zone law reflected broader tensions between protecting free speech and ensuring safe access to healthcare facilities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the deeply polarized nature of abortion debates in New Hampshire. While supporters of the bills framed them as measures to protect life and free speech, opponents argued they would undermine reproductive rights, harm vulnerable populations, and create dangerous legal and medical precedents. The committee’s deliberations on these bills will weigh these competing interests, with significant implications for reproductive healthcare and constitutional rights in the state.
