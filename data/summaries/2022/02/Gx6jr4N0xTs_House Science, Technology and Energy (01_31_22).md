**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (January 31, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 31, 2022, to discuss the health, safety, and regulatory implications of **5G technology** and **radiofrequency radiation (RFR)** from wireless communication devices, including cell towers. The meeting involved detailed debates on scientific evidence, legislative proposals, industry perspectives, and public health concerns. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Health Risks of RF Radiation**
1. **Scientific Findings**:  
   - The commission and experts highlighted credible studies linking RFR, particularly frequencies starting at 500 megahertz and above, to adverse health effects. These include **oxidative stress**, **cancer**, **brain tumors**, **infertility**, and **DNA damage**.  
   - Living within **500 meters of a cell tower** was associated with increased health risks.  
   - Studies from the **U.S. National Toxicology Program** and the **Ramazzini Institute** provided clear evidence of cancerous tumors and cellular damage from RFR exposure.  
   - Concerns were raised about the impact of RFR on **photosynthesis**, **pollinators (bees)**, **bird navigation**, and **human biomembranes** involved in nervous and reproductive systems.  

2. **5G Technology**:  
   - 5G, which piggybacks on 4G infrastructure and uses higher frequencies (including millimeter waves), was a central focus. While some argued that 5G frequencies are non-ionizing and lack the energy to cause direct DNA damage, others emphasized the potential harm from denser antenna placement and overlapping signals.  
   - Millimeter waves, absorbed by **oxygen** and **water vapor**, were noted to pose risks to humans and the environment.  
   - The **precautionary principle** was advocated, urging limits on antenna proximity to people and sensitive areas.

### **Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Challenges**
1. **Setback Requirements**:  
   - The commission proposed **500-meter setbacks** for new cell towers from homes, workplaces, and recreational areas to mitigate health risks.  
   - A bill proposing **1,640-foot setbacks** from parks, schools, and residential areas was debated but faced opposition for potentially hindering broadband expansion in rural areas.  

2. **Federal Preemption**:  
   - The **Telecommunications Act of 1996** preempts state and local governments from regulating wireless facilities based on RFR emissions, creating tension between federal regulations and local zoning authority.  

3. **Legislative Actions**:  
   - **House Bill 522** led to the formation of a commission to study wireless technology effects. Discussions included splitting the bill into sections addressing cell tower placement and a health registry, with concerns about the fiscal impact of the registry.  
   - An **interim study** was recommended to further investigate the issue due to conflicting scientific evidence.

### **Industry and Technological Perspectives**
1. **Industry Influence**:  
   - Critics accused the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** of being influenced by the telecommunications industry and failing to update safety standards since 1996.  
   - The **Business and Industry Association (BIA)** opposed restrictive legislation, arguing it would impede **economic development**, **telehealth**, **remote learning**, and broadband expansion, particularly in rural areas.  

2. **5G vs. Fiber Optics**:  
   - While 5G was touted for its economic and technological benefits, some advocated for **fiber optic networks** as a safer and more reliable alternative, despite higher deployment costs.  
   - A **composite approach** combining fiber and wireless technologies was suggested to balance safety and accessibility.  

---

### **Public Safety and Education**
1. **3G Phase-Out and 911 Concerns**:  
   - The phase-out of **3G networks** was discussed, with warnings that older phones would lose 911 capabilities. Public awareness campaigns were urged to ensure device upgrades.  

2. **Public Education**:  
   - Calls were made for **public education** on the risks of wireless technology, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, who are more susceptible to RFR exposure from devices like laptops and cell phones.  

---

### **Global Standards and Further Research**
1. **International Comparisons**:  
   - The U.S. has higher (less strict) RFR exposure limits compared to other countries. The commission recommended adopting more stringent standards.  

2. **Call for Independent Research**:  
   - The need for **independent scientific research**, free from industry influence, was emphasized. The **World Health Organization’s** reopening of its investigation into RFR’s health effects was cited as a positive step.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing **technological advancement**, **public health**, and **regulatory constraints**. While concerns about 5G and RFR were widely acknowledged, the committee leaned toward further study and cautious legislative action. The subcommittee agreed to reconvene on **February 7th** to hear additional testimony, deliberate on proposed legislation, and potentially vote on recommendations.  

Overall, the discussions highlighted the need for **comprehensive research**, **public education**, and a balanced approach to ensure both technological progress and public safety.
