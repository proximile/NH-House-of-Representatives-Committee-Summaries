**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (02/11/22)**  

The NH House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 11, 2022, centered on discussions surrounding **House Bill 1677**, which addresses claims related to historical abuse, particularly sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, within the state’s juvenile detention system, including the **Youth Development Center (YDC)**. The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing a **victim-centered, trauma-informed approach** with ensuring fairness, transparency, and financial accountability. Key themes and discussions included:  

### **Victim-Centered Process and Trauma-Informed Approach**  
1. **Victim Protections and Accessibility**:  
   - The bill emphasizes creating a trauma-informed process that prioritizes victims’ needs, including allowing private meetings with the **independent administrator** to foster healing and closure.  
   - Victims are not required to cooperate with **criminal investigations** as a condition of participating in the claims process, and perpetrators may only be referred to law enforcement with the **victim’s consent**.  
   - Victims have the right to consult with attorneys and victim advocates throughout the process.  

2. **Presumption of Truthfulness**:  
   - The bill includes a presumption that claims submitted under oath are truthful, which sparked debate. While some argued this is essential to encourage victims to come forward, others expressed concerns about potential abuse of the system.  

3. **Scope of Abuse Claims**:  
   - Discussions included expanding the bill to cover **physical and emotional abuse**, not just sexual abuse, acknowledging the severe and lasting impact of emotional trauma. However, this expansion requires careful consideration to avoid ambiguity.  

### **Claims Resolution Process and Administrator’s Role**  
1. **Independent Administrator**:  
   - The bill proposes appointing a **truly independent administrator** to oversee the claims process, separate from the Attorney General’s office, to ensure trust and fairness. The administrator would develop **guidelines** and a **compensation matrix** in consultation with stakeholders.  
   - The administrator’s role includes making binding decisions on claims if the Attorney General’s office and claimants cannot reach an agreement.  
   - The workload for the administrator is expected to peak within the first 6–12 months and taper off over a potential 10-year period, with the legislature retaining discretion to terminate the administrator if the workload diminishes.  

2. **Compensation and Payouts**:  
   - Victims can choose between **lump-sum payments** or **installment plans**, with the administrator having limited discretion to override this choice in specific cases (e.g., protecting victims from financial harm).  
   - The **compensation matrix** outlines ranges for claims based on the severity of harm, avoiding heavy reliance on post-abuse life outcomes to prevent penalizing those who have overcome adversity.  

3. **Voluntary Participation and Waiver of Rights**:  
   - The bill currently requires claimants to waive their right to pursue litigation in exchange for participating in the settlement process. Concerns were raised about forcing victims to relinquish legal rights before knowing the settlement outcome. Suggestions were made to allow victims to waive their rights only after being informed of the settlement amount and terms.  

### **Transparency, Reporting, and Financial Considerations**  
1. **Transparency and Reporting**:  
   - The administrator will provide **public reports** on the nature of claims and financial expenditures without identifying individual claimants.  
   - Quarterly reporting was suggested to better track the process and financial implications, replacing the initial annual reporting requirement.  

2. **Financial Concerns**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the financial implications of the bill, including the **$1.5 million cap on claims** and the potential for future legislatures to underfund the process. Suggestions included ensuring victims could recover from the state even if the fund is depleted.  
   - Discussions also addressed the costs associated with hiring an independent administrator versus using state employees, with proposals to balance independence with cost control, such as hiring a retired judge or mediator.  

3. **Attorney Fees**:  
   - The bill includes guidelines for attorney fees, with a **25% fee** for settlements reached with the Attorney General’s office and **33.3%** for cases resolved by the administrator, incentivizing attorneys to consider the additional work involved.  

### **Legal and Procedural Refinements**  
1. **Confidentiality and Right to Know**:  
   - The bill includes provisions for confidentiality, particularly regarding settlement agreements, ensuring that claimants can speak freely while administrators maintain privacy if requested.  

2. **Expansion of Facilities Covered**:  
   - The bill now includes institutions that existed before the YDC but performed similar functions, broadening the scope of potential claims.  

3. **Definition of Sexual Abuse**:  
   - The definition of sexual abuse was clarified to remove the requirement of coercion, emphasizing that any sexual contact between staff and inmates is unacceptable, regardless of consent.  

4. **Claims Process and Timeframe**:  
   - The filing window for claims was extended from one year to two years, based on feedback that victims need more time to come forward. The **1980 date restriction** for claims was lifted, allowing claims from any time period.  
   - Notice requirements were expanded to include national publications and social media, with the administrator having discretion to determine the most effective and cost-efficient methods.  

### **Future Steps and Conclusion**  
The committee acknowledged the need for further discussion and refinement of the bill, particularly regarding the inclusion of physical and emotional abuse claims, the presumption of truthfulness, and ensuring a fair and effective process for all victims. The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on February 24, 2022, to address unresolved issues and refine the bill further.  

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of a **victim-centered, transparent, and trustworthy process** to address the harms suffered at YDC and similar facilities, while balancing fairness, financial accountability, and legal considerations.
