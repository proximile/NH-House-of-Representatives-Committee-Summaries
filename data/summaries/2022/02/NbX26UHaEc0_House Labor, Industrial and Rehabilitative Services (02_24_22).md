The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee held a meeting on February 24, 2022, to discuss and vote on several bills related to labor, employment, and healthcare. The session was marked by extensive debates on balancing individual rights, public health, and business interests, with a particular focus on vaccine mandates, worker protections, and employment practices.

### Key Bills and Discussions:

#### **HB 1210: Vaccine Mandates and Exemptions**
- **Overview**: HB 1210 consolidates three related bills (HB 1210, 1351, and 1358) addressing vaccine mandates in workplaces and educational settings. The bill, amended by Representative Lang, introduces a **right of conscience** exemption alongside existing medical and religious exemptions, allowing individuals to object to vaccines based on moral or personal beliefs.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Exemption Process**: Employees or students can submit a simple form to request an exemption, which **shall be granted** without further investigation. Employers **may** work with employees to find reasonable accommodations, but termination is possible if no agreement is reached.
  - **Public Health Concerns**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Hospital Association, argued that the right of conscience exemption conflicts with federal CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) requirements, potentially jeopardizing federal funding for healthcare facilities. They also raised concerns about undermining public health efforts by increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.
  - **Federal vs. State Conflicts**: The bill’s provisions could lead to non-compliance with federal vaccine mandates, particularly in healthcare settings, risking penalties or loss of Medicare and Medicaid funding.
  - **Legislative Intent**: The bill aims to balance individual rights with business flexibility, allowing employers to manage exemptions and accommodations as they see fit. The subcommittee voted **3-2** to recommend the bill to the full committee with possible amendments.

#### **Other Labor and Employment Bills**
- **Bathroom and Meal Break Protections**: A bill ensuring workers’ rights to bathroom breaks, meal breaks, and rest periods cannot be denied due to productivity quotas was discussed. It was noted that the bill provides transparency for employees regarding productivity quotas.
- **COVID-19 Employment Protections (HB 1088)**: A bill aimed at protecting employees from COVID-19-related workplace discrimination was debated. Some argued that existing laws already protect individuals’ medical choices, while others believed the bill was unnecessary in an at-will employment state like New Hampshire.
- **Non-Compete Agreements (HB 1363 and HB 1089)**: The committee discussed bills addressing the enforceability of non-compete agreements, particularly in areas with critical worker shortages. An amendment was proposed to clarify that material changes in employment terms (e.g., salary cuts, medical interventions) would nullify existing non-compete agreements, aiming to protect employees while maintaining employer interests.
- **Volunteer Firefighters’ Employment Protections (HB 1508)**: A bill related to employment protections for volunteer firefighters was debated, with some arguing it was unnecessary due to a lack of evidence of widespread issues, while others emphasized the importance of volunteer firefighters in communities.
- **E-Verify Mandate (HB 1124)**: A bill requiring employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check employees’ eligibility to work was discussed. Opponents cited potential burdens on small businesses and errors in the E-Verify system, while supporters viewed it as a way to address illegal immigration.
- **Employee Work Schedules (HB 1094)**: A bill proposing regulations on employee work schedules was debated, with concerns raised about its practicality for industries affected by weather conditions. The committee ultimately moved to recommend the bill be inexpedient to legislate (ITL).
- **Sub-Minimum Wage (HB 1251)**: A bill to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers was debated. Supporters argued it would ensure fair wages and address outdated labor practices, while opponents claimed it could harm small businesses. The committee voted to recommend ITL, with some suggesting further study.
- **Anti-Union Activities (HB 1472)**: A bill aimed at prohibiting employers from engaging in anti-union activities, such as requiring employees to attend anti-union meetings, was discussed. Supporters argued it would level the playing field for workers, while opponents claimed it infringed on employers’ free speech rights. The committee voted to recommend ITL.

#### **HB 1514: Payment of Unused Vacation Time and PTO**
- **Overview**: The bill requires employers to pay out unused vacation time or PTO in two specific scenarios: permanent layoffs and change of business ownership. It redefines these benefits as compensation, making them subject to wage payment laws.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Debate on Wage Definition**: Opponents argued that classifying vacation time and PTO as wages could create financial burdens for employers, while supporters emphasized fairness to employees.
  - **Limited Scope**: The bill applies only to the two specific scenarios and does not require employers to pay out sick leave or other benefits unless part of a combined PTO system.
  - **Amendment and Vote**: An amendment to clarify the bill’s language failed in a **11-10 vote**, and the bill was moved to **interim study**, delaying further action.

### Themes and Outcomes:
- **Individual Rights vs. Public Health**: The discussions highlighted the tension between protecting workers’ rights to refuse vaccines and maintaining public health, particularly in healthcare and educational settings.
- **Federal Compliance**: Several bills, particularly HB 1210, raised concerns about conflicts with federal mandates, especially regarding CMS requirements and potential loss of federal funding.
- **Business Flexibility vs. Worker Protections**: Many debates centered on finding a balance between ensuring businesses’ operational flexibility and protecting workers’ rights, with some bills being deemed unworkable or unnecessary.
- **Legislative Process**: Several bills were moved to “inexpedient to legislate” (ITL), indicating they would not proceed further, while others were recommended for further study or refinement.

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene on March 9th to address remaining bills, reflecting the committee’s ongoing efforts to navigate complex labor and employment issues in New Hampshire.
