The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on February 8, 2022, to discuss a series of transportation-related bills, covering topics ranging from vehicle safety inspections to facial recognition technology.

Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1447: Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)**  
   - The bill proposed prohibiting state agencies from using FRT, citing concerns about privacy, racial bias, and high error rates, particularly among non-white individuals. Supporters, including the ACLU, argued that FRT poses significant risks to civil liberties and advocated for proactive restrictions.  
   - Opponents, including law enforcement and the Security Industry Association, countered that FRT is a valuable tool for solving crimes, such as human trafficking and fraud, and emphasized its use as part of broader investigations. They warned that a ban could hinder joint operations with federal and out-of-state agencies.  
   - Amendments were discussed to include guardrails rather than an outright ban, with both sides expressing willingness to refine the legislation.

2. **House Bill 1474: Eliminating Mandatory Vehicle Safety Inspections**  
   - The bill sought to remove mandatory safety inspections for non-commercial vehicles while retaining them for commercial vehicles and emissions testing. Proponents argued that there is no conclusive data linking inspections to improved road safety, and they disproportionately burden lower-income residents. They also highlighted predatory practices by some inspection stations.  
   - Opponents, including automotive professionals and law enforcement, stressed that inspections are critical for identifying safety issues like worn brakes, rusted frames, and faulty suspension, particularly in New Hampshire’s harsh climate. They cited post-collision data and examples of crashes caused by vehicle deficiencies.  
   - The debate centered on whether inspections are necessary for public safety or if they impose an undue financial burden on vehicle owners.

3. **House Bill 1401: Mileage Data Privacy**  
   - This bill aimed to prohibit the disclosure of vehicle mileage data to protect citizens’ privacy, particularly in response to potential federal mileage taxes. Prime sponsor Representative Keith Ammon emphasized shielding residents from federal overreach.  
   - Stakeholders, including Carfax and State Farm, raised concerns about disrupting business models reliant on mileage data, such as insurance and vehicle sales. Amendments were proposed to clarify the bill’s scope and address these concerns.

4. **House Bill 1341: Broadening “Conviction” in Motor Vehicle Laws**  
   - The bill sought to expand the definition of “conviction” to include non-commercial drivers, improving public safety and record-keeping. The Department of Motor Vehicles supported the bill, stating it would enhance the accuracy of driver records.

5. **House Bill 1302: Limiting Vehicle Weighing to Commercial Vehicles**  
   - The bill proposed removing the requirement to weigh non-commercial vehicles, arguing that the law is outdated and unnecessary. Representative Stephen Smith emphasized that non-commercial vehicles should only be weighed with probable cause.  
   - The New Hampshire State Police opposed the bill, citing public safety concerns, as overloaded non-commercial vehicles can pose risks. Troopers noted that they often use such instances for education rather than enforcement.

6. **House Bill 1426: Vehicle Inspection Requirements**  
   - The bill proposed changes to state vehicle inspection requirements. Testimony from a mechanic suggested that inspections may not significantly impact road safety, as issues are often identified during routine maintenance.  
   - Opponents, including the New Hampshire Motorcycle Rights Organization, argued that inspections are crucial, especially for motorcycles, given their unique risks and the state’s harsh climate. Data from the Department of Motor Vehicles showed a 15% average failure rate for inspections, with tires and brakes being the most common issues.

7. **Other Bills**  
   - **House Bill 1160**: Passed with an amendment clarifying that it applies to utilitarian vehicles, not recreational equipment.  
   - **House Bill 1239**: Passed with an amendment ensuring fair process and protecting individual rights in default orders.  
   - **House Bill 1240**: Moved to interim study due to concerns about presuming service of notice within three days.  
   - **House Bill 1573**: Moved to interim study in favor of a more comprehensive Senate bill (SB 311).

### **Additional Discussions**

- **Antique Vehicle Side Exhausts**: Representative Tom Walsh introduced a bill to allow side exhausts on antique vehicles, aligning them with custom and hot rod vehicle regulations. Amendments were proposed to ensure exhaust systems direct gases away from the vehicle.  
- **Distracted Driving Law**: Representative Stephen Smith advocated for repealing an outdated distracted driving law, as a newer, more effective version had been implemented. He highlighted issues with the old law, such as courts requiring an actual incident to prove distraction.  
- **Commercial Vehicle Screening**: A representative explained the process of screening commercial vehicles for violations, including weight checks, and emphasized the need for probable cause to stop non-commercial vehicles.
