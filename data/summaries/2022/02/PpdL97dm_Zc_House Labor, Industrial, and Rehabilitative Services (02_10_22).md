The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 10, 2022, focused on several key bills addressing labor, industrial, and rehabilitative services, with discussions centering on employee protections, employer responsibilities, and the balance between the two. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key bills and themes discussed:

### **House Bill 1363: Non-Compete Agreements and Medical Mandates**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to void non-compete agreements for employees terminated unless the employer continues to pay their salary and benefits for the duration of the non-compete period. It also addresses terminations related to medical mandates, such as vaccination refusal, requiring employers to provide severance (up to two-thirds of compensation for six months).
- **Key Points**:
  - Aims to prevent employees from being locked out of their industry post-termination.
  - Allows renegotiation or lump-sum payouts for non-compete agreements.
  - Concerns were raised about the financial burden on small businesses and how the bill handles employees who quickly find new jobs.
  - Debate focused on balancing employer rights with employee protections, with some questioning state intervention in private agreements.
  - Proposed amendments included clarifying definitions of "medical mandates" and addressing non-salaried employees.

### **House Bill 1143: Medical Mandates and Severance Pay**
- **Purpose**: Requires employers to provide six months of severance pay to employees terminated for refusing medical mandates (e.g., vaccinations, drug testing).
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Ambiguity in defining "medical mandates" and calculating severance.
  - Opposition from the New Hampshire Hospital Association, Business and Industry Association (BIA), and county nursing homes, citing increased litigation and financial burdens.
  - Enforcement challenges noted by the Department of Labor (DOL), including conflicts with federal mandates.

### **House Bill 1410: Liability for Medical Mandates**
- **Purpose**: Holds private businesses liable for damages suffered by employees or customers due to compliance with medical mandates.
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Broad language could lead to unintended lawsuits (e.g., injuries unrelated to mandates).
  - Opponents argued the bill would create a "cottage industry" of litigation.
  - Lack of clarity in defining "medical mandate" and scope of damages.

### **House Bill 1508: Volunteer Firefighters and EMTs**
- **Purpose**: Protects volunteer firefighters and EMTs from being discharged or disciplined for responding to emergencies during work hours.
- **Key Points**:
  - Requires a note from the fire chief to verify emergency response.
  - Protects volunteers who are late to work but not those who leave mid-shift (potential for amendment).
  - Includes provisions for legal action in superior court; debate over whether DOL should have jurisdiction.
  - Definition of a volunteer (fewer than 975 hours in six months) questioned, with openness to adjustment.
  - Opposition from library representatives to a separate bill (HB 1529) requiring background checks for library volunteers.

### **House Bill 1514: Accrued Vacation Time and Wages**
- **Purpose**: Requires employers to pay out unused vacation time upon employee departure, with a focus on layoffs or terminations in good standing.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Opposition**: Critics argued the bill would burden small businesses, discourage front-loading vacation policies, and be redundant given existing laws.
  - **Support**: Proponents emphasized that earned time is part of compensation and should be paid out, especially in cases of layoffs or business sales.
  - **Concerns**: Ambiguity in handling unlimited paid time off policies and the 15-employee threshold.
  - **Amendments**: Sponsor indicated willingness to clarify definitions and address employer concerns.

### **House Bill 1569: Unemployment Benefits and Drill Pay**
- **Purpose**: Addresses unemployment benefits and drill pay for National Guard members.
- **Key Points**:
  - Drill pay is already excluded from wages under existing law, making the bill unnecessary.

### **Key Themes and Debates**
1. **Employee Protections vs. Employer Flexibility**:
   - Bills like HB 1363, HB 1143, and HB 1514 sparked debates over whether the state should mandate employee benefits or leave such decisions to employers.
   - Supporters emphasized fairness for employees, while opponents argued for employer autonomy and flexibility.

2. **Financial and Administrative Burdens**:
   - Many bills faced opposition due to concerns about increased costs and administrative challenges for businesses, particularly small employers.

3. **Clarity and Enforcement**:
   - Ambiguity in definitions (e.g., "medical mandates," "earned time") and enforcement challenges were recurring themes, with calls for clearer language and amendments.

4. **Public Safety and Volunteerism**:
   - HB 1508 highlighted the importance of protecting volunteer firefighters and EMTs to address recruitment challenges, while balancing employer concerns.

5. **Redundancy and Existing Laws**:
   - Several bills were criticized as unnecessary or redundant, with opponents pointing to existing laws that already address the issues raised.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing employee protections with employer rights, with significant debate over the necessity, clarity, and potential burdens of proposed legislation. While some bills aimed to address gaps in current law, others faced strong opposition for being overly intrusive or redundant. Amendments and further discussions were proposed to refine the bills and address concerns raised by stakeholders.
