The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 23, 2022, focused on a series of election law bills and amendments, addressing issues ranging from ballot tabulation and voter eligibility to ranked-choice voting (RCV). The discussions highlighted tensions between ensuring election integrity, maintaining voter confidence, and avoiding measures that could disenfranchise eligible voters. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key points and outcomes:

---

### **1. Overvotes and Ballot Tabulation**
A significant portion of the meeting centered on **HB 1163**, a bill addressing **overvoted ballots** (where voters select more candidates than allowed). Sponsored by Representative Marjorie Porter, the bill aimed to ensure fair elections by requiring voting machines to reject overvoted ballots and return them to voters for correction or placement in an **auxiliary compartment** for later hand-counting. Key points included:
- **Discrepancies in Handling Overvotes**: Machine-counted towns automatically reject overvoted ballots, while hand-counted towns often interpret voter intent, leading to potential disenfranchisement.
- **Proposed Solution**: Voting machines would notify voters of overvotes, allowing correction or placement in an auxiliary bin for hand-counting. This process is already used in states like Vermont and Massachusetts.
- **Amendment**: An amendment was proposed to treat absentee and in-person voters equally, addressing concerns raised by the Secretary of State’s office.
- **Concerns**: Issues included fairness for absentee voters, potential delays in voting lines, and compliance with the **HAVA Act** (Help America Vote Act of 2002).

Testimony highlighted the impact of overvotes in the **2020 election**, with some towns reporting high overvote rates. The committee debated the bill and its amendment, focusing on fairness, election efficiency, and voter privacy.

### **2. Amendments to Voting Laws and Voter Eligibility**
The meeting also addressed amendments to voting-related bills, including:
- **Citizenship and Residency**: One amendment proposed requiring voters to be "a citizen of New Hampshire" with a "primary residence" in the state. Critics argued this language was unclear and redundant, as current laws already require voters to be U.S. citizens and state residents.
- **College Students**: Concerns were raised that the amendments could disenfranchise out-of-state college students by making it unclear where they are eligible to vote.
- **Public Testimony**: Organizations like the League of Women Voters urged clarity in voter eligibility language, warning against disenfranchising groups such as college students and overseas voters.

### **3. Executive Session on Election-Related Bills**
During the executive session, the committee reviewed several election-related bills:
- **HB 1324 (Allocating Presidential Electors)**: Deemed inexpedient to legislate, as New Hampshire’s swing state status was seen as more valuable than securing electoral votes.
- **HB 1242 (Filing Deadlines for Charter Commission Candidates)**: Deemed inexpedient due to redundancy with Senate Bill 423.
- **HB 1153 (Absentee Ballot Requests)**: Recommended for passage, closing a loophole by requiring requesters to be registered voters.
- **HB 1166 (Declaring Party Affiliation Before Primaries)**: Deemed inexpedient, as it could burden candidates switching party affiliations close to filing deadlines.
- **HB 1326 (Campaign Contributions by Business Organizations)**: Deemed inexpedient, as it duplicated recent campaign finance reforms.
- **HB 1359 (Election Day Duties of Incumbent Officials)**: Deemed inexpedient due to constitutional and practical concerns.
- **HB 1394 (Reporting Campaign Contributions by LLCs)**: Deemed inexpedient, with concerns about excessive tracking requirements and free speech implications.

### **4. Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)**
The committee also debated two RCV-related measures:
- **CACR 22 (Constitutional Amendment for RCV)**: Deemed inexpedient to legislate, as members argued a constitutional amendment was unnecessary at this stage.
- **HB 1264 (Enabling Legislation for RCV)**: An amendment proposed allowing municipalities and political parties to adopt RCV through voter referenda or party processes. The bill faced opposition over logistical challenges, potential voter confusion, and concerns about impacting New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary. The motion to pass the bill with the amendment failed 10-10, leaving it unresolved.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Election Integrity vs. Voter Disenfranchisement**: Discussions highlighted the balance between clarifying voter eligibility and avoiding measures that could disenfranchise eligible voters, such as college students.
- **Public Confidence**: Members emphasized the importance of maintaining public trust in elections, with some arguing that ambiguous language or unnecessary changes could undermine confidence.
- **Logistical Challenges**: Concerns about ballot counting, election efficiency, and compliance with federal laws were central to debates on overvotes and RCV.
- **Non-Germane Amendments**: Criticism was directed at introducing amendments unrelated to the original bills, which some argued disrupted the legislative process.

The meeting concluded with several bills deemed inexpedient to legislate, while others, like **HB 1163** and **HB 1264**, remained unresolved pending further discussion. The committee scheduled its next meeting for March 9, 2022.
