**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (February 8, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 8, 2022, to discuss two key bills: **House Bill 1186**, addressing the accommodation of companion animals during declared states of emergency, and **House Bill 1454**, pertaining to permits for the siting of new landfills. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 1186: Accommodation of Companion Animals During Emergencies**

The committee focused on refining **House Bill 1186**, which aims to ensure the welfare of companion animals during evacuations and declared states of emergency. Key points included:

1. **Committee Amendments**: Proposed amendments clarified that hotels or community shelters must allow **disaster animal response trailers** on-site during evacuations, though not necessarily inside facilities. This addresses concerns about compatibility and liability.

2. **Volunteer Protections**: The bill seeks to classify trained volunteers assisting with companion animals during emergencies as **emergency workers**, granting them protections such as workers' compensation if injured.

3. **Companion Animal Definition**: The bill defines companion animals as dogs, cats, or other animals typically kept in homes. Discussions clarified that animals like chickens are classified as livestock under state law, while exotic pets were not explicitly addressed.

4. **Logistical Responsibilities**: Questions arose about who ensures the availability and placement of trailers during emergencies, with the **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)** likely overseeing this.

5. **Local Ordinances**: The bill stipulates that the number of animals per family must comply with local ordinances, though concerns were raised about varying regulations across municipalities.

6. **Evacuation Order Definition**: Representatives sought clarity on what constitutes an evacuation order, referencing existing statutes.

7. **Additional Accommodations**: Suggestions were made to include language about **reasonable accommodations** beyond trailers, such as temporary structures, to house animals during emergencies.

8. **Feeding and Care**: Discussions addressed responsibility for feeding and caring for animals in trailers, with the assumption that trailers would be stocked with necessary supplies.

9. **Timeline for Care**: Questions were raised about how long the state would provide care for animals during emergencies, with the expectation that it would align with the duration of human accommodations.

10. **Next Steps**: The committee planned to finalize the draft, incorporate feedback, and schedule a follow-up work session to review the revised language before sending it to the full committee.

### **House Bill 1454: Permits for the Siting of New Landfills**

The committee also discussed **House Bill 1454**, which aims to establish stricter standards for landfill siting to protect groundwater resources. Key points included:

1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill seeks to establish a **time-to-travel standard** for groundwater contamination, ensuring a **five-year buffer** to detect and respond to leaks or spills from landfills before they impact water resources. It also aims to improve the clarity and scientific rigor of landfill siting requirements.

2. **Discussion on Amendments**: The committee reviewed amendments to the bill, including changes to language regarding **on-site field testing** and **representative sampling**. Debate centered on terms like "adequate" and "representative," with concerns about interpretation and enforcement by the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**.

3. **Technical Considerations**: The committee emphasized the **geological complexity of New Hampshire**, including variations in soil, overburden, till, and bedrock, and how these factors affect groundwater flow. Accurate and representative testing was highlighted as critical for determining groundwater travel time.

4. **Public and Environmental Impact**: The bill addresses concerns about **groundwater contamination** and its potential impact on water resources. It aims to ensure that landfills are sited in locations where contamination can be detected and mitigated within a reasonable timeframe.

5. **Role of DES**: DES would play a central role in evaluating landfill applications, including determining what constitutes **adequate testing** and ensuring compliance with the bill’s requirements. The committee discussed the need for DES to have the authority to request **off-site testing** if necessary.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to continue refining the bill, with plans to draft additional language and hold another work session. The goal is to finalize an amendment that clarifies the bill’s intent and ensures it is scientifically sound and enforceable.

### **Overall Themes**

Both bills reflect the committee’s focus on balancing **public welfare**, **environmental protection**, and **practical implementation**. **House Bill 1186** emphasizes the importance of companion animal welfare during emergencies, addressing logistical, legal, and operational concerns. **House Bill 1454** underscores the need for rigorous scientific standards and regulatory clarity to protect groundwater resources from landfill contamination. The committee emphasized collaboration with state agencies and stakeholders to refine the bills and ensure their effectiveness.
