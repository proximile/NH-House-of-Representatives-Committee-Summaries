### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (February 9, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 9, 2022, to discuss several key bills, focusing on issues ranging from solar energy in homeowners associations (HOAs) to law enforcement access to hotel guest logs. Below is a detailed summary of the meeting’s key discussions and themes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 1380: Solar Energy and Homeowners Associations**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prohibit HOAs from restricting the installation of solar photovoltaic energy systems on properties controlled by homeowners, voiding any unreasonable restrictions in HOA documents.
- **Support**:
  - Supporters, including the prime sponsor, argued that the bill empowers homeowners to adopt clean energy solutions, reduce energy costs, and align with broader environmental goals.
  - The bill does not mandate solar installation but removes barriers for homeowners who wish to install systems.
- **Opposition**:
  - Stakeholders, including attorneys and HOA representatives, opposed the bill, citing concerns about aesthetic uniformity, property values, and potential conflicts over placement and maintenance of solar panels.
  - Opponents emphasized that HOAs already have mechanisms to amend their documents through democratic voting if they wish to allow solar installations, and that state intervention undermines HOA autonomy.
- **Key Themes**:
  - The debate centered on the balance between homeowner autonomy and collective decision-making in HOAs.
  - Opponents stressed the importance of maintaining community standards and property values, while supporters highlighted the need for clean energy adoption.

#### **House Bill 1378: Inspection of Public Lodging Houses**
- **Purpose**: The bill would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant to access hotel guest records, aligning with privacy protections under the New Hampshire Constitution.
- **Support**:
  - Advocates, including constituents and representatives, argued that individuals have a right to privacy in their lodging activities. They cited historical examples, such as Nazi Germany, to emphasize the dangers of unchecked access to personal information.
- **Opposition**:
  - Law enforcement officials opposed the bill, stating that access to hotel logs is crucial for combating crimes like human trafficking, drug dealing, and fugitive tracking. They argued that the current system allows for efficient investigations without requiring warrants.
- **Modernization of Laws**:
  - Both supporters and opponents acknowledged that New Hampshire’s lodging statutes, last updated in the 1970s, need modernization to reflect current business practices, such as contactless check-ins and online bookings.
- **Key Themes**:
  - The debate highlighted the tension between protecting individual privacy and enabling law enforcement to effectively combat crime.
  - There was a call for updating outdated statutes to reflect contemporary practices and technologies.

#### **House Bill 1146: Condo Fee Assessments**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to reduce the threshold for rejecting condominium fee increases from a two-thirds majority to a simple majority (50% +1).
- **Support**:
  - The prime sponsor, a former condo association president, argued that this change would give condo owners more control over fee increases, especially in cases where sudden, significant hikes cause financial strain. The bill only applies to monthly fees, not special assessments or other decisions.
- **Opposition**:
  - Stakeholders, including attorneys, property managers, and condo board members, strongly opposed the bill. Key concerns included:
    - The two-thirds threshold ensures fiscal responsibility and protects associations from financial instability.
    - Lowering the threshold could make it harder for boards to manage budgets, especially with rising costs due to inflation and emergencies.
    - Boards already have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the association, and the current law allows owners to override budgets with a two-thirds vote.
    - The bill could discourage volunteers from serving on boards due to increased difficulty in managing finances.
- **Key Themes**:
  - The debate focused on the balance between individual rights and collective decision-making in condo associations.
  - Opponents emphasized the importance of maintaining fiscal responsibility and protecting the financial stability of associations.

### **Law Enforcement Access to Hotel Logs**
- **Current Practices**:
  - Under current New Hampshire law, law enforcement can inspect hotel guest logs without a warrant. This is seen as an effective tool for combating illegal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and other crimes.
- **Case Studies**:
  - Law enforcement officials provided examples where access to hotel logs was instrumental in solving cases, including a double homicide and a police shooting.
- **Privacy Concerns**:
  - Legislators raised questions about the balance between public safety and individual privacy rights. Law enforcement officials emphasized that they operate with transparency and follow established procedures to ensure that constitutional rights are not violated.
- **Legislative Proposals**:
  - There was discussion about potential legislative changes that could require law enforcement to notify the public when they access hotel records. Some legislators expressed concerns about the implications for privacy and civil liberties, while others supported the current practices as necessary for public safety.

### **Other Topics**
- **Commercial Scales and Food Trucks**:
  - The meeting briefly touched on issues such as the calibration of commercial scales and the regulation of food trucks and carts. These topics were discussed in the context of ensuring compliance with state regulations and protecting consumer interests.

   - There was significant discussion about the role of state intervention in local matters, particularly in HOAs and lodging regulations.
