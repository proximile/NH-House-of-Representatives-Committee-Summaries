**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (February 14, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy (STNE) Committee convened on February 14, 2022, to discuss key issues related to **House Bill 1258**, which focuses on the reorganization of the **Department of Energy (DOE)** and its relationship with the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**. The meeting addressed overlapping responsibilities, procedural challenges, and the need for clarity in governance and consumer protection within the energy sector. Below is a consolidated summary of the discussions:

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities**  
   - The PUC has well-defined statutory responsibilities, while the DOE's operational mandate remains less clear, leading to potential confusion in overlapping duties.  
   - The committee emphasized the need for a detailed presentation from the DOE to clarify its functions and its relationship with the PUC. This session is tentatively planned for the fall or before the session year ends on May 26th.  

2. **Reorganization Between DOE and PUC**  
   - The ongoing reorganization between the two agencies was a central focus, with many positions only recently filled. The committee acknowledged that further adjustments will be necessary as the reorganization progresses.  
   - Specific areas of responsibility, such as community power aggregation, were clarified, with the DOE withdrawing its request for authority over this area, leaving it with the PUC.  

3. **Investigative and Adjudicative Processes**  
   - Concerns were raised about the efficiency of investigations when investigators belong to the DOE rather than directly to the PUC. The committee discussed the need for streamlined processes to ensure timely and effective resolutions.  
   - The committee debated the handling of consumer complaints, with some members advocating for the ability to appeal to the PUC if dissatisfied with the DOE's resolution. The DOE agreed to consider adding language to allow consumers to request a hearing before the PUC.  

4. **Rulemaking and Jurisdiction**  
   - The legislature reaffirmed its authority to determine jurisdiction and expressed frustration over a proposed five-year rulemaking timeline. Members stressed the need for timely resolution of issues, particularly those related to safety and pole attachments.  
   - The committee discussed extending the expiration date of the PUC’s procedural and organizational rules, set to expire on June 30th, to ensure continuity while new rules are developed.  

5. **Consumer Protection and Advocacy**  
   - The role of the Consumer Advocate was clarified, with the office representing the interests of residential ratepayers generally, while the DOE's consumer division handles individual complaints.  
   - The committee addressed a typographical error in the statute related to consumer protection provisions for competitive electric and gas suppliers, ensuring the correct agency (DOE) is referenced.  

6. **Licensing and Safety Regulations**  
   - The committee proposed streamlining the process for granting licenses to utilities to cross state lands and waters. Under the new proposal, the DOE would grant licenses administratively, with appeals to the PUC if parties feel harmed.  
   - Both the DOE and PUC retain authority over safety regulations for utilities, though the division of responsibilities remains a work in progress.  

7. **Affiliate Agreements and Pole Attachments**  
   - The committee proposed removing language requiring the PUC to approve affiliate agreements between public utilities and their affiliates, as this has historically not been the PUC’s role.  
   - Discussions also focused on ensuring that both the DOE and PUC retain authority over safety and other regulations related to pole attachments, preventing utilities from bargaining away state regulatory authority.  

8. **Procedural and Administrative Issues**  
   - The committee addressed the timeline for amendments to Bill 1258, with amendments to be finalized by February 25th. Subcommittee meetings were scheduled for February 22nd–24th to review and finalize the amendment.  
   - The committee tentatively planned to meet on February 22nd at 10 a.m. to evaluate the amendment, with language to be submitted to the Office of Legislative Services (OLS) by February 16th for review.  
   - The remaining STNE bills are set to be executed on February 28th and March 1st, though some members noted scheduling conflicts due to school vacation week.  

9. **Funding and Assessments**  
   - The committee discussed the process for assessing public utilities to fund the DOE, PUC, and Office of Consumer Advocate. The DOE would handle the collection of assessments, but budget allocation remains controlled by the legislature and governor.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the complexities of the reorganization between the DOE and PUC and the need for clear communication, streamlined processes, and ongoing collaboration to ensure effective governance and consumer protection in the energy sector. The committee emphasized the importance of ongoing rulemaking and adjustments to address overlapping responsibilities and procedural challenges. The session concluded with plans to move forward on Bill 1258 and continue addressing these issues in future meetings.
