**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (02/18/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 18, 2022, to address various administrative rules, focusing on compliance, clarity, and timely implementation. The meeting encompassed several critical discussions and decisions:

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

1. **Support and Opposition to Motions**:  
   Representatives debated a motion concerning the implementation of a program with significant taxpayer implications. Senator Whitley opposed the motion, citing concerns about violating public trust and inadequate criteria for managing public funds. Representative Ruriart supported the motion but stressed the need for clarity, such as explicitly prohibiting the use of funds for religious instruction.

2. **Approval of Rules with Recommendations**:  
   The committee conditionally approved a rule related to the disbursement of child support payments, recommending that the agency collaborate with the legislature to resolve outstanding issues. The approval included a requirement for the agency to report on how it implements the constitutional mandate against funding religious instruction.

3. **Federal Regulations and State Rules**:  
   Discussions centered on aligning state rules with federal regulations, particularly concerning intercepted federal tax refunds. The committee decided to incorporate specific federal language into the rule to ensure compliance and prevent unauthorized changes without legislative approval.

4. **Rule Expiration Concerns**:  
   The committee addressed a significant reduction in rule-making over the past two years, with many rules nearing expiration. Staff expressed concern that agencies are not proactively renewing or updating rules, potentially leading to enforcement issues. The committee plans to send letters to agencies reminding them of upcoming expirations and encouraging timely action.

5. **Emergency Rule for Dentists**:  
   The Board of Dental Examiners proposed an emergency rule allowing dentists to complete 100% of their continuing education units online for 180 days due to limited access to in-person seminars. This measure aimed to ensure dentists could renew their licenses without economic harm.

6. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)**:  
   A substantial portion of the meeting focused on the EFA program, which allows parents to use state funds for educational expenses. Key points included:  
   - **Catch-All Provision**: Concerns were raised about the broad language in the catch-all provision (category "o") for educational expenses, which covers unforeseen costs. The Department of Education argued that the provision was necessary and constrained by the statute's broader categories.  
   - **Religious Instruction**: There was debate about explicitly prohibiting the use of funds for religious instruction. The Department of Education maintained that such use would be unconstitutional but opposed adding specific language to the rules, citing potential confusion and legal complications.  
   - **Scholarship Organization Oversight**: The scholarship organization administering the EFA program has the authority to determine eligible expenses, with oversight from the Department of Education, which conducts programmatic monitoring and audits to ensure compliance.  

7. **Public Testimony and Rule Approval**:  
   The committee approved the EFA rules, requesting that the Department of Education work with the legislature to address concerns about the catch-all provision and religious instruction.

8. **Other Administrative Rules**:  
   The committee also discussed and approved rules related to the licensure of architects and distance education, with no significant public testimony received.

### Committee Procedures and Health Measures:  
The committee noted that staff members wear face masks due to chronic medical conditions, emphasizing that this is not a political statement. Procedural improvements, such as better tracking of rule expirations and potential extensions for agencies falling behind, were also discussed.

### Adjournment:  
The meeting concluded with a reminder about upcoming public hearings and the importance of timely rule-making to prevent lapses in enforcement.

### Overall Themes:  
The meeting underscored the importance of clear, compliant, and timely administrative rules. Key themes included addressing concerns about public trust, ensuring federal-state alignment, and preventing rule expirations. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing legislative intent, constitutional requirements, and administrative practicality, particularly in programs like the EFA.
