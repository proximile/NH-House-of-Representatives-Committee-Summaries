The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 7, 2022, focused on several key bills addressing housing, local governance, and zoning reforms. Here is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Housing Crisis and Zoning Reforms**
1. **HB 1177 (Fourplex Bill)**:
   - **Purpose**: To address New Hampshire’s housing shortage by allowing up to four residential units on single-family lots in areas with municipal water and sewer systems.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Promotes "missing middle" housing (duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes) to bridge the gap between single-family homes and large apartment complexes.
     - Targets infill development in existing neighborhoods to maximize infrastructure use and reduce environmental impact.
     - Supports diverse housing needs, including aging residents, young professionals, and multi-generational families.
     - Opposed by the New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) due to concerns about local control and infrastructure capacity.
     - Supported by groups like AARP and the American Enterprise Institute for its potential to alleviate the housing crisis and support aging in place.

2. **HB 1194 (Overriding Local Tax Caps)**:
   - **Purpose**: Requires a three-fifths supermajority to override local tax caps, aligning the override threshold with the threshold needed to adopt a tax cap.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Aims to ensure fiscal responsibility and prudence in spending.
     - Applies to towns, districts, and school districts, but not cities.
     - Mixed reactions, with some arguing it ensures fiscal discipline and others questioning the need for a statewide mandate.

### **Local Governance and Accountability**
1. **HB 1223 (Meeting Attendance Requirements)**:
   - **Purpose**: Requires elected members of budget committees and school boards to attend at least 75% of meetings in person annually.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Aims to address issues with absenteeism, particularly among "snowbirds" and remote attendees.
     - Exceptions for extenuating circumstances like illness.
     - Opposition from NHMA due to conflicts with existing laws and concerns about discrimination against individuals with health issues.

2. **HB 1259 (Election and Resignation of Members)**:
   - **Purpose**: Prevents strategic resignations within 90 days of an election to allow board-appointed replacements.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Proposes appointing the next highest vote-getter from the election to ensure voter choice.
     - Questions raised about handling multiple candidates or primaries.
     - Opposition from NHMA, emphasizing local control.

### **Housing Appeals Board (HAB)**
1. **HB 1307 (Modifications to HAB)**:
   - **Purpose**: Limits the HAB’s jurisdiction to housing development decisions made by specific local boards.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Aims to clarify the HAB’s focus on housing-related appeals, excluding broader municipal decisions.
     - Opposed by Senator Bob Guida and others who argue the HAB is essential for addressing the housing crisis efficiently.
     - Concerns about pushing more appeals to superior courts, increasing delays and costs.
     - Support from NHMA for limiting the HAB’s authority to specific land use boards.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Local vs. State Control**: Recurring debate on whether issues should be addressed through statewide mandates or left to local governing bodies.
2. **Accountability and Representation**: Efforts to ensure elected officials are accountable to voters and actively participate in their roles.
3. **Housing Crisis**: Emphasis on the urgent need for more housing to address affordability, workforce shortages, and the state’s aging population.
4. **Opposition from NHMA**: Consistent opposition to bills perceived as infringing on local decision-making and conflicting with existing laws.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the ongoing tension between local autonomy and the need for statewide solutions to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis and governance challenges. Discussions on HB 1177, HB 1194, HB 1223, HB 1259, and HB 1307 underscored the importance of balancing accountability, representation, and local control while striving to provide more housing options and ensure fiscal responsibility. The committee planned to reconvene to continue discussions on other pending bills.
