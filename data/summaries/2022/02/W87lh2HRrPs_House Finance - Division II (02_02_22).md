The February 2, 2022, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division II, focused on the financial and regulatory challenges faced by a nonprofit organization, **Econ**, in managing a **closed landfill** in **Newport, NH**. The discussion centered on the **financial assurance requirements** imposed by the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** and the organization’s request for state funding to address a significant funding gap. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Background and Financial Shortfall**
Econ, a volunteer-run nonprofit and economic development organization, is responsible for the post-closure maintenance of the Newport landfill. DES requires a **rolling 30-year financial assurance** to cover ongoing costs, such as monitoring and maintenance. However, Econ faces a **funding shortfall** due to a midstream clarification of DES regulations. Initially, the landfill’s costs were covered by a trust fund established with contributions from 27 towns, but the 2014 regulatory change to a rolling 30-year assurance has created a gap. The trust fund currently holds **$756,649**, but after accounting for unpaid invoices to Newport, the effective balance is **$584,000**. Econ estimates they need **$820,000** to meet the financial assurance requirement.

---

### **Econ’s Unique Situation**
Econ is the only organization in New Hampshire managing a landfill without generating revenue from it. This unprecedented situation has placed significant financial strain on the nonprofit. Despite exploring alternative revenue streams—such as renting out parts of the property or developing a solar farm—none have proven viable due to high infrastructure costs and regulatory constraints. Econ emphasized that their primary mission is economic development, not landfill management.

---

### **Request for State Funding**
Econ is seeking a **$500,000 appropriation** from the state to bridge the funding gap and meet DES’s financial assurance requirements. This funding would allow Econ to continue managing the landfill without depleting the assurance funds, which are restricted and cannot be used for operational expenses. Econ warned that without state assistance, the landfill could fall into the hands of the state, shifting the financial burden to taxpayers.

---

### **Regulatory Constraints and DES’s Position**
DES representatives clarified that the **rolling 30-year financial assurance** requirement has always been in place, though there was a lack of clarity in its interpretation in the past. DES emphasized that they are bound by state regulations and cannot waive or modify the rules, even in unique cases like Econ’s. They acknowledged Econ’s stewardship of the landfill but stressed that any solution would require legislative action.

---

### **Legislative Discussion and Concerns**
Committee members explored potential solutions, including:
- **Amending legislation** to allow the existing trust fund to meet the financial assurance requirement.
- Granting DES **waiver authority** for specific cases.
- Providing a **legislative carve-out** to address Econ’s unique situation.

However, concerns were raised about setting a **precedent** for other entities managing closed landfills and the broader implications of deviating from regulatory requirements. Representatives also questioned the **responsibility of local governments** and the feasibility of Econ’s funding request.

---

### **Proposed Amendment to HB 1300**
Representative Rawlings introduced an **amendment to HB 1300** at Econ’s request. The amendment seeks to address the funding shortfall and ensure the landfill’s continued maintenance. Econ has worked with **Novus Engineering** to develop detailed cost estimates and has consulted with experts, stakeholders, and legal counsel to exhaust all options.

---

### **Next Steps**
The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issue and planned to schedule another work session to further discuss potential solutions. They emphasized the need to balance regulatory requirements with the practical challenges faced by Econ while considering the financial and legal implications of providing state funds.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the **financial and regulatory difficulties** faced by Econ in managing the Newport landfill and underscored the broader challenges of landfill management in New Hampshire. The discussion revolved around finding a solution that allows Econ to continue its stewardship of the landfill without violating state regulations, while also addressing the funding gap and avoiding a financial burden on taxpayers. The committee’s next steps will involve further exploration of legislative and regulatory options to resolve the issue.
