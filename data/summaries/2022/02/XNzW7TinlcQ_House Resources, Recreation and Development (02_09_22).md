### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Resources, Recreation, and Development (02/09/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened to discuss and deliberate on a range of bills addressing environmental protection, public safety, and recreational access. The meeting highlighted the committee's efforts to balance these priorities through amendments, interim studies, and work sessions. Below is a summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1167**: Establishing a maximum contaminant level for perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS) in surface water. The committee moved the bill to interim study to allow the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to complete its ongoing work on the issue.

2. **House Bill 1185**: Addressing PFAS-contaminated waste handling by septic haulers and wastewater treatment facilities. The bill was amended to distinguish between residential and commercial septic haulers and passed with unanimous consent.

3. **House Bill 1188**: Establishing a commission to study off-highway recreational vehicle (OHRV) use in the state. The bill, with an amendment adjusting the commission’s membership, passed unanimously.

4. **House Bill 1227**: Relative to the definition of prime wetlands. The bill faced opposition due to concerns about increased costs and delays for highway projects. The motion to declare the bill inexpedient to legislate failed, and it will proceed with a minority report.

5. **House Bill 1316**: Establishing safety standards for a new type of watercraft. The bill passed unanimously, granting Marine Patrol authority to regulate the craft.

6. **House Bill 1440**: Setting surface water quality standards for perfluorinated chemicals. Similar to HB 1167, the bill was moved to interim study to allow DES to finalize its ongoing study.

7. **House Bill 1498**: Establishing a safety program for OHRVs and snowmobiles. The bill was moved to interim study to refine costs and regulations.

8. **House Bill 1554**: Allowing online payment of fees for OHRVs and snowmobiles. The bill, with an amendment removing fines, passed nearly unanimously.

9. **House Bill 1602**: Relative to PFAS testing in schools and child care facilities. The committee decided to hold a work session to address concerns about funding and implementation.

10. **House Bill 1071**: Increasing the safe passage distance for wake surfing from 150 to 250 feet. This bill sparked significant debate, with supporters citing environmental and safety concerns, while opponents argued it would limit recreational access. The discussion included references to a **University of Minnesota study** showing that wake surfing waves at 150 feet are twice as large and have 10 times the energy of waves from traditional boats. Proponents emphasized the need to protect shorelines and aquatic habitats, while opponents highlighted the **Wake Responsibly Campaign** as an alternative to legislation.

11. **House Bill 1438**: Relative to the use of moorings by persons other than permit holders. A work session clarified that moorings on the seacoast are managed by the New Hampshire Port Authority, which has a temporary seasonal use program. The bill aims to allow mooring holders to lend their moorings for short periods, but concerns were raised about potential abuse and liability.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Environmental Protection**: Several bills, including HB 1167, HB 1440, and HB 1071, focused on mitigating environmental impacts, particularly from PFAS contamination and recreational activities like wake surfing. The committee often moved bills to interim study to allow DES to complete ongoing work or refine regulations.

- **Public Safety**: Bills like HB 1316 (watercraft safety standards) and HB 1498 (OHRV and snowmobile safety program) emphasized the importance of safety in recreational activities. Amendments were made to address practical concerns and ensure enforceability.

- **Recreational Access**: The committee sought to balance recreational access with environmental and safety concerns. For example, HB 1071 highlighted the tension between wake surfing enthusiasts and those concerned about shoreline erosion and lake health. Opponents argued that education, rather than legislation, is the best approach to address these issues.

- **Economic Considerations**: The economic impact of recreational activities, particularly wake surfing and OHRV use, was a recurring theme. Opponents of HB 1071 warned that the bill could harm New Hampshire's tourism industry, while supporters countered that responsible regulation would protect the state’s natural resources.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: The committee demonstrated a commitment to engaging stakeholders, as seen in the extensive testimony on HB 1071 and the decision to hold work sessions for bills like HB 1602 and HB 1438.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on finding a balance between environmental stewardship, public safety, and recreational access. Many bills were moved to interim study or amended to address stakeholder concerns, reflecting a deliberative approach to complex issues. The debate over HB 1071, in particular, highlighted the challenges of reconciling competing interests while protecting New Hampshire’s natural resources and promoting responsible recreation. The committee’s decisions will shape future policies on water quality, recreational safety, and environmental conservation in the state.
