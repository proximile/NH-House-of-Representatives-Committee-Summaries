**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee Meeting (02/03/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on February 3, 2022, to discuss several bills addressing housing, taxation, ethics, local governance, and funding mechanisms. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills:

---

### **Housing and Zoning Issues**
1. **House Bill 1179**:  
   - **Purpose**: To address the housing crisis by potentially modifying dimensional requirements for housing developments.  
   - **Discussion**: The bill received no support and one opposition during the hearing, with some representatives arguing that the current system was sufficient.  

2. **House Bill 1184**:  
   - **Purpose**: Authorizes counties, cities, and village districts to establish revolving funds, similar to those already allowed for towns.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Inspired by the need for revolving funds for police details in counties.  
     - Aims to standardize the ability of all political entities to create funds for specific purposes, such as police equipment.  
     - Concerns were raised about clarity and the capacity of counties to manage such funds.  
     - The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) opposed the bill due to vagueness and potential conflicts with existing laws.  

3. **House Bill 1219**:  
   - **Purpose**: Prevents local planning boards from denying housing projects affiliated with religious institutions based on parking requirements.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Inspired by California legislation, the bill aims to repurpose underutilized church parking lots to address housing shortages.  
     - Concerns included defining "religious use parking spaces" and potential tax implications.  

4. **Protest Petitions and Zoning Changes**:  
   - **House Bill 1179**: Seeks to limit the use of protest petitions in zoning changes, particularly those aimed at increasing housing density or affordability.  
   - **Debate Highlights**:  
     - Questions arose about whether the bill would reduce citizen input and local control over zoning decisions.  
     - The bill’s sponsor clarified its intent to facilitate compliance with state housing development goals.

### **Taxation and Elderly Assistance**
1. **House Bill 1183**:  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes a 5% annual reduction in the school portion of property taxes for residents aged 75 and older, totaling a 25% reduction over five years.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill includes provisions for towns or cities to adopt or rescind the tax credit.  
     - Implementation was delayed until 2024 to allow tax collectors time to prepare.  
     - Concerns were raised about the lack of means testing and the potential burden on other taxpayers.  
     - The NHMA initially opposed the bill but became neutral after amendments addressed local control issues.

### **Ethics and Transparency**
1. **House Bill 1161**:  
   - **Purpose**: Establishes ethics standards for elected local and county officials, requiring disclosure of conflicts of interest and imposing penalties for violations.  
   - **Debate Highlights**:  
     - Concerns were raised about defining conflicts of interest, especially in small towns where officials often have personal ties to issues.  
     - Questions arose about the inclusion of criminal penalties (misdemeanors) and the mechanisms for removing officials.  
     - Testimony from the NHMA and other organizations opposed the bill, citing existing ethics policies and concerns about overreach.

### **Local Governance and Funding**
1. **House Bill 1136**:  
   - **Purpose**: Requires planning boards to list required studies and fee schedules for applications, aiming to provide transparency and cost predictability.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Repetitive studies are only allowed if there are substantial changes to the plan.  
     - Concerns included the lack of specificity in defining "substantial impact" and potential redundancy for towns already following similar practices.  
     - The NHMA opposed the bill, arguing it could complicate planning board processes.  

2. **House Bill 1223**:  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes attendance requirements for elected members of budget committees and school boards.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Concerns were raised about removing officials for non-attendance, especially due to illness or other valid reasons.  

3. **Police Details and Revolving Funds**:  
   - **Discussion**: Police details (e.g., construction site security) are self-funded, with fees covering costs or generating profits for equipment like bulletproof vests and cruisers.  
   - **Clarification**: Revolving funds (self-sustaining, non-tax revenues) differ from capital reserve funds (typically for building and facilities).

### **General Themes and Concerns**
- **Local Control vs. State Goals**: Several bills sparked debate about balancing state objectives (e.g., housing development) with local decision-making and citizen input.  
- **Clarity and Readiness**: Many bills faced criticism for vague language, lack of specificity, and potential unintended consequences.  
- **Fiscal Impact**: Representatives emphasized the need for fiscal notes to assess the financial implications of proposed legislation.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting covered a wide range of issues, from housing and taxation to ethics and local governance. While many bills aimed to increase transparency, accountability, and support for vulnerable populations, they also raised concerns about clarity, implementation, and their impact on local control. The meeting concluded early due to deteriorating weather conditions, with plans to resume discussions on Monday.
