The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on February 3, 2022, addressed several key pieces of legislation impacting education policy, with discussions focusing on charter schools, homeschooling, background checks, school culture and climate, and mask mandates. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

### **House Bill 1402: Charter Schools and Bonding Processes**
HB 1402 aims to include charter schools in school district bond issuance processes for capital construction needs. The bill seeks to clarify existing laws, which are unclear about whether charter schools can engage in bonding independently or jointly with districts. Key points include:
- **Voluntary Participation**: Charter schools can participate in bonding discussions, but districts retain authority to accept or reject their inclusion.
- **Funding Challenges**: Charter schools often divert operating funds to facilities, limiting resources for educational programs. The bill aims to address this by enabling access to construction funding through bonding.
- **Concerns**: Representatives raised issues about financial liability, property ownership, and potential debt burdens on districts. It was clarified that districts are not mandated to take on financial responsibility for charter schools.
- **Potential Benefits**: Including charter schools in bonding could make proposals more appealing to voters, particularly charter school communities.
- **Amendments**: Suggestions were made to clarify property ownership and financial responsibilities, with plans for further discussion in a subcommittee.

### **House Bill 1133: Criminal Background Checks**
HB 1133 mandates criminal background checks for individuals working with children in educational programs receiving public funds. Key points include:
- **Scope**: The bill applies to employees, volunteers, and contractors, including tutors hired through Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs).
- **Volunteers and Costs**: Debate focused on whether volunteers or short-term workers should be subject to checks and who would bear the costs.
- **Legal Framework**: The bill aligns with RSA 189:13-a, which outlines background check requirements for public school employees.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal note was deemed indeterminable due to the bill’s broad scope.
- **Child Safety**: There was consensus on the importance of ensuring child safety, though questions remained about implementation.

### **House Bill 1663: Homeschooling Reforms**
HB 1663 seeks to modernize and clarify New Hampshire’s homeschooling laws, particularly for unfunded homeschool families. Key points include:
- **Equal Access**: The bill ensures homeschool students have access to public school resources, such as extracurricular activities and specialized classes.
- **Parental Control**: It emphasizes that home education is directed by parents, not school districts, and removes the 40th percentile academic achievement requirement for homeschoolers, which was deemed unfair and discriminatory.
- **Special Needs Protections**: The bill includes explicit protections for homeschool students with disabilities, ensuring assessments account for their individual needs.
- **Notification Requirements**: It clarifies procedures for notifying school districts when homeschooled students move or change districts.
- **Support**: Homeschool advocates testified in favor of the bill, highlighting its potential to reduce unnecessary burdens and ensure equitable treatment.

### **House Bill 1398: Centralized Background Checks**
HB 1398 proposes a study committee to explore centralized criminal history record checks for education professionals. Key points include:
- **Inefficiencies**: The current system requires separate background checks for individuals working in multiple schools.
- **Complexities**: Federal regulations and FBI involvement complicate the process.
- **Child Safety**: The Department of Education supported the study committee approach, emphasizing the need for careful consideration to avoid risks.

### **House Bill 1198: School Culture and Climate**
HB 1198 aims to restrict the Department of Education from enforcing rules related to school culture and climate. Key points include:
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to address ambiguity and redundancy in administrative rules, which include language on diversity, equity, and respectful behavior.
- **Concerns**: Supporters argued these rules are overly broad and could lead to policies lacking community consensus.
- **Opposition**: Organizations like NAMI New Hampshire and New Futures emphasized the importance of positive school culture in reducing bullying and improving student wellness.
- **Debate**: The discussion highlighted the balance between academic priorities and the role of school culture in student well-being.

### **House Bill 1588: Mask Mandates and Parental Rights**
HB 1588 addresses mask mandates in schools and parental rights. Key points include:
- **Support**: Supporters argued parents should decide whether their children wear masks, emphasizing parental rights and local control. They claimed masks harm children physically and psychologically and questioned their effectiveness.
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including the American Federation of Teachers, argued mask mandates should remain a local decision based on public health needs. They warned the bill could impose financial burdens on school districts.
- **Public Health**: Proponents of mandates cited studies showing masks reduce COVID-19 transmission, while opponents questioned the evidence.
- **Emotional and Political Undertones**: The debate was highly charged, with references to authoritarianism, bullying, and the psychological impact on children.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected broader national debates on education policy, highlighting tensions between parental rights, local control, and public health. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing individual freedoms with collective responsibility, ensuring child safety, and fostering equitable access to educational resources.
