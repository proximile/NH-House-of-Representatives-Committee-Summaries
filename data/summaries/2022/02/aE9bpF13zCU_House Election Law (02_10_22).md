The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 10, 2022, focused on a range of election-related bills and amendments, with discussions centered on voter registration, election integrity, provisional ballots, and the practical implications of proposed changes. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1543: Voter Registration and Provisional Ballots**
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to ensure only legally eligible individuals vote by tightening voter registration requirements and introducing provisional ballots for cases where eligibility cannot be immediately verified.
   - **Provisional Ballots**: If a voter’s registration cannot be validated at the time of voting, they would receive a provisional ballot, which would be sealed and only counted if eligibility is confirmed later.
   - **Verification Measures**: The bill includes provisions for verifying voter domicile, such as requiring new voters to register their vehicles and obtain New Hampshire driver’s licenses within 60 days. Town clerks would follow up with the DMV to confirm compliance.
   - **Concerns**: Town clerks expressed logistical challenges in verifying vehicle registrations, especially in towns where clerks do not handle vehicle registrations. Concerns were also raised about the impact on disabled or elderly voters who do not own vehicles. The New Hampshire City and Town Clerks Association opposed the bill, citing potential burdens on clerks.
   - **Support**: Supporters argued the bill would prevent non-residents from voting and ensure election integrity.

2. **House Bill 1174: Election Challengers’ Proximity**
   - **Amendment**: An amendment was unanimously approved (20-0) to clarify the placement of election challengers, ensuring they could observe ballot counting without disrupting the process. It specified that challengers should be within six feet of hand-counting ballots for tabulation.
   - **Outcome**: The bill, as amended, was passed with bipartisan support.

3. **House Bill 1197: Party Recognition Threshold**
   - **Proposal**: The bill proposed lowering the threshold for party recognition in New Hampshire from 4% to 1% in statewide elections.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to recommend the bill as inexpedient to legislate (ITL), arguing the current system is fair.

4. **House Bill 1252: Political Contributions from Businesses**
   - **Proposal**: The bill addressed political contributions from businesses receiving state grants.
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously voted (20-0) to recommend ITL, finding the language too broad despite supporting the intent.

5. **House Bill 1383: Absentee Ballot Lists**
   - **Proposal**: The bill required absentee ballot lists to be provided within one business day.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was postponed for further work on amendments to streamline the process for town clerks.

6. **House Bill 1567: Removal of Election Officials**
   - **Proposal**: The bill pertains to the removal of election officials.
   - **Outcome**: A continuance was requested to allow time for further amendment work.

### **Additional Bills and Themes**

1. **House Bill 1153: Absentee Ballot Requests**
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Peter Tarosian introduced the bill, which clarifies that absentee ballots cannot be mailed to voters who are not registered in the town or city where they are voting.
   - **Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the potential burden on disabled or homebound voters, and town clerks opposed the bill, citing extra work and delays.

2. **House Bill 1324: Allocation of Presidential Electors**
   - **Proposal**: The bill proposes a proportional allocation of New Hampshire’s four electoral votes based on the percentage of votes each presidential candidate receives.
   - **Opposition**: Both Alvin C and Secretary of State David Scanlan spoke against the bill, arguing it would diminish New Hampshire’s influence in presidential elections and could be unfair in cases involving third-party candidates.

3. **House Bill 1359: Election Day Duties of Incumbent Election Officials**
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Jennifer Rhodes introduced the bill, which addresses conflicts of interest for election officials who are also candidates on the ballot.
   - **Amendment**: An amendment was proposed to exclude town clerks from the bill, addressing concerns raised by the New Hampshire Municipal Association.

4. **House Bill 1082: Prohibition of Political Action Committees**
   - **Proposal**: The bill aimed to prohibit certain state officers from forming political action committees.
   - **Support and Opposition**: Supporters argued it prevents conflicts of interest, while opponents claimed it infringes on First Amendment rights.

5. **House Bill 1149: Reduction of Signature Requirements**
   - **Proposal**: The bill sought to reduce the number of signatures required for nomination papers.
   - **Outcome**: It was deemed likely to overcrowd ballots and was recommended as "inexpedient to legislate."

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Election Integrity**: Many discussions centered on ensuring the integrity of elections, particularly around absentee ballots, provisional ballots, and the role of election officials.
- **Practical Concerns**: Several bills raised concerns about the potential for increased administrative burdens on town clerks and voters, as well as the fairness of proposed changes to electoral processes.
- **Opposition**: Multiple stakeholders, including town clerks and the Secretary of State, opposed certain bills, citing unintended consequences and the potential to undermine New Hampshire’s electoral influence.
- **Bipartisan Agreement**: Many bills and amendments received unanimous or bipartisan support, highlighting agreement on the need for clarity and fairness in election laws.
