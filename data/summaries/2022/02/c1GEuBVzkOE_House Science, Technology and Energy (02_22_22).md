**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (02/22/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee held a meeting on February 22, 2022, to discuss **House Bill 1258**, which addresses utility regulations and the implementation of the Department of Energy (DOE). The session focused on amendments to the bill, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the DOE and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), and ensuring effective oversight of energy policies. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Jurisdictional Clarity**
The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining the state's regulatory authority over utilities, particularly in areas such as **safety** and **vegetation management**. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts between the PUC and DOE, especially following the transfer of staff from the PUC to the DOE. The committee debated whether the DOE should retain or be granted regulatory authority, given its recent organizational changes. The goal was to ensure that utilities cannot bypass state oversight through contracts or agreements.

---

### **2. Role of the Department of Energy**
The DOE's authority was a central topic of discussion. Historically, the DOE lacked regulatory power, and the committee sought to clarify its role in energy-related proceedings. The amendment presented by the DOE consolidated provisions from other bills and clarified its responsibilities, including:
- **Adjudicative Proceedings**: The DOE is now an automatic party to PUC proceedings, and parties can request hearings if the DOE declines to transfer a complaint to the PUC.
- **Confidential Information**: The amendment ensures the DOE has access to confidential information from utilities, similar to the PUC, to perform its regulatory functions while preventing ex parte communications and maintaining transparency.
- **Crossing Licenses**: The DOE will handle administrative approvals for utilities crossing state land or water, with the PUC adjudicating disputes if necessary.

---

### **3. Poll Attachments and Safety**
The committee discussed **poll attachment agreements**, focusing on ensuring that utilities cannot bypass state oversight. Both the DOE and PUC will retain authority over safety and vegetation management for utility poles. However, concerns were raised about potential conflicts between the agencies in handling these matters.

---

### **4. Proposed Amendments and Language Adjustments**
Several amendments were proposed to refine the bill:
- **Five-Year Rule Review**: A provision for a five-year review of rules was discussed to address past issues, though it was not yet included in the bill.
- **Statewide Energy Data Platform**: Language from House Bill 1285 was incorporated to establish a statewide energy data platform with privacy and security provisions.
- **Public Good Standard**: The committee debated whether the "public good" standard should remain with the PUC or shift to the DOE, ultimately leaving it as a general standard without specifying jurisdiction.

---

### **5. Disconnections and Terminations**
The DOE will review **service disconnections** to ensure compliance with rules, particularly for medical disconnections, safeguarding vulnerable populations.

---

### **6. Collaboration Between PUC and DOE**
The committee acknowledged the need for seamless collaboration between the PUC and DOE, especially in areas like **transmission siting** and **regional energy issues**. The amendment aims to clarify roles and responsibilities to avoid jurisdictional conflicts and ensure efficient regulation.

---

### **7. Timeline and Next Steps**
The committee aimed to finalize amendments by Friday, February 25, to prepare for the bill's execution on March 1. Concerns about a potential snowstorm affecting deadlines were noted.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of reorganizing regulatory responsibilities between the PUC and DOE. The committee emphasized the importance of clear language to prevent conflicts, ensure effective oversight, and maintain transparency in energy-related matters. The amendment to House Bill 1258 seeks to address these issues while balancing the roles of the PUC and DOE in regulating utilities and implementing energy policies. The session concluded with thanks to the DOE for their assistance and an acknowledgment that further adjustments might be needed as the new regulatory structure is implemented.
