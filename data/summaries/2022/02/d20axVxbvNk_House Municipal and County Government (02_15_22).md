The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 15, 2022, convened to discuss a range of bills related to municipal and county government, with a focus on transparency in budgeting, affordable housing, environmental regulations, property taxes, and school district budgets. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Transparency in Municipal Budgeting (HB 1026)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1026 aims to enhance transparency in municipal budgeting by requiring governing bodies to provide budget recommendations in full line-item detail in an editable spreadsheet format, enabling budget committees to make more informed decisions.
- **Discussion**: Representative Piemonte introduced the bill, emphasizing its simplicity and the need for transparency. Concerns were raised about the language of the bill, particularly the use of "may" versus "shall," and the practicality of editable spreadsheets. Catherine Heck from the NH Municipal Association supported the bill but cautioned against making the provision mandatory.
- **Outcome**: The committee continued discussions without reaching a final decision.

### **Affordable Housing and Tiny Homes (HB 1068 and HB 1238)**
- **HB 1068 - Tiny Homes**: This bill seeks to legalize tiny homes, particularly those on wheels, and prevent municipalities from banning them. However, due to unresolved issues like zoning, taxation, and wastewater management, the committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill for Interim Study (ITL), effectively delaying further action.
- **HB 1238 - Affordable Housing**: This bill aims to reduce restrictive land use regulations to promote affordable housing, particularly multi-family units. Representative Vose introduced an amendment to clarify that municipalities cannot prohibit workforce housing in any zone. While stakeholders like the NH Home Builders Association supported the bill, concerns were raised about its impact on single-family zoning and its effectiveness in addressing the housing crisis.

### **Environmental and Health Regulations (HB 1119 and HB 1268)**
- **HB 1119 - Single-Use Plastics**: This bill proposes giving municipalities the authority to regulate the distribution of single-use plastic and paper bags. Supporters emphasized the environmental benefits, while opponents raised concerns about individual freedom and economic burdens. The discussion highlighted the tension between local control and state authority.
- **HB 1268 - Municipal Health Ordinances**: This bill seeks to limit municipal authority to regulate public health issues, particularly in response to local mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proponents argued for state-level control, while opponents stressed the need for local flexibility in addressing health crises.

### **Property Taxes and Tax Abatements (HB 1365 and HB 1289)**
- **HB 1365 - Two-Rate Property Tax System**: This bill proposes allowing towns to tax residential and commercial properties at different rates, aiming to shift the tax burden from homeowners to businesses. Supporters argued it would provide residential tax relief, while critics warned it could harm businesses and lead to economic decline.
- **HB 1289 - Property Tax Abatements for OHRV Impacts**: This bill seeks to provide tax abatements for homeowners affected by the use of public roads as off-highway recreational vehicle (OHRV) trails. Supporters highlighted the negative impacts of noise and pollution, while committee members raised questions about the practicality of the proposal.

### **School Budgets and Veterans' Tax Credits (HB 1667 and School Budget Caps)**
- **HB 1667 - Veterans' Tax Credits**: This bill aims to expand veterans' property tax credits to include currently serving National Guard members and reservists. Supporters emphasized the importance of recognizing all forms of military service, while concerns were raised about the fiscal impact on municipalities.
- **School Budget Caps**: A bill proposing the adoption of school district budget caps was introduced to address rising school budgets despite declining enrollments. Proponents argued for fiscal responsibility, while opponents highlighted the challenges of fixed costs and the need to maintain quality education.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Transparency and Local Control**: Several bills, such as HB 1026 and HB 1268, highlighted the tension between local control and state-level mandates, particularly in budgeting and public health regulations.
2. **Affordable Housing**: Bills like HB 1068 and HB 1238 addressed the need for affordable housing, but concerns about zoning, practicality, and economic impacts led to recommendations for further study or amendments.
3. **Environmental Concerns**: HB 1119 and discussions on septic systems (HB 1293) underscored the importance of balancing environmental protection with economic and practical considerations.
4. **Property Tax Relief**: Bills like HB 1365 and HB 1289 aimed to provide tax relief for homeowners but raised concerns about the impact on businesses and municipalities.
5. **Fiscal Responsibility in Education**: Proposals for school budget caps and discussions on SB2 reflected the ongoing challenge of balancing educational needs with taxpayers' affordability.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing municipal and county government issues, with a focus on transparency, affordability, environmental sustainability, and fiscal responsibility. The committee’s discussions underscored the need for careful consideration of the potential impacts of proposed legislation on communities, businesses, and the environment.
