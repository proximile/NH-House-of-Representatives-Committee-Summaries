**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (February 8, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 8, 2022, covered a wide range of legislative topics, including cosmetology licensing, consumer protection, public health, labor shortages, solid waste management, and prescription drug affordability. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

---

### **Cosmetology Licensing and Consumer Protection (HB 1171, HB 1560)**

1. **HB 1171: Cosmetology Education and Licensing**  
   - The bill proposed exemptions for certain "niche beauty services" (e.g., blow-dry styling, eyelash extensions, makeup application, and threading) from full cosmetology licensure.  
   - **Supporters** argued that these services are inherently low-risk and that requiring full licensure (1,500 hours of training) creates unnecessary barriers to entrepreneurship, particularly for low-income women. They cited successful models in other states where similar reforms led to job growth and economic opportunity.  
   - **Opponents**, including cosmetology schools and licensed professionals, raised concerns about public safety, emphasizing the importance of training in sanitation, infection control, and handling adverse reactions. They also warned that the bill could devalue the cosmetology profession and create unfair competition.  
   - The debate highlighted the tension between reducing regulatory burdens and maintaining public health and safety standards.

2. **HB 1560: Non-Resident Licensure**  
   - This bill aimed to streamline the process for out-of-state cosmetologists, barbers, and estheticians to work in New Hampshire by recognizing their existing licenses.  
   - Supporters argued that the bill would address labor shortages in the industry, boost the economy, and provide more opportunities for skilled professionals.  
   - The discussion focused on reducing bureaucratic barriers while ensuring that out-of-state professionals meet New Hampshire’s standards.

### **Public Health and Awareness (HB 1287, HB 1443)**

1. **HB 1287: Sleep Awareness Month**  
   - The bill proposed designating March as Sleep Awareness Month to highlight the health and safety impacts of sleep deprivation, particularly related to daylight saving time.  
   - The discussion included concerns about the effectiveness of proclamations and the potential for a more formal resolution to address time changes.

2. **HB 1443: COVID-19 Memorial Day**  
   - This bill sought to designate the first Monday in March as COVID-19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day to honor those who lost their lives to the pandemic and recognize the sacrifices of healthcare workers.  
   - The proposal was seen as a way to provide space for collective mourning and reflection.

### **Solid Waste Management (HB 1274)**

1. **HB 1274: Study Committee on State Agency Solid Waste Practices**  
   - The bill proposed creating a study committee to review how New Hampshire state agencies manage solid waste, particularly in light of the 2019 disruption in recycling markets when China stopped accepting U.S. recyclables.  
   - The committee would focus on improving waste reduction, recycling, and procurement of recycled products, as well as exploring cost savings for municipalities.  
   - Discussions emphasized the need for public awareness about recycling and the economic implications of solid waste management.

### **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB) (HB 1566)**

1. **Background and Purpose**  
   - The PDAB was established in 2020 to monitor and address prescription drug costs for public payers. It collects and analyzes drug pricing data, assesses fees from pharmaceutical supply chain entities, and operates a non-lapsing fund.  
   - Supporters, including organizations like **New Futures** and **AARP New Hampshire**, argued that the board is essential for increasing transparency and accountability in drug pricing, which they described as a public health crisis.  

2. **Concerns and Proposed Amendment**  
   - Critics raised issues about the board’s transparency, accountability, and potential overreach. Some meetings are exempt from public disclosure, and concerns were raised about the board’s necessity and process of creation.  
   - Representative Bleckis proposed abolishing the PDAB, citing these concerns.  
   - The committee ultimately voted to move **HB 1566** to **interim study**, acknowledging the complexity of the issues and the need for further examination.

### **Other Key Discussions**

1. **HB 1545: Film Production Directory**  
   - The bill aimed to create a state directory for film production but was tabled after discussions revealed that the necessary data is already being collected by the travel and tourism industry.

2. **HB 1173: Indigenous Peoples’ Day**  
   - The discussion centered on moving Indigenous Peoples’ Day from October to August 9th to align with the United Nations’ International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. Some representatives opposed the change, arguing that the October date is already widely recognized in New Hampshire.

3. **HB 1354: Real Estate Licensing**  
   - An amendment to the bill clarified licensing requirements for non-resident brokers and allowed real estate brokers to receive deferred compensation after becoming inactive. The amendment was adopted, and the bill was recommended to pass.

4. **HB 1535: Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA)**  
   - The committee discussed a one-time COLA for retirees, funded directly from the general fund. The amendment passed unanimously, with members emphasizing the importance of addressing retirees’ financial needs without increasing unfunded liabilities.
