**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Meeting (02/03/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a series of meetings and a public hearing on February 3, 2022, to discuss and vote on several bills related to election law. The discussions centered on issues such as ballot access, campaign finance, election integrity, and voter confidence. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all segments:

### **Bills Discussed and Voted On**

1. **HB 1197**: Proposed lowering the threshold for a political organization to be recognized as an official party from 4% to 1% of the vote in statewide elections. Supporters argued it would increase voter choice and align with New Hampshire's tradition of inclusivity. However, the Secretary of State's office opposed it, citing concerns about ballot layout and increased printing costs. The committee voted 11-9 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), effectively opposing its passage.

2. **HB 1423**: Aimed to establish public funding for political campaigns. Critics argued it did not effectively address campaign finance issues and could lead to excessive government involvement in elections. The committee voted 11-9 to recommend ITL.

3. **HB 1482**: Proposed ranked-choice voting for federal and state offices. Supporters claimed it could improve election outcomes, while opponents raised concerns about complexity and voter understanding. The committee voted 12-7 to recommend ITL.

4. **HB 1484**: Called for a forensic audit of the 2020 elections, funded by private donations. Opponents argued it was unnecessary, lacked specificity, and would not restore voter confidence. The committee unanimously voted 19-0 to recommend ITL.

5. **HB 1496**: Sought to expand access to voter checklists. The committee postponed the vote to allow time for an amendment to be finalized.

6. **CACR15**: Proposed lowering the voting age in primaries to 17 for those who would turn 18 by the general election. An amendment clarifying residency requirements was introduced but deemed non-germane, requiring a separate hearing. The amendment passed 10-9, and the bill was amended for further discussion.

7. **CACR19**: A constitutional amendment requiring paper ballots for all elections to enhance voter confidence and ensure election integrity. The bill passed 11-9 and advanced to the next stage.

8. **HB1009**: Required the inclusion of voter registration dates in voter information. The bill passed 11-9 and will be reported accordingly.

9. **HB1010**: Aimed to include municipal voter history in statewide voter history reports. An amendment corrected a section of the law, and the bill passed unanimously (20-0) as amended.

10. **HB1149**: Proposed reducing the number of signatures required for nomination papers by two-thirds to make it easier for independent and third-party candidates to access the ballot. The bill's sponsor argued that current requirements disadvantage rural candidates, while the Secretary of State's office opposed it, citing potential ballot clutter.

11. **HB1157**: Prohibited electronic ballot-counting devices from being connected to the internet to prevent hacking. The bill passed unanimously (20-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

12. **HB1166**: Required voters to declare party affiliation 120 days before a primary election and mandated that candidates be party members for a certain period before running. The sponsor cited concerns about voter deception, but the New Hampshire City and Town Clerks Association opposed it, citing potential voter disenfranchisement.

13. **HB1174**: Clarified the placement of poll challengers during elections, allowing them to stand within six feet of ballot-counting areas to ensure transparency. Supporters argued it would increase trust in elections, while opponents raised concerns about potential interference.

14. **HB1442**: Proposed printing election materials in multiple languages. An amendment set a threshold of 3% for language inclusion and limited it to three languages. The amendment passed 19-1, but the bill was ultimately deemed ITL with a vote of 9-11.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Voter Confidence and Election Integrity**: Many discussions emphasized the importance of restoring voter confidence in elections, with bills like CACR19 (paper ballots) and HB1157 (internet security for ballot-counting devices) passing to address these concerns.
- **Ballot Access and Fairness**: Bills like HB1149 and HB1197 focused on improving ballot access for independent and third-party candidates, though both faced opposition and were recommended as ITL.
- **Forward-Looking Solutions**: Committee members generally favored forward-looking solutions over revisiting past elections, as evidenced by the unanimous rejection of HB1484 (forensic audit of the 2020 elections).
- **Public Funding and Campaign Finance**: HB1423, which proposed public funding for campaigns, was opposed due to concerns about government overreach and inefficacy.
- **Ranked-Choice Voting**: HB1482, which proposed ranked-choice voting, was rejected due to concerns about voter understanding and complexity.

### **Next Steps**
- The last executive session before the crossover deadline was scheduled for March 9th or 10th, with bills being addressed after town elections.
- Public hearings and executive sessions were planned for the week of February 16th or 17th, with reports due by the close of business on Monday.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the committee's focus on balancing election integrity, voter confidence, and fair ballot access while addressing concerns about complexity, cost, and government involvement in elections.
