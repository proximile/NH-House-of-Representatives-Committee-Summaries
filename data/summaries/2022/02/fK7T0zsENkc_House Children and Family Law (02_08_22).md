**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on February 8, 2022: House Children and Family Law**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 8, 2022, focused on several key bills and issues related to family law, parental rights, and education. The discussions highlighted the complexities of child support calculations, the proposed Parental Bill of Rights, alimony modifications, foster parent reimbursement, and concerns over school policies. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

### **1. Child Support Calculations (HB 1647):**
   - **Representative Yokela** introduced an amendment to clarify child support calculations, emphasizing proportional financial responsibility based on income and parenting time. The amendment also addressed the self-support reserve to prevent homelessness due to child support obligations.
   - **Vivian Gerard** opposed the current system, sharing her struggles as a stay-at-home mom and business owner, arguing it unfairly impacts families and increases reliance on taxpayers.
   - **Michael Dinan** supported HB 1647, which simplifies child support calculations, advocating for clear, fair guidelines to avoid adversarial relationships and ensure both parents can support their children.
   - **Brenda Towne** explained that the bill aligns with a $500,000 study by the Casey Carsey Institute, which found New Hampshire has some of the highest child support orders in the country. The bill proposes raising the overall child support order by 150% to account for the costs of maintaining two households.

### **2. Parental Bill of Rights (HB 1431):**
   - **Representative Paul Terry** introduced HB 1431, modeled after Florida’s law, to enumerate parental rights regarding their children’s education and healthcare. The bill aims to preempt conflicts between parents and state institutions, particularly in areas like curriculum transparency and medical decisions.
   - **Key Concerns and Discussions:**
     - **Immunization Exemptions:** Questions arose about whether parents could exempt their children from immunizations beyond current medical and religious exemptions.
     - **Parental Consent for Medical Procedures:** Concerns were raised about the bill potentially restricting public health information or medical care for minors without parental consent.
     - **Gifted Programs:** Clarifications were sought on whether schools would be required to fund or provide transportation for children to attend gifted programs in other districts.
     - **End-of-Life Decisions:** The bill explicitly excludes parental decisions that would “end life,” leading to questions about its implications for abortion or other sensitive issues.
   - **Support and Opposition:** Supporters argued the bill is necessary to counteract the erosion of parental rights, while opponents, including social workers’ associations, contended that existing laws already protect parental rights and that the bill could undermine children’s autonomy.

### **3. Alimony and Cohabitation (HB 1278):**
   - **Representative Terry Roy** introduced HB 1278, which modifies alimony laws to prevent the automatic termination of alimony if the recipient enters a new relationship or cohabitates unless the new relationship provides substantial financial benefit.
   - The bill was inspired by a constituent’s story: a 54-year-old stay-at-home mom with health issues lost her sole means of support (alimony) when her ex-husband remarried, while she could not start a new relationship without losing her alimony.
   - **Richard Head** from the Judicial Branch noted the bill could increase litigation and workload for courts due to the need to interpret terms like "new romantic relationship."

### **4. Foster Parent Reimbursement (HB 1623):**
   - **Representative Bill Boyd** introduced HB 1623, proposing a 1.3% cost-of-living adjustment for foster parent reimbursement rates to help cover rising expenses.
   - He emphasized the importance of foster families in providing stability for children and highlighted that reimbursement rates were last updated in 2018.

### **5. Parental Rights and School Policies:**
   - **Parental Authority:** Parents emphasized their fundamental right to direct and protect their children’s upbringing, education, and medical care. They expressed frustration over schools and other entities undermining parental authority, such as withholding information about curriculum or encouraging children to conceal activities from parents.
   - **Concerns About Schools:** Several representatives and parents raised concerns about schools promoting ideologies or materials that parents find objectionable, such as gender identity discussions or social-emotional learning surveys. They also highlighted instances where schools allegedly encouraged children to act without parental knowledge or consent.
   - **Transparency and Communication:** Parents testified about the lack of transparency in schools, including difficulties accessing curriculum information or addressing concerns with school boards. They argued that the bill would restore their ability to make informed decisions about their children’s education and health.
   - **Examples of Overreach:** Specific examples were given, such as schools allegedly allowing children to identify as animals, providing litter boxes in bathrooms, or encouraging gender transitions without parental consent. Parents also criticized policies that they believe promote division between children and their families.

### **6. Legislative Motions and Committee Procedures:**
   - Multiple bills were discussed, with motions to "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate) being made for several of them. These included bills related to family court proceedings, the right of children to testify in court, and the prohibition of reunification therapy.
   - The committee voted unanimously (14-0) to ITL several bills, including HB 1436, HB 1142, HB 1551, and HB 1568, among others. These decisions were made with little to no discussion, indicating a consensus among committee members.

### **Overall Themes and Conclusions:**
   - **Fairness in Support Orders:** Both HB 1278 and HB 1647 aim to ensure that support orders are fair, particularly in cases of shared parenting or new relationships.
   - **Impact on Courts:** The bills could increase judicial workloads due to the need for additional findings and interpretations.
   - **Cost of Living Adjustments:** HB 1623 seeks to address rising costs for foster parents, ensuring they are adequately supported.
   - **Parental Rights and School Policies:** The discussions underscored a growing sentiment among some parents that their rights are being eroded and that legislative action is needed to reaffirm their role as the primary decision-makers for their children.

The meeting concluded with representatives seeking further clarifications and expressing concerns about the practical implementation of these bills, highlighting the need for careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences.
