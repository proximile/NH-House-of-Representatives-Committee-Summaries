**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (February 22, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on February 22, 2022, to address a range of healthcare and social policy issues. The meeting included discussions on patient rights, gender identity, healthcare financing, immunization registries, and liability protections for healthcare providers during emergencies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **1. Patient Rights and Gender Identity Legislation**
- **Patient Rights Bill**: The committee debated revisions to the **Patient's Bill of Rights (RSA 151:21)**, focusing on healthcare settings for minors and adults. Key discussions included:
  - Expanding parental access to minors in long-term care facilities.
  - Adjusting language on **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** to allow facilities or visitors to provide PPE.
  - Shifting responsibility for informational materials from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to individual facilities.
  - Debating the removal of CDC guidelines from liability clauses.
  - The committee proposed moving sections 1 through 3 into the Patient's Bill of Rights while retaining other sections for further debate.

- **Gender Identity Bill (HB 1180)**: This bill sparked intense debate over the state’s ability to differentiate between **biological sex and gender identity** in contexts such as **athletics, incarceration, and public facilities**.
  - **Athletics**: Supporters argued that biological males have inherent physical advantages, making it unfair for transgender women to compete in women’s sports. Opponents countered that there is no evidence of transgender athletes dominating competitions and emphasized inclusivity.
  - **Incarceration**: Concerns were raised about the safety of transgender inmates, with suggestions for separate housing options. Opponents highlighted the high rates of sexual assault faced by transgender individuals in prisons.
  - **Public Facilities**: The bill proposed separate facilities based on biological sex, raising concerns about privacy and discrimination.
  - **Mental Health**: Opponents stressed the high rates of depression and suicide among transgender individuals, arguing that the bill exacerbates stigma. Supporters claimed it protects fairness and safety.
  - **Legal Concerns**: Opponents, including the ACLU, argued the bill violates **Title IX** and the **14th Amendment**, citing the **Bostock v. Clayton County** Supreme Court decision.

### **2. Healthcare Financing and Access**
- **Critical Access Hospitals**: The committee discussed the financial struggles of critical access hospitals, which operate on low profit margins (around 1%). Concerns were raised about **Medicaid reimbursement** not covering the cost of care, particularly for maternity services.
- **Membership-Based Healthcare Facilities**: A bill proposing membership-based healthcare facilities was debated. Opponents argued it could create a bifurcated system, excluding those unable to pay membership fees, while supporters emphasized innovation and competition.
- **Federal Control**: Some representatives criticized federal control over **Medicare** and **Medicaid**, arguing it hinders state sovereignty and tailored healthcare solutions.

### **3. Immunization Registry**
- **HB 1487**: This bill proposed allowing individuals to withdraw from the state’s immunization registry without a healthcare provider’s signature. Opponents argued it could lead to uninformed decisions, fraudulent withdrawals, and liability issues. Supporters emphasized privacy rights and reducing burdens on individuals.
- **HB 1488**: This bill aimed to expand non-discrimination protections for individuals who choose not to participate in the registry. Concerns were raised about potential discrimination by private entities, such as daycare centers.
- **HB 1606**: A bill proposing an opt-in system for the registry was postponed for further review.

### **4. Liability Protections During Emergencies (HB 1271)**
- **Non-Germane Amendment 0729**: Introduced by Representative Erica Leon, this amendment sought to repeal **RSA 21-P:42a**, which provides limited liability protection to healthcare providers during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.
  - **Support for Repeal**: Leon argued the statute undermines state autonomy by deferring to federal authorities.
  - **Opposition to Repeal**: Healthcare providers and the New Hampshire Hospital Association opposed the repeal, emphasizing the need for liability protections during emergencies. They highlighted actions taken during the pandemic, such as setting up alternative care sites and expanding telehealth, which were enabled by these protections.
  - **Legal Concerns**: The committee debated the potential for retroactive lawsuits and the interplay between state and federal liability protections, such as the **PREP Act**.

### **5. Other Key Discussions**
- **HB 1369**: This bill addressed health and safety policies at performing arts venues, allowing venues to establish their own policies (e.g., mask mandates, vaccination requirements) while ensuring patrons are informed and can receive refunds. The bill passed with an 11-9 vote.
- **HB 1616**: A bill proposing a commission to study the use of hypodermic needles and epinephrine auto-injectors was voted “inexpedient to legislate” (ITL).
