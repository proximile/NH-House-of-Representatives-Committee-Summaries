The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 7, 2022, convened by the House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee, addressed several critical bills and amendments related to public health, vaccination mandates, and healthcare worker regulations. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Healthcare Worker Background Checks (HB 1659)**
The committee passed an amendment to streamline background checks for healthcare workers, allowing facilities to use authorized vendors instead of relying solely on the state police. This change aims to reduce hiring delays while ensuring safety through direct supervision during a 90-day temporary employment period. The amendment passed overwhelmingly with a 19-1 vote.

### **Ethics Advisory Committee**
There was significant debate about the composition and role of the Ethics Advisory Committee, particularly its ability to provide ethical oversight during public health emergencies. Concerns were raised about the committee’s limited activity and whether its members are adequately trained in ethics. Discussions emphasized the need for ethical considerations in public health decisions, especially regarding emergency orders.

### **Vaccination Mandates for Schools and Universities**
Several bills addressed vaccination mandates for COVID-19:
- **HB 1633**: Proposed mandating COVID-19 vaccination for school attendance, including post-secondary education. Supporters argued it would keep schools open and safe, while opponents raised concerns about vaccine safety, parental rights, and the lack of long-term data.
- **University Attendance**: Another bill sought to mandate COVID-19 vaccination for university attendance, citing high infection rates in university towns. Private institutions like Dartmouth already require vaccinations.
- **Natural Immunity**: Concerns were raised about whether natural immunity should exempt individuals from vaccination mandates, given that immunity from infection wanes over time.

### **Performing Arts Venues (HB 1369 and HB 1639)**
Bills focused on COVID-19 safety protocols for performing arts venues:
- **HB 1369**: Allows venues to set their own COVID-19 policies (e.g., masking, testing, vaccination requirements) without mandates. Venue operators supported the bill, emphasizing the need for flexibility to ensure safety and financial survival. An amendment removed liability protection for venues enforcing these policies.
- **HB 1639**: Addressed vaccine and testing requirements for entry into entertainment venues. Discussions centered on refund policies if requirements change after ticket purchase and whether natural immunity should be considered equivalent to vaccination.

### **Child Care Study Committee (HB 1384)**
The committee discussed creating a study committee to address child care needs and funding. Concerns were raised about the practicality of forming another committee, and an alternative approach involving an ad hoc group was proposed.

### **Vaccine Exemptions (HB 1035)**
HB 1035 aimed to expand vaccine exemptions to include conscientious objectors, remove notarization requirements, and eliminate the need for parents to disclose specific medical or religious reasons. Supporters argued for parental rights and vaccine safety concerns, while opponents warned that expanding exemptions could lower vaccination rates, jeopardize herd immunity, and lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.

### **General Themes**
1. **Public Health vs. Individual Rights**: Many debates centered on balancing public health mandates with individual freedoms, particularly regarding vaccination requirements and exemptions.
2. **Ethical Oversight**: The need for ethical considerations in public health decisions, especially during emergencies, was a recurring theme.
3. **Economic and Mental Health Impact**: The economic challenges faced by businesses, particularly in the performing arts, and the mental health benefits of maintaining open schools and cultural venues were emphasized.
4. **Vaccine Safety and Efficacy**: Discussions included concerns about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for children, and the role of natural immunity.
5. **Legislative Role and Oversight**: Questions were raised about the extent of legislative involvement in public health decisions and the need for clear, enforceable policies.

### **Key Testimonies**
- **Support for Vaccination Mandates**: Medical professionals and organizations highlighted the importance of vaccines in preventing disease outbreaks and protecting vulnerable populations.
- **Opposition to Mandates**: Parents, advocates, and some healthcare professionals shared personal stories of vaccine-related injuries and argued against government overreach in medical decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing public health concerns while respecting individual rights and economic realities. The committee worked through numerous amendments and procedural issues, with a focus on finding balanced solutions that support both public health and personal freedoms. The debates reflected deep divisions on issues like vaccine mandates, exemptions, and the role of ethical oversight in public health decision-making.
