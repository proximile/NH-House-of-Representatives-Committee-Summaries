The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on February 10, 2022, covered a wide range of topics, focusing on consumer protection, public health, and regulatory challenges. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

---

### **1. Consumer Privacy and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) – HB 1413**
The committee debated **House Bill 1413**, which aims to restrict ISPs from collecting, using, or selling consumer data without explicit consent. Modeled after a similar law in Maine, the bill seeks to protect consumer privacy in an era of increasing data collection. Key points included:
- **Provisions**: The bill requires ISPs to obtain opt-in consent for data usage, prohibits service denial for non-consent, and imposes a $1,000 fine for violations, enforced by the Attorney General’s Office.
- **Support**: Advocates argued that the bill is necessary to safeguard consumer privacy, as ISPs can track metadata, device identifiers, and IP addresses, even with encrypted traffic.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the Attorney General’s Office, Technet, and the New England Cable and Telecommunications Association, raised concerns about enforceability, the bill’s narrow focus on ISPs, and potential conflicts with federal privacy laws. They also highlighted legal challenges to Maine’s similar law and urged New Hampshire to await the outcome of that case.
- **Outcome**: The bill faced significant opposition, with no immediate action taken.

### **2. PFAS Labeling – HB 1422**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1422**, which would require labeling of products containing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals linked to health risks such as cancer and reproductive harm. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to inform consumers about PFAS presence in products like non-stick cookware and waterproof coatings, empowering them to reduce exposure.
- **Support**: Advocates, including Representative Wendy Chase, shared personal stories of PFAS-related health impacts and emphasized the need for awareness and consumer protection.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including the Business and Industry Association, argued that the bill would be burdensome for businesses and difficult to enforce. They suggested federal regulation or voluntary labeling systems as alternatives.
- **Outcome**: The committee leaned toward an interim study to further evaluate the issue.

### **3. Short-Term Health Insurance Policies**
The committee examined the impact of short-term health insurance policies, which often lack coverage for essential services like prescription drugs, mental health, and maternity care. Key points included:
- **Concerns**: These policies, primarily purchased by younger, healthier individuals, could destabilize the broader insurance market by drawing healthier participants away from regulated plans.
- **Outcome**: The committee considered an interim study to better understand the implications of short-term policies on the market and consumer protections.

### **4. Chiropractic Care Coverage**
The committee debated a bill to reduce co-pays for chiropractic care by reclassifying chiropractors from “specialists” to “primary care providers.” Key points included:
- **Support**: Proponents argued that lower co-pays would make chiropractic care more accessible, potentially reducing opioid use and costly surgeries.
- **Opposition**: Critics expressed concerns about increased insurance premiums and the potential for other specialists to request similar co-pay reductions.
- **Outcome**: The committee considered interim studying the bill or working with the sponsor to address concerns.

### **5. PANDAS Coverage**
The committee discussed a bill to remove a sunset clause ending insurance coverage for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS). Key points included:
- **Support**: Advocates emphasized the need for continued coverage for expensive treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
- **Concerns**: Opponents questioned the lack of a specific diagnostic code and the financial impact on insurers.
- **Outcome**: The committee debated extending the sunset clause to allow more time for research and data collection.

### **6. Towing Regulations – HB 1404**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 1404**, which aimed to address towing complaints, particularly the retrieval of personal items from towed vehicles. Key points included:
- **Sponsor’s Request**: The prime sponsor requested the committee to kill the bill, citing existing legislation that addressed towing regulations.
- **Opposition**: Representatives from the towing industry argued that the bill would impose unaffordable costs and disrupt property management and snow removal services.
- **Outcome**: The committee indicated the bill would likely be killed.

---

### **7. Ivermectin and Emergency-Use Medications**
The committee discussed the use of ivermectin, a drug not FDA-approved for COVID-19 treatment, and its exclusion from emergency use authorization coverage. Key points included:
- **Controversy**: The debate highlighted the drug’s safety profile and the broader issue of off-label drug use.
- **Outcome**: The committee noted that ivermectin would not be covered under emergency use authorization.

---

### **8. Insurance Premiums and Policy Impact**
The committee evaluated whether certain policies or treatments were affecting insurance premiums. Key points included:
- **Findings**: No significant spikes in premiums were reported, suggesting the policies in question had minimal direct impact.
- **Sunset Clause**: A repeal of one policy would not take effect until July 1, 2024, providing time for further evaluation.
- **Outcome**: The committee concluded there was no immediate urgency to act.

---

### **General Observations**
- The committee emphasized the complexity of addressing public health and consumer protection issues at the state level, particularly when balancing consumer rights with economic and logistical challenges.
- Interim studies were frequently proposed to gather more data before making final decisions.
- Industry stakeholders played a significant role in shaping the discussions, highlighting concerns about enforceability, costs, and unintended consequences.
