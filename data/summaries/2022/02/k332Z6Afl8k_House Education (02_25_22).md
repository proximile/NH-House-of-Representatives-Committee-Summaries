### **Mask Mandates in Schools (House Bill 1131 and Related Discussions)**

3. **Effectiveness and Safety of Masks**:  
   - Many speakers questioned the scientific basis for mask mandates, citing a lack of randomized controlled trials proving their efficacy and safety for children.  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential harm of masks, including bacterial contamination, reduced oxygen intake, and increased CO2 levels.

   - Testimonies emphasized that mask mandates infringe on parental rights, with calls for decisions about masking to be left to parents rather than school boards or state mandates.

5. **Legal and Ethical Issues**:  
   - Some speakers referenced **RSA 358**, New Hampshire’s consumer protection law, arguing that mandating ineffective masks is unethical and potentially illegal.

### **Special Education Reforms (House Bill 1141 and Related Discussions)**

1. **Overview of House Bill 1141**:  
   - The bill, introduced by **Representative Cordelli**, aims to amend New Hampshire’s special education laws to better align with federal regulations under the **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)**.

3. **Concerns and Recommendations**:  
   - **Bonnie Dunham**, a parent of a child with disabilities, emphasized the importance of maintaining strong protections for parents and children, noting that the proposed amendments could reduce parental involvement and lower protections to the bare minimum required by federal law.  
   - There was confusion over the use of “parent” versus “parents” in the legislation, particularly in cases where divorced or separated parents may have conflicting views on their child’s education.  
   - Representatives called for a side-by-side comparison of the amendment, current state law, and federal law to understand where the amendment aligns, diverges, or potentially reduces protections.
