The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 10, 2022, to address a range of legislative and policy issues. The meeting focused on workforce development, tax policy, marijuana legislation, and various bills with fiscal and constitutional implications. Here’s a detailed overview of the key discussions and decisions:

### **1. Workforce Development and Retention**
The committee discussed strategies to retain young workers in New Hampshire, a growing concern for the state. A report proposed matching small amounts of money for educational grants to make the state more attractive to young people.

The committee emphasized the importance of refining the proposal and ensuring it aligns with broader workforce development goals.

### **3. Marijuana Legislation**
The committee anticipated receiving a bill related to state-operated marijuana businesses, modeled after the state’s liquor commission.

Challenges discussed included financial implications and federal banking restrictions on marijuana-related funds. The committee planned to hold additional work sessions to address these complexities.

- **House Bill 1430**: Aimed to phase out the motor vehicle rental tax but was voted “Inexpedient to Legislate” (ITL) due to concerns about revenue loss and the state’s bond rating.
- **House Bill 1478**: Proposed a surtax on businesses with employees earning $15 or less but was deemed unconstitutional and voted ITL.
- **House Bill 1494**: Sought to exempt certain communication services leases from property taxes but was voted ITL due to concerns about constitutionality and potential tax increases on other entities.
- **House Bill 1509**: Proposed terminating the FRM Victims Contribution Recovery Fund but was voted ITL to avoid a “bait and switch” scenario after the fund had already been appropriated.
- **House Bill 1524**: Aimed to establish a fund for national service alumni attraction and retention but was held for further drafting and clarity.

### **5. Other Key Discussions**
- **House Bill 1063**: A technical corrections bill related to the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA), held for further comparison with Senate Bill 435.
