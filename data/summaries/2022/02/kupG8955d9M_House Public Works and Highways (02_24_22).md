The New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee held an executive session on February 24, 2022, to discuss and vote on several bills. The meeting began with a brief recess due to the vice chair being delayed in traffic. Upon resuming, the committee focused on:

1. **House Bill 2022**: The committee discussed and adopted **Amendment 0745H**, which addressed the removal of toll plazas in Merrimack and the associated costs. Representative Mills explained that the amendment reflected changes from a previous straw vote, excluding the toll plaza location, which is typically addressed in the budget. The committee voted **21-2** to recommend the bill as amended to the full House.

2. **House Bill 1432**: Representative McConkey moved to reconsider the committee's previous action on this bill, which prohibits the use of state funds for passenger rail projects. The motion to reconsider failed **11-12**, so the bill will proceed to the House with no recommendation from the committee.

3. **House Bill 1032**: The committee unanimously voted **23-0** to recommend **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)** on this bill, which dealt with the sale of the Laconia State Property. The committee noted that the governing council had already issued an RFP for the sale, and the mayor of Laconia supported the process.

4. **House Bill 1548**: The committee adopted **House Amendment 0756H**, which requires a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Lakes Region Facility to be used for relocating the facility. The bill was unanimously voted **23-0** to pass as amended and placed on the consent calendar.

The committee concluded its work for the session, with the chairman thanking members for their hard work and the Department of Transportation for their input on the 10-year plan. The committee will not meet again until after the crossover period, with potential public hearings on Senate bills scheduled for a single day to minimize travel for participants. The chairman expressed hope that bills on the consent calendar would be addressed during the next House session on March 10th. The meeting was adjourned.
