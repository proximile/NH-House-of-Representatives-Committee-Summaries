**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (02/02/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 2, 2022, centered on concerns about election integrity and proposed legislative actions to address these issues. The meeting featured extensive discussions on alleged irregularities in the 2020 election, calls for forensic audits, and proposals for election law reforms. Key themes and highlights from the meeting are summarized below:

### **1. Concerns About Election Integrity**
Multiple speakers, including representatives and citizens, expressed deep concerns about the accuracy, transparency, and security of New Hampshire’s election process. Specific issues raised included:
- **Voter Fraud Allegations**: Instances of voters registered at incorrect or non-existent addresses, and individuals who moved out of state allegedly voting in New Hampshire.
- **Absentee Ballot Issues**: Reports of missing ballots, unsolicited absentee ballot requests, and discrepancies in absentee ballot handling.
- **Voting Machine Vulnerabilities**: Concerns about outdated voting machines, particularly those from LHS Associates, and potential hacking risks. Memory card erasures and connectivity to routers were also highlighted.
- **Voter Checklist Discrepancies**: Problems with voter checklists, including over 120% voter registration in Rye and other anomalies in towns like Merrimack and Nashua.

### **2. Calls for Forensic Audits**
A recurring demand throughout the meeting was for comprehensive forensic audits of the 2020 election to address these concerns and restore public trust. Key points included:
- **HB 1473 and HB 1484**: These bills proposed forensic audits of the 2020 election results, with HB 1484 emphasizing a privately funded audit to avoid taxpayer costs. The audits would be conducted by impartial third parties to identify vulnerabilities and improve election practices.
- **Windham Audit Findings**: The audit in Windham revealed significant flaws, including uncalibrated machines and shortcuts by election officials, leading to inaccurate vote counts. This case was cited as evidence of the need for broader audits.
- **Grassroots Audit Efforts**: Citizen activists, such as Brenda Towne, highlighted their own audit findings, including data anomalies like unusual absentee ballot increases and discrepancies in voter turnout. These findings were submitted to the Attorney General for investigation.

### **3. Legislative Action and Proposed Bills**
Several bills were discussed to address election integrity and improve transparency:
- **HB 1473**: Focused on forensic audits and stricter verification processes for voter checklists and absentee ballots.
- **HB 1467**: Proposed expanding the scope of state-level recounts to include additional races, providing more data points for future elections.
- **HB 1008**: Aimed to establish a commission to study municipal government structures and election turnout, with the goal of improving local election participation.
- **HB 1082**: Sought to prohibit political action committees (PACs) for the offices of Secretary of State and Treasurer to preserve their nonpartisan nature.
- **HB 1242**: Proposed adjusting the timeline for charter amendment processes to align with federal requirements for absentee ballot distribution.

### **4. Public Testimonies and Personal Experiences**
Numerous citizens shared personal stories and concerns, including:
- **Access to Information**: Some speakers, like Sandra Panik, recounted difficulties in obtaining election data through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, revealing that many towns no longer had memory cards from the 2020 election.
- **Voter Registration Errors**: Individuals described challenges in correcting party affiliation errors and other discrepancies in voter records.
- **Statistical Anomalies**: Data analysis presented by activists and representatives, such as Representative Hamola, showed statistical anomalies in certain towns and counties, prompting calls for further investigation.

### **5. Criticism of Current Practices**
Criticism was directed at election officials, including the Secretary of State’s office, for a perceived lack of transparency and responsiveness to voter concerns. The use of voting machines, particularly Dominion and LHS Associates systems, was questioned due to their age and potential vulnerabilities.

### **6. Proposed Solutions**
Speakers suggested various solutions to address election integrity concerns:
- **Hand Counting**: Some advocated for eliminating voting machines altogether and returning to hand-counting ballots, citing practices in countries like Canada and the UK as examples.
- **Bipartisan Efforts**: Several speakers, including Representative Hamola, emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation to restore voter confidence and ensure fair elections.
- **Improved Transparency**: The proposed bills aimed to enhance transparency by preserving election data for the required 22 months and mandating detailed audits.

### **7. Secretary of State’s Perspective**
David Scanlon, representing the Secretary of State’s office, defended New Hampshire’s election process, stating that while individual errors occur, there is no evidence of widespread fraud or conspiracy. He argued that conducting a statewide audit during the 2022 election cycle would be logistically challenging and unnecessary.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored widespread concerns about election integrity in New Hampshire, with strong demands for forensic audits, legislative reforms, and greater transparency. The discussions reflected broader national tensions over election security and the need to restore public trust in democratic processes. The proposed bills and testimonies highlighted the urgency of addressing these issues to ensure accurate, transparent, and secure elections in the future.
