The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 23, 2022, focused extensively on education-related bills, with particular attention to the **Education Freedom Account (EFA)** program, cooperative school districts, student transfers, and support for students with disabilities. The discussions highlighted tensions between accountability, transparency, and parental choice, as well as logistical challenges and procedural considerations. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

### **Cooperative School Districts**
- The committee reviewed four bills related to cooperative school districts. Three were interim studied, while one bill, which aimed to allow voters in specific districts within a cooperative to elect their own representatives rather than voting across the entire cooperative, was held back due to concerns. After clarifying that the bill would not alter the number of representatives but ensure voters elect representatives from their own district, the committee moved forward with it.

### **Student Transfers**
- **HB 1373** addressed a parent’s request to transfer their child from a Massachusetts school to a New Hampshire school based on the "best interest of the student." The committee debated whether the bill was necessary, as existing statutes already provide a process for manifest educational hardship transfers. The committee decided to gather more information before voting.

### **Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**
The EFA program, which provides state funds for students to attend private schools or homeschool, was a central focus of the meeting. Key discussions included:

1. **Transparency and Accountability**:
   - **HB 1114** proposed requiring the scholarship organization managing the EFA program to compile a directory of education service providers, including accreditation, performance data, and discipline policies. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), arguing that the scholarship organization is already working on providing this information.
   - **HB 1355** passed with a vote of 10-9, requiring scholarship organizations to report suspected misuse of EFA funds to the Attorney General.

2. **Eligibility and Aid**:
   - Discussions centered on how eligibility for free and reduced-price lunch, differentiated aid, and special education services is determined for EFA students, particularly homeschoolers and those without Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Concerns were raised about verification processes using federal tax returns.

3. **Taxability of EFA Payments**:
   - **HB 1283**, which aimed to clarify the tax liability of EFA payments, was tabled (ITL) with a vote of 10-9, as representatives debated whether the bill could mislead families about tax obligations.

4. **Parental Rights and IDEA Protections**:
   - An amendment (**0439H**) was proposed to clarify that parents must be informed of their rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) when enrolling in the EFA program. The committee debated whether participation in the EFA program constitutes parental placement under IDEA and whether parents waive their rights to special education services.

5. **Fraud and Misuse of Funds**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of safeguarding against fraud and misuse of EFA funds, with **HB 1355** passing to ensure scholarship organizations report suspected misuse to the Attorney General.

6. **Program Administration and Oversight**:
   - **HB 1669**, which sought to transfer the administration of the EFA program from scholarship organizations to the Department of Education (DOE), passed with a vote of 10-9, despite concerns about the DOE’s capacity.
   - **HB 1683**, proposing the repeal of the EFA program, was indefinitely postponed (ITL) with a vote of 10-9, following extensive debate about the program’s success, cost, and accountability.

### **Support for Students with Disabilities**
- **HB 1594**, requiring schools to assist students with disabilities (on IEP or 504 plans) in transitioning to adulthood, including voter registration, passed unanimously with an amendment that strengthened the bill.

### **Logistical Challenges**
- Due to an impending snowstorm, the committee decided to proceed with scheduled hearings on February 25 rather than rescheduling, emphasizing the importance of meeting the March 9 deadline for bill submissions.

### **Key Votes and Outcomes**
- Several bills related to the EFA program passed with close votes, reflecting the committee’s divided opinions on accountability, transparency, and parental choice. These included **HB 1637** (requiring a survey for parents electing EFAs), **HB 1649** (unique pupil identification for EFA participants), and **HB 1672** (misuse of EFA funds).

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing parental choice with accountability and transparency in education funding. Representatives grappled with ensuring the responsible use of taxpayer funds, protecting students’ rights, and maintaining flexibility for families while addressing logistical and procedural challenges. The discussions highlighted ongoing debates about the role of scholarship organizations, the DOE’s capacity, and the effectiveness of the EFA program in meeting the needs of New Hampshire students.
