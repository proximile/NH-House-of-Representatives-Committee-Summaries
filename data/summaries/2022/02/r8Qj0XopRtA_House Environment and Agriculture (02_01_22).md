**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/01/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 1, 2022, to discuss and deliberate on several bills and issues related to environmental protection, agriculture, and animal welfare. The meeting was divided into three key segments, each addressing distinct legislative topics. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Environmental and Agricultural Legislation Overview**

1. **Groundwater and Geological Concerns**  
   Representatives examined the impact of geological changes on groundwater paths and their implications for permits and regulations. The need for laws to adapt to natural shifts in water flow over time was emphasized, alongside calls for clearer definitions in legislation, particularly regarding terms like "shallow and deep groundwater."

2. **State Fairs and Agricultural Funding (HB 1584)**  
   A significant portion of the meeting focused on House Bill 1584, which proposes a capital improvement grant program for state fairs and agricultural events. Key points included:
   - **Funding Allocation**: The bill proposes $250,000 annually from the general fund, sparking debate over competing priorities such as value-added production grants for farmers or CBD product regulation.
   - **Economic Impact**: Representatives highlighted the economic benefits of fairs, which support local businesses, promote agriculture, and preserve New Hampshire’s agricultural heritage, including youth programs like 4-H.
   - **Infrastructure Needs**: The deteriorating condition of fairground buildings, including roofs, foundations, and compliance with new regulations (e.g., septic systems and electrical upgrades), was noted as a pressing issue.
   - **Funding Alternatives**: Discussions explored alternative funding sources, such as fees or ARPA funds, to avoid drawing from the general fund, with some suggesting the capital budget as a more appropriate avenue.
   - **Grant Allocation Process**: The commissioner of agriculture outlined a potential process for evaluating and awarding grants, including site visits to assess facility conditions.
   The bill passed with a 14-3 vote, with further funding details to be addressed in the Ways and Means Committee.

3. **Soil Contamination and Remediation (HB 1547)**  
   The committee discussed HB 1547, which addresses perfluorochemicals (PFAS) in soil. An amendment introduced by Representative Maureen Mooney was well-received, allowing the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to set soil remediation standards by November 2023. The amended bill passed unanimously.

4. **Recycling and Waste Management (HB 1652)**  
   HB 1652, which relates to recycling beverage containers, was discussed. While the concept of a bottle redemption plan was supported, the bill was sent to interim study for further examination.

### **Animal Welfare Legislation**

1. **Declawing Cats (HB 1226)**  
   HB 1226, which prohibits the declawing of cats, sparked extensive debate. While many agreed declawing is undesirable, concerns were raised about criminalizing veterinarians and the lack of a significant issue in New Hampshire. The bill was indefinitely postponed (ITL) with a 16-1 vote, with discussions about potential amendments to focus on discouraging the practice rather than imposing criminal penalties.

2. **Companion Animals in Emergencies (HB 1186)**  
   HB 1186, which requires shelters to accommodate pets during a declared state of emergency, was discussed. Concerns about practicality, liability, and the need for further study led the committee to assign the bill to a subcommittee for further review.

### **Other Legislative Discussions**

1. **Soil Conditioners Study (HB 1168)**  
   HB 1168, which establishes a study committee to examine New Hampshire laws related to soil conditioners, was deemed straightforward and necessary due to the current statute’s lack of clarity. The bill passed unanimously.

2. **Landfill Siting Permits (HB 1454)**  
   HB 1454, related to permits for the siting of new landfills, was discussed. An amendment proposed by Representative Tucker addressed concerns raised by DES, and the bill was assigned to a subcommittee for further review.

3. **Gardening and Homesteading (HB 1412)**  
   HB 1412, which relates to gardening and homesteading, was ITL due to concerns that it would weaken existing agricultural laws.

4. **Milk Pasteurization (HB 1187)**  
   HB 1187, concerning milk pasteurization, was amended to align with a similar Senate bill and passed unanimously.

### **Key Takeaways and Next Steps**

The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the committee’s collaborative efforts and reminders for members to submit blurbs for committee reports. Several bills, including HB 1584 (state fairs) and HB 1547 (PFAS in soil), were advanced, while others, such as HB 1226 (declawing cats) and HB 1412 (gardening and homesteading), were indefinitely postponed. Subcommittees were assigned to further review HB 1454 (landfill siting) and HB 1186 (companion animals in emergencies). The committee scheduled a work session for February 8, 2022, to continue detailed discussions and consider potential amendments.
