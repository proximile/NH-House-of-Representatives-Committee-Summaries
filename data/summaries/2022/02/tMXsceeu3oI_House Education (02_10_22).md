### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (02/10/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 10, 2022, to discuss a range of education-related bills, focusing on ethics, charter schools, student services, and administrative rules. The meeting emphasized collaboration, efficiency, and addressing overlapping issues to streamline discussions. Below is a detailed summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

#### **Ethics and Professional Conduct**
1. **HB 1336 (Professional Code of Ethics Violations)**:
   - The committee discussed this bill, which aimed to address violations of the **New Hampshire Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct for educational professionals**. The Department of Education (DOE) advised against codifying these changes into law, as it would complicate future modifications. Instead, the committee proposed addressing these issues through the **rule-making process**.
   - The committee unanimously approved (18-0) sending a letter to the DOE, suggesting a **fourth category of action** for infractions: a **confidential letter of concern** as a non-disciplinary measure preceding reprimand, suspension, or revocation.

#### **Charter Schools**
1. **HB 1047 (Charter Public School Oversight Committee)**:

2. **HB 1212 (Charter School Transportation)**:
   - This bill clarified that charter school students are entitled to transportation on full and half school days. However, the committee raised concerns about logistical challenges in coordinating transportation between public and charter schools and voted to **indefinitely postpone (ITL)** the bill (18-0).

3. **HB 1428 (Special Education Services in Charter Schools)**:
   - The bill required charter schools to provide special education services if the public school district could not do so within two weeks. The committee found the timeline unrealistic and voted to **ITL** the bill (18-0).

2. **HB 1198 (Culture and Climate in Schools)**:
