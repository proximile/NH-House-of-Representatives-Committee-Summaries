### **Key Bills and Amendments Discussed**

1. **CACR 24**:  
   This constitutional amendment proposes that the Attorney General be elected by a majority vote of the General Court in a joint session. The committee reviewed background information, an amendment from the prime sponsor, and legislative history. While some members opposed the proposal, citing the sacred nature of the state constitution, others argued that its recurring introduction over 41 years indicates a persistent concern that warrants attention.

2. **HB 1033**:  
   This bill seeks to prohibit recipients of state or local grants or appropriations from using such funds for lobbying. An amendment clarified that the prohibition applies to funds raised by local property taxation. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on municipalities' ability to advocate for their interests, particularly through organizations like the New Hampshire Municipal Association.

3. **HB 1102**:  
   This bill aims to remove the Boxing and Wrestling Commission from the Secretary of State's domain and place it in its own RSA section. An amendment removed unnecessary repeals and clarified language. The bill passed as amended with a vote of 9-6.

4. **HB 1170**:  
   This bill limits the authority of New Hampshire delegates to policy-making conventions. An amendment addressed the selection process for delegates, their compensation, and the oath they must take. The bill passed as amended with a vote of 9-8.

5. **HB 1269**:  
   This carryover bill addresses the removal of defunct or inactive study committees. The committee worked through the bill line by line, making changes to the section on the Christa McAuliffe Discovery Center and removing significant portions to streamline the legislation.

6. **HB 1084**:  
   The bill was closed with a vote of 9-6, and a minority report was anticipated.

7. **HB 1104**:  
   Initially moved to "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) with a vote of 9-6, the bill was reconsidered and unanimously voted to ITL (17-0) due to existing legislation (HB 1650) addressing the issue.

8. **HB 1129, HB 1154, HB 1309, HB 1486**:  
   These bills were moved to ITL with votes of 10-7, 16-0, 10-7, and 16-1, respectively. No minority reports were filed.

9. **HB 1370**:  
   Initially moved to ITL, the bill was later passed with a vote of 10-7, and a minority report was written by Representative Expedia.

10. **HB 1586**:  
    This bill involved accepting a donated portrait of Wentworth Cheswell. An amendment was proposed and passed unanimously (17-0), and the bill was passed as amended with a unanimous vote (17-0). It was not placed on the consent calendar to allow for floor discussion.

11. **House Concurrent Resolution 9**:  
    The resolution was moved to interim study with a unanimous vote (17-0) to allow for a certificate of recognition to be issued without killing the bill.

### **Themes and Debates**

1. **Legislative Compensation and Constitutional Amendments**:  
   Several CACRs were discussed, including proposals to change legislative compensation, lower the voting age, and modify the process for electing the attorney general. Most proposals were moved to ITL, with arguments that existing laws or federal provisions already addressed the issues.

2. **Labor Unionization for Legislative Employees**:  
   A bill proposing the right for legislative employees to unionize was debated. Proponents argued it would protect employees' rights and safety, while opponents felt it was unnecessary or redundant. The bill was ultimately moved to ITL.

3. **Disclosure of Model Legislation**:  
   A bill requiring the disclosure of the source of model legislation was discussed. Supporters argued it would increase transparency, while opponents felt it was unnecessary and could deter collaboration. This bill was also moved to ITL.

4. **Insurrection and Office Disqualification**:  
   A bill addressing disqualification from office for participation in insurrection or rebellion was debated. Supporters argued it was necessary to uphold democratic principles, while opponents felt it was redundant due to existing federal laws.

5. **Committee Expirations**:  
   A significant portion of the conversation revolved around the automatic sunset (expiration) of certain committees and commissions after five years or upon the completion of their final reports. This was seen as a way to streamline legislative processes and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy.
