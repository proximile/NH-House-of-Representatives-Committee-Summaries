**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (February 15, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on February 15, 2022, to address several key bills and issues. The meeting focused on improving state processes, enhancing oversight, and addressing challenges in hiring, rulemaking, and education funding. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **State Hiring Process (House Bill 1510)**
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Representatives discussed the inefficiencies in the state’s hiring process, emphasizing the need for fairness, speed, and competitiveness with the private sector. Carolyn Russell, a senior operational analyst from the Department of Administrative Services, highlighted a 19% statewide vacancy rate and the difficulties of attracting talent in a tight labor market. Proposed solutions included hiring dedicated hiring managers for critical positions, improving training for HR professionals, and streamlining the application and onboarding processes.
- **Next Steps**: The committee acknowledged the need for further study to balance speed and quality in hiring while ensuring transparency and fairness. A study committee was proposed to explore ways to attract and retain qualified candidates.

### **Rulemaking Reforms (House Bill 1395)**
- **Legislative Oversight**: Representative Glenn Turcotte presented this bill, which aims to strengthen legislative oversight in the rulemaking process. The bill proposes requiring explicit legislative approval for rules, rather than the current process of assumed approval unless the legislature objects.
- **Key Proposals**: The bill seeks to empower the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) with stronger authority, improve public and business input, and involve policy committee chairs in rulemaking reviews. The goal is to ensure that unelected government employees do not effectively create law through rules and to restore legislative authority over policy matters.

### **Education Freedom Accounts Audit (House Bill 1135)**
- **Concerns and Oversight**: Representative Sally Fellowes introduced this bill, calling for an audit of the Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) program, which allows parents to use state funds for private education. Concerns were raised about potential fraud, lack of oversight, and the program’s cost, which has already reached $8 million. The bill aims to ensure state funds are managed appropriately and to analyze the demographic data of participating students.
- **Proposed Action**: A performance audit by the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) was recommended to address these concerns.

### **Designation of Awareness Months and Days**
- **House Bill 1287**: The committee unanimously deemed this bill, which proposed designating Sleep Awareness Month, as "inexpedient to legislate." Representative Goalie argued that such designations should be handled through annual proclamations by the governor rather than being permanently enshrined in statute.
- **House Bill 1443**: The committee considered a motion to deem this bill, which proposed designating the first Monday of March as COVID-19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day, as "inexpedient to legislate." Representative Lekkas supported the motion, suggesting that such commemorations could be handled more effectively through other means. The motion passed with a vote of 14-1.

### **Streamlining Professional Boards (House Bill 1446)**
- **Proposal**: This bill proposes converting the governing boards for recreational therapists and respiratory care practitioners into advisory boards. Representative Schuett explained that the bill aims to streamline administrative duties while maintaining expert consultation.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill as "ought to pass."

The meeting highlighted bipartisan support for improving efficiency, oversight, and the effectiveness of state programs and processes. Key themes included:
- Addressing challenges in the state’s hiring process to attract and retain talent.
