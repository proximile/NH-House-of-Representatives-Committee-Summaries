**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (February 8, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on February 8, 2022, addressed a wide range of education-related bills and issues, reflecting deep divisions over topics such as the teaching of divisive concepts, COVID-19 vaccine mandates, agricultural education, and historical teaching in schools. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **1. Divisive Concepts Law and Related Bills (HB 1090, HB 1576, HB 1638)**
The meeting prominently featured debates over the so-called "divisive concepts" law, enacted as part of the 2021 budget (HB2), which restricts teaching on race, gender, and discrimination in public schools and workplaces. Critics argued the law is vague, leads to arbitrary enforcement, and chills important discussions on systemic racism and historical injustices. Testimonies from educators, advocates, and parents highlighted the law’s chilling effect on teaching, with educators fearing penalties, including loss of teaching licenses, for addressing topics like slavery, segregation, and systemic inequality.

- **HB 1090 and HB 1576**: These bills aim to repeal or replace the divisive concepts law. Supporters, including the ACLU of New Hampshire and NEA New Hampshire, argued that the law stifles free speech, prevents students from learning critical historical and social issues, and harms marginalized communities by silencing their histories. Personal stories from immigrants and people of color emphasized the importance of teaching diverse perspectives to foster understanding and belonging.
- **HB 1638**: This bill seeks to change grievance procedures for discrimination complaints, keeping them within local school administrative units (SAUs) and allowing appeals to the Department of Education or courts. Supporters argued it would streamline the process, while critics questioned its effectiveness in addressing systemic issues.

Counterarguments defended the divisive concepts law, claiming it prevents discrimination and ensures fairness in education. However, critics countered that the law itself is discriminatory and harms marginalized communities by silencing their histories and experiences.

### **2. Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) Initiatives**
The meeting included polarized testimonies on CRT and DEIJ initiatives in schools. Some parents and advocates argued these programs label students as oppressors or white supremacists based on race, creating division and guilt. They shared examples of assignments they found troubling, claiming these initiatives undermine civil rights and create a hostile environment for students and teachers.

Supporters of CRT and DEIJ, including educators and organizations like New Futures, argued that these frameworks are essential for addressing systemic inequalities and fostering critical thinking. They emphasized the importance of teaching uncomfortable historical truths, such as slavery and the three-fifths compromise, to create a more equitable society.

### **3. COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates (HB 1241)**
House Bill 1241, which seeks to prohibit school districts from mandating COVID-19 vaccines for school attendance, sparked significant debate. Supporters, including Representative Tom Lanzaro and Dr. York, argued against mandates, citing concerns about bodily autonomy, parental rights, and the safety of vaccines for children. They emphasized that children are well-adapted to handle COVID-19, particularly the Omicron variant, and raised concerns about vaccine side effects, such as myocarditis.

Opponents of the bill questioned the need for legislative action, as the Department of Health and Human Services clarified that school districts do not currently have the authority to mandate vaccines. The discussion also touched on natural immunity, the rapid rollout of vaccines, and the importance of parental decision-making.

### **4. Agricultural Education and Farm-to-School Programs**
The committee discussed the Ag in the Classroom program, which educates children about agriculture, and a proposed farm-to-school reimbursement program that would incentivize schools to purchase local farm products. Questions were raised about the program’s funding, structure, and practicality, with some representatives suggesting a pilot program to test its feasibility. Concerns included identifying eligible vendors, processing raw foods, and the limited funding available ($1,200 per school).

### **5. Historical Teaching in Schools**
Representative Maria Perez and others emphasized the importance of teaching history to understand the diverse cultural background of the United States. Personal stories from immigrants highlighted the significance of learning history for citizenship and fostering inclusivity. However, some speakers argued against what they perceived as anti-American and communist teachings, urging representatives to stand up for children, particularly white children, who they felt were being unfairly targeted.

### **6. Broader Educational Issues**
The meeting also touched on broader issues, including public participation in school boards, the challenges of remote learning, and the need for transparency in curriculum and teacher training. A representative shared an article from the Derry School Board chair, highlighting challenges in governance and public engagement.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored deep divisions over how race, gender, and history should be taught in New Hampshire schools, with strong arguments for and against the divisive concepts law. It also highlighted ongoing tensions between ensuring educators can teach honest history and addressing concerns about potential biases or misinterpretations in the classroom. Additionally, debates over COVID-19 vaccine mandates and agricultural education programs reflected broader concerns about parental rights, local control, and the practicality of new initiatives. The discussions emphasized the need for collaboration, transparency, and critical thinking in addressing these complex issues.
