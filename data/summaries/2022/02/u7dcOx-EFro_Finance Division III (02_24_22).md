The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 24, 2022, focused on several critical pieces of legislation, primarily centered around victim compensation for abuse, Medicaid dental benefit expansion, and structured settlements. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Victim Compensation and Abuse Claims**

1. **Scope of Compensation**:
   - The committee debated the scope of victims eligible for compensation, initially limited to sexual assault but expanded to include physical and emotional abuse, such as solitary confinement. The broader definition of child abuse used by the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) was considered, encompassing emotional abuse and unlawful confinement.

2. **Administrator Selection and Independence**:
   - Concerns were raised about the independence of the administrator overseeing the compensation process. Proposals included placing the administrator within the judicial branch, ensuring impartiality, and clarifying whether they could maintain private mediation or arbitration practices.

3. **Compensation Caps and Guidelines**:
   - The appropriateness of arbitrary compensation caps, such as $150,000 for physical abuse cases, was debated. Some members argued for alignment with existing statutory caps. The development of streamlined guidelines for determining compensation ranges was also discussed to avoid process breakdowns.

4. **Victim Rights and Waivers**:
   - Significant discussion focused on whether victims should waive their right to pursue judicial remedies before knowing their compensation amount. Some advocated for victims to see proposed awards before deciding to accept them or pursue litigation.

5. **Structured Settlements**:
   - Structured settlements were proposed as an option, allowing victims to receive tax-free, periodic payments instead of a lump sum. This approach benefits both victims and the state by preventing premature fund dissipation and removing ongoing administrative obligations.

6. **Process Complexity and Streamlining**:
   - Concerns about the complexity of the proposed process were addressed, with suggestions to streamline it for efficiency and victim-friendliness. Deferring to experts and reducing extensive legislative review were considered.

7. **Finality of Administrator’s Decision**:
   - The committee discussed whether the administrator’s decision should be final and non-appealable, with exceptions for plain errors or mistakes, ensuring enforceability similar to arbitration awards.

### **Medicaid Dental Benefit Expansion (HB 103 FN)**

1. **Purpose and Key Points**:
   - The bill aims to expand Medicaid dental benefits for adults in New Hampshire, focusing on cost controls and eligibility. It includes a $1,500 annual cap on dental benefits, excluding preventive services, and introduces cost-sharing for individuals above 100% of the federal poverty level.

2. **Denture Benefit and Financing**:
   - The denture benefit is limited to specific populations, such as those with developmental disabilities and nursing facility residents, subject to medical necessity. The bill is financed through a 50-50 federal-state match for standard Medicaid populations and a 90-10 match for the expansion population, with funds from the health trust fund.

3. **Implementation and Amendments**:
   - The implementation date is set for April 1, 2023, with estimated state costs of $6.91 million annually. Representative Erf’s amendment clarifies language, adds provisions for the annual cap, and consolidates the benefit into a single section for clarity.

### **Victims’ Rights and Structured Settlements (HB 1677)**

1. **Victims’ Rights and Administrator Selection**:
   - The bill addresses the rights of victims of abuse at the Youth Development Center (YDC), emphasizing inclusivity and independence. A new draft proposes that the Supreme Court select the administrator to ensure impartiality.

2. **Structured Settlements and Next Steps**:
   - Provisions for structured settlements were included to provide long-term financial support to victims. The committee planned to reconvene on March 1 to finalize recommendations, focusing on incorporating settlement funding and ensuring a victim-friendly resolution.

### **Claims Process and Guidelines**

1. **Claims Process and Installment Payments**:
   - The process for handling claims includes the role of the Attorney General, the claimant, and the administrator. Options for claimants to receive awards include lump sum payments, installment payments over up to 10 years, or purchasing an annuity from a third-party company.

2. **Scope Expansion and Guidelines Approval**:
   - The scope was expanded to include physical abuse claims, with a lower cap of $150,000 compared to $1.5 million for sexual abuse claims. Guidelines for the claims process must be approved by the fiscal committee to ensure legislative oversight.

3. **Administrator’s Role and Privacy Concerns**:
   - The administrator’s role was debated, with a consensus leaning toward applying pre-established guidelines to maintain process integrity. Balancing transparency with the privacy of victims was emphasized, with considerations for additional privacy protections beyond RSA 91-A.

4. **Notification, Sunset Provisions, and Future Adjustments**:
   - The timeline for notifying potential claimants was discussed, with the notice deadline moved to December. Sunset provisions were acknowledged as necessary, and the process allows for adjustments based on experience, requiring fiscal committee approval.

### **Overall Tone and Collaborative Effort**

The meeting reflected a collaborative effort to refine the bills, balancing financial responsibility with the need to provide meaningful benefits and support to affected individuals. The committee aimed to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in the claims process while addressing concerns raised by both committee members and stakeholders. The focus remained on finalizing the bills promptly, with clear language and specific recommendations to avoid delays.
