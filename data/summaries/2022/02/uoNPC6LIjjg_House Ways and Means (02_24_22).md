The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on February 24, 2022, covered a wide range of topics, focusing on revenue, taxation, and the allocation of funds, particularly in relation to opioid settlement agreements and proposed legislation. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### Opioid Settlement Fund Allocation
The committee engaged in a detailed debate about the distribution of funds from opioid settlement agreements to address the ongoing opioid crisis in New Hampshire. Key points included:
- **Rural vs. Urban Access to Treatment**: Representatives highlighted the challenges faced by rural areas in accessing treatment programs, which are more readily available in larger cities.
- **Fund Allocation**: The discussion centered around the distribution of settlement funds, with a focus on whether to increase the percentage allocated to counties and municipalities. Currently, 15% of the funds go directly to 13 specific towns and counties, while the remaining 85% is managed by a commission.
- **County vs. Municipal Allocation**: There was debate over whether more funds should be allocated directly to counties, which cover the entire state and can distribute resources more broadly, versus specific municipalities that were part of the initial lawsuit. Some representatives argued that counties are more "nimble" and better equipped to address local needs.
- **Commission's Role**: The commission, tasked with distributing the 85% of funds, was criticized for not being transparent or accessible. Representatives expressed frustration over the lack of communication from the commission about its priorities and decision-making process.
- **Long-term Considerations**: Concerns were raised about the long-term implications of the current allocation formula, especially as more settlements are expected. Some suggested a "look back" period to reassess and potentially reallocate funds based on evolving needs.
- **Non-Profit and Community Involvement**: The potential role of non-profits in addressing the opioid crisis was discussed, with some representatives advocating for funding to support these organizations, especially in smaller towns that may not have the capacity to develop their own programs.
- **Straw Poll Suggestion**: A suggestion was made to conduct a straw poll to gauge the committee's support for increasing the county allocation to 30% while keeping the municipal allocation at 15%.

### Senate Bill 275 and Fund Distribution
The committee also discussed Senate Bill 275, which proposes an 85-15 split of funds. Members contemplated the implications of passing the bill as is, particularly its impact on small towns and the authority of the commission to distribute funds to nonprofits and statewide programs. One member asserted that the legislation does not impose restrictions on such distributions. The committee emphasized the need to focus on the revenue and funds aspect of upcoming bills rather than policy issues and assigned homework to review relevant materials in preparation for their next meeting.

### Work Session on Bills
The work session reviewed several bills, primarily centered around revenue, taxation, and opioid abatement:
- **Marijuana Bill**: A significant marijuana bill was highlighted for its revenue implications, with a focus on the establishment of a special New Hampshire bank. Members from the Commerce and Finance Committees were invited to assist with questioning during the public hearing.
- **Revenue Focus**: The committee emphasized that their role was to examine the revenue aspects of the bills, not to alter policy. They discussed the need to address unbudgeted funds, particularly the $24 million request in the marijuana bill.
- **House Bill 1097**: The committee discussed the complexities of this bill, which required additional time for legal language refinement. The Attorney General’s office requested seven to ten more days to finalize the language, pushing the timeline tight for the bill’s consideration.
- **House Bill 1221**: This bill pertains to the Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET). An amendment proposed reducing the BPT from 7.6% to 7.5% while removing the BET reduction. The fiscal impact was discussed, with estimates showing a reduction in revenue by $1.8 million in FY23 and up to $8.4 million by FY25.
- **House Bill 1565**: This bill relates to the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. An amendment proposed changing the allocation factor from 40% to 30%, aiming for a more equitable distribution of funds between political subdivisions and the state. The amendment also incorporated changes from Senate Bill 275, which included adjustments to the commission overseeing the fund.
- **Public Comment and Debate**: Representatives debated the merits of the proposed tax cuts and the allocation of opioid settlement funds. Concerns were raised about the impact of tax cuts on state revenues and the equitable distribution of opioid settlement funds to address the widespread opioid crisis across the state.

### Conclusion
The meeting concluded with a commitment to further refine the language of the amendments and address the fiscal impacts of the proposed changes. The committee also reminded members about procedural tasks and the importance of being prepared for future sessions. Overall, the meeting reflected a complex debate over how best to allocate funds and address policy issues, balancing the needs of rural and urban areas, counties and municipalities, and ensuring transparency and accountability in the distribution process.
