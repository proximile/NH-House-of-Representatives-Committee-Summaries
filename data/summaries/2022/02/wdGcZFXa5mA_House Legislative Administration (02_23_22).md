**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Committee Meeting (February 23, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Committee convened on February 23, 2022, to discuss and refine several bills during an executive session. The meeting began with a pledge of allegiance and a work session plan to address three key pieces of legislation: **House Bill (HB) 1033**, **HB 1269**, and **HB 1368**. The committee focused on clarifying language, addressing unintended consequences, and ensuring the bills' effectiveness. Here are the key points from the discussions:

---

### **House Bill 1033: Prohibitions on Purchasing Lobbying Services**
This bill aimed to regulate the use of state and local funds for lobbying activities. The committee debated the need for clearer language to prevent unintended consequences, such as restricting free speech or limiting municipalities' ability to advocate for their interests. Two amendments were proposed and passed with a 13-0 vote:
1. **Amendment 2022-0805h**: Clarified the origination of funds to ensure taxpayer money is not used for lobbying services.
2. **Amendment 2022-0743h**: Improved communication with municipalities and school boards about their roles and responsibilities, ensuring public officials could still testify and communicate with legislators.

Concerns were raised about the potential impact on small towns and the role of municipal associations in representing communities. The bill, as amended, passed with a 9-4 vote, with a minority report expected.

### **House Bill 1269: Legislative Study Committees**
This bill focused on legislative study committees and statutory commissions, requiring commissions to have a repeal date no later than five years after their creation. The discussion centered on ensuring legislative control over commissions and addressing concerns about retroactive application. An amendment (**2022-0782h**) was introduced to refine the bill, including a requirement that legislative members constitute a majority of commissions. The committee also emphasized the need for periodic review of existing commissions to ensure they remain active and relevant. The amendment passed 13-0, and the bill was approved as amended with a 13-0 vote, moving to the consent calendar.

### **House Bill 1368: Recusal for Conflicts of Interest**
This bill addressed recusal by members of the General Court for conflicts of interest. The committee discussed an amendment (**2022-0794h**) to clarify when recusal is required. Concerns were raised about ensuring the amendment did not create unnecessary burdens or ambiguities. After deliberation, the committee voted 13-0 to send the bill to interim study for further review.

### **Additional Discussions**
The committee also briefly discussed an amendment related to marine fisheries, particularly the composition of advisory committees. The amendment proposed that a majority of members, including alternates, have expertise in marine fisheries and represent the seacoast region, defined as tidewater towns.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the chair thanking members for their efficiency and announcing the next session on March 10, 2022. Members were encouraged to communicate any plans to speak on non-consent bills. Throughout the session, the committee emphasized the importance of clarity, addressing unintended consequences, and ensuring taxpayer funds are used appropriately while preserving municipalities' ability to advocate for their needs.
