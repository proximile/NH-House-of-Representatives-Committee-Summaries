The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on February 18, 2022, addressed a wide range of critical issues, focusing on workforce challenges, program effectiveness, financial oversight, and the efficient use of resources. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### Workforce and Staffing Challenges
1. **Vacancies and Hiring Strategies**:
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported 3,249 vacant positions, exceeding the House’s cap of 3,000. The committee emphasized prioritizing needs and working with the agency to manage hiring within this limit.
   - The Department of Corrections (DOC) faced high vacancy rates, leading to significant overtime costs and reliance on the National Guard. Discussions included exploring contractual requirements for newly trained officers to ensure retention.
   - The committee debated hiring a headhunting firm but decided to allow three months for internal hiring efforts before considering external consultants.

2. **Hampstead Hospital**:
   - The committee reviewed a request for six positions to manage Hampstead Hospital, with an emphasis on keeping senior leadership as state employees for greater control while contracting out other services. Concerns were raised about hiring feasibility given high vacancy rates at New Hampshire Hospital and potential conflicts between state employees and contracted staff.

3. **Broader Workforce Issues**:
   - Workforce challenges were acknowledged across state government, particularly in mental health and substance use disorder services. The committee highlighted the need for competitive wages and innovative recruitment strategies.

### Program Effectiveness and Funding
1. **Doorways Program**:
   - The committee discussed the effectiveness of the Doorways program, a substance abuse treatment initiative, which had 27,000 interactions but faced challenges in measuring success amidst rising overdose deaths in Manchester and Nashua. Efforts to improve data collection and program evaluation were outlined.

2. **Fraud Investigations**:
   - Funding for overtime in the Special Investigations Unit, which handles fraud cases related to state benefits, was reviewed. The unit had a backlog of cases due to increased referrals during the pandemic.

3. **Apprenticeship and Training Programs**:
   - The committee considered funding for apprenticeship programs aimed at addressing workforce shortages in trades like plumbing and electrical work, which had shown success in placing students in apprenticeships.

### Financial Oversight and Federal Relief Funds
1. **ARPA Funds**:
   - The committee approved $1.7 million in ARPA funds for six positions at Glencliff Home, with concerns about long-term financial implications once ARPA funds are exhausted.

2. **Rental Assistance Program**:
   - $30 million in ARPA funds were authorized for rental assistance, benefiting over 13,000 households with an average aid of $8,000. Discussions included concerns about the program’s efficiency.

3. **CARES Act Update**:
   - Commissioner Taylor Caswell provided an update on the CARES Act, detailing the distribution of $1.25 billion in federal funds supporting various programs, including small business relief, healthcare, and unemployment.

### Audits and Program Reviews
1. **Child Care Industry Audit**:
   - The audit highlighted concerns about employment eligibility determinations for child care workers and the need for a process to track reasons for child care program closures. The Child Care Licensing Unit (CCLU) was advised to strengthen its policies and procedures.
   - The audit revealed over 1,000 child care licensing rules, which are being reviewed and condensed for clarity and efficiency.

2. **529 College Savings Plans Audit**:
   - The audit of the NH 529 College Savings Plans, managed by Fidelity, revealed no significant issues. The plan continues to grow, with over $23 billion in assets and 800,000 accounts, benefiting low-income students through administrative assessments.

### Committee Actions and Motions
- The committee voted on several items, including the approval of funds for the 911 system and the transfer of funds within the Department of Corrections.
- A motion to table the request for Hampstead Hospital positions failed, and the item was moved forward with a call for more detailed briefings on the hospital’s operations and future plans.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the importance of strategic planning, ongoing oversight, and innovative solutions to address staffing shortages, program effectiveness, and financial management. The committee emphasized the need for competitive wages, better data collection, prevention efforts, and efficient use of resources to improve state services and better serve residents.
