The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on February 9, 2022, addressed a wide range of education-related bills, focusing on issues such as academic integrity, school funding, student nutrition, career technical education (CTE), and charter school policies. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **Academic Integrity and Student Protection (HB 1222)**  
   - The committee unanimously voted (18-0) to recommend further work on this bill, which aims to prohibit coercion or interference in student grading, particularly by coaches or others seeking to alter grades for athletic eligibility.  
   - The bill proposes making such interference a **Class B felony**, which sparked debate. Some members argued the penalty was too severe, suggesting a misdemeanor instead. Concerns were also raised about the bill’s applicability to K-12 education, where legitimate grade changes (e.g., for medical issues or makeup work) occur.  
   - Testimony from the University System of New Hampshire highlighted concerns about the bill’s vague language and the potential redundancy of existing academic integrity policies.  

2. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs) and Funding (HB 1516, HB 1684, HB 1355)**  
   - The committee voted 10-8 to recommend further study (ITL) on **HB 1516**, which proposes using local property taxes for EFAs. Concerns were raised about constitutionality and the burden on local taxpayers.  
   - **HB 1684**, addressing EFA funding, was discussed extensively. The program, which allows families to use state funds for private or alternative education, has seen higher-than-expected costs (projected $129,000 vs. actual $8.1 million). An amendment was proposed to cap funding based on projected enrollment, with exceptions for emergencies.  
   - **HB 1355** focused on suspected fraud in the EFA program. An amendment proposed requiring the scholarship organization to report substantial misuse of funds to the Attorney General. The committee recessed further discussion to allow more consideration.  

3. **Student Nutrition and Meal Programs (HB 1660, HB 1229)**  
   - The committee voted 10-8 to recommend further study (ITL) on **HB 1660**, which aims to ensure students have access to meals. Supporters emphasized the importance of addressing child hunger, while opponents cited cost and local control concerns.  
   - **HB 1229** proposes establishing a study committee to examine school meal programs, particularly in light of pandemic-related changes like remote learning and meal distribution. The committee voted to move the bill to interim study for further consideration.  

4. **Career Technical Education (CTE) (HB 1661)**  
   - The committee voted to recommend passage (OTP) of **HB 1661**, which amends regional CTE agreements to align school schedules more closely, allowing for up to 10 dissimilar days as requested by CTE directors.  
   - Discussions highlighted challenges in synchronizing schedules across 28 CTE centers, including transportation issues and differing calendars.  

5. **Charter School Policies (HB 1132, HB 1193, HB 1202)**  
   - **HB 1132**, which simplifies the process for converting public schools to charter schools, raised concerns about unintended consequences, including impacts on collective bargaining agreements. The committee recessed further action to allow time for amendments.  
   - **HB 1193**, prohibiting charter schools from charging enrollment fees and requiring preference for in-state students, passed unanimously (18-0).  
   - **HB 1202**, addressing transportation to school activities by contract carriers, passed with a majority vote, though concerns were raised about driver safety and background checks.  

6. **Lead in School Drinking Water (HB 1421)**  
   - The committee unanimously passed (18-0) an amended version of **HB 1421**, which addresses lead in school drinking water. Amendments focused on sampling timing, data submission, post-remediation testing, and enforcement penalties.  

7. **Other Bills**  
   - **HB 1276**, requiring cost-per-student information on school budgets, was unanimously killed (ITL) due to concerns about data accuracy and comparability.  
   - **HB 1398**, proposing a study on centralized criminal history record checks in education, passed unanimously (OTP).  
   - **HB 1453**, addressing transportation to charter schools, was unanimously killed (ITL) due to feasibility concerns.  

### **Key Themes and Outcomes:**  
- **Funding and Fiscal Responsibility**: Several bills sparked debates about the use of public funds, particularly for EFAs and school meal programs. Concerns about cost projections, local taxpayer burdens, and accountability were recurring themes.  
- **Student Well-Being**: Discussions on school meals and lead in drinking water highlighted the committee’s focus on student health and safety.  
- **Educational Choice and Equity**: The EFA program and charter school policies underscored ongoing debates about educational choice, equity, and the balance between public and private education.  
- **Academic Integrity and Local Control**: Bills like HB 1222 and HB 1660 reflected tensions between ensuring academic integrity and respecting local control over education decisions.  
- **Interim Studies**: Several bills, including HB 1229 and HB 1680, were moved to interim study to allow for further analysis and refinement.  

The meeting demonstrated the committee’s commitment to addressing complex education issues while balancing fiscal responsibility, student well-being, and local control.
