### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Science, Technology, and Energy Committee (02/01/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 1, 2022, to discuss several bills related to energy, telecommunications, and environmental regulation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Energy Regulation and Oversight**
   - **HB 1270: Repealing the Legislative Oversight Committee**
     - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to dissolve the Legislative Oversight Committee, which was originally established to oversee the divestiture of electrical generating stations and later expanded to general electricity industry oversight.
     - **Arguments**:
       - **Proponents**: Representative Thomas argued the committee has served its purpose, as the divestiture process is complete, and the committee has been inactive for years.
       - **Opponents**: Some representatives expressed concerns about losing independent oversight, particularly for renewable energy and carbon emission budgets.
     - **Outcome**: The Department of Energy (DOE) suggested minor housekeeping changes if the bill moves forward.

   - **HB 1148: Prohibiting Restrictions on Fuel Sources for Energy**
     - **Purpose**: The bill aims to prevent municipalities from restricting energy projects based on fuel type, ensuring state-level control over energy decisions.
     - **Arguments**:
       - **Proponents**: Representative Plett argued that local ordinances should not block energy projects already subject to state-level permitting.
       - **Opponents**: Concerns were raised about the bill undermining municipalities’ net-zero goals and renewable energy transitions.
     - **Outcome**: Further discussion was scheduled, with a focus on balancing state authority and local autonomy.

   - **HB 1635: Limited Producer Electricity Generation and Avoided Transmission Charges**
     - **Purpose**: The bill allows small-scale electricity producers (e.g., solar and battery storage) to enter long-term power purchase agreements and receive credits for reducing transmission costs during peak demand.
     - **Concerns**:
       - **Complexity**: Calculating avoided transmission charges and managing billing were highlighted as technical challenges.
       - **Consumer Protections**: Calls were made for regulatory review to ensure residential and small business customers are not adversely affected.
     - **Outcome**: The committee discussed forming a study committee or aligning the bill with **Senate Bill 321** for further analysis.

#### **2. Environmental Regulation**
   - **HB 1546: Limiting PFAS Air Emissions**
     - **Purpose**: The bill aims to regulate PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) emissions into the air, inspired by studies from other states.
     - **Key Points**:
       - **Amendment**: Representative Boyd proposed an amendment allowing the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to use scientific studies to set PFAS limits.
       - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the complexity of PFAS, its presence in various environments, and the need for further research.
       - **Public Testimony**: The committee reviewed public testimony, with 8 in support and 34 in opposition.
     - **Outcome**: The committee considered forming a commission to study PFAS comprehensively.

   - **PFAS in Artificial Turf and Firefighting Foams**
     - **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about PFAS in artificial turf fields and firefighting foams, with limited inhalation studies available.
     - **Outcome**: DES clarified that current regulations already address some PFAS compounds, but further research is needed.

#### **3. Telecommunications Modernization**
   - **HB 1328: Removing Carrier of Last Resort Obligations**
     - **Purpose**: The bill allows incumbent telephone utilities to petition the DOE to relieve them of their obligation to provide basic service in areas with sufficient competition (95% wireline and 97% wireless coverage).
     - **Arguments**:
       - **Proponents**: Supporters argued the obligation is outdated due to increased competition from cable, VoIP, and wireless services.
       - **Opponents**: Concerns were raised about rural access, unintended consequences, and potential gaps in service.
     - **Outcome**: The committee discussed potential amendments to address rural access and ensure continued service.

   - **Telecommunications Deregulation**
     - **Discussion**: Representatives debated modernizing regulations as the industry shifts toward wireless and broadband, emphasizing the need for affordable basic services and 911 emergency access.

#### **4. Renewable Energy and Community Power**
   - **Community Power Coalition**:
     - **Testimony**: A representative from the Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire advocated for market-based alternatives to net metering and equitable treatment for municipal aggregations.
     - **Outcome**: The committee emphasized the importance of creating a local distribution-level market that complements the ISO New England wholesale market.

### **Key Themes**
1. **State vs. Local Control**: Debates centered on the balance between state authority and local autonomy, particularly in energy regulation and environmental policies.
2. **Regulatory Modernization**: Efforts to update outdated regulations in telecommunications and energy sectors were a recurring theme.
3. **Environmental and Health Concerns**: Discussions highlighted the need for scientific rigor in regulating PFAS and addressing its widespread presence in air, water, and soil.
4. **Consumer Protections**: Ensuring affordable access to essential services (e.g., telecommunications, electricity) and protecting residential and small business customers were key concerns.
5. **Renewable Energy Transition**: The meeting underscored the importance of supporting renewable energy initiatives while addressing technical and regulatory challenges.

### **Next Steps**
- **Study Committees**: The committee considered forming study committees to address unresolved issues, particularly regarding PFAS regulation and avoided transmission charges.
- **Public Hearings and Amendments**: Further public hearings and potential amendments were scheduled for several bills, including HB 1148, HB 1546, and HB 1635.
- **Subcommittee Meetings**: A subcommittee meeting was planned for February 14 to discuss **HB 1258**, which deals with the restructuring of the PUC and DOE.

The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing regulatory oversight, scientific rigor, and consumer protection while addressing the complexities of modernizing energy and telecommunications policies.
