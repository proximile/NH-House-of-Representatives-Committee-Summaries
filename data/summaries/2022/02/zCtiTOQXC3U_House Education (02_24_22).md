**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (February 24, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 24, 2022, to discuss and vote on several education-related bills. The meeting began with a moment of silence for the crisis in Ukraine, followed by extensive deliberations on a range of topics, including health education, school district policies, student representation, remote learning, and enrollment projections. Key themes throughout the discussions included the importance of local control, transparency, parental and student involvement, and the balance between state oversight and district autonomy.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **Health Education and School Policies**
1. **HB 1533 (Health Education Curriculum)**: The committee voted 18-1 to **ITL** (Inexpedient to Legislate) this bill, which aimed to address health education curriculum in schools. The decision was based on the existence of similar legislation (HB 1263) that the committee preferred to focus on.
   
2. **HB 1015 (School District Policies on Objectionable Material)**: The committee voted 18-1 to **ITL** this bill, which sought to regulate school district policies regarding objectionable material. Concerns were raised about the impact on teachable moments and the potential for hindering timely classroom discussions.

3. **HB 1169 (Public Comment During School Board Meetings)**: The committee voted 19-0 to **ITL** this bill, which aimed to formalize public comment and inquiry processes during school board meetings. Members felt the bill went too far in its requirements.

#### **Classroom Recordings and Observers**
4. **HB 1295 (Reports on School Policies and Classroom Recordings)**: This bill would require school districts to submit reports on policies related to classroom recordings and observers. The committee discussed concerns about costs, local control, and the potential for the Department of Education to collect and centralize policies. After extensive debate, the motion for "ought to pass" failed (10-8), but a subsequent motion for an interim study passed unanimously (18-0), indicating the need for further examination.

#### **Tuition Agreements and Student Transfers**
5. **HB 1373 (Tuition Agreements and Student Transfers)**: This bill addresses situations where students are tuitioned to out-of-state schools, focusing on a case involving South Hampton students sent to Amesbury, Massachusetts. Parents expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of education and the financial burden of paying tuition differences for in-state schools. A motion for an interim study passed unanimously (18-0) to explore the financial and policy implications of tuition agreements and ensure equitable access for students.

#### **School Board Duties and Student Representation**
6. **HB 1137 (School Board Duties)**: This bill aims to clarify and expand the duties of school boards, addressing issues like parental engagement, transparency, and curriculum accessibility. A motion for an interim study passed 12-6, indicating the need for further examination due to the bill's complexity and gaps.

7. **HB 1381 (Student School Board Members)**: This bill proposes allowing at least one student member from each public high school to serve on the school board. Proponents argued that student representation provides valuable insights, fosters leadership, and enhances civic education. Critics argued that the bill is unnecessary because local boards already have the discretion to include student members. The bill initially failed with a vote of 7-12 but later succeeded with a vote of 14-4, indicating it would move forward with a minority report.

#### **Remote Learning and Local Control**
8. **HB 1113 (Remote Learning)**: This bill seeks to prohibit the Department of Education and the State Board of Education from directing or limiting school instructional options, such as remote learning. Supporters argued that remote learning should remain an option for short-term emergencies to maintain continuity in education, while opponents expressed concerns about its detrimental impact on student outcomes. The motion to pass the bill with an amendment (**ITL - Inexpedient to Legislate**) carried 10-9, indicating a divided opinion.

#### **Enrollment Projections**
9. **HB 1605 (Five-Year Enrollment Projections)**: This bill requires school administrative units (SAUs) to prepare and maintain a five-year enrollment projection report to help manage costs and plan budgets. Supporters viewed the bill as a transparency and planning tool, while opponents saw it as unnecessary overreach and a potential infringement on local decision-making. No final vote was recorded in the provided transcript.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Local Control vs. State Oversight**: Throughout the meeting, members emphasized the importance of local control in education policy and the need to avoid unnecessary mandates on school districts. Concerns were raised about the Department of Education becoming overly involved in local school policies, with some representatives likening it to "big brother."
- **Transparency and Parental Involvement**: Many bills focused on increasing transparency and parental involvement in school board processes, curriculum accessibility, and policy development. However, there was debate about the best ways to achieve these goals without overstepping local autonomy.
- **Student Representation**: The discussions highlighted the importance of student voices in school governance but also raised concerns about potential backlash for students who speak up. The debate on HB 1381 underscored the tension between mandating student representation and respecting local discretion.
- **Remote Learning**: The committee grappled with the balance between maintaining local control over education decisions and addressing concerns about the potential misuse of remote learning. Proponents emphasized flexibility for emergencies, while opponents focused on the need for safeguards to prevent prolonged remote instruction.
- **Interim Studies**: Several bills were referred for interim studies to allow for further analysis and stakeholder input, reflecting the complexity and contentious nature of the issues at hand.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing local control, state oversight, and the diverse needs of students, parents, and educators in shaping effective education policies.
