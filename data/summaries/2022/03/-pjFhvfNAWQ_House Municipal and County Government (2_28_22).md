The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 28, 2022, focused on a variety of issues related to municipal and county government. The session involved discussions and votes on several bills, with key themes including housing, property taxes, local governance, and the balance between state and local control. Here is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Housing and Land Use**
1. **Housing Appeals Board (HAB) Authority**:
   - A bill to remove certain land use decisions, such as parking requirements, from the HAB's authority was debated. Supporters argued it would help the HAB focus on housing issues, while opponents feared it could increase costs for workforce housing. The motion to pass the bill (Ought to Pass, OTP) was approved 13-3.
   - Another bill (HB 1307) modified the HAB's duties, limiting its investigatory powers to specific town boards and commissions. The motion to pass this bill (OTP) was approved, though some members opposed it for potentially restricting the board's scope.

2. **HB 1238 Amendment**:
   - An amendment to HB 1238 aimed to prevent municipalities from prohibiting or unreasonably discouraging multi-family housing development. It included provisions for innovative land use controls and a streamlined application process. While the amendment passed, concerns were raised about its effectiveness in addressing workforce housing needs.

### **Property Taxes**
1. **Property Tax Evaluation**:
   - A bill related to the procedure for evaluating property taxes was discussed and unanimously supported. The motion to pass the bill (ITO) was approved 16-0.

2. **Differential Tax Rates**:
   - A bill allowing towns and cities to tax residential and non-residential property at different rates was debated. Concerns were raised about complicating the tax system and creating tension between residents and businesses. The motion to kill the bill (ITO) was approved unanimously (16-0).

3. **HB 1289**:
   - This bill allowed homeowners to apply for tax abatements due to issues like noise and dust from off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs) on nearby roads. While members sympathized with affected homeowners, they felt tax abatements were not the right solution. The motion to move the bill to interim study passed 13-3.

### **Local Governance and Control**
1. **Local Land Use Boards Membership**:
   - A bill addressing the membership of local land use boards was discussed, with the issue primarily affecting Portsmouth. The motion to kill the bill (ITO) was approved unanimously (16-0).

2. **HB 1259**:
   - This bill pertained to the election and resignation of school board and budget committee members. Due to concerns about its complexity and potential unintended consequences, the motion to declare it "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) passed unanimously.

3. **HB 1267**:
   - This bill limited municipal authority for road and sidewalk closures. Members expressed concern it would hinder municipalities' ability to creatively use streets and sidewalks, particularly in response to COVID-19. The motion to ITL passed unanimously.

4. **HB 1268**:
   - This bill limited the authority of city councils to enact bylaws and ordinances. Opponents argued it would restrict local control and hinder municipalities' ability to address local issues. The motion to pass the bill (OTP) narrowly passed 9-7.

5. **HB 1272**:
   - This bill limited the authority of town health officers. Members opposed it, citing concerns about reducing local control, especially in the context of COVID-19. The motion to pass the bill (OTP) narrowly passed 9-7.

### **Environmental and Public Health**
1. **HB 1293**:
   - This bill prohibited homeowners from designing their own septic systems. Members supported it, citing the complexity and potential environmental impact of septic system design. The motion to pass the bill (OTP) passed unanimously.

### **Closing Remarks**
- The chair thanked the committee for their professionalism and cordiality during the session. He reminded members of the next session and encouraged Republicans to arrive early.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Housing and Land Use**: Several bills and amendments focused on streamlining housing development and refining the role of the Housing Appeals Board, though concerns about their impact on workforce housing persisted.
- **Property Taxes**: Bills related to property tax evaluation and differential tax rates were discussed, with a strong emphasis on maintaining fairness and simplicity in the tax system.
- **Local Governance**: Many bills sparked debates about the balance between state and local control, with members expressing concerns about restricting municipalities' ability to address local issues.
- **Environmental and Public Health**: Bills addressing septic system design and town health officers highlighted the importance of balancing individual responsibility with environmental and public health considerations.

The session concluded on a positive note, with appreciation expressed for the collaborative and respectful atmosphere among committee members.
