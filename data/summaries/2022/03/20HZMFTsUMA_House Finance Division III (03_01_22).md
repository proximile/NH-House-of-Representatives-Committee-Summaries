The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 1, 2022, focused on two key pieces of legislation: **House Bill 1677 (HB 1677)**, addressing claims of physical and sexual abuse at the Youth Development Center (YDC), and **House Bill 103 (HB 103)**, concerning dental care for Medicaid beneficiaries. The discussions were comprehensive and multifaceted, involving debates on definitions, funding, administrative processes, and legal considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **HB 1677: Youth Development Center Claims**
1. **Definition of Abuse and Liability**:
   - The committee debated the definitions of **physical and sexual abuse**, including whether to incorporate **common law causes of action** and remove references to specific legal cases like *State v. Foss*. The goal was to simplify the process for victims to release civil claims without needing to prove supervisory authority in court.
   - The **Victims' Council** proposed expanding the definitions to include common law and civil liability standards, arguing that the current definitions were too narrow and could exclude valid claims, potentially leading to additional litigation.

2. **Compensation and Caps**:
   - There was extensive discussion on **caps for settlements**. Plaintiffs' counsel advocated for aligning the caps with existing state law ($475,000 per incident and an aggregate cap under RSA 1435-B), while the Attorney General's office supported a $1.5 million cap for sexual abuse and $150,000 for physical abuse, based on historical verdict and settlement data.
   - Concerns were raised that caps might encourage plaintiffs to bypass the mediation system in favor of potentially higher recoveries through court litigation.

3. **Administrative Process and Mediation**:
   - The role of the **administrator** in mediating the development of claims guidelines and valuing claims was debated. Some argued the administrator should be involved in the guidelines process, while others believed their role should be limited to adjudicating claims.
   - The committee discussed allowing for a **part-time administrator** and setting their compensation rates, with a push for flexibility in hiring and compensation to adapt to the workload.
   - Mediation was another point of contention, with the Attorney General suggesting that mediation should only occur if both parties agree, rather than unilaterally.

4. **Aggravating Factors**:
   - The addition of **false imprisonment** as an aggravating factor in valuing claims was contentious. Some members argued it was necessary to account for instances of solitary confinement, while others expressed concerns about scope creep and the potential for relitigating claims. A straw vote rejected its inclusion.

5. **Judicial Review and Transparency**:
   - The committee debated the necessity of **judicial review** in the mediation process, with some advocating for limited review to address issues like fraud, misconduct, or mathematical errors. Others believed it could undermine the efficiency of the mediation system.
   - **Transparency and privacy** were major themes, particularly regarding the release of records related to the claims process. The committee agreed on balancing public disclosure with protecting claimants' privacy, especially for juvenile victims.

6. **Attorney's Fees and Surviving Spouses**:
   - The committee considered the structure of **attorney's fees**, debating whether to have a single cap of 33.33% or a two-tiered system (25% for early settlements and 33.33% for cases that go through full adjudication). The argument for a single cap was that it would encourage early settlements and prevent attorneys from prolonging cases for higher fees.
   - The discussion also touched on whether **surviving spouses** of deceased victims should be eligible to file claims. Some representatives supported this, citing the ongoing impact of the abuse on the spouse, while others were concerned about the complexity and potential for abuse of the system.

7. **Funding and Control of Funds**:
   - The committee debated whether to use the **Rainy Day Fund** (Revenue Stabilization Reserve Account) or **general funds** to finance the settlement fund. A straw vote showed a majority (8-5) in favor of using the Rainy Day Fund, with arguments about matching liabilities to historical funding sources.
   - Language ensuring the **Attorney General** maintains control of the settlement fund and provisions for reimbursing other state agencies for related costs were reviewed. Concerns were raised about minimizing the fund's depletion and ensuring transparency in expenditures.

8. **Sunset Provision**:
   - The committee discussed adding a **sunset provision** to the bill to ensure the law would expire after fulfilling its purpose, with a tentative date of June 2032.

### **HB 103: Oral Health for Medicaid Beneficiaries**
1. **Amendments and Funding**:
   - The committee discussed amendments to HB 103, which addresses dental care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Key changes included incorporating a **$1,500 annual cap**, using **Centene settlement funds**, and emphasizing **personal responsibility** for oral health.
   - The committee also debated **co-pays for patients** and eligibility criteria, aiming to align the bill with **Senate Bill 422 (SB 422)**.

2. **Patient Education and Strategy**:
   - Amendments added language emphasizing **personal responsibility** in oral health strategies and incorporating **patient education** into the state's requirements. No objections were raised, and the committee voted unanimously (6-0) to accept the amendments.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing fairness for victims, fiscal responsibility, and legal considerations in both HB 1677 and HB 103. The committee conducted multiple **straw votes** to gauge preferences on key issues and planned to reconvene on **March 3rd** to finalize amendments and address outstanding concerns, particularly those raised by the Victims' Council. The goal was to ensure the legislation effectively addressed the needs of victims and Medicaid beneficiaries while maintaining transparency, efficiency, and accountability.
