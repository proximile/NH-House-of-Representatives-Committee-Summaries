**Summary of New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (March 3, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 3, 2022, focused on legislative matters related to **HB 1677** and a bill addressing claims of abuse at the **Youth Development Center (YDC)**. The discussions highlighted procedural steps, debates on financial and legal implications, and efforts to balance fairness, transparency, and efficiency in addressing historical claims. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **1. Vote on OTPA and Procedural Steps**  
- The committee approved an **OTPA (likely a bill or motion)** with a **12-1 vote**, after initially noting a 13-1 vote.  
- Responsibilities were assigned for writing **blurbs (summaries)** of the bill, with one representative volunteering to write the positive side and considering a **minority report** if they voted no in the full committee.  
- A representative expressed concerns about specific sections of the bill but indicated they were not opposed to it overall. They suggested they might vote no in the full committee and write a report if they did.  
- The bill was referred to the **full Finance Committee** for further discussion the following Tuesday.  
- The chair expressed optimism about the bill but acknowledged its true impact would only be clear after a few years. The meeting concluded with the **adjournment of HB 1677**.

### **2. Youth Development Center (YDC) Claims and Settlement Fund**  
The committee engaged in a detailed discussion about a bill addressing the administration and funding of claims related to abuse at the YDC. Key points included:  

#### **Caseload and Settlement Process**  
- The **Attorney General’s team** is handling a heavy caseload, with the settlement process described as **experimental** and designed to resolve hundreds of cases efficiently.  
- Some claimants are willing to settle for less, but others may pursue litigation, which could take years to resolve.  
- The process is **data-driven**, though estimating costs and attorney time is challenging due to the case-by-case nature of the claims.  

#### **Funding Controversy**  
- A significant debate centered on whether to fund the **$100 million settlement** from the state’s **Rainy Day Fund**.  
- Concerns were raised about the potential impact on the state’s **bond rating** and financial stability, especially given the unprecedented influx of federal funds (ARPA and CARES Act).  
- Some representatives argued for using **surplus revenue** instead of the Rainy Day Fund.  

#### **Right-to-Know Law and Sunset Provision**  
- Amendments to the **Right-to-Know Law (RSA 91-A)** were debated, particularly regarding the release of records related to YDC claims.  
- The committee discussed whether to include a **sunset provision** that would repeal the law after the fund is no longer needed (by June 30, 2032). Some argued for removing the sunset provision to ensure future transparency.  

#### **Final Amendments and Vote**  
- The committee agreed to strike the word **"single"** from the bill and removed the sunset provision.  
- A **roll call vote** was taken, and the amended bill was passed.

### **3. Legislative Amendments and Definitions in HB 1677**  
The committee reviewed amendments to **HB 1677**, focusing on language related to abuse claims. Key discussions included:  

#### **Definitions of Abuse**  
- Significant debate centered on the definitions of **physical abuse** and **sexual abuse**, particularly whether a **single incident** is sufficient to initiate a claim.  
- The Attorney General clarified that the definition of "claim" allows for **one or more incidents** to be covered under a single claim, alleviating concerns about multiple filings.  

#### **Caps on Compensation**  
- The committee discussed caps on compensation: **$1.5 million** for claims involving both sexual and physical abuse, and **$150,000** for physical abuse-only claims.  
- Concerns were raised that these caps might discourage some claimants from participating in the settlement process, opting instead to pursue litigation.  

#### **Solitary Confinement**  
- A contentious issue arose regarding whether **solitary confinement** should be included as a standalone claim category.  
- A **straw vote** resulted in **5 in favor** and **8 opposed**, so solitary confinement was not added as a separate category.  

#### **Administrator Appointment and Process**  
- The committee reviewed the process for appointing an **administrator** to oversee claims, including provisions for **mediation** if disputes arise.  
- The Attorney General emphasized the importance of a **trauma-informed process** and the challenges of verifying emotional abuse claims.  

#### **Cost of Litigation vs. Settlement**  
- A representative inquired about the cost of **litigating abuse cases** versus the proposed settlement process.  
- The Attorney General acknowledged that litigation is resource-intensive but noted that the settlement process aims to provide a quicker, more efficient resolution.  

#### **Timeline and Deadlines**  
- Concerns were raised about the timeline for appointing an administrator and finalizing guidelines.  
- The committee agreed that the **November 1 deadline** for publishing notice provides a de facto timeline for these tasks.  

#### **Final Decisions**  
- The committee moved through the remaining pages of the amendment, addressing minor language changes and ensuring alignment with previous straw votes.
