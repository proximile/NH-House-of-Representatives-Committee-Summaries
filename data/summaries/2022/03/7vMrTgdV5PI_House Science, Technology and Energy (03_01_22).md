**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (March 1, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee met on March 1, 2022, to discuss and vote on several bills related to energy policy, environmental regulation, and municipal processes. The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing renewable energy promotion, consumer protection, and economic impacts. Here are the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Energy Policy and Net Metering**
1. **HB 1599**: Aimed at preventing double payments to renewable energy producers by excluding the cost of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from default service rates. Passed 13-9, despite concerns that it was premature pending a study on Distributed Energy Resources (DER) due in the spring.

2. **HB 1628**: Directed the Department of Energy to report on a microgrid project. The bill was indefinitely postponed (ITL) with a vote of 19-3.

3. **HB 1635**: Recommended for interim study (18-4), as its issues were expected to be addressed by the upcoming DER study.

4. **HB 1645**: Focused on ending REC sweeping, a practice where renewable energy attributes are taken from customer generators without compensation. Representative Oxenham argued this practice is unconstitutional and constitutes a taking of property. The bill sought to protect producers’ rights and ensure fair compensation. Despite strong arguments, the bill was voted ITL (12-10).

5. **HB 1629**: Addressed net metering and the valuation of DERs. The debate centered on whether net metering customers should be compensated for costs they do not incur, such as risk premiums, and the intrinsic value of DERs like load reduction and environmental benefits. The bill was voted down (12-10), with concerns about its impact on renewable energy adoption and market stability.

6. **HB 1596**: Proposed expanding net metering from 1 MW to 5 MW. Opponents argued it could lead to socially regressive cost transfers, while supporters emphasized its role in renewable energy growth and grid stability. The bill was voted ITL (13-9).

### **Environmental Regulation**
1. **HB 1546**: Addressed the regulation of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), chemicals linked to health risks. Amended to require the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to review studies and potentially add PFAS to the list of regulated toxic air pollutants. Passed unanimously (22-0).

---

### **Municipal and Infrastructure Processes**
1. **HB 1491**: Focused on improving communication between transmission companies and municipalities regarding pipelines. Amended to replace "shall" with "may," making the language less mandatory and more flexible. Passed unanimously (22-0).

2. **HB 1258**: Clarified roles between the Department of Energy and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), adjusted timelines for rule reviews, and streamlined adjudicative proceedings. Passed unanimously (22-0) but was not placed on the consent calendar due to the complexity of its amendment.

3. **HB 1611**: Voted ITL (21-1) as there was no immediate need for the bill, and broader discussions on the Site Evaluation Committee were ongoing.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **REC Sweeping and Net Metering**: The committee grappled with the fairness and constitutionality of REC sweeping, ultimately rejecting HB 1645. Discussions on net metering highlighted tensions between promoting renewable energy and ensuring fair compensation for ratepayers.
  
- **Environmental Protection**: The unanimous passage of HB 1546 underscored the committee’s commitment to regulating harmful substances like PFAS.

- **Municipal Processes**: Bills like HB 1491 and HB 1258 focused on streamlining communication and regulatory processes, emphasizing clarity and efficiency.

- **Bipartisanship and Procedural Rigor**: The committee demonstrated a commitment to bipartisan decision-making and careful consideration of amendments, as seen in the detailed discussions and unanimous votes on several bills.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected the committee’s dedication to addressing complex energy and environmental issues while balancing economic and regulatory considerations. The debates and outcomes underscored the importance of ongoing studies, careful policy design, and the need to protect both consumer rights and environmental health.
