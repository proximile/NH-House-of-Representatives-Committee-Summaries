**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (March 7, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on March 7, 2022, to address a range of topics, including forestry, utility management, solar panel recycling, and vegetation management. The meeting began with a moment of silence for those who died in Ukraine and the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by procedural updates and discussions on key bills and initiatives.

### Forestry and Tree Management
The first segment focused on forestry and tree identification, highlighting the importance of proper tree selection and placement, particularly near power lines. Key points included:
- **Tree Identification**: Distinguishing between spruce, fir, and hemlock trees based on cone and needle characteristics.
- **Pandemic Impact**: Increased interest in gardening during the COVID-19 pandemic led to shortages of landscape materials.
- **Oak Trees and Mast Years**: Oak trees retain leaves (marcescence) and experience mast years, producing abundant acorns to ensure regeneration.
- **Utility Arboretums**: Efforts to create arboretums with trees that grow to manageable heights (around 30 feet) near power lines to reduce maintenance and prevent outages.
- **Invasive Species**: Challenges posed by invasive species like Oriental bittersweet, which can cause power outages.
- **Climate Change Adaptation**: Experimenting with non-native tree species, such as crepe myrtle and Chinese fringe tree, to assess their adaptability to New Hampshire’s climate.
- **Educational Outreach**: Promoting public education on proper tree selection and placement, with resources like the "30 Under 30" poster listing suitable trees for planting near power lines.

### Solar Panel Recycling and House Bill 1469
The second segment centered on **House Bill 1469**, which addresses the recycling of photovoltaic (solar) panels. Key discussions included:
- **Responsibility for Recycling**: Amendments shifted responsibility from manufacturers to retailers and finally to installers, who would finance the take-back and recycling system without cost to the end-user.
- **Cost Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the financial burden on installers and the potential disincentive for solar adoption.
- **Timing and Urgency**: Debate over whether the bill was premature or visionary, given the industry’s growth and the underdeveloped recycling infrastructure.
- **Regional Solutions**: Suggestions to explore regional recycling facilities for increased efficiency.
- **State Policy Alignment**: Some argued the bill contradicted New Hampshire’s renewable energy incentives, while others saw it as essential for addressing future waste issues.
The committee adopted **Amendment 0940h**, clarifying the installer’s responsibility, and passed the amended bill with a vote of 11-7.

### Eversource’s Vegetation Management Program
In the final segment, **Bob Allen**, Manager of Vegetation Management at Eversource, presented an overview of the company’s program. Key highlights included:
- **Program Scope**: Eversource manages vegetation across 13,220 square miles, covering 40,000 miles of overhead lines in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. The program operates on a 4-5 year cycle, trimming 10,000 miles annually and maintaining 7 million trees per cycle.
- **Challenges and Goals**: Tree-related outages account for 45% of distribution outages and 90% of storm outages. Improved infrastructure and aggressive tree programs have reduced outage durations.
- **Tree Removal and Maintenance**: Over 50,000 trees are removed annually, focusing on hazard and risk trees. Eversource does not use herbicides in New Hampshire, relying on mechanical methods.
- **Customer and Municipal Relations**: Eversource contacts over 300,000 customers annually, with less than 1% refusing work. New Hampshire’s opt-out notification law allows property owners 45 days to consult before work begins.
- **Emerald Ash Borer and Tree Health**: The emerald ash borer and other pests, like the spongy moth, have significantly impacted tree health in the region.
- **Replanting and Education**: Eversource provides guidance on suitable native species for replanting but does not have a one-for-one replacement program.
- **Safety and Training**: Annual safety summits with contractors improve safety practices and professionalism.
- **Community Outreach**: Mailers and consultations inform customers about vegetation work, promoting awareness of trees’ environmental benefits.

### Conclusion
The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of members’ contributions and plans for future committee meetings, including a field trip to the Seabrook Station nuclear power plant. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing environmental sustainability, utility management, and public education in New Hampshire’s approach to forestry, renewable energy, and vegetation management.
