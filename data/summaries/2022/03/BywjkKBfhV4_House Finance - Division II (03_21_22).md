#### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

1. **Disaster Relief and Infrastructure Funding**  
   - **Disaster Recovery Challenges**: Representatives discussed the difficulties small towns face in funding disaster recovery, particularly road repairs, due to limitations in FEMA rules. The **Exceptional Disaster Relief Loan** program, established in 2017-2018 and requiring a presidential disaster declaration, was highlighted. Updates on the **omnibus spending bill** noted a shift to a 90-10 cost-share split for disaster relief, reducing the burden on applicants.  
   - **Parking Garage Project**: A significant debate centered on funding for a $35 million parking garage project. Some representatives questioned the use of general revenue and suggested redirecting funds from a proposed $40 million rebate program to cover the costs.  
   - **Natural Disaster Assistance**: Representative John Ahern emphasized the need for a statutory mechanism to provide immediate financial assistance to towns affected by natural disasters, citing challenges faced by towns like Acworth and Langdon.

2. **Rebate Program and Housing Crisis**  
   - **Vehicle Registration Rebate**: The committee debated a proposed **$25 vehicle registration rebate**, with some members criticizing it as inequitable and "gimmicky" (e.g., truckers receiving the same amount as motorcycle owners). A motion was made to remove the rebate section from the bill and focus on the parking garage project.  
   - **Housing Initiative**: Representative Heath proposed reallocating the $40 million rebate funds to address the state’s housing crisis, combining it with the governor’s $100 million housing initiative to create a $140 million fund for statewide housing improvements.  

3. **Education Programs and Funding**  
   - **Medicaid Direct Certification Program**: Jessica Goran from New Hampshire Hunger Solutions advocated for the Medicaid Direct Certification program, which would automatically certify children receiving Medicaid for free or reduced-price school meals. The program aims to reduce administrative burdens, improve access to meals, and enhance academic performance. Mark Manganiello noted the program could increase state adequacy grants by up to $60 million, though the impact would not be realized until fiscal year 2025.  
   - **Education Freedom Account (EFA) Administrator**: An amendment was passed to fund an EFA administrator position starting July 2022 and incorporate the Medicaid Direct Certification program.  
   - **Regional Career and Technical Education Agreements (RCTEAs)**: Representative Rick Ladd introduced **HB 1661**, which aims to align calendars between sending and receiving districts for career and technical education (CTE) programs, reducing missed instructional days and improving student participation.  

4. **Unified Co-Curricular Activities (HB 1624)**  
   - **Purpose and Scope**: **House Bill 1624** proposes a $50,000 annual grant program under the Department of Education to support **unified co-curricular activities** for students with disabilities, including sports, theater, and other programs that integrate students with disabilities and their neurotypical peers. The funds would cover startup costs like equipment and uniforms but not ongoing operational expenses.  
   - **Grants and Equity**: Schools could apply for grants of up to $4,000 per program, with unused funds reallocated to schools with existing programs. Discussions emphasized equitable access for smaller or financially challenged districts.  
   - **Rule-Making and Implementation**: The Department of Education would manage the program, with rules established by **September 1, 2022**, to allow sufficient time for rule-making.  

5. **Philosophical Differences and Government Spending**  
   - The meeting highlighted philosophical disagreements about the role of government, with some members advocating for returning money to taxpayers (e.g., through rebates) and others emphasizing the need to address pressing issues like infrastructure, housing, and education.  

6. **Other Bills and Amendments**  
   - **Police Standards and Training Council**: An amendment reduced the appropriation for the Police Standards and Training Council from $350,000 to $175,000 for fiscal year 2023.  
   - **Co-Curricular Program Grants**: The committee voted on **HB 1624**, which limits grants for co-curricular programs to $4,000 per program and adjusts the effective date to September 1, 2022. The bill passed unanimously.
