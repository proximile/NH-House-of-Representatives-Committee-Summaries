**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 21, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 21, 2022, featured extensive discussions on a range of bills and amendments, reflecting both practical decision-making and philosophical debates. Key topics included disaster relief funding, education initiatives, infrastructure projects, and social inclusion programs. Here’s a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **1. Disaster Relief and Funding**
Legislators discussed the challenges of providing timely financial support to communities affected by natural disasters. Concerns were raised about the current system, which requires towns to pay 25% of damage costs before receiving FEMA reimbursement—a burden many cannot afford. Proposals included creating a statutory mechanism for faster access to relief funds and leveraging the state’s Exceptional Disaster Relief Loan program. Additionally, the recent federal omnibus spending bill’s 90-10 cost-sharing adjustment was noted as a positive step to reduce the financial burden on applicants.

### **2. Education Initiatives**
Several education-related bills were debated, with a focus on improving access and equity:
- **Medicaid Direct Certification for School Meals**: Jessica Goran of New Hampshire Hunger Solutions advocated for automatically certifying eligible children for free and reduced school meals using Medicaid data. This program, already successful in other states, reduces administrative burdens and enhances students’ academic performance, attendance, and health.
- **Regional Career and Technical Education (CTE) Agreements**: HB 1661, introduced by Representative Rick Ladd, seeks to align school calendars between sending districts and CTE centers to minimize missed instructional time and boost participation in CTE programs, which are currently underutilized in New Hampshire.
- **Unified Co-Curricular Activities (HB 1624)**: This bill, introduced by Representative Tim Lang, proposes a $50,000 annual grant program to support unified activities (e.g., sports, theater) that integrate students with and without disabilities. The program focuses on startup costs like equipment and aims to promote inclusion and social development. Amendments included capping individual grants at $4,000 and adjusting the effective date to September 1, 2022, to allow for rulemaking.

### **3. Infrastructure and Funding Debates**
Legislators engaged in heated discussions about funding priorities, particularly for a parking garage project and a proposed $40 million rebate program:
- **Parking Garage Funding**: Questions were raised about the source of funds and the overall cost of the project. Some members suggested reallocating funds from the rebate program to support the garage.
- **Rebate Program Debate**: The $40 million rebate program, which would provide $25 refunds to vehicle registrants, faced significant criticism. Opponents called it “gimmicky” and questioned its fairness, administrative burden, and limited individual impact. Suggestions were made to redirect the funds to more pressing needs like housing or infrastructure.

### **4. Other Key Bills and Amendments**
- **HB 1661**: Amended to remove the rebate program and focus solely on parking garage funding.
- **HB 1627**: Passed an amendment to include funding for an Education Freedom Account administrator and the Medicaid direct certification program (5-1 vote).
- **HB 1682**: Amended to reduce the appropriation for the Police Standards and Training Council from $350,000 to $175,000 for hiring a staff attorney and two investigators.

### **5. Philosophical and Procedural Matters**
The meeting highlighted philosophical differences among legislators regarding the role of government. Some advocated for returning funds to taxpayers, while others emphasized addressing systemic issues like housing, infrastructure, and education. Procedural matters, such as drafting amendments, aligning effective dates with fiscal years, and assigning responsibilities for bill summaries, were also addressed.

### **6. Broader Themes and Next Steps**
The discussions underscored a commitment to balancing immediate needs with long-term state priorities. Key themes included:
- **Inclusion and Social Development**: Bills like HB 1624 received broad support for fostering social integration and positive human experiences among students.
- **Equity and Access**: Efforts to streamline programs like Medicaid direct certification and expand CTE opportunities aimed to reduce barriers for underserved populations.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Debates over funding allocations reflected a focus on maximizing resources and ensuring taxpayer dollars address the most critical needs.

The meeting concluded with a recess, with plans to reconvene later in the afternoon for further discussions and amendments.
