**Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division Meeting - March 14, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division convened on March 14, 2022, to discuss several key bills addressing professional certification, law enforcement practices, child support calculations, and state employee benefits. The meeting highlighted a balance between policy goals, fiscal responsibility, and operational feasibility, with extensive discussions and proposed amendments across the following topics:

---

### **House Bill 1552: Board for Certification of Assessors**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes transferring oversight of assessor certification from the **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA)** to the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** to address transparency and confidentiality concerns in disciplinary processes.
- **Key Points**:
  - Assessors are dissatisfied with the DRAâ€™s confidentiality statutes, which shield disciplinary records. The bill aims to make these records public.
  - The board would be self-funded, with a proposed certification fee of $155 every two years. Concerns were raised about additional costs for assessors, including fines and continuing education.
  - The bill lacks a clear appeals process for fines, potentially forcing assessors into costly superior court proceedings.
  - While some representatives opposed moving oversight from the DRA, citing its expertise in property tax assessments, others supported the bill for its transparency improvements.
  - The policy committee unanimously approved the bill (18-0), and the Finance Division voted **5-2 in favor of recommending the bill to pass (OTP)**.

### **House Bill 1540: Recording of Custodial Interrogations**
- **Purpose**: Requires police departments to record custodial interrogations (audio or video) to prevent false confessions and wrongful convictions.
- **Key Points**:
  - Recordings are mandatory for interrogations in jails, police stations, or detention facilities but exclude roadside interrogations after traffic stops.
  - Most departments already have recording capabilities, and small departments can use devices like smartphones, minimizing financial burdens.
  - Unrecorded statements may be inadmissible unless there is a valid reason for the lack of recording, such as technical failures or impracticality.
  - The bill protects both law enforcement and suspects, reduces litigation over Miranda rights, and aligns with practices in 30 other states.
  - Proposed amendments included allowing judges to consider financial constraints and clarifying that recordings can be audio or video.

### **House Bill 1647: Calculation of Child Support**
- **Purpose**: Proposes changes to child support calculations, including increasing the self-support reserve from 120% to 150% of the poverty level.
- **Key Points**:
  - Higher self-support reserves could lead to more minimum child support orders, potentially increasing reliance on public assistance.
  - The changes may complicate child support cases, increasing judicial workload and processing times.
  - The financial impact on the state is unclear, but delays could result in additional costs.
  - Technical adjustments were discussed to prevent parties from seeking court modifications solely due to the law change.

### **House Bill 1587: Retirement Benefits Amendment**
- **Purpose**: Addresses recruitment and retention issues in public safety roles (firefighters, police, corrections) by adjusting retirement benefits.
- **Key Points**:
  - Staffing shortages in public safety were attributed to 2011 changes that reduced benefits and increased employee contributions.
  - An amendment reduced the funding from $56 million to $28 million, passing with a 4-3 vote.
  - The work session was recessed until Friday, March 18, for further discussion.

### **House Bill 1535: Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA)**
- **Purpose**: Initially proposed a recurring COLA for all retirees but was amended to a one-time COLA for retirees who had been retired for at least five years as of July 1, 2017.
- **Key Points**:
  - The amendment proposed a 1.5% COLA on the first $30,000 of retirement income, benefiting approximately 23,500 retirees.
  - Concerns were raised about excluding retirees earning over $30,000, with suggestions to apply the COLA to the first $30,000 for all retirees.
  - A proposed amendment aimed to limit the COLA to the current biennium with an $8 million cap, but further adjustments were needed to align with fiscal constraints.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**
1. **Transparency and Fairness**: Discussions emphasized the need for transparency in professional certification and fairness in retirement benefits, particularly for lower-income retirees.
2. **Fiscal Responsibility**: The committee balanced policy goals with fiscal constraints, proposing amendments to limit costs while addressing immediate needs.
3. **Operational Feasibility**: Practical concerns, such as judicial workload and police department capabilities, were central to discussions on child support and interrogation recording bills.
4. **Collaborative Approach**: Stakeholder input from law enforcement, legal experts, and state agencies informed the discussions, highlighting practical solutions and potential challenges.

The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on Friday, March 18, focusing on refining amendments and ensuring equitable outcomes across all bills.
