**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting – House Finance, Division I (March 14, 2022)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on March 14, 2022, covered several key bills addressing assessor certification, retirement benefits, cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), custodial interrogation recordings, and child support calculations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. House Bill 1552: Board for Certification of Assessors**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes transitioning the certification and oversight of assessors from the **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA)** to the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**. This aims to address confidentiality concerns in the DRA’s discipline process and improve transparency.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Assessors have expressed dissatisfaction with the current process, and the bill seeks to make certification records public, similar to real estate licenses.
  - **Costs**: The bill is designed to be self-funded, with a proposed certification fee of $155 every two years. However, concerns were raised about administrative and travel costs for the new board.
  - **Discipline**: The bill introduces fines for violations but lacks an appeals process, requiring individuals to go to superior court.
  - **Support and Opposition**: The policy committee unanimously supported the bill (18-0), citing improvements to the certification process. Some representatives, like **Rep. Griffin**, opposed it, arguing it should originate from the executive branch.
  - **Outcome**: The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill failed (2-5), and the bill passed (5-2), moving forward as **ought to pass (OTP)**.

### **2. House Bill 1587: Retirement Benefits for Public Employees**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to restore retirement benefits for public employees, including firefighters, police officers, and corrections officers, who were adversely affected by retroactive changes in 2011.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Amendment**: Due to budget constraints, an amendment reduced the funding from $56 million to $28 million, passing 4-3.
  - **Testimony**: Representatives and stakeholders, including **Rep. Steve Pearson**, **Arthur Beaudry** (Retired Fire Captain), and **Brian Rill** (Professional Firefighters of NH), highlighted the recruitment and retention crisis in public safety roles, exacerbated by inadequate retirement benefits.
  - **Outcome**: The work session was recessed until Friday, March 18, to allow leadership to assess available funds.

### **3. House Bill 1535: Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes a 1.5% COLA for retirees who have been retired for at least five years and were employed before July 1, 2017, applying to the first $30,000 of retirement income.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Amendment**: An amendment limited the COLA to the current biennium, reducing the estimated cost from $79 million to $6.6 million.
  - **Testimony**: **Karen Irwin** advocated for a special fund to pre-fund COLAs, while **Arthur Beaudry** expressed concerns about excluding retirees earning over $30,000.
  - **Discussion**: The committee debated whether to apply the COLA to all retirees’ first $30,000 of income or limit it to those earning less than $30,000. The amendment was not finalized, and further discussion was scheduled for Friday.

### **4. House Bill 1540: Recording Custodial Interrogations**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires police departments to record custodial interrogations (audio or video) to prevent false confessions and ensure transparency.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Cost Concerns**: Legislators raised concerns about financial burdens on small police departments, though proponents argued most departments already have the necessary equipment (e.g., smartphones).
  - **Flexibility**: The bill includes exceptions for cases where recording is not feasible, with judges determining admissibility based on reasonable explanations.
  - **Amendments**: Proposed amendments aimed to clarify language, ensure flexibility, and address potential financial burdens.
  - **Outcome**: The discussion was tabled for further review on Friday.

### **5. House Bill 1647: Child Support Calculations**
- **Purpose**: The bill increases the self-support reserve threshold from 120% to 150% of the poverty level, potentially raising minimum child support orders.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Financial Impact**: Increased child support orders could lead to more families relying on public assistance, raising state costs.
  - **Judicial Burden**: Concerns were raised about increased court workload and potential delays in case processing.
  - **DHHS Position**: The **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)** did not take a position but highlighted potential administrative challenges.
  - **Outcome**: The discussion was tabled for further review on Friday.

### **Key Themes Across All Bills**
1. **Budget Constraints**: Legislators consistently balanced policy goals with fiscal responsibility, proposing amendments to reduce costs and limit long-term financial commitments.
2. **Public Employee Support**: Bills addressing retirement benefits and COLAs highlighted the recruitment and retention crisis in public safety roles, emphasizing the need for better incentives.
3. **Transparency and Fairness**: Bills like HB 1552 and HB 1540 focused on improving transparency in assessor certification and custodial interrogations, respectively.
4. **Practical Concerns**: Legislators addressed potential financial and administrative burdens, particularly for small police departments and the judicial system.
