The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on March 14, 2022, centered on the legalization and regulation of cannabis, with a focus on both medical and recreational use, revenue implications, and the role of existing medical cannabis providers. The discussions covered several key areas, including licensing, revenue allocation, market structure, and the impact on Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs). Here is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

### **1. Medical vs. Recreational Cannabis:**
- The debate highlighted the distinction between medical and recreational cannabis, particularly concerning the sale of cannabis-infused products (edibles). Some argued that if edibles are restricted for recreational use, they should also be restricted for medical use. Concerns were raised about the viability of ATCs if they are excluded from the recreational market. There was also discussion about recriminalizing possession of edibles for the general population, which could undermine the existing decriminalization framework.

### **2. Licensing and Regulation:**
- The committee considered a dual regulatory structure for cannabis sold in state stores, particularly for medical patients. Proposals included allowing ATCs to cultivate, manufacture, and transport cannabis for recreational sales to ensure their viability. The debate also touched on whether to set specific licensing fees in the bill or leave it to agency rulemaking. Comparisons were made to other states, where fees range from $1,000 to $15,000 depending on the license type. The committee estimated potential revenue from licensing fees, which was seen as modest but still a consideration.

### **3. Revenue Allocation and Funding:**
- Revenue from cannabis sales was a major focus, with proposals to allocate funds for education property tax relief, the New Hampshire Retirement System, and health and human services (HHS) programs, particularly for substance use disorder treatment. There was a suggestion to set aside $25 million for HHS, with strong language to prevent diversion of these funds. The committee debated whether to use fixed dollar amounts or percentage-based allocations to avoid consuming all revenue. The fiscal note estimated a $14 million upfront cost for opening cannabis stores, with suggestions to use a revolving fund to reinvest initial profits.

### **4. Market Structure and Competition:**
- The bill’s state-run retail model was criticized as less competitive compared to neighboring states like Maine and Massachusetts, which have more open, free-market systems. Concerns were raised that the limited number of cultivators and state-controlled retail could fail to capture the illicit market or provide sufficient consumer choice. The committee discussed the potential impact of out-of-state consumers, particularly in southern New Hampshire, which could significantly increase revenue.

### **5. Role of Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs):**
- The viability of New Hampshire’s existing ATCs was a recurring concern. The state-controlled model could harm ATCs by creating competition without allowing them to transition to for-profit status or expand their operations. Proposals were made to allow ATCs to participate in the adult-use market to ensure their survival. The importance of maintaining a robust medical cannabis market, which offers untaxed products and serves patients under 21, was emphasized.

### **6. Edibles and Cannabis-Infused Products:**
- The committee debated whether to allow edibles in state-run stores or restrict them to medical cardholders. There was concern about the potential revenue loss if edibles were not available to all consumers, as they constitute a significant portion of the market. The impact on existing therapeutic cannabis programs was also considered, with a focus on protecting these programs from harm.

### **7. Banking and Financial Services:**
- The banking language in the bill was considered problematic, and there was a recommendation to remove it. The banking industry indicated they could provide financial services to cannabis-related businesses without state intervention. However, additional language might be needed to provide protections for banks entering this space.

### **8. Implementation and Regulatory Timelines:**
- The committee discussed the tight timelines for adopting rules and regulations for cannabis establishments, suggesting extending deadlines to ensure proper rule-making and avoid delays in revenue generation. Clear licensing and registration processes for cultivation, manufacturing, and testing facilities were emphasized, with a focus on aligning rules with legislative intent.

### **9. Broader Concerns and Compromise:**
- The committee acknowledged the political challenges of cannabis legalization and the need for compromise to achieve incremental progress. The unprecedented state-controlled model was seen as risky and untested, with potential negative impacts on revenue, consumer choice, and the illicit market. The importance of balancing revenue generation with public health and safety was emphasized.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of implementing cannabis legalization in New Hampshire, with ongoing debates about regulation, revenue allocation, and the role of existing medical cannabis providers. The committee aimed to finalize the bill in the coming weeks, with further discussions planned to address remaining concerns and ensure a balanced approach that supports both revenue generation and public health.
