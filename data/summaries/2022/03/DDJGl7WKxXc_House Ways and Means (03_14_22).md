**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on March 14, 2022**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee meeting on March 14, 2022, centered on the legalization and regulation of adult-use cannabis, with a particular focus on revenue generation, market structure, and regulatory frameworks. The discussions revolved around several key bills, including **HB 1598**, **HB 237**, and **HB 41**, and addressed a wide range of issues from licensing and fee structures to revenue allocation and market competition. Here are the key themes and takeaways from the meeting:

### **1. Revenue Generation and Taxation**
The Ways and Means Committee’s primary focus was on the potential revenue implications of cannabis legalization. Key points included:
- **Revenue Projections**: Estimates ranged from $25 million to $50 million annually, though the exclusion of edibles and cartridges—which account for 15-50% of the market in other states—could significantly reduce these figures.
- **Revenue Allocation**: Proposals included repaying taxpayers for startup costs, funding education property tax relief, contributing to the New Hampshire Retirement System, and supporting health and human services (HHS) programs. A revolving fund was suggested to reinvest profits into opening additional state-run cannabis stores.
- **Taxation vs. Regulation**: The committee emphasized revenue generation over broader policy issues, acknowledging the need for compromise to ensure the bill’s passage.

### **2. Market Structure and Competition**
The committee debated the proposed state-controlled model for adult-use cannabis, with the Liquor Commission overseeing retail sales. Key discussions included:
- **State-Run Stores vs. Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs)**: Concerns were raised about competition between state-run stores and ATCs, which currently serve the medical cannabis market. ATCs argued that allowing them to participate in the adult-use market would sustain their operations and continue serving medical patients.
- **Cultivation Limits**: The bill proposed limiting the number of cultivators to 15, with some members suggesting a conservative initial limit and adjusting it later based on market demand. Comparisons were made to neighboring states like Massachusetts and Maine, which have more diverse, free-market systems.
- **Out-of-State Consumers**: The potential impact of out-of-state consumers, particularly in southern New Hampshire, was considered, as they could drive significant sales.

### **3. Licensing and Fee Structures**
The absence of a fee schedule in the bill sparked debate:
- **Registration vs. Licensure**: Confusion arose over the distinction between registration (initial application) and licensure (meeting regulatory requirements).
- **Fee Flexibility**: Members discussed whether to set fixed fees in statute or allow agencies to determine fees through rulemaking, with a preference for the latter to ensure adaptability.
- **Revenue from Licensing**: Licensing fees were estimated to generate around $165,000 annually, which was seen as a minor contribution to the overall budget.

### **4. Regulatory and Implementation Challenges**
The committee addressed several regulatory and operational hurdles:
- **Dual Regulatory Structure**: Concerns were raised about the potential complexity of a dual regulatory system if state stores sold both medical and recreational cannabis. Some suggested removing medical cannabis sales from state stores to simplify the structure.
- **Implementation Timeline**: Estimates suggested it could take up to two years to fully implement the program, with a phased approach proposed to manage startup costs.
- **Tracking and Monitoring**: The need for a tracking system to monitor cannabis products was discussed, though New Hampshire’s limited market has not yet required one.

### **5. Medical vs. Adult-Use Markets**
The viability of the medical cannabis market under the proposed model was a recurring concern:
- **Edibles and Product Restrictions**: There was debate over whether to allow edibles and other cannabis-infused products for the general population. Restricting these products could negatively impact retailers and state revenue, while also undermining the medical market.
- **Patient Access**: The importance of maintaining a viable medical market for patients under 21 and those requiring higher-potency products was emphasized. Concerns were raised that the adult-use market could attract medical patients, potentially destabilizing the medical cannabis industry.

### **6. Public Opinion and Political Considerations**
The committee acknowledged strong public support for legalization but recognized that political factors could influence the final outcome. Balancing revenue generation, public health, and regulatory oversight was seen as critical to passing a workable bill.

### **7. Banking and Financial Concerns**
The banking language in the bill was scrutinized, with recommendations to remove it entirely. Representatives from the New Hampshire Bankers Association suggested adding language to provide additional protections for banks entering the cannabis market.

### **8. Future Adjustments and Flexibility**
The committee agreed that while compromises were necessary to pass the current bill, future adjustments could address any shortcomings. Flexibility in regulatory frameworks, fee structures, and market dynamics was emphasized to ensure the industry’s long-term success.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of legalizing and regulating adult-use cannabis in New Hampshire. Balancing revenue generation, regulatory oversight, market viability, and public health concerns requires careful consideration and compromise. The committee’s discussions underscored the need for a flexible, phased approach to implementation, with ongoing adjustments to address emerging challenges and ensure the program’s success.
