The New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee convened on March 9, 2022, to discuss and vote on a series of election-related bills and amendments. The meeting addressed a wide range of topics, including election integrity, accountability, procedural improvements, and systemic challenges in election administration. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

### **Key Themes and Discussions**
1. **Election Integrity and Accountability**:
   - Representatives expressed frustration with repeated instances of election officials failing to perform their duties correctly, such as mishandling ballots or using unauthorized equipment. These issues were seen as undermining voter confidence and the integrity of the electoral process.
   - Proposals were made to impose civil remedies, such as fines on municipalities for election officials' negligence or failure to follow the law, to incentivize better compliance and attention to election procedures.
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of accountability for elected officials and insufficient support from state offices like the Secretary of State and Attorney General.

2. **Systemic Issues**:
   - Systemic issues in election administration were highlighted, including low voter turnout in local elections and the need for greater oversight and enforcement of election laws.
   - Representatives debated the practicality and fairness of various election procedures, such as provisional ballots, hand-counting ballots, and the use of electronic devices for counting votes.

3. **Legislative Process and Committee Dynamics**:
   - The meeting included a young visitor, Jack, who asked questions about the legislative process, such as what happens in tie votes and how committees function. Representatives explained how bills move through the House and Senate and the role of committees of conference.
   - Discussions also touched on the challenges of substituting members on committees and the importance of maintaining decorum and efficiency during debates.

### **Key Bills and Amendments**
1. **Procedural Improvements**:
   - **Bill 1457**: An amendment (967) was adopted (20-0) to change the storage of ballot boxes to containers with a log maintained by clerks. The bill, as amended, was recommended **ought to pass** (20-0).
   - **Bill 1467**: An amendment (257) removed provisions allowing candidates to select offices for recounts and instead required recounts of upper ballot races during state rep recounts. The amendment passed (20-0), and the bill was recommended **ought to pass** (20-0).
   - **Bill 1527**: An amendment (022h) was adopted (20-0) to codify the submission of vote count tapes to the secretary of state. The bill, as amended, was recommended **ought to pass** (20-0).

2. **Election Integrity and Audits**:
   - **Bill 1473**: Sent to **interim study** (20-0) for further review, as it proposed a forensic audit of the 2020 election in Merrimack County.
   - **HB 1064**: This bill sought to require hand-marked durable paper ballots and prohibit electronic devices for counting ballots. The committee voted 20-0 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

3. **Voter Registration and Ballot Handling**:

4. **Bills Recommended as Inexpedient to Legislate**:
   - **Bill 1383**: Recommended **inexpedient to legislate** (20-0) due to vendor issues with generating reports in time for fall elections.
   - **Bill 1470**: Recommended **inexpedient to legislate** (20-0) because overvotes do not register on machines, making the bill ineffective.
   - **Bill 1485**: Recommended **inexpedient to legislate** (20-0) due to concerns about provisional ballots and administrative burdens.
   - **Bill 1522**: Recommended **inexpedient to legislate** (20-0) due to concerns about the decentralization of ballot printing and the impracticality of embedded security technology.
   - **Bill 1542**: Recommended **inexpedient to legislate** (20-0) due to concerns about provisional ballots and delays in election results.
   - **Bill 1543**: Recommended **inexpedient to legislate** (20-0) because it referenced outdated statutes and included provisional balloting, which is unconstitutional in NH.

5. **Constitutional Amendment**:
   - **CACR 15**: A constitutional amendment related to elections. The committee voted 11-9 to adopt an amendment (0735) and then passed the bill as amended with the same vote. The amendment aimed to address voter integrity concerns, though some members argued it created confusion.

### **Outcomes and Recommendations**
- The committee voted on several amendments and bills, with mixed results. For example, one amendment passed 15-5, while another bill passed 12-8. A bill related to partial audits of ballots involved in recounts passed unanimously (20-0).
- Several bills were recommended for the consent calendar without objection, streamlining their progress through the legislative process.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting focused on improving election procedures, enforcing accountability, and addressing systemic issues in election administration. While there was broad support for measures aimed at enhancing election integrity and efficiency, some proposals faced skepticism due to concerns about practicality, fairness, and constitutional issues. The committee aimed to balance election security with the efficiency of election processes, with some members emphasizing local control and others advocating for statewide consistency.
