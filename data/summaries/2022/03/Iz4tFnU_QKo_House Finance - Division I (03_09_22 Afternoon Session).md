The transcript is from a work session of the New Hampshire House Finance Committee, Division I, discussing **House Bill 1417**, which proposes to reinstate state contributions to municipal retirement systems. The bill aims to provide financial relief to municipalities by having the state contribute 7.5% to the retirement system, down from the original 35% that was phased out in previous years. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Background on Retirement System**: Representative Ken Weiler provided historical context, explaining the growth of the retirement system since its inception in 1968 and the financial challenges it has faced, including underfunding due to unrealistic investment return assumptions and spiking issues (e.g., employees inflating salaries with overtime before retirement).

2. **Opposition to the Bill**: Representative Weiler and others expressed concerns about the unpredictability of municipal hiring and pay increases, making it difficult to budget for state contributions. They argued that reinstating contributions would lead to uncontrollable costs and questioned whether the bill would effectively reduce property taxes, as municipalities might use the funds for other purposes.

3. **Support for the Bill**: Representatives like Michael O’Brien (a former firefighter) and Catherine Heck from the New Hampshire Municipal Association argued that the bill would alleviate property tax burdens on municipalities. They highlighted the financial strain on towns and cities due to the state’s lack of contributions and emphasized the bill’s potential to support public safety and other essential services.

4. **Fiscal Concerns**: Some members raised concerns about committing future legislatures to spending, especially given the uncertain economic climate, including inflation and potential recessions.

5. **Motion to ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**: The committee voted 4-2 to recommend killing the bill (ITL), citing concerns about fiscal responsibility and the unpredictability of municipal budgets. However, some members indicated they would support the bill in front of the full Finance Committee or on the House floor.

The session concluded with the decision to forward the bill to the full Finance Committee for further discussion.
