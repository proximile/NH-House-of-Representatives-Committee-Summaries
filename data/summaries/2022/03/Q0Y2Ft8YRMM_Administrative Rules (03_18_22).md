The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 18, 2022, focused on administrative rules and various emergency rule filings. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Postponement of Item 9**: Representative McGuire motioned to postpone an item due to inadequate objection responses, suggesting the department needed more time to address concerns.

2. **Board of Pharmacy Fees**: Discussion centered on conditional approval for the Board of Pharmacy, particularly regarding fees for mail-order pharmacies. The interim rule setting a $2,000 fee was set to expire on March 21, and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) planned to file for a permanent rule on March 22. Delays were attributed to pushback from various licensing boards.

3. **Licensing and Fees**: OPLC faced challenges in setting fees due to disputes over authority and collaboration with 54 different licensing boards. A bill (SB 313) intended to clarify fee-setting authority was amended to create a study committee, delaying resolution.

4. **Nursing Licenses**: An emergency rule was discussed to streamline the reinstatement of nursing licenses by removing the active practice requirement for those who had been out of the workforce for less than five years. This was aimed at addressing healthcare workforce shortages exacerbated by the pandemic.

5. **Police Standards and Training**: An amended conditional approval request for police standards and training was approved without staff comments.

6. **Mental Health Admissions**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) adopted an emergency rule on involuntary emergency admissions to address the stateâ€™s mental health crisis. The rule, prompted by an executive order, aimed to increase access to mental health services. DHHS confirmed they were starting regular rulemaking to prevent the emergency rule from expiring.

The meeting concluded with no further business, and the next meeting was canceled.
