The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 18, 2022, focused on administrative rules, with several key discussions and decisions:

1. **Postponement of Item 9**: Representative McGuire motioned to postpone discussion on Item 9 due to an inadequate objection response, suggesting the department needed more time to address the issue. The motion passed without objections.

2. **Board of Pharmacy Conditional Approval**: The committee discussed a conditional approval request for the Board of Pharmacy, particularly concerning a fee for mail-order pharmacies set at $2,000. The fee was established under an emergency rule expiring on March 21, with no permanent rule filed yet. The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) indicated they would file for a permanent rule on March 22. The committee approved the conditional approval request.

3. **Nursing Licenses Reinstatement**: The committee reviewed an emergency rule aimed at expediting the reinstatement of nursing licenses by limiting active practice requirements to those who have not held a license for at least five years. The Board of Nursing argued this was necessary to address workforce shortages exacerbated by the pandemic. The rule was supported, with the understanding that employers would assess competency for re-entering nurses.

4. **Police Standards and Training**: An amended conditional approval request for Police Standards and Training was approved without discussion.

5. **Involuntary Emergency Admissions**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) adopted an emergency rule on involuntary emergency admissions to designated facilities, following an executive order addressing the mental health crisis. The rule, which includes policies and standards for hospitals, was discussed, and DHHS confirmed they were starting regular rulemaking to ensure the emergency rule does not expire.

The meeting concluded with the adjournment of the session.
