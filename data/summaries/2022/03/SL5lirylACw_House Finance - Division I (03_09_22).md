The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I held a work session on March 9, 2022, to discuss **House Bill 1235** and **House Bill 1535**. Here are the key points:

### **House Bill 1235**:
- **Purpose**: Increases claimant compensation for victims of certain crimes from $40,000 to $50,000, effective July 1, 2024.
- **Discussion**:
  - A representative raised questions about the last time the compensation was increased (1997) and how often the fund is distributed.
  - Concerns were raised about whether the state should be liable for compensating victims of financial crimes like Ponzi schemes.
  - The bill passed with a 4-1 vote, directing any unclaimed funds into the Victims Assistance Fund.

### **House Bill 1535**:
- **Purpose**: Proposes a one-time, permanent **cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)** of 1.5% for New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) retirees, funded upfront by the state.
- **Background**:
  - COLAs were historically granted annually but have been limited since 2010 due to the elimination of a special account that funded them.
  - Retirees, especially those in Group 2 (who do not receive Social Security), face financial challenges due to inflation.
  - The bill would cost $79 million, funded by the state, with no immediate impact on municipalities.
- **Discussion**:
  - Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact and whether municipalities supported the bill.
  - The committee considered a one-time payment instead of a permanent COLA to reduce costs.
  - The work session was recessed until March 14, 2022, for further consideration.

### **Next Steps**:
- The committee will reconvene on March 14 to discuss HB 1535 further and explore a one-time payment option.
