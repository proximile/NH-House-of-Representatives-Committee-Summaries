The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee Division I met on March 9, 2022, to discuss two bills: **House Bill 1235** and **House Bill 1535**.

### **House Bill 1235**
The bill proposes increasing the maximum claimant compensation from $40,000 to $50,000 for victims of certain crimes, with an indeterminate fiscal impact and an effective date of July 1, 2024. The committee voted 4-1 in favor of recommending the bill "Ought to Pass" (OTP). One representative raised concerns about the stateâ€™s liability for compensating victims, particularly in cases of financial fraud, but the chair clarified that the bill only directs unclaimed funds to the Victims Assistance Fund.

### **House Bill 1535**
The bill addresses cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) retirees. A representative from the NHRS retirees, Mr. Beaudry, testified in support, highlighting that retirees have only received one COLA since 2010, a 1.5% increase, while inflation and healthcare costs have risen significantly. He argued that without COLAs, retirees, especially those in Group 2 who do not receive Social Security, face financial hardship and may rely on social services.

The bill proposes a one-time, permanent 1.5% COLA on the first $30,000 of pensions, costing $79 million, to be funded upfront by the state. The committee discussed alternatives, such as a one-time payment rather than a permanent increase, to reduce costs. The NHRS representative, Marty Karlon, provided background on COLA history and explained the actuarial calculations behind the $79 million figure. The committee recessed the discussion until March 14 to explore a one-time payment option.

### Key Points:
1. **HB 1235**: Passed 4-1, increases victim compensation to $50,000.
2. **HB 1535**: Focuses on COLA for retirees, with a $79 million proposal for a permanent increase. Committee considering a one-time payment alternative to reduce costs.
3. Next meeting: March 14 at 10 AM to finalize discussions on HB 1535.
