**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Decorum in the House Chamber/Mock Session (03/03/22)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 3, 2022, focused on **decorum, voting procedures, and logistical preparations** as members returned to the House chamber after holding sessions in alternative venues due to COVID-19. The meeting included both a **refresher on House rules** and a **mock session** designed to familiarize members, particularly new ones, with proper conduct and chamber operations.  

### Key Highlights:  

**1. Decorum and House Rules:**  
- Members were reminded to maintain **professionalism and respect** for the chamber’s traditions, including:  
  - Avoiding disruptions, such as walking in front of the speaker’s podium, crossing the aisle while someone is speaking, or wearing political paraphernalia.  
  - Dressing respectfully (e.g., hats are prohibited for men except for medical reasons).  
  - Silencing cell phones and refraining from eating in the chamber.  
- The **gavel** is used to bring the chamber to order, and members must remain quiet during debates and votes.  
- Several members apologized for past breaches of decorum, such as crossing the well or obstructing the podium, and reflected on the historical significance of the chamber.  

**2. Voting Procedures:**  
- Members were instructed to stay in their seats during votes and wait for the speaker to announce the results.  
- The **voting system** was explained: members activate their stations by pressing a button, turning their seat indicator from black to yellow. Voting is time-limited to 30 seconds, and abstentions are not allowed.  
- Mistakes in voting can be corrected by notifying the clerk, and members were urged to use their voting buttons correctly. The **clicker system** has been replaced with a seating chart for better accountability.  
- Members were reminded to notify the clerk if they need to leave early to have their votes excused.  

**3. Logistical and Technical Preparations:**  
- Members were reminded to sign in for **mileage reimbursement**, use assigned lockers for personal items, and wear **security pins and name tags** for identification.  
- Parking arrangements and **shuttle services** for upcoming sessions were discussed.  
- The chamber tested **camera angles** for streaming to enhance the viewing experience for online audiences.  
- **Evacuation plans** and **parliamentary inquiry forms** were distributed for members’ reference.  

**4. Staff Roles and Housekeeping:**  
- The roles of key staff members (e.g., assistant clerk, bill status clerk, journal clerk) were highlighted.  
- Members were encouraged to prepare remarks for the **journal** in advance to save time.  

**5. Mock Session:**  
- The **mock session** included a **humorous debate** on a fictitious bill (House Bill 9) to study the cream filling in Oreo cookies. Members engaged in a **roll call vote** on the bill, which failed, followed by a vote on whether the bill was "inexpedient to legislate."  
- The session served as a **dry run** for new members, emphasizing proper conduct and the functioning of the chamber’s systems.  

**6. Special Recognitions:**  
- The session included recognition of **guests**, such as historical figures (e.g., Daniel Webster) and **pages**, with applause.  

### Conclusion:  
The meeting served as a comprehensive refresher on House rules, procedures, and decorum, with an emphasis on **professionalism, respect for tradition, and smooth proceedings**. The mock session provided a lighthearted yet practical illustration of the legislative process, ensuring members were prepared for the upcoming session.
