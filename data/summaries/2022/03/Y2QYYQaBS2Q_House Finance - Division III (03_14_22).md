The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division III, convened on March 14, 2022, to discuss several bills, focusing on healthcare, childcare, and Medicaid funding. The meeting highlighted legislative efforts to address public health, fiscal responsibility, and access to essential services. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Healthcare and Abortion Legislation (HB 1609)**
The committee debated **HB 1609**, which proposed restrictions on abortions and introduced reporting requirements for procedures after 24 weeks. Key points included:
- **Exceptions for Fetal Anomalies**: Discussions centered on allowing exceptions for cases where fetal anomalies are incompatible with life, though concerns were raised about the ambiguity of such definitions.
- **Transparency vs. Medical Practice**: Representative Wolf emphasized the need for transparency and data collection on late-term abortions, while others argued against legislating medical decisions.
- **Vote Outcome**: The committee voted 4-3 to recommend **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)** for HB 1609, signaling opposition to the bill.

### **Lead Testing in Children (HB 1622 and HB 1642)**
The committee reviewed two bills aimed at improving lead testing compliance for children entering schools or childcare facilities:
- **HB 1622**: This bill requires schools and childcare centers to verify lead test results on existing health forms, ensuring children are tested for lead exposure. The fiscal impact was deemed neutral, as the bill leverages existing forms and does not impose new costs.
- **HB 1642**: Similar to HB 1622, this bill emphasizes reviewing existing health forms for lead test results. Concerns were raised about potential punitive measures, leading to proposed amendments to clarify that lack of testing cannot deny enrollment or continuation in schools or childcare.
- **Key Focus**: Both bills aim to address low compliance with lead testing, particularly in New Hampshire’s older housing stock, without adding significant burdens.

### **Medicaid and Mental Health Funding**
The committee addressed funding for Medicaid and mental health programs, particularly the "in-and-out" program for individuals with severe mental illness:
- **Funding Suspension**: The Senate had suspended funding for the program, leaving it without financial backing. The House had intended to maintain the program but had not explicitly secured funding.
- **Program Impact**: The program serves approximately 6,073 individuals, including 2,500 with severe mental illness. Discussions focused on the financial burden on community health centers and the need for continuity of care.
- **Federal Matching Funds**: The state receives a 50% federal match for Medicaid expenditures, meaning a $5.37 million state investment would result in $10.7 million in total funding.
- **In-and-Out Medicaid Eligibility (HB 1526)**: This bill sought to lift the suspension on funding for the in-and-out program, which allows low-income individuals to qualify for Medicaid by documenting medical expenses that reduce their income to the eligibility level. The bill also proposed updating the income threshold, which has not been adjusted in 30 years, to better reflect current living costs.

### **Vaccination Exemptions (HB 1604)**
The committee discussed **HB 1604**, which deals with exemptions for healthcare workers regarding vaccinations:
- **Amendment Proposal**: Representative Leah Cushman proposed eliminating the conscientious objector exemption and simplifying the religious exemption process.
- **Concerns**: There was debate over whether the amendment inadvertently removed the medical exemption and how it aligns with federal CMS guidelines. The committee decided to refine the amendment to ensure compliance with federal law and address fiscal impacts.

### **Privacy Impact Assessments (HB 1662)**
The committee reviewed **HB 1662**, which involves privacy impact assessments for IT systems in the Department of Health and Human Services:
- **Fiscal Update**: The fiscal note was updated to reflect lower costs due to a corrected labor grade and federal funding assistance.
- **Amendment**: An amendment clarified that each IT system requires its own privacy impact assessment.

### **Other Bills**
- **HB 1608**: Briefly discussed, this bill was considered for return without further action due to its negligible fiscal impact, though some disagreement arose over cost reductions from amendments.
- **HB 1531**: Deferred due to time constraints.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on balancing legislative intent with practical implications, particularly in healthcare and childcare policies. Discussions highlighted the importance of fiscal responsibility, legal compliance, and the need to address public health issues through legislative updates. The committee planned to finalize amendments and revisit the bills the following week.

Overall, the session reflected efforts to improve access to essential services, ensure public health, and manage the state’s financial challenges responsibly.
