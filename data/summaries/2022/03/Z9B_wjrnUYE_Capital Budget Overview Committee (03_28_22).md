The provided transcript appears to be a brief and unclear snippet from a New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting, specifically the Capital Budget Overview Committee on March 28, 2022. The content is fragmented and lacks substantive information, consisting of casual remarks like "Okay," "Thank you," and "Come here, Chester." There is no meaningful discussion or detail about the committee's proceedings, making it impossible to summarize any specific topic or decision. It seems to capture a moment of informal interaction rather than official business.
