The provided transcript appears to be a brief, informal exchange during a New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting, specifically from the Capital Budget Overview Committee on March 28, 2022. The conversation is fragmented and includes phrases like "Until they turn them off," "We're done," and "Come here, Chester," followed by repeated expressions of gratitude ("Thank you"). There is no substantive discussion or detail about the capital budget or any specific agenda item. The transcript seems to capture a moment of procedural or casual interaction rather than a formal deliberation.
