Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

9. **HB 1647**: The child support reform bill, a focal point of the meeting, was discussed extensively and passed with a 4-3 vote, though concerns about its complexity and fiscal impact were noted.

### **Detailed Discussion on HB 1647**
HB 1647 proposes significant changes to child support calculations, particularly incorporating parenting time into the allocation of funds. Key points from the discussion include:  
1. **Current System Issues**: The existing system, based on the *Silva v. Silva* precedent, requires the higher earner to pay all child support to the lower earner, regardless of parenting time. This has been criticized as unfair and financially burdensome for parents with significant custody but no support funds during their parenting time.  
2. **Proposed Changes**: The bill introduces an **offset method**, used by most states, where child support is allocated based on income disparity and parenting time percentages. This aims to ensure more equitable distribution of funds between households.  
3. **Impact on Litigation**: The bill is expected to reduce family court litigation by establishing clear guidelines for child support allocation, though it may shift disputes to parenting time determinations.  
4. **Fiscal Impact**: Concerns were raised about potential increases in state costs for public assistance programs, such as TANF, child care subsidies, and food stamps, if the self-support reserve is raised. However, the bill could also reduce court costs over time by streamlining calculations.  
5. **Complexity Concerns**: Representatives and judicial branch officials expressed concerns about the bill’s complexity, particularly for self-represented litigants. The bill introduces multiple new definitions and calculations, which could create confusion and increase the burden on court clerks.  
6. **Quadrennial Review**: The Department of Health and Human Services is conducting a quadrennial review of child support guidelines, which may provide additional recommendations for improving the system.  
7. **Amendments and Senate Bill**: Amendments to HB 1647 were discussed, including a provision to phase in changes over three years to avoid overwhelming the courts. Comparisons were made to **Senate Bill 431**, which proposes a simpler approach to similar issues.  
8. **Public Assistance Implications**: Raising the self-support reserve could increase the number of families requiring public assistance, though the exact financial impact remains indeterminable.  

### **Committee Vote and Next Steps**
The committee voted **4-3 in favor of recommending HB 1647 "Ought to Pass" (OTP)**, acknowledging the need for further refinement and potential collaboration with the policy committee. The bill’s passage ensures the House has a position in ongoing negotiations with the Senate, particularly regarding the parallel **Senate Bill 431**.

### **Overall Meeting Highlights**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing **policy goals** with **financial considerations**, particularly in child support reform. While several bills passed unanimously or with minor adjustments, HB 1647 emerged as a contentious yet critical piece of legislation requiring further analysis and collaboration to address its fiscal and practical implications. The committee emphasized the importance of understanding these factors before finalizing the bill’s provisions.
