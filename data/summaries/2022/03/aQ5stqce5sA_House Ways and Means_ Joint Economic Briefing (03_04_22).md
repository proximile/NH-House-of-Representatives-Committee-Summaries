**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Joint Economic Briefing (03/04/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Joint Economic Briefing on March 4, 2022, addressed the state's economic recovery, challenges, and opportunities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and ongoing structural issues. The meeting featured presentations and discussions from experts and representatives across various sectors, focusing on key economic indicators, workforce challenges, housing affordability, energy costs, and public health. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and insights from the briefing:

---

### **1. Economic Recovery and Headwinds**
- **Post-Pandemic Recovery**: New Hampshire’s economy has partially rebounded from the pandemic, but recovery remains uneven across sectors. Industries like arts, entertainment, and recreation continue to struggle, while others have rebounded more quickly. The state’s gross state product and employment levels remain below pre-pandemic benchmarks.
- **Inflation and Fiscal Stimulus**: Inflation has emerged as a significant risk, driven by supply chain disruptions, increased demand for goods, and substantial federal fiscal stimulus (totaling over $7 trillion nationally). The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated inflation, particularly in energy and commodity prices, with potential for prolonged economic disruptions if the conflict persists.
- **Federal Assistance**: Federal stimulus measures, including unemployment compensation, stimulus checks, and child tax credits, played a critical role in supporting economic growth and reducing hardship during the pandemic. However, challenges like inflation and workforce shortages persist.

### **2. Workforce and Demographic Challenges**
- **Labor Market Constraints**: New Hampshire faces workforce shortages due to demographic shifts, health concerns, and childcare limitations. The labor force participation rate has declined, particularly among older workers (55+) and younger adults (25-34). Many workers have reduced hours or left the workforce entirely due to caregiving responsibilities or health concerns.
- **Education and Training**: There is a need for upskilling and education to prepare workers for the post-pandemic economy. Many adults in New Hampshire have some college education without a degree, which limits their earning potential.
- **Wage Growth**: Wage growth has been uneven, with lower-wage workers seeing smaller increases compared to higher-wage workers. The pandemic has disproportionately affected low-wage employment, which has been slower to recover.
- **Demographic Trends**: The state’s declining number of children poses long-term challenges for the future workforce, with New Hampshire experiencing more pronounced demographic shifts than other states.

### **3. Housing Market Crisis**
- **Affordability and Supply**: The housing market faces severe challenges, with rising home prices and rents outpacing income growth. The median home sales price in New Hampshire increased by 38% from January 2020 to January 2022, reaching $385,000. Median rents have also risen significantly, with statewide median gross rent (including utilities) at nearly $1,500 in 2021.
- **Low Inventory and Vacancy Rates**: Housing inventory remains critically low, with vacancy rates below 1% statewide. Construction activity has not kept pace with demand due to regulatory barriers, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions affecting materials like lumber and appliances.
- **Out-of-State Buyers and Investors**: The influx of out-of-state buyers, particularly from Massachusetts, and institutional investors has further strained the housing market, making homeownership increasingly unaffordable for residents.
- **Regulatory Challenges**: Tight local land use regulations limit the development of smaller, more affordable housing units, prompting developers to focus on larger, more expensive homes.

### **4. Sector-Specific Challenges and Innovations**
- **Agriculture**: The agricultural sector is grappling with rising costs of raw materials, farm machinery, and fertilizers due to supply chain disruptions and the Ukraine conflict. Wheat prices are expected to increase sharply, impacting global food prices.
- **Manufacturing**: The manufacturing sector faces ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Automation and data analytics are being adopted to mitigate these challenges.
- **Utilities and Energy**: Rising energy costs, exacerbated by the Ukraine conflict, are a significant concern. Utilities are exploring renewable energy sources like battery storage, renewable natural gas, and clean hydrogen to enhance sustainability and energy independence.
- **Hospitality and Tourism**: The hospitality sector has adapted to labor shortages through technology, such as kiosks for check-ins and grab-and-go services. Tourism saw a robust season in 2021, but uncertainties remain about future regional trends.
- **Healthcare**: The healthcare sector faces severe staffing shortages, particularly for nurses and clinical providers, compounded by rising salaries and recruitment expenses. The lack of affordable housing further complicates efforts to attract and retain workers.

### **5. Public Health and COVID-19**
- **Prevention and Mitigation**: Continued emphasis on handwashing, testing, and isolation/quarantine guidelines to prevent community spread. Wastewater surveillance is being used as a cost-effective tool to detect COVID-19 in communities.
- **Vaccination and Therapeutics**: New Hampshire has administered over two million vaccine doses, with vaccines now available for young children. Therapeutic drugs like Paxlovid are being used to manage COVID-19.
- **Community Risk and Masking**: The state has transitioned to a more individualized approach to masking based on personal risk assessments, guided by the CDC’s community risk framework.

### **6. Geopolitical and Economic Risks**
- **Ukraine Conflict**: The Russian invasion of Ukraine has introduced significant uncertainty into the global economy, particularly affecting energy markets, supply chains, and commodity prices. Three scenarios were presented for inflation and GDP growth: a rapid resolution, a prolonged conflict, and stagflation.
- **Global Supply Chains**: Supply chain disruptions, particularly in the semiconductor industry, have been worsened by the Ukraine conflict. Neon gas, a key input for chip production, is largely sourced from Ukraine and Russia.
- **Geopolitical Stability**: Russia’s weakened economy due to sanctions and China’s growing GDP are key factors in global economic stability.

---

### **7. Policy and Future Considerations**
- **Equitable Recovery**: Policymakers emphasized the need for equitable and inclusive economic strategies to address challenges like workforce shortages, housing affordability, and energy costs.
- **Federal Resources**: Leveraging federal funds to support recovery and mitigate future risks is critical. This includes investments in infrastructure, housing, and workforce development.
- **Regulatory Reforms**: Addressing regulatory barriers to housing development and energy innovation is essential to fostering economic growth and sustainability.

### **Conclusion**
The briefing underscored the interconnected challenges facing New Hampshire’s economy, including workforce shortages, housing affordability, inflation, and geopolitical risks. While the state has made progress in recovering from the pandemic, significant headwinds remain. Policymakers and stakeholders must collaborate to address these issues through innovative solutions, regulatory reforms, and strategic investments to ensure a resilient and inclusive economic future for New Hampshire.
