The NH House of Representatives meeting on March 9, 2022, focused on a series of bills related to labor, industrial, and rehabilitative services, addressing topics ranging from workers' compensation and family medical leave to vaccine mandates and unemployment benefits. Here’s a detailed overview of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Opening and Committee Business**

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 1352 - Workers' Compensation for COVID-19 Vaccinations**  
   The committee reviewed HB 1352, which proposed workers' compensation for adverse reactions to mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations. It was noted that the bill’s language was redundant with existing Department of Labor policies. The sponsor agreed to table the bill, and the committee voted unanimously (19-0) to do so.

2. **Granite State Paid Family Leave Plan (FMLI Program)**  
   Chris Nicolopoulos, the Insurance Commissioner, presented the Granite State Paid Family Leave Plan, which was included in the state budget. He emphasized that the program is voluntary, available to all residents, and designed to address nationwide demand for family medical leave. However, concerns were raised about adverse selection and the program’s funding, particularly the tax credits for employers.

   - **Repeal of the Plan (HB 1165)**: Representative Prout moved to repeal the program, arguing that private insurance companies already offer similar coverage and that the state program could create a monopoly and impose financial burdens. Opponents, including Representative Turcotte, countered that the program provides essential benefits and should be improved rather than repealed. The committee debated the merits of the program, with discussions highlighting differing views on the role of government versus the private sector in providing such benefits.

3. **HB 1210 - Vaccine Mandate Exemptions**  
   This bill sought to provide exemptions for vaccine mandates. An amendment was proposed to refine the bill, focusing on public employers and private employers receiving public funding, while excluding private employers entirely. The amendment aimed to balance individual rights with public health concerns. Concerns were raised about potential economic and medical risks, including the loss of Medicare and Medicaid funding for hospitals and nursing homes. The amendment passed narrowly (11-10), and the bill was ultimately supported by the committee.

4. **HB 1337 - Unemployment Benefits Duration**  
   The bill proposed adjusting the duration of unemployment benefits based on the unemployment rate, reducing the maximum weeks from 26 to 16 during periods of low unemployment. An amendment was introduced to modify the bill further, including changes to the effective date and provisions for states of emergency. The amendment passed overwhelmingly (20-1), but the bill itself faced opposition. Some members argued that the current system works well and that reducing benefits could harm vulnerable populations.

5. **HB 1529 - Background Checks for Public Library Employees and Volunteers**  
   The bill sponsor, Representative Love, moved to find the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), citing errors in the initial information and testimony. The motion to ITL passed unanimously (21-0), effectively killing the bill.

### **Adjournment and Caucus**
The committee agreed to a 10-minute caucus to discuss the new information presented during the meeting before resuming the session.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted significant debates on:
- The role of government versus the private sector in providing benefits like family medical leave.
- Balancing individual rights with public health concerns, particularly regarding vaccine mandates.
- The economic and social implications of adjusting unemployment benefits.
- The need for accurate information and careful consideration when drafting and reviewing legislation.

Several bills were amended or dismissed based on these discussions, reflecting the committee’s focus on addressing practical concerns while balancing competing interests.
