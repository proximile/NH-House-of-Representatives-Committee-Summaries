**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee Meeting (March 9, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee met on March 9, 2022, to discuss several key bills and amendments. The meeting highlighted debates on vaccine mandates, unemployment benefits, background checks for library employees, and the Granite State Paid Family Leave Plan. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 1210 - Vaccine Mandate Exemptions**
- **Amendment Overview**: Rep. Turcotte proposed an amendment consolidating provisions from three bills to create a unified approach. The amendment allows exemptions based on the "right of conscience" for public employers and private employers receiving public funding. Employers retain the ability to terminate employees if accommodations cannot be made without violating federal mandates (e.g., Medicare/Medicaid funding).
- **Support**: Rep. Seaworth argued the amendment balances individual rights with employer flexibility, allowing exemptions while ensuring compliance with federal requirements.
- **Opposition**: Rep. Sullivan raised concerns about increased risks of infectious diseases and potential loss of federal funding for healthcare institutions.
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed with a close vote of 11-10.

#### **HB 1337 - Unemployment Benefits Duration**
- **Amendment Overview**: Rep. Turcotte proposed adjusting the maximum weeks of unemployment benefits based on the unemployment rate:
  - 26 weeks when unemployment is high.
  - 16 weeks when unemployment is below 3%.
  - The effective date was extended to 120 days to allow stakeholders time to prepare.
- **Support**: Rep. Turcotte argued the change incentivizes quicker reemployment, citing data showing most people find jobs within 16 weeks.
- **Opposition**: Rep. Sullivan and others expressed concerns about the impact on vulnerable workers, particularly older individuals and those needing retraining, and referenced studies showing cutting benefits does not boost job growth.
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed overwhelmingly (20-1), and the bill passed with a vote of 11-10.

#### **HB 1529 - Background Checks for Library Employees**
- **Motion to ITL**: Rep. Love moved to deem the bill **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)**, citing errors in initial testimony and a desire to seek bipartisan consensus in the future.
- **Outcome**: The motion passed unanimously (21-0).

#### **HB 1352 - Workers' Compensation for Adverse COVID Vaccination Reactions**
- **Discussion**: The bill was deemed redundant as it mirrored existing Department of Labor policies.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (19-0) to title the bill without further action.

#### **Granite State Paid Family Leave Plan (HB 1165)**
- **Program Overview**: Insurance Commissioner Chris Nicolopoulos provided detailed testimony on the state’s voluntary family medical leave insurance (FMLI) program, included in the 2021 budget. The program offers voluntary coverage for individuals, groups, and state employees, with a tax credit for participating employers. Nicolopoulos highlighted its potential to address nationwide demand for family medical leave without mandating participation.
- **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about adverse selection (higher-risk individuals opting in) and the potential for a monopoly by the single company selected to administer the program.
- **Support for Repeal**: Rep. Prout argued that private insurers now offer similar products, making the state plan unnecessary. He expressed concerns about costs to taxpayers and the potential for a monopoly.
- **Opposition to Repeal**: Rep. Turcotte argued the program, while flawed, provides a necessary safety net. He criticized its financial exclusivity for low-income workers and urged improving it rather than repealing it.
- **Outcome**: The committee debated the merits of repeal, with some members supporting it due to fiscal concerns and others advocating for improving the existing program. The final vote was not explicitly stated.

### **Other Notes**

- **Future Bills**: The committee expects to review 3-5 Senate bills in the coming weeks, aiming to minimize session days.
