#### **Health Care Access and Disparities**
1. **Rural Health Disparities**: Rural residents in New Hampshire face significant health disparities, including higher rates of older adults, disabled individuals, low-income households, uninsured individuals, and veterans. The North Country and Carroll County are particularly affected, with Carroll County having the highest percentage of uninsured residents. Rural areas also experience longer travel times to access primary care, with Winnipesaukee and Carroll County having the highest travel times.
   
2. **Barriers to Care**: The percentage of rural residents without a personal doctor increased from 13.7% in 2021 to 18.1% in 2022. Chronic disease management appears stronger in rural areas, as non-rural residents are more likely to be hospitalized for preventable complications. However, rural areas have higher rates of late-stage breast cancer, indicating gaps in primary care access.

3. **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No significant geographic disparities exist in emergency department visits for substance use or mental health issues, though Winnipesaukee and Greater Manchester report worse outcomes. Non-rural suicide rates have risen, despite improvements in substance-related self-harm emergency visits.

4. **Maternal and Preventive Health**: Rural residents have higher rates of smoking during pregnancy but show no significant disparities in post-term delivery or late prenatal care. Winnipesaukee has the second-highest mammography rate in the state, and medical check-up rates have increased statewide, though non-rural rates remain higher.

5. **Mortality Rates**: Winnipesaukee, North Country, and Strafford County have the highest age-adjusted mortality rates in New Hampshire.

#### **Behavioral and Mental Health Services**
1. **Statewide Mental Health Plan**: The committee reviewed New Hampshire’s 10-year mental health plan, emphasizing prevention, community-based programs, crisis response, and inpatient care. Investments in children’s behavioral health services, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs), and a new forensic hospital were discussed.

2. **Inpatient Care Expansion**: Plans are underway to expand inpatient psychiatric beds, including a new psychiatric hospital in Epping. The goal is to increase capacity and provide specialized care for mental health disorders within the state.

3. **Crisis Response Services**: The New Hampshire Rapid Response Access Point, launched in January 2022, has seen significant engagement, with 1,500 contacts in its first month. Mobile crisis teams are operational statewide, with plans to expand data reporting and outreach.

4. **Housing and Transitional Services**: Securing and furnishing transitional housing for mental health patients remains a challenge, but progress is being made, with nine out of ten centers actively expanding their programs.

#### **Public Health and Workforce Issues**
1. **Child Care Workforce Crisis**: The Child Care Advisory Council reported a crisis in child care, with programs closing and reduced capacity due to workforce shortages. Efforts to recruit and retain workers include public service announcements, job listing sites, and traveling recruiting booths. Immediate investment is needed to stabilize the workforce and rebuild the pipeline of child care professionals.

2. **Health Workforce Data Collection**: The committee discussed efforts to collect data on health workforce supply, including primary care and mental health providers. Tracking the net change in provider supply based on license renewals is a key focus.

3. **Health Officer Training**: Local health officers face challenges, including the need for better training and support. A new online training platform is expected to launch in May or June 2022.

#### **Legislative Updates and Initiatives**
1. **Senate Bill 446**: This bill addresses child care workforce issues and includes pilot programs and incentives for businesses to support child care for employees.

2. **Task Force on Precision Medicine**: Representative Soloway proposed forming a task force to explore emerging technologies in precision medicine and genetic testing, aiming to produce a forward-looking report within months.

3. **Child Fatality Review Committee**: The annual report highlighted efforts to reduce child mortality rates, which remain below the national average. Recommendations include improving public education, driving safety, and upstream interventions to prevent adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

#### **COVID-19 Response and Preparedness**
1. **Testing and Treatment**: The state continues to provide free PCR tests and is prepared for potential surges in COVID-19 cases, particularly with the BA.2 variant. Antiviral treatments are available, and vaccination clinics can be reopened if necessary.

2. **After-Action Review**: The Department of Safety and Homeland Security is leading an after-action review of the state’s COVID-19 response.

#### **Next Steps and Recommendations**
The committee emphasized the need for timely and actionable solutions to address public health threats, mental health challenges, and workforce shortages. A supplementary report with detailed solutions is expected to be provided, focusing on mental health, housing, and health officer training.
