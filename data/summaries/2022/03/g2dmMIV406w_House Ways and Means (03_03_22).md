The NH House of Representatives meeting on March 3, 2022, focused on several key legislative issues, with a significant emphasis on the legalization and commercialization of cannabis, revisions to the Cigar Bar law, and other fiscal and regulatory matters. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Cannabis Legalization and Commercialization (HB 1598)**
The meeting extensively discussed **House Bill 1598**, which proposes the legalization and state-controlled sale of recreational cannabis in New Hampshire. Key points included:

1. **State-Run Model**: The bill proposes a state-run cannabis retail system, similar to New Hampshire’s liquor sales model, with the Liquor Commission overseeing operations. Initially, 10 state-run stores would be established, with potential for expansion based on demand. However, concerns were raised about the feasibility of this model, particularly regarding cultivation contracts, shelf life, and the exclusion of infused products, which account for 50% of retail sales in other states.

2. **Revenue and Costs**: Fiscal analyses projected potential revenue of $48 million annually, with $25 million earmarked for substance abuse and mental health treatment. However, the bill’s startup costs were significantly underestimated, with initial projections of $14 million revised to $50.8 million. Critics argued that the state’s monopoly model could hinder profitability and fail to compete with the illicit market.

3. **Banking and Financial Services**: Due to federal restrictions, cannabis businesses face challenges accessing banking services. The bill proposed establishing a state-chartered bank to handle cannabis transactions, but testimony from the New Hampshire Bankers Association and Banking Department highlighted the high costs and legal risks of such an endeavor. Private banks and credit unions were suggested as viable alternatives.

4. **Public Health and Safety**: Law enforcement representatives expressed concerns about increased costs related to impaired driving, substance use disorder, and the need for additional drug recognition experts. The New Hampshire Chiefs of Police Association estimated potential costs of $88 million related to cannabis commercialization.

5. **Medical vs. Recreational Cannabis**: Representatives from the therapeutic cannabis program warned that the bill could undermine the existing medical cannabis market by creating direct competition with recreational sales. They emphasized the need to maintain a separate, well-regulated medical program.

6. **Equity and Economic Opportunities**: Critics argued that the bill lacked provisions to support economically disadvantaged groups or those harmed by past drug policies. Some representatives advocated for allowing private businesses to participate in the market, which could generate additional revenue and create economic opportunities.

7. **Canadian Experience**: References to Canada’s experience with state-run cannabis sales highlighted significant financial losses and operational challenges. This raised concerns about the viability of New Hampshire’s proposed model.

8. **Interim Study Suggested**: Given the complexity of the issue and mixed results from other states, some representatives suggested conducting an interim study to better understand the fiscal and public health implications before proceeding with legalization.

### **Cigar Bar Law Revisions (HB 1237)**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1237**, which seeks to revise the 2009 Cigar Bar law. Key points included:

1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to address financial challenges faced by cigar bars, restaurants, and hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing them to compete more effectively with other establishments.

2. **Proposed Changes**: The original bill proposed reducing the revenue threshold for cigar bars from 60% to 30% for a two-year trial period. However, the Commerce Committee amended the bill to maintain the 60% threshold but allow the inclusion of cigarette and loose tobacco sales to meet this requirement.

3. **Revenue Concerns**: The Liquor Commission expressed concerns that lowering the threshold could reduce tobacco-related tax revenue. Proponents argued that the changes would help cigar bars stay in business and potentially increase overall revenue.

4. **Social and Economic Impact**: The bill is seen as a way to provide social gathering spaces for cigar enthusiasts and reduce roadside litter by encouraging people to gather in designated smoking areas.

5. **Technical Issues**: Confusion arose about the current law, particularly regarding the prohibition on smoking cigarettes in cigar bars while allowing their sale. Representatives suggested a technical fix might be needed to align the law with the bill’s intent.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to further analyze the fiscal impact and seek clarification from the Liquor Commission before making a final decision.

### **Other Fiscal and Regulatory Matters**
1. **Winnipesaukee River Basin Control Replacement Fund (HB 1339)**: The committee unanimously voted to pass this bill, which updates the funding model for the Winnipesaukee River Basin program, distributing repair costs more equitably among member communities.

2. **Capital Improvement Grant Program for Agricultural Fairs (HB 1584)**: The bill proposes a $250,000 annual grant program to support infrastructure improvements at regional agricultural fairs. While proponents highlighted the economic and educational benefits, opponents argued that taxpayer funds should not support private nonprofit organizations.

3. **House Bill 1288**: The committee discussed increasing the cap on a revolving fund from $20,000 to $100,000 for training programs within the Department of Administrative Services. Action was deferred pending further information from the bill’s sponsors.

- **Public Health and Safety**: Concerns about the potential negative impacts of cannabis legalization and cigar bar revisions on public health and safety were prominent.
- **Equity and Economic Opportunities**: Many discussions highlighted the need to create equitable economic opportunities, particularly in the cannabis industry, while addressing the financial barriers to entry.
