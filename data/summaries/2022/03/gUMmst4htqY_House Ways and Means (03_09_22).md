The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 9, 2022, convened by the House Ways and Means Committee, addressed a range of legislative issues, focusing on tax policy, state funding for agricultural fairs, workforce development, and opioid settlement allocations. The discussions underscored the tension between fiscal responsibility and the need for investment in key areas, with debates often reflecting partisan divides.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Agricultural Fair Funding (House Bill 1584)**:
   - **Support and Challenges**: Representatives and stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and various fair associations, strongly supported the bill, emphasizing the economic, educational, and cultural importance of agricultural fairs. Testimonies highlighted the financial struggles fairs face due to rising maintenance costs, necessary infrastructure upgrades (e.g., electrical systems, ADA compliance), and reliance on volunteer labor. Historical context was provided, noting the decline of revenue sources like Rockingham Park, which previously supported fairs.
   - **Opposition**: Granite State Taxpayers opposed the bill, arguing it represented special interest legislation and raised constitutional concerns about delegating too much authority to the executive branch without clear criteria for grant distribution.
   - **Amendments and Funding**: There was significant debate about funding mechanisms, with suggestions to explore alternative revenue streams like charitable gaming or sports betting. The bill proposed a $250,000 annual grant program for fair improvements, managed by the Department of Agriculture.

2. **Opioid Settlement Funds (House Bill 1565)**:
   - **Discussion**: The bill addressed the allocation of opioid settlement funds. Concerns were raised about the growing settlements and the need to allow current allocations to stabilize before making changes. The committee unanimously voted (21-0) to recommend an interim study for further analysis and discussion.

3. **Remote Work Taxation (House Bill 1097)**:
   - **Amendment and Debate**: The bill aimed to protect New Hampshire residents working remotely for out-of-state employers from being taxed by other states, particularly Massachusetts. An amendment (1037h) was introduced to clarify and strengthen the bill's language, with significant debate over the use of "may" versus "shall." The amendment passed 17-6, and the amended bill also passed 17-6, moving forward to the Senate.

4. **Business Tax Reductions (House Bill 1221)**:
   - **Amendment**: The bill proposed reducing the Business Profits Tax (BPT) from 7.6% to 7.5% and the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) from 0.55% to 0.5%. An amendment removed the BET reduction, focusing solely on lowering the BPT to 7.5%, citing concerns about revenue impacts. The amendment passed, and the bill moved forward for further consideration.

5. **Workforce Development (House Bill 1524)**:
   - **Program Details**: The bill aimed to establish a fund to attract and retain national service alumni (e.g., AmeriCorps, Peace Corps) by matching grants for education or employment, using ARPA funds without impacting general or educational trust funds. Supporters argued it would address workforce shortages, while critics pointed to unclear mechanics and the lack of a sunset clause.
   - **Voting Outcome**: A motion to indefinitely postpone the bill passed 12-11, reflecting the contentious nature of the proposal.

6. **Tax Cuts and Fiscal Prudence**:
   - **General Discussion**: Representatives debated previous opportunities to eliminate or reduce taxes (e.g., car rental tax, communication tax, and the Business Enterprise Tax) but chose not to act on them. The focus was on reducing the BPT to 7.5%, emphasizing fiscal restraint and the importance of lowering taxes for both large and small businesses.

7. **Public-Private Partnerships and ARPA Funds**:
   - **Discussion**: There was debate over the potential for private sector involvement in funding state initiatives, particularly for agriculture and fairs. However, it was noted that larger corporations in New Hampshire have limited interest in supporting agriculture-related projects. Concerns were also raised about the allocation of ARPA funds for various initiatives, including workforce development and capital improvements.

### Conclusion:
The meeting highlighted ongoing debates over tax policy, workforce challenges, and the role of state support for economic and cultural institutions like state fairs. The discussions underscored the tension between fiscal responsibility and the need for investment in key areas, with close votes reflecting partisan divides. The formation of subcommittees was proposed to address the complexities of certain bills and ensure transparency in the legislative process.
