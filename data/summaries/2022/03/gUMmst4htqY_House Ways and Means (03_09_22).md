The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 9, 2022, convened by the House Ways and Means Committee, covered a wide range of legislative discussions, focusing on taxation, state funding, and economic development. The meeting highlighted key debates on agricultural fair funding, tax cuts, workforce development, opioid settlement allocations, and remote work taxation, reflecting the committee’s efforts to balance fiscal responsibility with addressing pressing state needs. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Agricultural Fair Funding (House Bill 1584)**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 1584**, which proposes state funding for agricultural fairs. Supporters, including the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and fair organizers, emphasized the economic, educational, and tourism value of fairs, as well as their financial struggles due to aging infrastructure, rising costs, and declining sponsorships. They argued that state funding is necessary for capital improvements such as electrical upgrades, ADA compliance, and building repairs. Opponents, including the Granite State Taxpayers Association, criticized the bill as special interest legislation, arguing that fairs should be self-sufficient and raising constitutional concerns about funding distribution criteria. The committee also explored alternative funding solutions, such as tapping into charitable gaming or sports betting revenue, and considered forming a subcommittee to address concerns transparently.

### **Tax Cuts and Fiscal Responsibility**
The committee debated several tax-related issues, including proposals to lower the **Business Profits Tax (BPT)** and **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**. An amendment to **House Bill 1221** focused on reducing the BPT from 7.6% to 7.5%, aiming to maintain competitiveness with neighboring states while acknowledging revenue uncertainties. Representatives also discussed previous opportunities to eliminate or reduce taxes, such as the car rental tax and communication tax, but emphasized fiscal prudence in not lowering certain taxes at this time. Concerns were raised about the impact of tax cuts on property taxes, particularly in low-wealth towns, with calls for increased state aid to municipalities and school districts to alleviate property tax pressures.

### **Workforce Development**
A bill aimed at establishing a fund to attract and retain national service alumni (e.g., AmeriCorps, Peace Corps) was discussed as part of efforts to address workforce shortages. The bill proposed matching funds for education or employment support, highlighting the importance of workforce development for the state’s economy. Representatives underscored the need to bring in qualified individuals to fill job gaps and strengthen the workforce.

### **Opioid Settlement Funds (House Bill 1565)**
The committee opened an executive session to discuss **House Bill 1565**, which relates to the allocation of opioid settlement funds. A motion for an **interim study** passed unanimously, reflecting concerns about making major changes to the allocation formula without allowing the existing framework to settle. The committee emphasized the need for caution in altering the distribution of these critical funds.

### **Remote Work Taxation (House Bill 1097)**
**House Bill 1097** addressed the taxation of New Hampshire residents working remotely for out-of-state employers, particularly in response to Massachusetts’ attempt to tax NH residents during the pandemic. An amendment was introduced to assert New Hampshire’s **sovereign interest** in protecting its residents from out-of-state income taxation, strengthening the state’s legal standing in potential future litigation. The amendment and bill passed, though some members expressed concerns about the language and potential unintended consequences.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
1. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Balancing tax cuts and state funding with the need for fiscal prudence and addressing property tax pressures.
2. **Economic Development**: Supporting agricultural fairs, workforce development, and business competitiveness to strengthen the state’s economy.
3. **Legal and Constitutional Considerations**: Addressing concerns about special interest legislation, funding distribution, and state sovereignty in taxation.
4. **Procedural Caution**: Emphasizing the need for interim studies and transparent subcommittee work to address complex issues like opioid settlement funds and marijuana legalization.

Overall, the meeting reflected the committee’s efforts to navigate competing priorities, allocate limited resources effectively, and address critical economic and social challenges facing New Hampshire.
