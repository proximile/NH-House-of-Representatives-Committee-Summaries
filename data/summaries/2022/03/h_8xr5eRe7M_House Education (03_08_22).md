**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (03/08/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on March 8, 2022, to discuss and deliberate on a wide range of education-related bills. The meeting covered topics such as agricultural education, charter schools, teacher loyalty, education funding, special education, home education, and COVID-19 policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **1. Agriculture and Legislative Oversight**
- **HB 1164 - Reviving the Agriculture in the Classroom Committee**:  
  The committee unanimously passed a bill to revive the Agriculture in the Classroom Committee, with an amendment updating membership to include the New Hampshire Fruit Growers Association. Concerns about sovereign immunity were addressed, and the bill passed 19-0.
  
- **HB 1236 - Legislative Oversight Committee for Education Improvement and Assessment Program**:  
  This bill aimed to reinstate a legislative oversight committee for the state’s education assessment program, which had been inadvertently repealed. An amendment streamlined committee membership to focus on House members. The bill passed unanimously.

### **2. Teachers' Loyalty and Education Tax Credits**
- **HB 1255 - Teachers' Loyalty**:  
  The bill, criticized for poor drafting and unclear intent, was indefinitely postponed (ITL) due to significant proposed amendments and tight deadlines. The committee plans to revisit the issue next year.

- **HB 1298 - Eligibility for the Education Tax Credit**:  
  The bill proposed increasing the household income eligibility cap for the education tax credit program from 300% to 500% of the federal poverty level. Supporters argued it would expand access to scholarships for middle-income families, while critics raised concerns about prioritizing higher-income families. The bill passed as amended.

### **3. Education Funding and Scholarships**
- **Education Funding and Scholarships**:  
  The committee discussed the challenges faced by students who exceed financial limits for school services and the impact on their access to alternative schools. There was debate over the state’s tax credit program, with disagreements on whether tax credits reduce state revenue or are considered private funds. The Supreme Court has ruled these funds as private.

- **Federal Funding and State Mandates**:  
  Concerns were raised about local taxpayers bearing the cost of unfunded federal mandates, particularly in special education and school lunch programs.

### **4. Charter Schools and Building Aid**
- **HB 1499 - Charter School Building Aid**:  
  The committee debated a bill allowing charter schools to access state building aid. An amendment clarified reimbursement rates (30%), addressed asset disposition if a charter school dissolves, and ensured accountability for taxpayer funds. The bill was moved to interim study due to unresolved issues.

- **HB 1132 - Charter Conversion Schools**:  
  This bill addressed the conversion of traditional public schools to charter schools, which remain under local school district jurisdiction. Amendments focused on voting thresholds, with a two-thirds majority at regular annual meetings favored over special meetings. Concerns were raised about union contracts and labor agreements, as teachers in conversion schools would not be part of existing union contracts. The bill’s purpose was framed as a cost-saving measure, but some opposed it due to potential impacts on services like libraries and health programs.

### **5. Special Education and Home Education**
- **HB 1513 - Special Education Services**:  
  The committee considered an amendment allowing students with disabilities to receive services until the end of the school year in which they turn 21, rather than being cut off immediately upon turning 21.

- **HB 1663 - Home Education Rules**:  
  The committee revisited a bill addressing home education requirements. An amendment removed certain sections related to rule-making and school attendance for homeschooled students, and the bill passed with the amendment.

### **6. Curriculum Transparency and COVID-19 Policies**
- **HB 1434 - Curriculum Material Accessibility**:  
  An amendment required school districts to make curriculum materials available for review by parents, legal guardians, or residents within 10 business days of a request. The focus was on transparency and practicality, with discussions on the scope of the requirement.

- **Mask and Vaccination Mandates**:  
  The committee debated bills related to COVID-19 policies, including mask mandates and vaccination requirements. Some argued for individual choice and local control, while others expressed concerns about mandating vaccines and the efficacy of natural immunity versus vaccination. A bill prohibiting schools from mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for attendance was discussed, with ideological differences around state versus local control.

### **7. Education Freedom Accounts and Teacher Code of Conduct**
- **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)**:  
  A bill related to EFAs for students with disabilities was discussed, with amendments ensuring parents are informed of their rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Some argued the bill was redundant, as this information is already provided in the EFA application process.

- **Teacher Code of Conduct**:  
  Concerns were raised about a bill potentially weaponizing the teacher code of conduct by penalizing educators for enforcing school policies, such as mask mandates. The Department of Education clarified that the code of conduct addresses serious issues like child safety, not employment disputes.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Transparency and Accountability**:  
  Discussions emphasized the need for transparency in curriculum materials and accountability in charter school operations, particularly regarding asset disposition and taxpayer funds.

- **Local Control vs. State Oversight**:  
  The meeting highlighted tensions between local control and state oversight, particularly in areas like COVID-19 policies, charter school conversions, and education funding.

- **Equity and Access**:  
  The committee focused on ensuring equitable access to education resources, with debates on expanding eligibility for education tax credits, supporting special education services, and addressing the needs of low-income families.

- **Teacher Rights and Labor Concerns**:  
  Concerns about the impact of charter school conversions on teacher unions and labor agreements were a recurring theme, with some representatives opposing bills perceived as undermining public education and teacher rights.

Overall, the meeting reflected a mix of policy debates, procedural considerations, and ideological differences, with a focus on balancing financial, regulatory, and educational priorities in New Hampshire’s education system.
