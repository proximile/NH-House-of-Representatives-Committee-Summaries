The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee met on March 7, 2022, to discuss and vote on a wide range of bills and amendments related to healthcare, vaccination policies, mental health services, and elder care. The meeting highlighted ongoing debates about balancing individual rights, public health needs, and the responsibilities of healthcare providers and institutions. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **1. Hospital Visitation and Patient Rights**
- **House Bill 1045 & House Bill 1439**: These bills addressed hospital visitation policies, particularly during health crises like COVID-19. Competing amendments were proposed, with one (by Representative Weber) moving visitation policies into the patient's bill of rights, and another (by Representative Leon) keeping them in the licensing statute. The debate centered on balancing patient rights with hospital flexibility, especially regarding medically or therapeutically contraindicated visits. The committee postponed decisions to continue discussions the next day.
  
#### **2. Parental Consent for Medical Treatments in Schools**
- **House Bill 1244**: This bill focused on parental consent for medical and dental treatments of children in schools. Amendments proposed by Representatives Cushman and Merchant debated whether explicit written consent should be required for all treatments and screenings or if screenings should be excluded due to their critical role in children’s health and education.

#### **3. Vaccination Policies and Medical Freedoms**
- **Vaccine Registry (HB 1487)**: The committee debated whether the state vaccine registry should be opt-in or opt-out. Concerns were raised about the impact on data robustness and public health. An amendment allowing patients to withdraw from the registry with either a healthcare provider’s signature or a notary was passed unanimously.
- **Federal Vaccination Mandates**: A bill aimed to prevent state enforcement of federal vaccination mandates, with discussions focusing on state sovereignty and potential financial risks to healthcare providers.
- **Repeal of Medical Freedom Statutes**: A bill to repeal statutes protecting medical freedoms, particularly around vaccination choices, sparked debate between proponents of public health priorities and advocates for individual rights.

#### **4. Mental Health Services for Minors**
- **House Bill 1409**: This bill allows minors aged 16 and older to consent to mental health services without parental approval, excluding medication. The committee passed an amendment to clarify confidentiality and insurance concerns, emphasizing the importance of providing mental health access to adolescents in unsupportive family environments.

#### **5. Ivermectin Dispensing and Off-Label Use**
- **House Bill 1022**: This bill sought to permit pharmacists to dispense ivermectin via standing orders, including off-label uses like COVID-19 treatment. An amendment clarified screening protocols, documentation, and referral plans for adverse effects, while removing language discouraging its use. The bill passed 11-9 after heated debate about safety, efficacy, and liability concerns.

#### **6. Nursing Homes and Rehab Facilities**
- **House Bill 1044 & House Bill 1347**: These bills proposed allowing private pay or membership-based nursing homes and rehab facilities, exempting them from certain regulations. Concerns were raised about the potential negative impact on county nursing homes, which rely on private pay patients to offset Medicaid losses. Amendments passed narrowly, reflecting fears of a two-tier healthcare system and increased property taxes.

#### **7. Conversion Therapy Ban Amendment**
- **House Bill 1077**: An amendment to the state’s conversion therapy ban clarified that counseling should be client-directed and not forced, addressing concerns from both therapists and clients. The amendment passed 11-10, and the bill, as amended, was also passed.

#### **8. Eyeglass and Contact Lens Prescriptions**
- **Pupillary Distance (PD)**: The committee debated whether to require PD measurements on eyeglass prescriptions, ultimately passing a compromise amendment allowing patients to request PD measurements while giving dispensers flexibility to adjust them.
- **Contact Lens Prescriptions**: Changes to contact lens prescription regulations were discussed, though concerns were raised about the lack of prior testimony on this issue.

#### **9. General Healthcare System Concerns**
- Representatives discussed broader issues in the healthcare system, including inadequate Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, the impact on rural healthcare providers, and the challenges of maintaining services in underserved areas. The conversation highlighted the complexity of healthcare funding and the need for market competition, though opinions differed on the best approach.

### **Committee Schedule and Next Steps**
The committee decided to take a break from March 21-25, with no meetings scheduled for March 14-15, while awaiting Senate bills for review. Several bills were moved to interim study for further consideration, including **House Bill 1271**, which addresses unresolved issues related to emergency protections enacted during the COVID-19 crisis.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of healthcare legislation, with representatives grappling with the balance between individual rights, public health needs, and the practicalities of implementation. Key themes included the importance of patient autonomy, the challenges of healthcare funding, and the need for clear, enforceable policies to protect vulnerable populations. The committee passed several bills and amendments, often with narrow margins, reflecting the contentious nature of these issues.
