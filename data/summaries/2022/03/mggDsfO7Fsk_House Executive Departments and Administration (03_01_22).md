The NH House of Representatives meeting focused on a bill (HB 1061) concerning the role of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) in overseeing professional boards, particularly the Midwifery Council. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Midwifery Council Concerns**: Sherry Stevens, Chair of the Midwifery Council, expressed frustration with OPLC’s handling of administrative tasks, such as licensing and record-keeping. She highlighted issues like lost records, inconsistent communication, and lack of clarity in OPLC’s responsibilities. Stevens emphasized the importance of maintaining the council’s autonomy to protect the midwifery profession, which she argued is vulnerable under OPLC’s oversight.

2. **OPLC’s Role**: Representatives discussed OPLC’s original purpose of consolidating administrative functions to reduce duplication and confusion across professional boards. However, concerns were raised about OPLC accumulating too much power, particularly in decision-making processes that should remain with professional boards. The bill aimed to clarify OPLC’s administrative role while preserving the boards’ authority over professional standards.

3. **Advisory Board vs. Decision-Making Authority**: There was debate over whether the Midwifery Council should remain an advisory board or retain decision-making authority. Stevens and others argued that placing ultimate authority with the OPLC executive director could jeopardize the midwifery profession, especially if future leadership opposes out-of-hospital births.

4. **Rulemaking and Legislative Intent**: Representatives emphasized the need for clear legislative intent to protect the autonomy of professional boards while assigning administrative tasks to OPLC. They discussed the importance of rulemaking to address gaps in processes like reference checks and investigations, which are currently not codified in law.

5. **Proposed Amendments**: An amendment was proposed to ensure that the OPLC executive director makes decisions “in consultation with” the Midwifery Council, rather than unilaterally. This amendment aimed to balance administrative efficiency with professional oversight.

6. **Future Oversight**: Some representatives suggested creating an oversight committee for OPLC, modeled after the Health and Human Services oversight committee, to address ongoing concerns and ensure accountability.

In summary, the meeting highlighted tensions between streamlining administrative functions through OPLC and preserving the autonomy of professional boards like the Midwifery Council. The discussion underscored the need for clear rules, legislative intent, and potential oversight mechanisms to address these concerns.
