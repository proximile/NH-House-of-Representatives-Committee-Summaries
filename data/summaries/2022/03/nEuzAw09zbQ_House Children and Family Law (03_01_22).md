**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Children and Family Law (March 1, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 1, 2022, focused on a series of bills related to family law, child support, parental rights, and guardianship. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing the rights of parents, the safety of children, and the financial and logistical challenges of implementing new legislation. Key topics and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Child Support and Enforcement**
1. **Enforcement of Child Support Payments**: Representatives discussed challenges in enforcing child support payments and proposed a bill to clarify guidelines for enforcing payments up to $10,000 or over a year. The need for stronger enforcement mechanisms was emphasized to ensure financial support for children.

### **Parental Rights and School Policies**
2. **House Bill 1431 (Parental Bill of Rights)**: This bill aimed to establish a "Parental Bill of Rights," ensuring parents are informed and involved in their children’s education and medical decisions. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with existing laws and the impact on trusted adult-child relationships, particularly regarding sensitive issues like gender identity.

### **Guardianship and Safety**
3. **House Bill 1518 (Guardianship Requirements)**: The bill proposed requiring home visits by child care agencies within 60 days of appointing a guardian, with waivers allowed if all parties consent. Guardians would bear the cost of the visit, and agencies must issue a report to the court within 30 days.
4. **Safety Reports for Guardianship**: Another bill required guardians to file safety reports to ensure children are placed in safe homes. Concerns about the financial burden on guardians led to amendments, including waiving costs for certain guardians and clarifying reporting requirements.

### **Confidentiality and Reporting**
5. **Confidentiality of Reports to DCYF**: A bill aimed to protect the confidentiality of reports made to the Division of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). Representatives debated whether requiring reporters to provide their names would deter reporting, especially in cases of domestic violence. An amendment proposed allowing anonymous reporting while holding malicious reporters accountable.

### **Juvenile Detention**
6. **Recording in Juvenile Detention Facilities**: A bill required the recording and storing of digital video in all state-funded juvenile detention facilities. Discussions focused on the scope of the bill, including its application to out-of-state facilities, and the balance between privacy and safety.

### **Key Votes and Outcomes**
7. **House Bill 1118**: Unanimously recommended "Ought to Pass" (OTP) by the committee (14-0).
8. **House Bills 1278 & 1279**: Both bills, addressing term alimony, were unanimously recommended "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) (14-0).
9. **House Bill 1280**: This bill sought to prevent a parent’s refusal to vaccinate a child from being used as grounds for terminating parental rights. After extensive debate, the committee voted 8-7 to recommend OTP, with a minority report recommending ITL.
10. **House Bill 1286**: This bill addressed the modification of parental rights and responsibilities. An amendment clarifying shared parenting passed 13-2, and the bill itself passed 8-7, with a minority report recommending ITL.
11. **House Bill 1305**: Proposed changes to temporary alimony calculations passed 8-7, with a minority report recommending ITL.
12. **House Bill 1382**: This bill aimed to establish a presumption of shared parenting in custody determinations. An amendment defining shared parenting passed 13-2, and the bill itself passed 8-7, with a minority report recommending ITL.
13. **House Bill 1396**: This bill sought to clarify the payment schedule for child support. After significant debate, the committee voted 8-7 to recommend ITL, with a minority report recommending OTP.

### **Themes and Concerns**
Throughout the meeting, representatives expressed concerns about:
- The clarity, enforceability, and potential unintended consequences of proposed legislation.
- The financial burden on guardians and families.
- The balance between parental rights and the best interests of children, particularly in cases involving domestic violence or financial instability.
- The impact of new laws on privacy, confidentiality, and trust in sensitive relationships.
