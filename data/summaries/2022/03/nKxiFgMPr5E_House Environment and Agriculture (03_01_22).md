### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (March 1, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on March 1, 2022, to discuss two key bills: **House Bill 1186** and **House Bill 1454**. The meeting focused on addressing critical issues related to landfill siting criteria, waste management, and emergency preparedness for companion animals.

#### **House Bill 1186: Companion Animals During Emergencies**
- **Objective**: The bill aims to ensure the safety and care of companion animals during states of emergency.
- **Amendment**: A subcommittee proposed **Amendment 2022-0727H**, which allows for disaster animal response trailers or reasonable accommodations for companion animals during evacuations. It also extends emergency worker protections to volunteers vetted by the Department of Health and Human Services who assist with animal care during emergencies.
- **Discussion**: The amendment addressed concerns raised in previous sessions and received unanimous support from the committee.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed as amended (19-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

#### **House Bill 1454: Landfill Siting Criteria and Waste Management**
- **Background**: The bill addresses landfill siting criteria, particularly the setback distance from perennial rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. It emerged in response to significant water contamination issues in New Hampshire, including cancer clusters linked to landfills, especially in the Merrimack area. Concerns were also raised about private companies importing trash from outside the state, exacerbating landfill capacity and environmental health risks.
- **Amendment**: A subcommittee introduced **Amendment 2022-0894-h**, which replaced the arbitrary 200-foot setback with a scientifically calculated distance based on groundwater seepage velocity. The amendment ensures that contaminants do not reach water bodies within five years. It also removed a controversial section about immediate landfill shutdowns in case of spills, focusing solely on the setback calculation.
- **Debate**:
  - **Immediate Action vs. Comprehensive Study**: Representatives were divided on whether to pass HB 1454 as a standalone bill or wait for the findings of a broader study committee (**House Bill 1049**). Proponents argued for immediate action to protect affected communities and demonstrate the legislature’s commitment to urgent environmental concerns. Opponents felt it was better to wait for the study committee’s holistic approach to waste management.
  - **Economic and Regulatory Concerns**: Some members expressed concerns about the bill’s impact on businesses with pending landfill applications and the need for clarity on grandfathering provisions.
- **Vote**: The motion to pass HB 1454 as amended narrowly passed with a vote of 10-9. The bill will proceed to the House floor, with both a majority and minority report prepared.
- **Study Committee (HB 1049)**: HB 1049, which includes HB 1454 as part of its scope, will study landfill siting criteria, solid waste policies, and related issues. Some representatives worried that passing HB 1454 now might limit the study committee’s ability to address the issue comprehensively.
- **Next Steps**: The bill will move to the House floor, while the study committee continues its work on broader waste management issues. The deadline for submitting reports on HB 1454 was set for the following day.

2. **Public Health and Environmental Protection**: Representatives emphasized the importance of safeguarding New Hampshire’s water bodies and public health, particularly in areas affected by landfill contamination.
3. **Balancing Economic and Regulatory Interests**: The debate underscored the need to balance environmental protections with economic considerations, particularly for businesses with pending landfill applications.
