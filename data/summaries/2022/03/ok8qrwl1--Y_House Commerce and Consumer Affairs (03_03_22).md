### **Health Insurance and Consumer Protections**
1. **Individual Health Insurance Policies (Bills 10-28 & 1028)**:

Concerns were raised about short-term health insurance policies potentially violating the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by excluding pre-existing condition protections.

2. **Insurance Coverage for FDA Emergency Use Authorization Products (Bill 1162)**:
