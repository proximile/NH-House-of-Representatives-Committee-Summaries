### **Key Bills and Outcomes**  

#### **Licensing and Regulatory Issues**  
1. **House Bill 1171**: This bill and its amendment focused on exempting certain services (e.g., blow-drying, hair styling, eyelash extensions) from licensing requirements. Concerns were raised about the safety of eyelash extensions due to the use of glue near the eyes. The amendment passed 11-8, and the bill passed with the amendment, also 11-8.  

2. **House Bill 1330**: This bill proposed repealing the licensing requirement for medical technicians. An amendment was adopted (10-9), and the bill passed (10-9), with a minority report expected.  

3. **House Bill 1560**: Addressed reciprocity for cosmetology licenses from other states. The bill passed 12-7 after discussions about simplifying the process for licensed cosmetologists moving to New Hampshire.  

4. **House Bill 1192**: Focused on acupuncture licensing and aligned with Senate Bill 282. An amendment was proposed to accommodate changes in certifying organizations, but no vote was taken in this session.  

#### **Public Health and Safety**  
1. **House Bill 1061**: Concerned midwifery and the relationship between the Midwife Advisory Council and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC). An amendment clarifying responsibilities passed 18-1, but the bill ultimately failed and was moved to interim study (19-0).  

2. **House Bill 1018**: Related to the Medical Imaging and Radiation Board. An amendment adding an alternate board member passed unanimously (19-0), and the bill passed as amended (18-2). Discussions centered on the board’s meeting frequency and its relationship with OPLC.  

3. **House Bill 1344**: Addressed fine print in real estate listing contracts, requiring agents to obtain explicit power of attorney from property owners. The bill passed 18-1, with one representative opposing, arguing it was unnecessary.  

#### **Administrative Efficiency and Oversight**  
1. **House Bill 1256**: Aimed to reclassify two senior leadership positions within the Department of Military Affairs and Veterans Services from classified to unclassified to improve efficiency. The bill passed with a language-cleanup amendment, 19-0.  

2. **House Bill 1510**: Proposed a study committee to address high vacancy rates in state agencies. The motion to deem the bill “inexpedient to legislate” passed 11-8, with opponents arguing government hiring processes are inherently slower.  

3. **House Bill 1395**: Related to changes in the administrative rulemaking process. It was moved to interim study (19-0) for further review.  

#### **Fiscal Responsibility and Audits**  
1. **House Bill 1135**: Focused on auditing the Education Freedom Accounts program. An amendment to delay the audit’s effective date to July 1, 2023, failed (9-10). The committee then voted 10-9 to adopt the amendment and passed the amended bill 10-9. A minority report was requested.  

2. **House Bill 1079**: Proposed allowing retirees to work full-time while collecting retirement benefits. The bill was deemed “inexpedient to legislate” (19-0) due to concerns about the intent of the law.  

#### **Environmental and Waste Management**  
1. **House Bill 1312**: Addressed grease trap regulations. Representative Bailey moved for an interim study, citing concerns about the bill’s lack of flexibility. The motion passed unanimously (19-0).  

2. **House Bill 1274**: Proposed a waste study committee. The bill was deemed “inexpedient to legislate” (19-0) as similar studies and state policies already address the issue.  

#### **Cultural and Historical Recognition**  
1. **House Bill 1173**: Proposed recognizing August 9th as Indigenous Peoples' Day. The bill failed (8-11) but was later moved to interim study (14-5).
