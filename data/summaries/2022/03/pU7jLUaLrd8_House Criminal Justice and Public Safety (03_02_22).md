---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Criminal Penalties and Access to Information**
- **House Bill 1072**: Proposed criminal penalties for denying elected school district officials access to school facilities, documents, or events. An amendment clarified that the bill does not override laws protecting confidential records (e.g., student IEPs). The amendment and bill passed narrowly (11-10), despite concerns about potential disruptions to school operations.
- **House Bill 1004**: Required individuals whose animals injure someone to report the incident to the police. An amendment allowed them to leave the scene and report later, addressing safety concerns. The bill passed as amended, though some opposed it due to enforcement challenges and opposition from dog owner groups.

#### **2. Cannabis Legalization**
- **House Bills 1348 and 1306**: Both bills related to the legalization or personal possession of cannabis were recommended for interim study. The committee cited the complexity of cannabis legislation and the existence of overlapping bills already under consideration. The motions passed with strong majorities (17-4 and 18-3, respectively).

#### **3. Immigration Enforcement**
- **Immigration Enforcement Bill**: Debated a bill prohibiting state or local policies that prevent law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Discussions centered on local control, the role of law enforcement, and the impact on immigrant communities. The bill passed with an 11-10 vote.

#### **4. Asset Forfeiture**
- **Amendment 2022-0874-h**: Addressed asset forfeiture, exempting small amounts of currency (under $200) and vehicles (under $2,000) from forfeiture, even if tied to criminal activity. The amendment aimed to prevent abuse while ensuring criminals do not retain ill-gotten gains. It passed with a 16-5 vote.
- **House Bill 1296**: Shifted the burden of proof to the state to demonstrate that seized money was used for drug purposes. The bill passed with an 11-10 vote and was also recommended for interim study.

#### **5. Criminal Justice Reform**
- **House Bill 1105**: Focused on reforming the "earned time credit" program for inmates, addressing concerns that inmates could reduce sentences by completing short video courses. The bill was sent to interim study after a 13-7 vote.
- **House Bill 1335**: Aimed to improve medical parole procedures, with an amendment clarifying eligibility criteria. The amendment and bill passed unanimously.

#### **6. Repeat Offenders and Bail Reform**
- **House Bill 1476**: Required individuals arrested multiple times while on bail to appear before a judge rather than a bail commissioner. It also reduced the maximum detention time before seeing a judge from 72 hours to 36 hours (excluding weekends and holidays). The bill focused on repeat offenders charged with serious crimes (Class A misdemeanors or higher). Supporters emphasized public safety and judicial oversight, while opponents raised concerns about due process and the strain on the judicial system. The amendment passed 19-1, and the bill was approved with a majority vote, though a minority report was requested.

#### **7. Historical Justice**
- **House Bill 1127**: Aimed to annul convictions for individuals who have passed away, addressing historical injustices like witchcraft convictions. Concerns were raised about the legislatureâ€™s authority and the potential erasure of historical lessons. The bill was recommended for interim study after a 16-5 vote.

#### **8. DUI Enforcement**
- **House Bill 1246**: Focused on requiring interlock devices in all vehicles registered to individuals convicted of aggravated DUI offenses. An amendment proposed limiting the requirement to the vehicle driven by the offender, but it was rejected. The bill passed as originally proposed.
