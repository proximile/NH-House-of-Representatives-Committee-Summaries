### **House Bill 1598: Legalizing and Regulating Cannabis**
The majority of the meeting focused on HB 1598, which proposes a state-run cannabis program. Key discussions and amendments included:

#### **1. Revenue and Economic Impact**
- The **New Hampshire Liquor Commission** projected **$250 million in gross revenue** from cannabis sales, with **$30 million in net revenue** after excluding **edibles** (food and drink products).
- A **staggered rollout** of **10 state-operated retail stores** was proposed, with **3-4 stores opening initially**, requiring a **$4.6 million investment**.
- Revenue would grow as more stores open, with each store adding approximately **$3 million annually**.
- Revenue allocation priorities included operational expenses, property tax relief, the New Hampshire Retirement System, substance abuse programs, public safety, and childrenâ€™s behavioral health services.

#### **2. Excluding Edibles**
- Edibles were excluded from the bill, reducing projected revenue by **40%**.
- Concerns were raised about losing customers to neighboring states where edibles are sold, but the Liquor Commission maintained revenue estimates accounted for this exclusion.

#### **3. Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs)**
- The bill allows **ATCs** (medical cannabis providers) to participate in the recreational market by obtaining parallel licenses.
- Debate centered on whether ATCs should operate as non-profits or for-profits, with concerns about their ability to compete and access capital.
- Amendments proposed allowing ATCs to operate for-profit entities under their non-profit umbrella, ensuring revenues benefit patients.

#### **4. Cultivation and Licensing**
- The bill removes a **15-cultivator limit**, allowing New Hampshire farmers to enter the cannabis market.
- Federal law prohibits interstate cannabis sales, limiting cultivation to in-state operations.
- The Liquor Commission emphasized separating cannabis branding from alcohol and ensuring no restrictions on who could obtain a license.

#### **5. Testing and Safety**
- The committee emphasized testing cannabis for contaminants (e.g., pesticides) and potency to ensure safety and quality.
- Amendments clarified definitions of **cannabis products** and ensured testing requirements apply to all products.

#### **6. Public Safety and Penalties**

- The bill proposes penalties for smoking or vaping cannabis in vehicles, with fines and license suspensions.

#### **7. Criminal Justice and Equity**
- The bill aims to reduce criminal records for cannabis-related offenses, particularly for marginalized populations.
- Concerns were raised about whether the bill adequately addresses this issue.

#### **8. Amendments and Finalization**
- Multiple amendments were proposed and adopted, including changes to cultivation licensing, labeling requirements, and health and safety rules.
- The bill passed with a **12-10 vote**, though some members recommended an interim study due to concerns about the lack of detailed financial and regulatory frameworks.
