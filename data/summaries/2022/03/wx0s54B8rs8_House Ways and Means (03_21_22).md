The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on March 21, 2022, to discuss several bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 1598**, which pertains to the legalization, regulation, and taxation of cannabis.

Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **House Bill 1598: Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**

#### **Key Discussions and Amendments**
1. **Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs)**:
   - The committee debated whether ATCs, which currently operate as non-profit entities serving medical cannabis patients, should be allowed to establish for-profit cultivation and manufacturing facilities to compete in the state-run cannabis market.
   - Concerns were raised about unequal competition between for-profit and non-profit entities and the challenges ATCs face in raising capital for expansion.
   - Amendments were proposed to allow ATCs to create separate for-profit entities under their non-profit umbrella, enabling them to access capital while maintaining their non-profit status. This approach aimed to protect ATCs from losing customers to retail cannabis stores.

2. **State-Operated Cannabis Stores**:
   - The bill proposes that all retail cannabis stores in New Hampshire be state-operated, creating a monopoly arrangement. Members discussed whether this should be explicitly stated in the bill and whether it aligns with the committee's intent.
   - The exclusion of edibles (cannabis-infused food and drink products) from state stores was debated, with concerns raised about potential revenue losses and customers turning to neighboring states where edibles are sold.

3. **Testing and Safety Regulations**:
   - Significant discussion centered on testing requirements for cannabis products, including potency and contaminants like pesticides. Members emphasized the need for clear language to ensure consumer safety and product quality.
   - Amendments were proposed to align testing standards with international benchmarks (ISO/IEC) and to require testing for all cannabis products.

4. **Revenue Allocation**:
   - The bill outlines how cannabis revenues will be allocated: 50% to offset property taxes, 30% to reduce the New Hampshire Retirement System debt, 10% to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for substance abuse programs, 5% to public safety agencies, and 5% to childrenâ€™s behavioral health services.
   - Some representatives argued for more flexible revenue allocation, suggesting that funds be determined during the budget process rather than being fixed in the bill.

5. **Financial Protections and Start-Up Costs**:
   - The bill includes provisions to keep cannabis-related funds separate from other state funds, particularly liquor revenues, to protect against federal intervention.
   - A five-year payback plan was proposed for the $4.6 million in start-up costs, with operational expenses prioritized before repaying citizens.

6. **Penalties and Enforcement**:
   - The bill includes penalties for smoking or vaping cannabis in vehicles. Members discussed whether penalties should have minimum thresholds to ensure consistency in enforcement.

7. **Final Amendments and Passage**:
   - The committee adopted **Amendment 1172H**, which clarified testing requirements, allowed ATCs to operate for-profit entities, and addressed the sale and regulation of cannabis products.
   - The bill, as amended, passed with a vote of 12-10, though some representatives expressed concerns about unresolved details, particularly around funding distribution and regulatory specifics.

#### **Revenue Projections**
- The committee estimated annual net revenue of $30 million once 10 state-operated cannabis stores are operational, with an additional $10 million for every three new stores.
- Excluding edibles from state stores was projected to reduce potential revenue, though the exact impact was debated.

2. **Transparency and Oversight**:
   - The amendment outlined the role of the Commissioner of Agriculture in managing the fund and emphasized transparency through annual reports and audits.
