**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 14, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 14, 2022, addressed a range of critical issues, including disaster recovery funding, PFAS contamination, and legislative bills aimed at supporting municipalities and public safety. The discussions highlighted the challenges faced by small towns, the importance of state and federal collaboration, and the need for timely and effective solutions to pressing environmental and infrastructure problems.

### **Disaster Recovery and Municipal Funding**
1. **FEMA Reimbursement and Municipal Projects**: Representatives emphasized the need to ensure that municipal projects do not interfere with FEMA reimbursement. They discussed enabling legislation to allow towns, especially smaller rural ones, to participate in recovery programs without financial strain. The lack of insurance options for infrastructure repairs after disasters was noted, with one example being a town that lost years of savings due to a single night of destruction.
   
2. **State and Municipal Collaboration**: Potential state funding mechanisms, such as using a "rainy day fund" or ARPA funds, were debated. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of loans and the need for municipalities to repay them. Legislative bills like SB 409 and SB 402 were discussed, with SB 402 proposing a 12.5% state and 12.5% municipal cost-sharing for FEMA-matched projects, though financial uncertainties delayed progress.

3. **Historical Disasters and Mitigation**: Past disasters, such as the 2007 Mother’s Day floods, were referenced to illustrate the state’s efforts to support affected municipalities. Mitigation projects were highlighted as essential to prevent future damage, with FEMA funding both disaster recovery and non-disaster mitigation efforts.

4. **Municipal Road and Bridge Disaster Relief Fund (HB 1665)**: Representative Judy Aaron introduced HB 1665 to create a fund for gap funding for municipalities dealing with road and bridge damage from natural disasters. The bill aims to allow immediate repairs without waiting for federal disaster declarations or FEMA reimbursements. However, concerns were raised about potential conflicts with FEMA funding, as state-funded relief might be seen as a duplication of benefits, reducing federal aid.

### **Legislative Bills and Public Safety**
1. **House Bill 1462 (Motorcycle Learner Permits)**: The bill proposes allowing individuals to obtain a second motorcycle learner permit if they fail to complete the process within the initial 45-day window. The DMV would need to update its systems and forms, with an estimated one-time cost of $28,000. The bill received support and was approved.

2. **House Bill 1547 (PFAS Contaminant Levels)**: This bill addresses soil remediation standards for PFAS, harmful chemicals found in water, soil, and air. The amended version allows the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to initiate rules for soil remediation standards by November 1, 2023, based on a USGS study. The bill also amends the Groundwater Protection Act to ensure safe alternative water for impacted wells and aligns hazardous waste generator certification with federal law. The bill was unanimously approved.

### **PFAS Contamination**
1. **Setting Soil Standards**: Representatives and state officials discussed the complexities of setting soil standards for PFAS. The original bill proposed soil standards equivalent to drinking water standards, which were deemed unachievable and costly. The amended bill sets more realistic soil standards, with a revised fiscal impact showing decreased costs.

2. **Impact on Agriculture and Research**: The discussion highlighted the need for more research to determine safe PFAS levels for growing crops, particularly on farms. Ongoing USGS studies aim to understand background PFAS levels in soil and their impact on groundwater.

3. **Federal Funding**: Federal sources like ARPA and the bipartisan infrastructure law were emphasized as crucial for addressing PFAS contamination in water systems across the state, especially in southern New Hampshire where contamination is more prevalent.

### **Future Meetings and Education Bills**
The committee planned to reconvene to review three education bills and consider potential amendments. They also discussed the possibility of allocating funds for certain initiatives, similar to previous allocations for police standards.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the financial challenges faced by municipalities in recovering from disasters and addressing environmental contamination. Representatives explored legislative solutions, emphasized the importance of state and federal collaboration, and highlighted the need for timely and effective funding mechanisms to support public safety and infrastructure resilience.
