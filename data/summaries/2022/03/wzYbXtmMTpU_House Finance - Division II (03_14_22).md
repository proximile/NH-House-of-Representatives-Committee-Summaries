**Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Finance - Division II (March 14, 2022)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on March 14, 2022, covered a wide range of topics, including disaster recovery funding, PFAS contamination, legislative bills, and municipal support mechanisms. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the session:

---

### **Disaster Recovery and Municipal Support**
1. **Challenges in Disaster Recovery**:
   - Representatives highlighted the difficulties small towns face in recovering from natural disasters, particularly the lack of financial resources to rebuild infrastructure. Smaller rural towns often struggle to secure insurance and FEMA reimbursements, which can take months or years to process.
   - **SB 409** and **SB 402** were discussed as potential solutions. SB 409 allows municipalities to take out zero-interest loans from the state treasury after a disaster declaration, with plans to amend the bill to enable loans even before a federal disaster declaration. SB 402 proposes a 12.5% state and 12.5% municipal cost-sharing for FEMA-matched funds, though uncertainty about its financial impact has delayed progress.
   - **HB 1665**, introduced by Representative Judy Aaron, proposes a municipal road and bridge disaster relief fund to provide immediate gap funding for temporary repairs after disasters. However, concerns were raised about potential conflicts with FEMA reimbursements, as FEMA may deduct state-provided funds.

2. **Mitigation Efforts**:
   - The importance of mitigation projects to prevent future disaster damage was emphasized. FEMA provides funding for both disaster recovery and non-disaster mitigation efforts, and representatives stressed the need for proactive measures to reduce long-term costs.

### **PFAS Contamination and Environmental Standards**
1. **PFAS Contamination**:
   - The session addressed the challenges of setting soil standards for PFAS compounds, which are regulated at very low concentrations due to their risk in drinking water. The original version of a bill proposed soil standards equivalent to drinking water standards, but this was deemed unachievable and costly. The bill was amended to avoid this issue.
   - The Department of Environmental Services (DES) is conducting a three-part study with the USGS to determine background PFAS levels in soil and assess their impact on groundwater. The complexity of PFAS behavior in soil requires extensive scientific study, and DES emphasized the need for science-based standards.
   - Funding from ARPA and federal infrastructure laws is being used to address PFAS contamination in drinking water and wastewater systems, particularly in southern New Hampshire, where contamination is more prevalent.

2. **HB 1547 (PFAS Contaminant Levels)**:
   - The bill, as amended, allows DES to initiate soil remediation standards by November 2023, based on the USGS study. It also amends the Groundwater Protection Act to include soil contamination and requires responsible parties to provide safe alternative water to impacted wells.
   - DES confirmed there are no fiscal impacts on state revenues or expenditures, and the bill was praised as a collaborative effort involving activists, legislators, and DES. It was unanimously approved by the Environment and Agriculture Committee.

### **Legislative Bills and Fiscal Matters**
1. **HB 1462 FN (Motorcycle Learner Permits)**:
   - The bill proposes allowing individuals to obtain a second motorcycle learner permit if their initial 45-day permit expires due to circumstances like bad weather. Currently, only one lifetime permit is allowed.
   - A one-time cost of $28,000 is anticipated for updating DMV systems and forms. Concerns about the fiscal impact were raised, with suggestions to reduce the appropriation or adjust fees to cover costs. The committee considered the bill a reasonable accommodation and approved it with potential amendments.

2. **Education Bills**:
   - The session concluded with a mention of upcoming discussions on three education bills, with the possibility of amendments being considered.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Disaster Recovery**: The meeting emphasized the need for state support to help municipalities recover from disasters, particularly smaller rural towns. Bills like SB 409 and HB 1665 aim to provide immediate funding and streamline the recovery process, though concerns about FEMA reimbursements remain.
- **PFAS Contamination**: The state is working on science-based soil standards for PFAS, with funding from ARPA and federal infrastructure laws being used to address contamination in water systems. HB 1547 establishes remediation standards and aligns hazardous waste regulations with federal law.
- **Legislative Bills**: HB 1462 FN provides flexibility for motorcycle learners, while upcoming discussions on education bills indicate a focus on fiscal and policy matters in the education sector.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the importance of collaboration, science-based solutions, and proactive measures to address disaster recovery, environmental concerns, and legislative challenges.
