**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting – March 1, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on March 1, 2022, to discuss and deliberate on a wide range of transportation-related bills. The meeting was divided into multiple segments, including general discussions, work sessions, and executive sessions, with a focus on driver licensing, vehicle regulations, boating safety, and compliance with federal laws. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Driver Training and Licensing**
- **Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) for Commercial Driver’s Licenses (CDLs)**: The committee discussed aligning New Hampshire’s CDL training requirements with federal mandates. Debates centered on whether the training should apply to instructors and the potential for federal waivers. There was also consideration of lowering the CDL age requirement from 21 to 18 to address the truck driver shortage, though this remains under federal review.
- **Driver’s License Transfers**: **House Bill 1643**, which modifies driver’s license transfer requirements for new residents, was recommended for interim study to streamline the process and remove fines for non-compliance.
- **Temporary Licenses for Asylum Seekers**: The committee considered issuing temporary driver’s licenses to individuals with pending asylum applications, addressing the gap before they receive work permits. Supporters emphasized the lengthy asylum process and the need for legal driving during this period.

### **2. Real ID Act and Non-Citizens**
- The committee debated **House Bill 1463**, which aims to bring New Hampshire into full compliance with the Real ID Act of 2005. A major concern was the impact on approximately 29,000 non-citizens who currently hold driver’s licenses but will be unable to obtain Real ID-compliant licenses, limiting their access to federal buildings and air travel. The bill’s language and its implications for social security number requirements were scrutinized.
- **Undocumented Individuals and Driver’s Licenses**: Another bill proposed allowing undocumented individuals to obtain driver’s licenses, with supporters arguing it would improve public safety by ensuring drivers are tested and insured. Opponents raised concerns about undermining federal immigration laws and creating a "sanctuary state."

### **3. Vehicle Regulations and Inspections**
- **Annual Vehicle Inspections**: **House Bill 1474**, which maintains annual vehicle inspections, passed with strong support (18-1). Proponents highlighted the importance of safety checks and flexibility for low-income individuals to manage inspection and registration costs.
- **Eliminating Vehicle Inspections**: **House Bill 1426**, which sought to eliminate inspections for non-commercial vehicles, was deemed "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) due to safety concerns (18-0).
- **Antique Vehicle Exhaust Systems**: **House Bill 1534**, allowing antique vehicles to use side exhaust systems, passed unanimously with an amendment ensuring the exhaust is directed away from the vehicle and positioned at the rear edge of the door(s).
- **Vehicle Registration Fees**: **House Bill 1570**, which aimed to reduce vehicle registration fees, was ITL’d unanimously due to concerns about revenue loss for municipalities.

---

### **4. Boating Safety and Licensing**
- **Boater Safety Education**: The committee considered amendments to boater safety education, including allowing proctored online tests for boating licenses. The goal is to encourage New Hampshire residents to take the state-specific test rather than out-of-state options like Florida’s.
- **Speed Limits on Lake Winnipesaukee**: **House Bill 1424**, which sought to eliminate the speed limit for watercraft on Lake Winnipesaukee, was ITL’d (15-3) due to safety concerns.
- **Online Safe Boater Education Certificates**: **Senate Bill 307**, allowing online safe boater education certificates, received support for its accessibility and safety benefits, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns about online test security were addressed by the company providing the service.

---

### **5. Vehicle Mileage Tax and Privacy**
- **House Bill 1401**: The committee debated this bill, which would prevent the sharing of vehicle mileage data with entities enforcing motor vehicle tax laws. An amendment narrowed the scope to focus on third-party public authorities. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on road maintenance funding as gas tax revenue declines due to fuel-efficient and electric vehicles.

---

### **6. Technology and Law Enforcement**
- **Face Recognition Technology**: **House Bill 1447**, which would prohibit state agencies from using face recognition technology, was recommended for interim study. The committee agreed the bill required further stakeholder input and clarity.
- **Electronic Devices While Driving**: **House Bill 1562**, clarifying the prohibition on using electronic devices while driving, passed unanimously (19-0) and was moved to the consent calendar.
- **Vehicle Weighing**: **House Bill 1302**, prohibiting law enforcement from ordering non-commercial vehicles to drive to scales for weighing, passed narrowly (10-9) despite opposition from the Department of Safety.

---

### **7. Other Key Discussions**
- **House Bill 1341**: A housekeeping bill clarifying the definition of conviction for certain motor vehicle statutes passed unanimously (19-0).
- **Interim Studies**: Several bills, including those on face recognition technology and driver’s license transfers, were recommended for interim study to allow for further analysis and stakeholder input.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a focus on public safety, compliance with federal laws, and addressing stakeholder concerns. The committee advanced several bills with amendments, recommended interim studies for complex issues, and ITL’d proposals deemed problematic or unnecessary. Discussions highlighted the balancing act between privacy, safety, revenue, and federal compliance in transportation policy. The committee planned to resume deliberations on remaining bills in future sessions.
