**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (03/18/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on March 18, 2022, centered on two primary topics: the regulation and taxation of cannabis (House Bill 1237 and House Bill 1598) and adjustments to cigar bar regulations. The discussions were detailed and multifaceted, addressing legal, financial, operational, and social implications of cannabis legalization, as well as the economic impact on cigar bars.

### **1. Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The bulk of the meeting focused on the legalization, taxation, and regulation of cannabis in New Hampshire. Key aspects of the discussion included:

#### **Legislation and Policy**
- **House Bill 1237 and House Bill 1598**: These bills aim to legalize and regulate cannabis, with a focus on creating a controlled, state-run system. The committee emphasized the importance of balancing policy goals (e.g., ending arrests for cannabis-related offenses) with financial considerations.
- **Compromise and Caution**: Representatives stressed the need for compromise to achieve legalization while ensuring public safety, regulatory clarity, and financial benefits for the state.

#### **Revenue and Financial Projections**
- **Revenue Estimates**: The committee reviewed financial projections, estimating gross revenue of $250 million from cannabis sales, with net revenue of $50 million after operational costs. Excluding edibles could reduce revenue by 40%.
- **Phased Implementation**: Initial revenues are projected at $10 million in the first year, scaling up to $30 million by the third year, as stores open incrementally (3-4 per year).
- **Revenue Allocation**: Funds would first cover operational costs and repay state startup costs within five years. Remaining funds would be allocated as follows:
  - 50% to offset educational property taxes.
  - 30% to pay down the New Hampshire Retirement System debt.
  - 10% to public health programs (capped at $25 million).
  - 5% each to public safety agencies and behavioral health programs.

#### **Operational and Regulatory Framework**
- **Store Model**: The New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC) proposed a freestanding retail model, with stores strategically placed near borders to attract out-of-state customers. Products would be displayed in cases, similar to jewelry stores.
- **Cultivation and Licensing**: The bill initially capped cultivator licenses at 15, but the committee debated removing this cap to allow more small farms to participate. Vermont’s tiered licensing system was discussed as a potential model.
- **Quality Control and Testing**: The committee emphasized the need for consistent quality, mandatory independent lab testing, and indoor cultivation to mitigate environmental risks.
- **Enforcement**: Additional personnel, including certified police officers with specialized training, would be required. The NHLC would oversee a tracking system to monitor cannabis from cultivation to sale, combating the black market.

#### **Product Inclusion and Exclusions**
- **Edibles and Vaping Products**: There was significant debate over whether to include edibles and vaping products. Excluding them could reduce revenue but might mitigate risks of accessibility and public health concerns.
- **Manufacturing and Definitions**: Clear definitions and regulations for cannabis products, including manufacturing and testing, were highlighted as essential for safety and consistency.

#### **Banking and Financial Services**
- The committee discussed the challenges of banking for state-run cannabis operations, emphasizing the need for protections and clarity to mitigate financial risks.

#### **Opt-Out Clause and Local Control**
- Towns would have the option to opt out of allowing cannabis operations, a departure from the NHLC’s liquor store model, where towns have no say in placement.

### **2. Cigar Bar Regulations**
The committee also addressed adjustments to cigar bar regulations to support businesses affected by the pandemic:
- **Bill Purpose**: The bill aims to help cigar bars meet the 60% revenue threshold from tobacco sales by including cigarettes and loose tobacco in the calculation.
- **Debate**: While some representatives viewed the bill as unnecessary, others supported it as a temporary solution to pandemic-induced challenges. The Cigar Association of New Hampshire did not oppose the bill.

### **3. Agricultural and Economic Impact**
- **Agricultural Opportunities**: Cannabis legalization was seen as a way to boost New Hampshire’s agricultural sector, allowing small farms to diversify their crops.
- **Economic Growth**: The NHLC highlighted the potential for cannabis to generate significant revenue, support local businesses, and create jobs.

### **4. Next Steps and Amendments**
The committee planned to continue refining the bills, focusing on:
- Clarifying definitions and regulations for cannabis products.
- Finalizing amendments related to licensing, revenue distribution, and cultivation caps.
- Addressing outstanding questions about edibles, enforcement, and public health impacts.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a cautious yet forward-looking approach to cannabis legalization, balancing public safety, financial benefits, and regulatory clarity. The committee also sought to support cigar bars through targeted regulatory adjustments. Discussions will continue as the bills move through the legislative process, with a focus on ensuring a well-regulated, economically beneficial system for New Hampshire.
