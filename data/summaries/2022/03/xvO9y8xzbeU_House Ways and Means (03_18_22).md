The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 18, 2022, centered on the legalization and regulation of cannabis, with discussions spanning multiple bills and key aspects of implementation. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points across all segments:

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The primary focus was on **House Bill 1598**, which outlines the legal framework for cannabis retail sales, taxation, and enforcement. Key discussions included:

1. **Revenue and Financial Projections**:
   - Initial revenue estimates ranged from $40 million to $60 million annually, based on comparisons with states like Washington and Massachusetts. However, the exclusion of edibles (which account for 35-45% of sales in other states) reduced projections by 40%.
   - In the first year, with three to four stores operational, the state expected $10.5 million in revenue, with $3 million in operational costs, leaving $7.5 million in net revenue. By the third year, with all 10 stores open, revenue was projected to reach full potential.
   - Startup costs were estimated at $14 million, with initial stores funding the rollout of additional locations.

2. **Store Operations and Model**:
   - The New Hampshire Liquor Commission proposed a model with 10 small, strategically placed stores near state borders, resembling jewelry stores in terms of security and product display. These stores would be separate from liquor stores to avoid cross-contamination of consumer bases.
   - Operational costs per store were estimated at $350,000 annually, with personnel costs starting at $1.6 million and potentially growing to $2 million in the first year.

3. **Cultivation and Supply Chain**:
   - The bill initially capped cultivation facilities at 15, but there was discussion about removing this cap to allow market-driven growth. Concerns were raised about the supply chain, particularly the ratio of growers to stores, and the need for tracking systems to ensure product integrity and prevent black market activity.
   - The potential for multiple harvests per year could provide a windfall for small farms and agricultural businesses. A "negociant" role (similar to a wine negotiator) was proposed to assess product quality, educate growers, and ensure consistency.

4. **Enforcement and Regulation**:
   - The Liquor Commission’s Division of Enforcement Licensing would oversee cannabis regulation, establishing a Bureau of Cannabis Control with approximately eight staff members, including investigators and auditors.
   - Enforcement strategies focused on education, compliance, and preventing youth access, with collaboration between state and local law enforcement agencies.

5. **Revenue Allocation**:
   - Revenue would first cover operational costs, then repay the state for startup expenses within five years. Remaining funds would be allocated as follows:
     - **50%** to offset the state’s education property tax.
     - **30%** to pay down the New Hampshire Retirement System debt.
     - **10%** (capped at $25 million) to fund public health programs, including substance abuse cessation.
     - **5%** to support public safety agencies, such as police training for drug recognition.
     - **5%** to behavioral health programs for children.

6. **Edibles and Product Line**:
   - The bill excluded edibles, which raised concerns about revenue loss and potential enforcement challenges. There were also discussions about the need for clear definitions and regulations around edibles and vaping products.

### **Other Key Discussions**
- **Cigar Bar Legislation (House Bill 1537)**: The committee debated adjusting the definition of a cigar bar to include loose tobacco and cigarette sales in meeting the 60% tobacco sales threshold. Some representatives expressed concerns about the need for this change.
- **House Bill 1288**: This bill focused on updating language and increasing the amount of a non-lapsing revolving fund used for training, which is now entirely funded by agency funds. The committee unanimously passed the bill.
- **Vermont’s Cannabis Model**: Representative Romney highlighted Vermont’s licensing structure, which includes seven cultivation tiers with varying fees, allows vertical integration, and limits corporate consolidation. Vermont had recently finalized its rules and opened its initial application period.

### **Social and Policy Considerations**
- **Youth and Marijuana**: Concerns were raised about the message legalization sends to youth, with some representatives expressing discomfort with encouraging marijuana use among young people.
- **Compromise and Legalization**: There was a consensus that achieving legalization would require compromise, with a focus on stopping arrests and incarcerations related to marijuana use.
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: Discussions emphasized the need for regulatory flexibility to allow entrepreneurial spirit and trial and error in the emerging cannabis market.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of legalizing cannabis in New Hampshire, including financial projections, operational logistics, enforcement strategies, and legislative adjustments. The discussions underscored the need for a balanced approach that considers revenue generation, public safety, agricultural opportunities, and regulatory clarity. The bills are expected to undergo further refinement as they move through the legislative process.
