The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee meeting focused on **Senate Bill 397**, which pertains to the **Mental Health Counseling Compact**. The compact aims to facilitate interstate practice for mental health counselors, requiring 10 states to adopt it for activation. As of the meeting, nine states had already enacted it, with New Hampshire potentially being the tenth.

### Key Points Discussed:
1. **Compact Overview**:
   - The compact would allow licensed mental health counselors to practice across state lines without needing multiple licenses.
   - States like Maine, Maryland, Alabama, Louisiana, and Colorado have already enacted it, with 15 others considering it.
   - The compact includes provisions for disciplinary actions and primary jurisdiction in cases of misconduct.

2. **Concerns and Objections**:
   - **Representative Allegro** raised concerns about the compact’s requirement for **social and cultural diversity training**, calling it a "poison pill" and opposing it on ideological grounds.
   - Some members questioned the efficacy of **telehealth** for mental health counseling, with skepticism about its effectiveness compared to in-person sessions.

3. **Alternative Models**:
   - Discussion arose about alternative approaches, such as creating **reciprocal licensing agreements** with other states instead of joining the compact.
   - The **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** had successfully issued emergency licenses during the pandemic, which some members suggested could serve as a model for a permanent solution.

4. **Massachusetts Factor**:
   - Massachusetts, a key neighboring state, does not participate in compacts, which could limit the compact’s effectiveness for New Hampshire residents who often seek care in Massachusetts.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The subcommittee decided not to make a formal recommendation but to present the two models (joining the compact vs. creating reciprocal agreements) to the full committee for further discussion.
   - The committee acknowledged the need for more input from OPLC and other stakeholders before making a final decision.

### Conclusion:
The meeting highlighted the tension between adopting a national compact to streamline mental health services and concerns about specific provisions and the practicality of telehealth. The committee plans to explore both the compact and alternative licensing models in greater depth before making a recommendation.
