**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (04/13/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on April 13, 2022, to discuss three key bills: **Senate Bill 344** (remote public meetings), **Senate Bill 399 FN** (ultrasound requirements for abortions), and **Senate Bill 243** (transfer on death deeds). The discussions highlighted the balance between leveraging technology for accessibility, aligning laws with practical standards, and addressing legal and moral concerns.

### **Senate Bill 344: Remote Public Meetings**
This bill allows municipalities to adopt remote meeting options, aiming to increase public participation and accessibility while maintaining the integrity of public meetings.

1. **Key Provisions**:  
   - Municipalities must vote to adopt remote meeting options, either through town meetings or legislative bodies.  
   - At least **25% of the board must be physically present** during remote meetings.  
   - Meetings must be adjourned if public access is disrupted, and members must have their **video on** during remote participation.  
   - The bill does not affect existing authority under RSA 91-A, which allows for emergency meetings or remote participation via phone.

2. **Support**:  
   - Advocates, including the **New Hampshire Municipal Association** and the **New Hampshire Association of Counties**, highlighted the benefits of remote meetings during the pandemic, such as increased public engagement and flexibility for elected officials.  
   - Testimonies emphasized that remote meetings have strengthened democracy by making participation more accessible.

3. **Concerns and Clarifications**:  
   - **Representative Horgan** questioned whether the bill would eliminate the use of speakerphones for remote participation. It was clarified that existing statutes (RSA 91-A) remain intact, and the bill only adds the option for video-based remote meetings.  
   - **Representative Sylvia** raised concerns about the "reasonably practicable" clause, which allows members to participate remotely if they cannot attend in person. Supporters clarified that this should be interpreted narrowly, such as for health or caregiving reasons, not for convenience.  
   - **Representative Weather** questioned the fairness of cities versus towns in adopting the remote meeting option, as cities’ legislative bodies (e.g., city councils) can decide, while towns require voter approval. It was explained that this aligns with their respective forms of government.

4. **Potential Amendments**:  
   - Some representatives suggested amendments, such as requiring annual approval for remote meeting options or addressing broadband limitations that might hinder video participation.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - The hearing concluded with strong support for the bill, emphasizing its narrow, local-option approach and safeguards to ensure public access and participation.

### **Senate Bill 399 FN: Ultrasound Requirements for Abortions**
This bill clarifies that **ultrasounds are only required before abortions performed at least 24 weeks into pregnancy**, rather than for all abortions.

1. **Support**:  
   - **Senator Cindy Rosenwald** and advocates like **Planned Parenthood** argued that ultrasounds are not always medically necessary, especially in early pregnancies, and the current law imposes an undue burden on patients.  
   - Supporters emphasized that the bill aligns New Hampshire's abortion laws with clinical standards and reduces unnecessary medical procedures.

2. **Opposition**:  
   - Opponents, including **Ian Hwit**, raised concerns about the moral implications of late-term abortions and the protection of viable life.  
   - Testimonies highlighted the emotional and physical consequences of abortion, with some speakers sharing personal experiences.

### **Senate Bill 243: Transfer on Death Deeds**
This bill introduces **transfer on death deeds** for real property, allowing property to be transferred to a beneficiary without going through probate.

1. **Support**:  
   - **Senator Lou D’Allesandro**, the primary sponsor, explained that this would simplify estate planning and reduce legal costs.  
   - Supporters, including **Barbara Schult**, emphasized the bill's simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and the fact that 31 other states already allow this practice.

2. **Opposition**:  
   - Multiple attorneys and legal experts testified in opposition to the bill, citing concerns about its lack of clarity and potential for creating legal ambiguities.  
   - Key issues raised include:  
     - **No notice or acceptance requirement**: The bill does not require beneficiaries to be notified or accept the transfer, leading to uncertainty about property ownership.  
     - **Creditor claims**: There is an 18-month period where property remains subject to creditor claims, creating complications for beneficiaries.  
     - **Undue influence and fraud**: The bill lacks safeguards to prevent exploitation, particularly of elderly individuals.  
     - **Contingent beneficiaries**: The bill does not allow for naming contingent beneficiaries, which could lead to unintended outcomes.  
     - **Interplay with other statutes**: The bill does not address how it interacts with existing probate, trust, and durable power of attorney laws.  
   - Suggestions for improvement include adding witness requirements, notice provisions, and clearer guidance on forms and processes.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - While there was general support for the concept of transfer on death deeds, significant amendments were recommended to address the concerns raised.
