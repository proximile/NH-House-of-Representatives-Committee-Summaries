The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on April 26, 2022, focused on a wide range of legislative topics, including infrastructure funding, education services, mental health initiatives, and procedural matters. The discussions centered on several key bills and amendments, with a strong emphasis on fiscal responsibility, equity, and practical implementation. Here’s a detailed summary of the meeting:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

1. **House Bill 381 and Procedural Matters**  
   - The meeting began with a focus on **House Bill 381**, which was the primary item under consideration. An amendment to the bill was discussed, and the process of turning it around quickly (within three days) was deemed manageable.  
   - The session also briefly touched on **redistricting**, which had already been voted on, and a potential **5% raise** for certain individuals.  
   - The meeting concluded with a reminder of the next session at **11 o'clock**.

2. **Road and Infrastructure Funding**  
   - Significant attention was given to funding for **road maintenance, culverts, and real estate development**, particularly in the North Country. Representatives debated the allocation of funds and the process for ensuring roads meet current standards, emphasizing the economic importance of these projects.  
   - **Senate Bill 401**, which allocates $36 million for municipal bridge repairs, was discussed. Two amendments were proposed:  
     - **Amendment 1749** suggested distributing funds based on per capita bridge deck area, favoring smaller towns.  
     - **Amendment 1756** proposed a 50-50 split between population and bridge deck area, aligning with the block grant aid formula.  
   - The committee favored **Amendment 1756** for its equity and ease of implementation, and the bill moved forward with the recommended changes.

3. **Toll Evasion Enforcement (Senate Bill 442)**  
   - The Department of Transportation proposed changes to address toll evasion, including suspending vehicle registration privileges sooner and prohibiting vehicle transfers to circumvent DMV holds. The goal was to improve toll collection efficiency and fairness.

4. **Hampton Beach Feasibility Study (Senate Bill 346)**  
   - An amendment redirected funding for a feasibility study on a potential pier project to the **Hampton Beach Area Commission** instead of the Department of Environmental Services. Representatives supported the project as an economic driver for the region.

5. **Special Education Services (Senate Bill 381)**  
   - The committee reconsidered a bill extending special education services to students until their 22nd birthday. Amendments clarified funding mechanisms and removed references to adult developmental disability services to avoid legal conflicts.

6. **Mental Health and Policing (Senate Bill 376)**  
   - A bill addressing police interactions with individuals experiencing mental health crises was amended to reduce funding for **Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training** and streamline the committee structure overseeing the initiative.

7. **Electric School Bus Pilot Program (Senate Bill 417)**  
   - The bill establishes a pilot program to examine the use of electric school buses in New Hampshire.  
   - **Kelly Buchanan**, Director of Legislative and Regulatory Affairs for Clean Energy NH, explained that the program would leverage existing funds, including the Volkswagen Mitigation Trust Fund and federal infrastructure funding.  
   - Concerns were raised about safety, battery performance in cold weather, and cost savings for school districts.  
   - An amendment was proposed to ensure funding from the **Public School Infrastructure Fund** could also be used for electric school buses, which passed 5-2.  
   - The bill, as amended, was recommended for passage (OTP-A).

8. **Golf Links Road Funding (Senate Bill 703)**  
   - The bill proposes $4.1 million in general funds to upgrade **Golf Links Road**, a state road in Dixville Notch, to support the **Balsams redevelopment project**.  
   - The funding is contingent on the project’s progress, ensuring the state’s investment is protected.  
   - Concerns were raised about the state’s role in funding a road that primarily benefits a private development.  
   - The Department of Transportation clarified that the road would eventually be transferred to the town or county, and the developer would assume responsibility.  
   - The committee debated the necessity and equity of the funding, with some members suggesting alternative approaches.

### **Overall Focus**

Throughout the meeting, the committee discussed the financial implications, equity, and practicality of the proposed bills and amendments. The discussions underscored a commitment to responsible use of taxpayer funds, supporting infrastructure improvements, and addressing critical issues such as education, mental health, and economic development.
