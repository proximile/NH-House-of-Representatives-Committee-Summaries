**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (04/08/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 8, 2022, focused on several bills aimed at improving the criminal justice system, public safety, and law enforcement accountability. The discussions covered a wide range of issues, including police misconduct, mental health crisis intervention, bail commissioners’ compensation, and infrastructure funding. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Police Misconduct Investigations (Segment 1/5)**  
   - A bill was introduced to establish a formal process for handling allegations of police misconduct. Complaints would be collected, investigated internally by the chief law enforcement officer, and reviewed by a conduct review committee with legal oversight. If misconduct is found, the officer’s certification may be reviewed by the Police Standards and Training Council. The bill also mandates reporting requirements, even if an officer resigns during an investigation.

2. **Escapes from Correctional Facilities (Segment 1/5)**  
   - This bill seeks to clarify penalties for escapes from state facilities, classifying them as felonies rather than misdemeanors, regardless of whether force is used. The change aims to ensure accountability and deterrence, particularly for serious offenders.

3. **Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Training (Segments 1/5, 2/5, 3/5)**  
   - A bill proposed funding to train at least one police officer in every jurisdiction in CIT, which is essential for handling mental health crises. Testimony from organizations like NAMI NH highlighted that over 60% of officer-involved shootings in NH involve individuals with mental health issues. The bill also establishes a study committee to review such incidents, focusing on improving procedures and training without being punitive.  
   - There was debate on whether CIT training should be mandatory for all officers, with some suggesting it be implemented a year after initial training to allow officers to gain experience first. Success stories were shared, demonstrating how CIT training has helped de-escalate situations and save lives.

4. **Bail Commissioners’ Reimbursement (Segments 1/5, 5/5)**  
   - A bill proposed mileage reimbursement for bail commissioners in addition to their flat $40 fee, based on IRS mileage rates. However, bail commissioners testified that the real issue is the non-payment of their $40 fee, not mileage. They emphasized the financial burden of their role, including mileage and vehicle maintenance, and called for enforcement mechanisms to ensure payment before considering mileage reimbursement.  
   - The fiscal note attached to previous bills indicated significant costs, and commissioners argued that the state should prioritize ensuring they are paid their $40 fee first.

5. **Reimbursement for Sheriff’s Offices (Segment 2/5)**  
   - **SB 303** addresses the disparity in reimbursement rates for sheriff’s offices providing prisoner custody and control services. Currently, sheriffs are reimbursed at about half the rate of other court security officers. Testimony highlighted the dangerous nature of the job and the difficulty in recruiting and retaining personnel due to low pay. The committee unanimously voted to recommend the bill for passage.

6. **Review Board for Police Incidents Involving Mental Health Issues (Segments 2/5, 4/5, 5/5)**  
   - **SB 376** proposes establishing a study committee to review officer-involved shootings involving individuals with mental health issues. The committee would examine tactics and training to prevent future incidents, rather than reviewing the legality of shootings. Supporters emphasized the need for improved training and mental health crisis response systems.  
   - Amendments were suggested, including funding for CIT training facilitation and instruction, but no formal amendments were presented during the meeting. The committee moved to pass the bill as is, with plans to address amendments later if necessary.

7. **Property Tax Relief and Infrastructure Funding (Segment 3/5)**  
   - **Senate Bill 401**, introduced by Senator Chuck Morse, aims to provide property tax relief using state surplus funds. The bill includes allocations for municipal bridge repairs, road construction grants, and funding for body-worn and dashboard cameras for law enforcement, with the goal of enhancing public safety.

8. **Other Bills (Segment 5/5)**  
   - **Senate Bill 456** was referred for interim study, as it was identical to another bill in the Senate.

- **Mental Health Crisis Response**: The discussions highlighted the need for improved mental health crisis intervention, with CIT training and review boards proposed as key solutions.
- **Bail Commissioners’ Compensation**: Bail commissioners expressed frustration with the lack of payment for their services and called for legislative action to ensure fair compensation.
- **Public Safety and Infrastructure**: Bills addressing public safety, such as funding for body-worn cameras and infrastructure repairs, aimed to enhance community safety and provide tax relief.
- **Unanimous Support for Key Bills**: Several bills, including **SB 303** (sheriff’s reimbursement) and the police misconduct investigation bill, received unanimous support from the committee.
