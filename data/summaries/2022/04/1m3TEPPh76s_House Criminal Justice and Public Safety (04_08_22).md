---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Law Enforcement Accountability and Training**
   - **Senate Bill 401**: Introduced by Senator Chuck Morse, this bill allocates surplus state funds to provide property tax relief, including $36 million for municipal bridge programs, $30 million for state road construction grants, and funding for body-worn and dashboard cameras for law enforcement. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and received broad support in the House, though concerns were raised about privacy and data storage costs for the camera program.
   - **Senate Bill 456**: This bill establishes a Law Enforcement Conduct Review Committee within the Police Standards and Training Council to review complaints of police misconduct. It appropriates $350,000 for FY23 and aims to increase transparency and accountability. The bill, based on recommendations from the Governor’s LEACT Commission, received unanimous Senate support.
   - **Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Training**: Multiple bills, including **Senate Bill 376**, emphasized the need for CIT training to improve law enforcement responses to mental health crises. Testimony from NAMI New Hampshire highlighted that over 60% of individuals shot by police in the past decade had mental health issues. The training focuses on de-escalation techniques and role-playing scenarios with individuals who have lived experience with mental illness.

2. **Mental Health Crisis Review**
   - **Senate Bill 376**: This bill proposes creating a study committee to review officer-involved shootings involving individuals with mental health issues. It also includes funding for CIT training, particularly for smaller and rural police departments. The bill passed with unanimous support for interim study, with amendments to add a program administrator to guide the review board.

3. **Transport and Handcuffing Policies**
   - Discussions highlighted the trauma caused by handcuffing individuals in crisis and the need for effective communication by first responders. While CIT training was emphasized, it was noted that it is not mandatory statewide, with some larger departments implementing it voluntarily.

4. **Reimbursement for Sheriff’s Offices**
   - **Senate Bill 303**: This bill seeks to increase the reimbursement rate for sheriff’s offices providing prisoner custody and control services in courthouses, addressing a budget oversight that currently reimburses them at half the rate of other court security officers. The committee voted 21-0 in favor, recommending it "ought to pass."

5. **Escape Penalties**
   - **Senate Bill 222**: The bill addresses penalties for escape from state facilities, making escape a felony regardless of whether force is used. Testimony from the NH Department of Corrections and Police Standards and Training highlighted the challenges of prosecuting escapees and the need for consistent felony charges. Concerns were raised about the bill’s language, particularly for individuals serving misdemeanor sentences.

6. **Bail Commissioner Mileage Reimbursement**
   - **Senate Bill 361**: This bill proposes mileage reimbursement for bail commissioners in addition to their standard $40 fee. While some commissioners supported the bill, others opposed it, arguing that the core issue is the lack of enforcement for collecting the $40 fee. The bill passed with 19 yays and 2 nays, but concerns about its effectiveness and fiscal impact remain.

### **Privacy Concerns and Dash Cams**
- An amendment to allow the Department of Transportation (DOT) to install dash cams in their vehicles for safety and training purposes was discussed. Privacy concerns were addressed, with assurances that video would be stored for only three days unless needed for specific incidents. The bill passed with a vote of 19 yays and 2 nays, with a minority report requested due to privacy objections.

### **Tributes to Representative Renny Cushing**
- Several representatives honored the late Representative Renny Cushing, praising his dedication to public service, his passion for justice, and his significant contributions to criminal justice reform, including the abolition of the death penalty in New Hampshire.

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**
- The committee voted on multiple bills, with several passing unanimously or with strong support. Bills addressing mental health crisis response, law enforcement accountability, and financial relief for residents were prioritized. Further discussions and amendments are expected for bills like SB 222 and SB 376 to address concerns about language and implementation.
