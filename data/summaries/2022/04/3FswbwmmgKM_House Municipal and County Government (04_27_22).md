### **Senate Bill 329 (SB 329): Housing Development Commission and Procedural Disputes**
1. **Initial Motion**:

   - An amendment (2022-1828H) introduced provisions related to **municipal budget law** and included **3D-printed housing** and **manufactured housing** as areas for the commission to study.
   - Critics argued the amendment was non-germane, as it introduced unrelated budget law provisions, detracting from the bill’s housing focus.

3. **Procedural Confusion**:
   - Significant confusion arose over the order of amendments and whether multiple amendments could be considered simultaneously. The chair and clerk clarified that amendments must be addressed one at a time.

   - Despite objections, the amendment passed **10-8**, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it.

7. **Request to Reconsider**:
   - Representative Van attempted to introduce Representative Rung’s amendment, but procedural confusion delayed the effort. The chair apologized for earlier missteps and allowed the process to move forward.
