### **Public Safety and Youth Services**
1. **SB 458**: Focused on reducing the types of criminal activities for which commitment to the Sununu Youth Services Center is possible and proposed a six-bed replacement facility. Concerns were raised about public safety and the adequacy of six beds, with no clear solution for children requiring level 5 security if the Sununu Center closes. The bill passed 13-7.  
2. **SB 376**: Established a mental health incident review board to address police interactions with mentally ill individuals, with a $1.1 million appropriation for training and oversight. It passed unanimously (20-0).

### **Education**
1. **SB 381**: Created an advocacy office for special education, with an amendment removing authority from the child advocate office. Concerns about duplication of efforts led to a 15-6 vote, with plans for a minority report.  
2. **SB 394**: Aligned New Hampshire with federal legislation allowing students with disabilities to stay in school until age 21, including funding for school districts to cover unexpected costs. It passed 22-1.  
3. **SB 420**: Established an extraordinary need grant for schools with low property values and high free/reduced lunch rates. The bill passed 14-6, with a minority report planned.

### **Infrastructure and Environment**

### **Elections and Voting**
1. **SB 363**: Allowed certain retirement system members to purchase non-qualified service time to reduce retirement age requirements. It passed unanimously (21-0).  
2. **SB 366**: Proposed auditing election machines to enhance voter confidence, but critics argued the cost ($100,000) and minimal impact (auditing only 2 out of 300+ machines) made it inefficient. A motion to kill the bill (ITL) passed 12-9, but a subsequent motion to pass it (OTP) also passed 12-9, leading to confusion and further discussion.  
3. **SB 418**: Aimed to verify voter affidavits but faced concerns over violating federal laws (e.g., overseas military voting deadlines) and voter anonymity. A motion for interim study failed, and the bill passed 12-9 with an amendment aligning timeframes.

- **Federal Compliance**: Bills like SB 418 (voter affidavits) raised concerns about violating federal laws, particularly regarding military voting deadlines.  
- **Duplication of Efforts**: SB 381 (special education advocacy office) and SB 376 (mental health incident review board) sparked debates about potential overlaps with existing programs.
