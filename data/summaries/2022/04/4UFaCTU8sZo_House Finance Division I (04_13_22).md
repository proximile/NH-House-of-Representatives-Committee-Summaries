The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I held a work session on **Senate Bill 445**, which was presented earlier in the morning with an amendment. The discussion focused on the **Hennessey Amendment (2022-1351s)**, which aimed to add the word "successfully" before "challenges" in the bill. The amendment was designed to clarify the process for providers to challenge funding applications in areas where construction for broadband infrastructure had already commenced. 

**Key Points:**
1. **Purpose of the Amendment:** The amendment ensures that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund overbuilding in areas where private companies like Comcast are already investing in infrastructure. If a provider has initiated construction, they can challenge another provider's eligibility for funding in that area.
2. **Explanation by Maura Weston:** Representing the New England Cable and Telecommunications Association, Weston explained that the amendment prevents redundant investments by ensuring that grants are directed to unserved areas, not areas already being serviced by private capital.
3. **Discussion on Clarity:** Some representatives found the language of the amendment "clumsy" and debated whether it needed further refinement. However, after Weston's detailed explanation, the committee agreed that the amendment was clear in its intent and did not require further changes.
4. **Voting:** The committee voted unanimously (7-0) to adopt the Hennessey Amendment and subsequently passed Senate Bill 445 as amended. The bill will now move to the full Finance Committee for further consideration.
5. **Next Steps:** The full Finance Committee is scheduled to meet on April 26th to continue discussions on the bill.

The session concluded with a reminder of the upcoming meeting and adjournment.
