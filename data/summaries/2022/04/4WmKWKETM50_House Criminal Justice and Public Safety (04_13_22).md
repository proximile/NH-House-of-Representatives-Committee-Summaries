The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety held a series of meetings on April 13, 2022, to discuss several key pieces of legislation aimed at improving public safety and reforming the criminal justice system. The discussions focused primarily on **Senate Bill 294 (SB 294)**, which addresses bail reform, and **Senate Bill 306 (SB 306)**, which seeks to enhance penalties for distracted driving. Additionally, other bills related to public safety, such as **SB 292** and **SB 299**, were debated. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key points and outcomes:

---

### **Senate Bill 294: Bail Reform**
1. **Current System and Concerns**:
   - The bill addresses the role of **bail commissioners**, who handle bail decisions outside court hours. Concerns were raised about inconsistencies in their decisions, lack of accountability to the judicial system, and the potential release of repeat offenders or individuals charged with serious crimes.

2. **Proposed Changes**:
   - SB 294 would require defendants accused of serious crimes (e.g., domestic violence, stalking, repeat offenses) to appear before a judge for bail hearings, eliminating the use of bail commissioners for these cases.
   - This would increase the court system’s workload, estimated at **11.8 additional hearings per day** statewide, with significant fiscal implications.

3. **Magistrate System Proposal**:
   - Several representatives advocated for transitioning to a **magistrate system**, where magistrates (court employees) would handle bail decisions 24/7. This system was seen as more accountable and cost-effective but would require time to implement (estimated by January 2024).

4. **Amendments and Debate**:
   - **Amendment 1509-H** sought to align SB 294 with **House Bill 1476 (HB 1476)**, which had already passed the House, by maintaining language in Section 8 of the law. This would ensure individuals charged with serious crimes are detained pending arraignment.
   - The amendment was **rejected** in a 9-11 vote, with opponents arguing that current law is sufficient and that the changes would burden the court system.

5. **Final Outcome**:
   - After extensive debate and procedural challenges, the committee voted to recommend SB 294 as **"Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL)**, effectively killing the bill for the session.

### **Senate Bill 306: Enhanced Penalties for Distracted Driving**
1. **Purpose and Provisions**:
   - SB 306 aims to deter distracted driving by increasing penalties for violations involving mobile electronic devices, particularly in cases resulting in serious bodily injury or death.
   - Offenses such as reckless and negligent driving would be elevated from violations to misdemeanors or felonies, depending on severity.

2. **Testimonies and Support**:
   - **Lisa Beaudoin**, a victim of a distracted driving crash, shared her personal story, emphasizing the life-altering impact of her injuries and the inadequate penalties faced by the driver.
   - **Lieutenant Brian Strong** of the New Hampshire State Police testified that distracted driving is one of the top three causes of serious crashes in the state.
   - **Senator John Reagan** and others stressed the need for stronger penalties to improve public safety.

3. **Committee Decision**:
   - The committee voted **16-4** in favor of passing the bill, reflecting strong support for enhancing penalties to address distracted driving.

### **Other Bills Discussed**
1. **SB 292: Notification for Escapees**:
   - The committee discussed improving notifications for escapees but determined that the issue could be resolved without legislation. The motion for **interim study** passed unanimously.

2. **SB 299: Penalties for Escape**:
   - The bill proposed classifying escape from custody as a felony rather than a misdemeanor. While some argued this was necessary due to the seriousness of the offense, others expressed concerns about overly harsh penalties for minor infractions. The motion to pass the bill passed **15-4**.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**
1. **Public Safety vs. Judicial Efficiency**:
   - Discussions highlighted the tension between enhancing public safety through stricter penalties and bail reforms and the practical challenges of implementing these changes, including increased court workloads and fiscal impacts.

2. **Data and Accountability**:
   - There was a call for better data collection to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed reforms, particularly regarding bail decisions and distracted driving outcomes.

3. **Procedural Complexities**:
   - The committee faced challenges in reconciling differing opinions on amendments and procedural issues, which complicated decision-making on key bills like SB 294.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing critical public safety issues, including bail reform and distracted driving. While **SB 306** gained strong support for its focus on enhanced penalties, **SB 294** faced significant opposition and was ultimately rejected due to concerns about its practicality and impact on the court system. The discussions highlighted the need for balanced, data-driven approaches to criminal justice reform, with further exploration of alternatives like the magistrate system anticipated in future sessions.
