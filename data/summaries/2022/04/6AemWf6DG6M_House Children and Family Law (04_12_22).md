The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 12, 2022, focused on several key pieces of legislation related to child welfare, juvenile justice, and family law. The discussions centered on **Senate Bill 458**, **Senate Bill 431**, and **Senate Bill 446**, addressing issues ranging from the closure of the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC) to child support guidelines and the child care workforce crisis. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **Senate Bill 458: Closure of Sununu Youth Services Center and Juvenile Justice Reform**
1. **Background and Purpose**:
   - The SYSC, plagued by systemic abuse and lawsuits, is mandated to close by **March 2023**. SB 458 proposes replacing it with a smaller, state-run facility for **6-12 high-risk youth**, emphasizing trauma-informed, evidence-based care.
   - The bill includes robust oversight by the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) to ensure accountability and transparency.

2. **Facility Details**:
   - The new facility will feature private sleeping rooms, crisis stabilization spaces, and programs for education, family visitation, and rehabilitation.
   - The proposed **$15 million construction budget** and **$50 million appropriation** were discussed, with concerns raised about operational costs (estimated at **$9-10 million annually**).

3. **Debate and Concerns**:
   - Some representatives and advocates, including **Neil Kirk**, opposed the state-run model, advocating for a **private, non-profit facility** that could qualify for Medicaid reimbursement and reduce costs.
   - Emotional testimony highlighted the **abuse and trauma** suffered by youth at SYSC, with over 500 allegations of abuse and 11 staff members incarcerated, primarily for sexual assault.
   - Critics argued the bill creates a "mini Sununu Center" instead of focusing on **community-based treatment** and diversion programs.

4. **Timeline and Transition**:
   - Construction of the new facility is expected to be completed by **June 2024**, with potential interim out-of-state placements if the facility is not ready by the SYSC closure date.
   - Pre-petition assessments under **SB 94 (2021)** have successfully diverted 70% of youth from the court system, reducing reliance on institutional care.

5. **Final Actions**:
   - The committee passed an amendment proposing a **6-bed facility**, with flexibility for the Finance Committee to adjust the number. The bill aims to balance immediate needs with long-term juvenile justice reform.

### **Senate Bill 431: Child Support Adjustments for Equal Parenting**
1. **Purpose and Provisions**:
   - SB 431 aims to clarify child support guidelines in cases of **equal or approximately equal parenting responsibilities**, ensuring fairness for both parents and children.
   - The bill proposes using the **net difference method** to calculate child support when parents’ incomes differ significantly and clarifies the allocation of **variable expenses** (e.g., education, vacations).

2. **Debate and Concerns**:
   - Representatives questioned the fairness of child support calculations, particularly for higher-earning parents, and whether equal parenting time alone should justify deviations from guidelines.
   - **Mary Krueger** from NH Legal Assistance raised concerns about the impact on **domestic violence survivors**, warning that changes could enable financial manipulation by abusers.
   - Advocates argued the bill simplifies the law and provides a **child-focused framework**, while critics expressed concerns about increased subjectivity and court involvement.

3. **Support and Next Steps**:
   - Proponents emphasized the bill’s focus on **fairness to children** and reducing disputes between parents. The committee will continue reviewing the bill before making a recommendation.

   - The plan, due by **June 30, 2022**, will focus on increasing access to affordable child care, improving wages and benefits, and ensuring long-term industry stability.

2. **Support and Testimony**:
   - Testimony highlighted the critical role of child care in supporting working families and the economy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - The bill received strong bipartisan support, with advocates emphasizing the need for immediate action to prevent further facility closures and retain workers.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
