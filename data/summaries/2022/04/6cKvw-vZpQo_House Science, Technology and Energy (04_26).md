### **Key Focus: Senate Bill 271 and Burgess BioPower**

1. **Complexity of the Issue**:  
   - Representatives acknowledged the multifaceted nature of supporting the forest products industry, which has economic ripple effects on tourism, cross-country skiing, hiking, and other sectors. They emphasized the need for a **permanent solution** rather than temporary fixes.  
   - The bill initially proposed forgiving Burgess BioPower’s $58 million debt, but the committee debated an **amendment** to extend the cap on over-market payments for another year instead of forgiving the debt. This amendment requires the plant to open its financial records to the Department of Energy for investigation.  

2. **Amendment Debate**:  
   - The committee debated whether the amendment provided enough time for a comprehensive solution. Some argued for a **shorter deadline** to ensure urgency, while others advocated for a longer timeline to allow for thorough consideration.  
   - The amendment to extend the deadline until **November 2023** was **adopted by a vote of 16 to 6**, and the amended bill was **passed by a vote of 22 to 6**. A **minority report** will be written by Representative Samsich, who opposed the amendment.  

3. **Biomass Plant Subsidies and Alternatives**:  
   - There was disagreement over whether subsidizing biomass plants is the best way to support the forest industry. Some proposed alternative ideas, such as the state purchasing low-grade timber and selling it back to biomass plants at a discount.  
   - Concerns were raised about the plant’s economic viability, its ability to repay its debt, and its reliance on subsidies.  

4. **Audit and Study Committee**:  
   - The bill includes an **audit** of Burgess BioPower’s financial viability and establishes a **study committee** to explore long-term solutions for the forest products industry.  

5. **Broader Economic Concerns**:  
   - Several representatives emphasized the need for a broader solution to support New Hampshire’s **forest products industry**, beyond just addressing Burgess BioPower’s financial issues. A commission to study the forestry industry was mentioned as a potential step toward sustainable economic solutions.

   - The committee discussed **field trips** in May to locations such as the New Hampshire Electric Co-op’s solar array in Moultonborough and other sites of interest to gain further insight into energy-related issues.  

2. **Committee Luncheon**:  
   - A **committee luncheon** was proposed for May 24, potentially combined with a subcommittee work session on interim study bills.  

3. **Interim Study Bills**:

### **Key Debates**

1. **Ratepayer Impact**:  
   - Some members expressed concerns about the potential for increased costs to ratepayers, while others argued that the plant’s broader economic benefits, such as job creation and support for the local economy, justify continued support.  

2. **Regulatory Authority**:  
   - Questions were raised about the legislature’s authority to direct the Public Utilities Commission and the Department of Energy, particularly regarding financial audits and regulatory decisions.
