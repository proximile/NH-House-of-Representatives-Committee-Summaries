**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (04/12/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on April 12, 2022, to discuss and deliberate on a range of bills related to energy policy, renewable energy, environmental conservation, and infrastructure. The meeting spanned multiple segments, addressing key issues such as offshore wind development, biomass energy, electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, and youth environmental engagement. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Renewable Energy and Offshore Wind Development**
1. **Senate Bill 440 (Offshore Wind Development)**:
   - The bill, which ensures New Hampshire’s participation in federal offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine, passed unanimously (18-0). It was placed on the consent calendar, reflecting bipartisan support for the state’s involvement in regional renewable energy initiatives.

2. **Senate Bill 265 (Electric Customer Aggregation)**:
   - This bill allows counties to aggregate electric customers, benefiting small towns by enabling competitive power purchase agreements. Senator Jay Kahn, the sponsor, emphasized the opt-in nature of the program, which passed after a public hearing.

3. **Senate Bill 270 and SB 424 (Renewable Natural Gas)**:
   - SB 270 was reconsidered and amended to address concerns from the Department of Energy, including cost recovery and enforcement mechanisms. SB 424, which establishes a pilot program for renewable natural gas, sparked debate over methane emissions and natural gas infrastructure expansion. Both bills advanced, with some members expressing environmental concerns.

### **Biomass Energy and Burgess Biopower**
1. **Senate Bill 271 (Burgess Biopower)**:
   - Burgess Biopower, a biomass plant in Berlin, NH, faces financial challenges due to a $58 million obligation from a previous bill (SB 577). SB 271 seeks to address this by ensuring costs are borne by ratepayers without imposing new charges. The plant generates 75 megawatts of renewable energy, supports 240 jobs, and contributes $70 million annually to the state economy. Despite opposition from the Department of Energy and concerns about ratepayer burden, the committee voted 15-5 in favor of the bill, citing its economic and environmental benefits.

2. **Debate on Biomass Subsidies**:
   - Critics, including the Josiah Bartlett Center, argued that subsidies unfairly burden ratepayers, potentially increasing electricity costs by $2-$3 monthly. Proponents highlighted the plant’s role in supporting the forestry industry, wildfire prevention, and local economies. The discussion underscored the tension between economic necessity and financial fairness.

### **Youth Environmental Engagement**
1. **Senate Bill 263 (Youth Environmental Education and Conservation Council)**:
   - The bill proposes creating a council for youth (ages 12–25) to engage in environmental education, conservation, and policy advising. Testimonies from youth advocates emphasized the importance of integrating young voices into environmental decision-making. The bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, was discussed with concerns raised about logistics, diversity, and funding.

### **Electric Vehicles and Infrastructure**
1. **Senate Bill 448 (State Fleet Transition to EVs)**:
   - The bill aims to transition the state vehicle fleet to electric vehicles where feasible, practical, and cost-effective. It emphasizes planning for charging infrastructure and leveraging funds from the Volkswagen settlement and federal infrastructure bills. Concerns about grid capacity and modernization were addressed, with the bill seen as timely given the increasing cost-effectiveness of EVs.

2. **Senate Bill 321 (Pilot Program for Limited Energy Producers)**:
   - This bill proposes a pilot program to allow limited energy producers (1-5 megawatts) to engage in intra-state electricity sales. Debate centered on jurisdiction, transmission costs, and feasibility, with stakeholders suggesting caps, reporting requirements, and a sunset date to ensure clarity and effectiveness.

---

### **Other Key Discussions and Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 261 (Net Metering)**:
   - An amendment adjusted the payment period for net metering credits from yearly to quarterly, with a $25 threshold. The Department of Energy supported the amendment, clarifying its application to both older and newer customer generators.

2. **Senate Bill 256 (Study Committee for Site Evaluation Committee)**:
   - A bill was discussed to establish a study committee to evaluate replacing the Site Evaluation Committee with a new structure, aiming to improve long-term energy project evaluations.

3. **Senate Bill 259 (Net Metering for State Housing Authorities)**:
   - The bill was referred to interim study due to concerns about expanding net metering opportunities and the need for further analysis.

---

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**
- The committee moved several bills forward, including SB 440, SB 270, and SB 448, with amendments to address technical and policy issues.
- Executive sessions were scheduled for April 19 and 21 to address additional bills, including SB 321 and SB 448.
- The meeting highlighted the state’s commitment to advancing renewable energy, supporting local economies, and addressing environmental challenges while balancing financial and logistical considerations.
