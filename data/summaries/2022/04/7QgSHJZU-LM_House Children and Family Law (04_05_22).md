### **Senate Bill 144: Enrollment-Based Child Care Scholarships**
The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 144**, which proposes a pilot program to shift from attendance-based to **enrollment-based child care scholarships**. The bill aims to provide stable funding for child care providers and reduce financial burdens on low-income families. Key points included:

### **Senate Bill 326: Office of Early Childhood**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 326**, which seeks to create an **Office of Early Childhood** to coordinate and integrate early childhood programs across state agencies. The goal is to reduce fragmentation and improve access to services for families. Key points included:

### **Senate Bill 457: Non-Profit Liability Study**
The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 457**, which proposes a study committee to address **insurance challenges** faced by non-profits contracting with DHHS for children’s services. Key points included:
- **Issue**: Non-profits like Waypoint and Spaulding Youth Center have lost umbrella insurance coverage due to high liability risks, threatening their ability to operate.
- **Proposed Solution**: The committee would explore extending **limited liability protection** to non-profits, similar to the state’s liability cap of $475,000, to ensure their sustainability.
- **Concerns**: Opponents argue that limited liability could reduce accountability. The study aims to balance protection for non-profits with maintaining accountability.
