### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting  
**Committee:** Municipal and County Government  
**Date:** April 7, 2022  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives, through its Municipal and County Government Committee, held a comprehensive meeting to discuss several bills addressing issues related to municipal governance, housing development, property assessments, and short-term rentals. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and debates from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**  

#### **1. Private Roads and Housing Development**  
- **Senate Bill 246 (SB 246)**: This bill addresses issues with private roads in condominium and homeowners associations (HOAs). It requires developers to either build roads to municipal standards or establish a capital reserve fund for future repairs. The bill aims to protect homeowners from unexpected assessment fees and ensure safer roads for emergency services.  
  - **Support**: Residents and lawmakers highlighted the financial burden on homeowners due to poorly maintained private roads, especially in newer developments. Environmental concerns were also raised, as substandard roads contribute to pollution and runoff.  
  - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Home Builders Association argued that the bill would increase costs for developers and homebuyers, potentially exacerbating the housing affordability crisis.  

- **Senate Bill 329 (SB 329)**: This bill establishes a study commission to examine barriers to housing development, particularly workforce and middle-income housing. The commission would explore federal resources, density issues, and other factors contributing to the state’s housing shortage.

#### **2. Municipal Trash Pickup and Condominium Fees**  
- **Senate Bill 245 (SB 245)**: This bill proposes a study committee to examine agreements between developers and municipalities regarding trash removal fees paid by condominium owners. The issue arose in Hampton, where condominium owners were excluded from municipal trash pickup despite paying property taxes.  
  - **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the fairness of charging fees for services not rendered. The committee debated expanding the scope to include other services like plowing and recycling but ultimately kept the focus on condominiums.

#### **3. Short-Term Rentals (STRs)**  
- **Senate Bill 249 (SB 249)**: This bill seeks to prohibit municipalities from banning short-term rentals in single or two-family homes while allowing towns to regulate aspects like parking, noise, and sanitation.  
  - **Support**: Proponents, including short-term rental operators, argued that STRs are a residential use of property and contribute significantly to the state’s tourism economy. They emphasized the importance of protecting property owners’ rights.  
  - **Opposition**: Many mayors, select board members, and residents opposed the bill, arguing it undermines local control and exacerbates the affordable housing crisis by reducing long-term rental availability. Concerns were also raised about noise, traffic, and the commercialization of residential neighborhoods.  
  - **Legal Implications**: The debate hinges on whether STRs are considered residential or commercial use, with a pending state Supreme Court decision potentially clarifying this issue.

#### **4. Financial Accountability and Property Assessments**  
- **Senate Bill 239 (SB 239)**: This bill enforces financial audit requirements for political subdivisions (e.g., towns, precincts, school districts) that fail to comply with state laws. It introduces penalties of up to $250 per day for non-compliance, inspired by cases like Woodsville, which failed to conduct audits for 10 years.  
  - **Support**: Lawmakers emphasized the need for accountability and transparency in the use of taxpayer funds.  
  - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) argued that small towns may struggle with compliance and that fines are rarely levied.  

- **Senate Bill 312 (SB 312)**: This bill allows assessors to correct errors in property appraisals annually, ensuring assessments are proportional within municipalities. It was prompted by a court case (*Merrimack Premium Outlets v. Town of Merrimack*) that restricted error corrections to revaluation cycles.  
  - **Support**: Assessors and the NHMA argued the bill restores fairness and accuracy to property assessments.

#### **5. Housing Development and Municipal Tools**  
- **Senate Bill 400 (SB 400)**: This omnibus bill provides municipalities with tools and incentives to address the state’s housing shortage, particularly workforce and senior housing. It includes provisions for training planning boards, extending tax relief periods, and creating a Housing Champion Certification program to reward housing-friendly policies.  
  - **Support**: Housing advocates emphasized the urgency of the housing crisis, with rising home prices and low inventory. They argued the bill incentivizes development and supports the workforce.  
  - **Opposition**: Critics, including local officials, expressed concerns about the bill’s impact on local control, resource strain (e.g., water and education), and the omnibus nature of the legislation.  

---

#### **6. Broadband Infrastructure and TIF Districts**  
- **Senate Bill 273 (SB 273)**: This bill allows towns to authorize bonding for broadband infrastructure at special meetings, expediting access to federal funds for broadband upgrades. It was supported by the NHMA.  
- **Senate Bill 251 (SB 251)**: This bill adjusts the membership of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district advisory boards to include business community representatives, ensuring broader representation.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
1. **Local Control vs. State Oversight**: Several bills, particularly SB 249 and SB 400, sparked debates over the balance between local zoning authority and state-level regulation. Opponents argued for preserving local control, while supporters emphasized the need for statewide solutions to issues like the housing crisis.  
2. **Housing Crisis**: The housing shortage emerged as a central theme, with discussions on affordability, workforce housing, and the impact of short-term rentals on long-term rental availability.  
3. **Fairness and Accountability**: Bills like SB 239 and SB 312 focused on ensuring financial accountability and fairness in property assessments.  
4. **Economic Impact**: The economic benefits of short-term rentals and housing development were weighed against their potential negative impacts on communities and infrastructure.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing local governance, property rights, and statewide needs. While some bills, like SB 400, sought to provide tools for addressing pressing issues like housing shortages, others, like SB 249, raised concerns about the erosion of local control. The committee planned to continue discussions and vote on the bills in subsequent sessions, with further amendments and studies anticipated to refine the legislation.
