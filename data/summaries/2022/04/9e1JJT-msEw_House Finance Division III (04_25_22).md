The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting held on April 25, 2022, focused on a wide range of legislative bills and pilot programs, with particular attention to funding, program effectiveness, fiscal responsibility, and support for vulnerable populations.

Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **1. Healthcare and Medicaid-Related Bills**
- **Medicaid Reimbursement for Personal Care Attendants**: The committee debated allowing family members to be paid as personal care attendants under Medicaid during the state of emergency. Concerns about fraud protection and the program's continuation post-emergency were addressed, with emphasis on maintaining services to prevent institutionalization.
- **Medicaid Expansion for Postpartum Health (SB 407)**: The committee unanimously supported extending Medicaid coverage for postpartum care for women with incomes between 138% and 196% of the federal poverty level, recognizing its importance for maternal health.
- **Obstetric Services Funding**: The committee discussed increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for obstetric services, particularly in rural areas like the North Country. The closure of obstetric services in several hospitals underscored the need for immediate funding to ensure access to care.
- **Behavioral Health Assessments for Children (SB 416)**: This bill aimed to improve behavioral health assessments for children in out-of-home placements, particularly those in residential treatment facilities. The committee recessed the bill to await further cost analysis and potential amendments.

#### **2. Youth Services and Developmental Programs**
- **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC) Bed Capacity (SB 254)**: The committee debated the appropriate bed capacity for SYSC, with proposals ranging from 6 to 18 beds. While some members supported a lower capacity to reduce youth incarceration, others advocated for flexibility to handle surges and separate male and female populations. The committee ultimately delegated the decision to the DHHS Commissioner, likely within a range of 14 to 18 beds.
- **Pilot Program for Developmental Services**: A pilot program aimed at providing developmental services to individuals aged 18 to 21 who are no longer under the responsibility of school districts was discussed. Concerns about cost containment and population size were addressed, with assurances that the program is ready for implementation.

#### **3. Workplace Safety and Violence Prevention**
- **Workplace Violence Prevention in Healthcare Facilities (SB 458)**: The committee debated whether to mandate workplace violence prevention programs in healthcare facilities. While some members proposed making the program voluntary to avoid financial burdens, others argued that removing the mandate would weaken the bill. The committee voted 6-1 to recommend the bill for passage, with the program remaining mandatory.
- **Healthcare Worker Safety (HB 459)**: Discussions centered on balancing transparency with confidentiality in reporting workplace violence incidents. The committee considered requiring public-facing reports on the DHHS website to encourage participation through public pressure. Amendments were proposed to refine reporting requirements, confidentiality provisions, and the effective date.

#### **4. Mental Health and Trauma Prevention**
- **Childhood Adverse Experiences Treatment and Prevention**: The committee reviewed a bill aimed at addressing trauma and mental health issues in children aged zero to five. The bill focuses on prevention and early intervention, leveraging ARPA funds. The discussion emphasized the importance of supporting families and mitigating the long-term impacts of trauma.

#### **5. Fiscal Responsibility and Procedural Matters**
- **Opioid Abatement Fund (SB 275)**: The committee recessed this bill to await an amendment clarifying eligibility for grants, particularly concerning charter schools and other educational settings.
- **Omnibus Bill (SB 430)**: This comprehensive bill included multiple provisions, with particular focus on sections with financial impacts. The committee discussed a proposed amendment to introduce a planning phase for a pilot program, ensuring better preparation and cost understanding before implementation.
- **Roll Call Votes**: The committee conducted roll call votes on several bills, including SB 444, which passed unanimously. Procedural matters, such as amendments and the need for timely expenditure of ARPA funds, were also discussed.

3. **Emphasis on Fiscal Responsibility**: The committee consistently sought detailed cost analyses and clear language in amendments to avoid unintended financial burdens and ensure effective program implementation.
4. **Healthcare Worker Safety**: Workplace safety in healthcare facilities emerged as a significant theme, with debates over mandates, transparency, and the balance between public awareness and confidentiality.
5. **Collaborative Decision-Making**: The committee demonstrated a collaborative approach, delegating certain decisions (e.g., SYSC bed capacity) to experts and seeking input from stakeholders to refine legislation.
