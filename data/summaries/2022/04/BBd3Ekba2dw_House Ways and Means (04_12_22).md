**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (04/12/22)**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on April 12, 2022, for a multifaceted meeting that blended procedural planning, policy discussions, and informal social considerations as the legislative session neared its conclusion. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including tax policy, revenue distribution, gaming regulations, and funding for economic initiatives.

### **Procedural and Social Planning**
1. **Social Event**: Members discussed organizing a social gathering with significant others in May or June, potentially at a venue like Marquis. Finalizing dates was emphasized.
2. **Upcoming Senate Session**: The Senate was set to begin its session soon, with numerous bills to address, which could lead to additional work for the House.
3. **Revenue Projections**: Updated revenue estimates were planned for after April, with discussions on whether to conduct new projections before the end of the term.
4. **Gas Tax Forgiveness Bill**: A Senate-introduced bill on gas tax forgiveness was discussed. Testimony on the bill was unfavorable, and there was hope it would not survive the committee process.
5. **Next Meeting**: The group planned to reconvene on Thursday at 9 AM for a Republican caucus in Room 104.

### **Tax Policy and Revenue Distribution**
1. **Senate Bill 343: Room Occupancy Tax Revenue Study**:
   - The bill aims to study the distribution of room occupancy tax revenue to municipalities, focusing on towns with significant tourism industries but small populations.
   - Discussions highlighted disparities in tax distribution, particularly in northern towns like Carroll and Gorham, which generate significant tourism revenue but receive limited state aid.
   - Some members argued for immediate legislative changes rather than another study, while broader issues of tax distribution fairness and the impact on the state’s general fund were also debated.

2. **Senate Bill 435-FN: Net Operating Loss Carryover**:
   - The bill proposes changes to the double apportionment of net operating losses (NOLs) under the Business Profits Tax (BPT) to align with federal tax code updates.
   - Key changes include single apportionment of NOLs, extending the carryover period to 10 years, and introducing an 80% limitation on NOL use in a given year.
   - The fiscal impact of these changes was debated, with concerns raised about the potential revenue loss and the rarity of businesses sustaining losses for extended periods.

3. **ARMI (Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute)**:
   - The committee reviewed ARMI’s tax breaks and tuition forgiveness program, which has not been utilized due to a lack of funding.
   - Plans were discussed to allocate $5 million to fund the program, with some advocating for immediate funding rather than spreading it over multiple years.
   - Concerns were raised about the program’s effectiveness, as only a few small businesses have taken advantage of the tax breaks.

### **Gaming Regulations**
1. **Senate Bill 316: "Lucky Seven" Licenses for Charitable Gaming**:
   - The bill, which impacts charitable gaming locations but not fraternal organizations or bingo halls, was unanimously passed (17-0). It allows charitable gaming halls to operate without needing a separate commercial bingo hall license.

2. **Senate Bill 318: Expanded Hours for Games of Chance**:
   - The bill proposes expanding the hours for games of chance from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. to 8 a.m. to 4 a.m.
   - Concerns were raised about late hours, noise, and parking issues, especially in mixed residential-commercial areas.
   - The committee considered compromises, such as adjusting the hours to 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. or allowing municipalities to set their own restrictions. A straw poll showed support for both adjusting the hours and including a municipal ordinance provision.

3. **House Bill 355: Keno Displays in Convenience Stores and Restaurants**:
   - The Senate amended the bill to allow keno displays in convenience stores and restaurants, which the committee disagreed with, as they had intentionally excluded keno displays to prevent the creation of keno parlors.
   - The committee voted to non-concur with the Senate amendment and requested a committee of conference to resolve the issue.

### **Outcome and Next Steps**
The committee decided to continue working on the discussed bills, with plans to address amendments and further discussions in future meetings. The ARMI funding issue was to be addressed through an amendment to Senate Bill 409, with a focus on securing immediate funding. The meeting concluded with plans to finalize amendments and vote on the bills during the next session.

Overall, the meeting reflected a blend of legislative diligence, policy adjustments, and informal planning as the session approached its conclusion.
