The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 6, 2022, focused on several key pieces of legislation related to criminal justice and public safety, with extensive discussions on Senate Bills 393, 294, 291, and 292. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Senate Bill 393: Restraints on Pregnant Incarcerated Women**
The committee unanimously supported **Senate Bill 393**, which limits the use of restraints on pregnant women in state or county correctional facilities during transport, labor, delivery, and postpartum recovery. Medical experts and advocates testified that shackling poses significant health risks, including physical harm, mental distress, and interference with medical care. The bill was amended to specify that pregnant women should only be restrained with front handcuffs during transport, with no restraints during labor, delivery, or recovery. The Department of Corrections initially had concerns but ultimately supported the amended version, balancing public safety with the dignity and health of pregnant women. Advocates, including formerly incarcerated women, shared personal experiences of the trauma caused by shackling, emphasizing the importance of allowing women to give birth and bond with their babies without unnecessary restraints. The bill aims to standardize practices across county jails and state prisons, where policies currently vary.

### **Senate Bill 294: Pretrial Detention and Bail Reforms**
**Senate Bill 294** sparked significant debate, focusing on pretrial detention for individuals accused of serious or violent crimes. The bill introduces a rebuttable presumption that certain defendants pose a danger to the community, requiring them to appear before a judge within 72 hours for a bail determination. It also mandates pretrial detention for individuals who miss three court appearances within three years. 

- **Supporters** argued the bill is necessary to protect public safety, citing instances where defendants released on bail committed further crimes. They emphasized the need for judges to have more authority to detain dangerous individuals.  
- **Opponents**, including representatives from Americans for Prosperity and the ACLU, criticized the bill for limiting judicial discretion, increasing jail populations, and violating due process by placing the burden of proof on defendants. They highlighted that existing laws already allow judges to detain individuals deemed dangerous or flight risks.  
- Concerns were raised about the bill’s broad scope, potential collateral consequences (e.g., job loss, family disruption), and the lack of data supporting its necessity. Critics also pointed to research showing that pretrial detention often leads to worse outcomes, including higher recidivism rates.  
- Alternative solutions were proposed, such as improving the notification system for court dates and investing in community-based programs to address root causes of crime, like substance abuse and mental health issues.  
- The committee voted 16-3 in favor of the bill, with plans to further analyze its implications and consider amendments.

### **Senate Bill 291: Protections for Unmarried Domestic Partners**
**Senate Bill 291**, which sought to explore protections for unmarried domestic partners, was recommended as "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) by a vote of 12-8. Testimony from Chelsea Christensen highlighted the financial and legal challenges faced by unmarried couples, particularly in asset division, retirement benefits, and healthcare access. Committee members debated the need for a study committee to address these issues, with some arguing that existing laws (e.g., prenuptial agreements) already provide protections, while others emphasized the growing prevalence of domestic partnerships and the need for legal safeguards. A minority report will be prepared by Representative Muse.

### **Senate Bill 292: Notice of Arrest to Probation and Parole Officers**
**Senate Bill 292** aims to ensure that probation and parole officers are promptly notified when someone on parole is arrested, starting the 72-hour clock for a preliminary hearing only after notification. Bob Oxley, Director of Field Services for the Department of Corrections, explained that delays in notification have caused challenges in meeting the 72-hour requirement. The bill shifts the responsibility to county jails to notify probation officers promptly. Some committee members raised concerns about potential delays in releasing individuals if notifications are not made, possibly extending detention beyond 72 hours. The committee questioned the necessity of the bill and suggested improving the notification system rather than changing the law.

### **Additional Discussions**
The meeting also included broader discussions on criminal justice issues:
- **Bail Decisions and Judicial Discretion**: Members debated the role of judges and bail commissioners, acknowledging human error but emphasizing the need for thorough consideration of circumstances, especially in severe crimes.  
- **Serious Crimes and Retention**: There was discussion about whether certain crimes, such as terrorism, should be included in a list of offenses allowing for the retention of individuals deemed a danger to the public. The absence of a specific RSA defining terrorism was noted, with members expressing willingness to work on creating such a definition.  
- **Data and Accountability**: Members highlighted the need for data on instances where bail commissioners may have made incorrect decisions and the outcomes of appeals or follow-ups.  
- **Concord-Specific Issues**: A representative from Concord pointed out unique challenges faced by the city due to the presence of state hospitals and prisons, which discharge individuals into the community.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Public Safety vs. Individual Rights**: The discussions highlighted a tension between protecting public safety and preserving individual rights and judicial discretion, particularly in the context of pretrial detention and bail reforms.  
2. **Health and Dignity**: SB 393’s unanimous support reflected a commitment to protecting the health and dignity of pregnant incarcerated women.  
3. **Data-Driven Solutions**: Opponents of SB 294 emphasized the need for data-driven approaches to criminal justice, rather than relying on anecdotal evidence or broad legislative changes.  
4. **Community-Based Alternatives**: There was a strong push for addressing root causes of crime, such as substance abuse, mental health issues, and homelessness, through community-based programs rather than incarceration.  
5. **Collaborative Efforts**: The meeting demonstrated a collaborative effort between legislators, medical professionals, advocates, and state agencies to address complex criminal justice issues.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of balancing public safety with individual rights, investing in community-based solutions, and ensuring that legislative changes are grounded in data and evidence.
