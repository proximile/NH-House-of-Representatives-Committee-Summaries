**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (April 8, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 8, 2022, focused on several key bills related to election law, with **Senate Bill 418 (SB 418)** dominating the discussions. The bill, which proposes significant changes to the state’s voting process, particularly regarding voter ID requirements and affidavit ballots, sparked intense debate among legislators, election officials, advocacy groups, and citizens. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting, combining all segments:

### **Key Discussions and Testimony**

1. **SB 418 – Election Security and Voter Qualification**
   - **Purpose**: SB 418 aims to enhance election security by requiring voters who cannot immediately prove their qualifications (e.g., lacking proper ID) to cast affidavit ballots. These voters must provide documentation within 10 days of the election, or their votes will be discounted.
   - **Constitutional Concerns**: Several representatives questioned the bill’s constitutionality, particularly whether it violates voter privacy or imposes undue burdens. There was debate over whether it aligns with New Hampshire’s requirement that all ballots be counted in one continuous meeting on election day.
   - **Impact on Military and Overseas Voters**: Critics, including veterans and military families, argued that the 10-day deadline would disenfranchise military and overseas voters, who often face delays in receiving and returning ballots. Concerns were raised that the bill could violate the **Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)**.
   - **First-Time Voters**: The bill would require first-time voters to provide proof of citizenship within 10 days, which critics argued is burdensome and could disenfranchise eligible voters, especially those without immediate access to documents like birth certificates or passports.
   - **Privacy Issues**: The bill’s affidavit ballot system raised concerns about voter privacy, as ballots could be traced back to individuals, particularly in small towns.
   - **Support for Election Integrity**: Proponents, including Secretary of State David Scanlan and Senator Regina Birdsell, argued that SB 418 is necessary to address declining voter confidence and ensure that only qualified voters cast ballots. Supporters emphasized the need for checks and balances in the voting process.
   - **Opposition from Advocacy Groups**: Organizations like the **ACLU**, **Brennan Center for Justice**, and **League of Women Voters** opposed the bill, arguing it creates unnecessary barriers, suppresses voter turnout, and could lead to New Hampshire losing its exemption from the **National Voter Registration Act (NVRA)**.
   - **Cost and Logistical Challenges**: The bill’s implementation was estimated to incur significant costs for the state and municipalities, including postage for affidavit ballots and additional staffing. Critics argued it would complicate the voting process and delay election results.

2. **SB 348 – Campaign Finance Reform**
   - Senator James Gray introduced SB 348, which aims to clarify campaign finance laws by incorporating tables into statutes to make them more understandable. The bill addresses issues like pre-primary, primary, and general election expenses, with some provisions allowing unlimited spending in certain categories.
   - **Opposition**: Olivia Zink of Open Democracy Action and others argued that unlimited political spending undermines democracy and creates confusion. Critics expressed concerns about the influence of wealth in politics.

3. **HB 425 – Election Information Portal**
   - HB 425 proposes an online portal for voter registration and updates (e.g., address changes, party affiliation). Supporters, including Liz Tentarelli and Michael O’Brien, highlighted its convenience and potential to reduce election-day confusion.
   - **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about data security and the potential for misidentifying voters, though supporters noted that safeguards exist in other states with similar systems.

4. **SB 364 – Electronic Poll Book Backups**
   - The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to pass SB 364, which extends the time for completing paper backups of electronic poll books from 10 to 30 minutes. The bill was placed on the consent calendar.

### **Themes and Divisions**
- **Election Integrity vs. Voter Accessibility**: The debate over SB 418 highlighted a deep divide between those who believe the bill is necessary to safeguard election integrity and those who view it as a solution in search of a problem that creates unnecessary barriers for voters.
- **Impact on Vulnerable Groups**: Critics emphasized that the bill would disproportionately affect military members, overseas voters, first-time voters, and individuals without easy access to required documents.
- **Fiscal and Administrative Burdens**: The potential costs and logistical challenges of implementing the bill were recurring concerns, with estimates suggesting significant expenses for the state and local municipalities.
- **Call for Modernization**: Some speakers urged the committee to focus on modernizing the voting process, such as implementing online voter registration and joining the **Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC)**, rather than adding burdensome requirements.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing election security with voter accessibility. While supporters of SB 418 argued it is necessary to address perceptions of voter fraud and ensure election integrity, opponents contended it would disenfranchise eligible voters, particularly military members and first-time registrants. The committee planned to continue deliberations on SB 418 and other election-related bills in future sessions.
