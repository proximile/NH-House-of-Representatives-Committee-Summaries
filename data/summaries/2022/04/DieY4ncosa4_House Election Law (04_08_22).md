#### **Key Bills Discussed**

1. **SB 348 - Campaign Finance Clarification**  
   - Introduced by Senator James Gray, this bill aims to clarify campaign finance laws by adding tables to statutes to make them more understandable.  
   - It addresses campaign spending limits and the transfer of campaign funds.  
   - Concerns were raised about the use of the term "unlimited," with some testifiers arguing it could create confusion and undermine transparency in elections.

2. **HB 425 - Election Information Portal**  
   - Proposed by Senator Gray, this bill seeks to create an online portal for voter registration and updating voter information (e.g., address, party affiliation).  
   - Supporters, including the League of Women Voters and America Votes, highlighted the convenience, efficiency, and cost savings for local communities.  
   - Opponents raised concerns about potential privacy issues and the implementation costs, though proponents noted that 42 other states already use similar systems.

3. **SB 418 - Voter Affidavit Verification**  
   - This bill, also introduced by Senator Gray, proposes changes to voter identification and affidavit verification processes.  
   - Key provisions include requiring voters without valid IDs to cast provisional ballots, which would only be counted if additional documentation is provided within 10 days.  
   - The bill also aims to use prior election data to verify voter information.  
   - Supporters, including Secretary of State David Scanlon, argued that it addresses declining voter confidence and ensures election integrity.  
   - Opponents, including veterans, election officials, and advocacy groups, criticized the bill for creating unnecessary barriers, potentially disenfranchising military, overseas, young, and marginalized voters. They also raised concerns about privacy, logistical challenges, and the lack of evidence of voter fraud in New Hampshire.

4. **SB 364 - Election Worker Time Extension**  
   - This bill extends the time for election workers to complete paper backups of electronic poll books from 10 to 30 minutes.  
   - It passed unanimously (20-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

#### **Key Themes and Concerns**

1. **Election Integrity vs. Voter Access**  
   - The debate centered on balancing election security with voter accessibility. Supporters of SB 418 argued it was necessary to prevent fraud and ensure only qualified voters participate. Opponents countered that the bill creates unnecessary hurdles, particularly for military, overseas, and first-time voters, and could suppress turnout.

2. **Privacy and Secrecy of the Ballot**  
   - Opponents of SB 418 raised concerns about the potential compromise of voter privacy, as provisional ballots could be uniquely identifiable, allowing officials to track how individuals voted.

3. **Constitutional and Legal Challenges**  
   - Significant discussion focused on the constitutionality of SB 418, with opponents suggesting it could face legal challenges similar to SB3. Some representatives proposed seeking an advisory opinion from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, but Senator Guida, the bill’s sponsor, opposed this, emphasizing the legislature’s independence.

4. **Cost and Administrative Burden**  
   - Both SB 418 and HB 425 were criticized for imposing significant costs and logistical challenges on state and local governments. SB 418, in particular, would require additional staffing, materials, and postage, potentially delaying election results.

5. **Impact on Military and Overseas Voters**  
   - Testifiers, including veterans and military families, argued that SB 418 would make it nearly impossible for service members stationed overseas to receive and return their ballots on time, threatening their right to vote.

6. **Lack of Evidence of Fraud**  
   - Opponents of SB 418 noted that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire, with the attorney general’s office confirming no criminal or civil enforcement actions regarding the 2020 elections.

- **Opponents**, including the ACLU, League of Women Voters, and veterans, argued that SB 418 would disenfranchise voters, create unnecessary barriers, and complicate the voting process.
