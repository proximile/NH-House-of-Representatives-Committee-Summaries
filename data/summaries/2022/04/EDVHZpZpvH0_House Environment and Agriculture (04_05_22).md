**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (April 5, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on April 5, 2022, to discuss a range of legislative bills and policy issues, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability, agriculture, and waste management. The meeting included presentations from policy advisors, detailed discussions on specific bills, and debates on the merits and concerns surrounding advanced recycling technologies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **Opening Remarks and Policy Updates**
The meeting began with opening remarks from the committee chair, who welcomed former committee chairs Tara Sad (Democrat) and Bob Heffner (Republican), now serving as agriculture policy advisors for the Council of State Governments (CSG). They highlighted their work on regional collaboration to address agricultural and environmental challenges. Key policy areas discussed included:
- **Transportation and Supply Chain Issues**: Challenges exacerbated by COVID-19, particularly affecting agriculture.
- **Rural Broadband Expansion**: Essential for modernizing farming practices and improving access to markets.
- **Carbon Farming and Climate Adaptation**: The need for innovative farming practices to mitigate climate change impacts.
- **Meat Processing Facility Shortages**: A regional issue impacting food systems.
- **The Upcoming Farm Bill**: Its significance for food services, SNAP benefits, and conservation efforts.

The CSG representatives emphasized the importance of regional food systems and invited committee members to their annual meeting in Manchester, NH, to foster collaboration.

### **Legislative Bills Discussed**
The committee reviewed two key bills, both of which had passed the Senate and were under consideration in the House:

1. **Senate Bill 396**:  
   This bill requires the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to hire an independent engineer or hydrogeologist when evaluating landfill permits. The goal is to ensure scientifically informed decisions to protect water resources and state parks. Committee members discussed the bill's regulatory framework, cost implications, and environmental impacts. Sponsors clarified that they worked closely with DES to address concerns and align the bill with state goals.

2. **Senate Bill 367**:  
   This bill reclassifies **advanced recycling facilities** as manufacturing rather than solid waste facilities. It aims to incentivize private investment in technologies like pyrolysis, which melts hard-to-recycle plastics at high temperatures without oxygen, breaking them down into reusable materials. Proponents argued that this process reduces landfill waste, creates jobs, and promotes economic growth. However, the bill sparked significant debate.

### **Debate on Senate Bill 367 (Advanced Recycling)**
The discussion on SB 367 highlighted a divide between supporters and critics of advanced recycling:

**Supporters** (including the Business and Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council) argued that:
- Advanced recycling reduces plastic waste in landfills and creates new products from recycled materials.
- The process is not incineration and meets federal emissions standards, posing minimal environmental risks.
- The bill aligns with environmental sustainability and economic development goals, with potential for job creation and investment in New Hampshire.

**Critics** (including the Conservation Law Foundation and environmental advocates) raised concerns that:
- Advanced recycling is a form of "greenwashing," with pyrolysis emitting toxic substances like dioxins and heavy metals.
- The bill lacks sufficient regulatory oversight and could make New Hampshire a dumping ground for out-of-state waste.
- The focus should be on reducing plastic production and improving traditional recycling methods rather than investing in unproven technologies.

**Technical and Regulatory Concerns**:  
Committee members expressed confusion about the technical details of pyrolysis, the classification of plastics as raw materials, and the state’s capacity to monitor and regulate these facilities. While DES was noted to be comfortable with the bill’s language, critics argued that DES should retain regulatory authority.

**Call for Caution**:  
Several speakers urged the committee to proceed slowly, citing the technology's novelty, potential environmental risks, and the need for further research. They recommended waiting for DES to update the state’s solid waste management plan before moving forward.

### **Committee Discussions and Next Steps**
The committee engaged in broader discussions on soil health, waste management, and the need for innovative solutions to reduce landfill use and promote recycling. For SB 367, the committee planned a work session to address technical questions and gather more expert input before making a final decision.

---

### **Closing Remarks**
The committee chair thanked the presenters and emphasized the importance of collaboration, innovation, and science-based decision-making in addressing environmental and agricultural challenges. The meeting concluded with a transition to the next hearing, which focused on solid waste management.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing economic opportunities with environmental and public health protections. While advanced recycling offers potential benefits in reducing plastic waste and creating jobs, significant concerns remain about its environmental impact, regulatory framework, and long-term sustainability. The committee’s cautious approach reflects the need for thorough research and stakeholder engagement before advancing such technologies. Overall, the discussions highlighted the importance of regional collaboration and evidence-based policy in tackling New Hampshire’s environmental and agricultural challenges.
