**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (April 5, 2022):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on April 5, 2022, to discuss several key bills, with a primary focus on **Senate Bill 367**, which addresses advanced recycling of plastics. The meeting also included an overview of work by the Council of State Governments (CSG) and discussions on other bills, such as **Senate Bill 396**, related to solid waste management.

### **Overview of CSG Work**
Former committee chairs Tara Sad and Bob Heffner, now agriculture policy advisors for the Council of State Governments (CSG), provided insights into their regional collaboration and policy research. They highlighted pressing issues such as transportation challenges due to COVID-19, rural broadband expansion, carbon farming, and meat processing shortages. They also discussed the upcoming CSG annual meeting in Manchester, NH, and the importance of the Farm Bill.

### **Senate Bill 396: Solid Waste Management**
**Senate Bill 396**, sponsored by Senator Kevin Cavanaugh, focuses on solid waste management by requiring the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to hire hydrogeologists or engineers for landfill permit evaluations. Senator Cavanaugh emphasized the need for scientific rigor in landfill siting decisions to protect natural resources. Committee members raised questions about the regulatory implications and costs associated with the bill.

### **Senate Bill 367: Advanced Recycling**
The bulk of the meeting centered on **Senate Bill 367**, sponsored by Senator Kevin Avard. The bill aims to classify advanced recycling facilities as manufacturing rather than solid waste facilities, incentivizing investment in technologies to recycle hard-to-process plastics. The bill had passed the Senate unanimously and seeks to reduce plastic waste in landfills while creating jobs. Senator Avard highlighted bipartisan support and collaboration with DES to address concerns.

#### **Key Points of Discussion:**
1. **Economic and Environmental Benefits:**
   - Proponents argued that advanced recycling would divert plastics from landfills, create jobs, and support a more robust recycling market in New England. They emphasized that these facilities should be regulated as manufacturers since they produce new materials rather than manage waste.
   - Supporters, including Margaret Gorman from the American Chemistry Council, highlighted the potential for economic investment and environmental benefits, noting that these facilities operate under federal environmental regulations.

2. **Environmental Concerns:**
   - Critics, including the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) and John Swann from Save Forest Lake, argued that advanced recycling is a form of greenwashing, involving the burning of plastics and emitting harmful pollutants like carbon dioxide, heavy metals, and dioxins. They warned that deregulating these facilities could lead to environmental and public health risks.
   - Opponents raised concerns about the bill's vague language, particularly around when waste transitions to feedstock and how the process would be regulated. They also highlighted that other New England states have rejected similar legislation.

3. **Regulatory and Technical Questions:**
   - Questions were raised about whether these facilities should be regulated under manufacturing or solid waste rules, with concerns about potential loopholes in environmental safeguards.
   - Technical questions about the types of plastics processed, contamination levels, and specific regulatory requirements were deferred to a future work session for more detailed answers.

4. **Public and Industry Perspectives:**
   - Members of the public expressed skepticism about the bill, emphasizing the need for plastic reduction rather than recycling. They cited reports questioning the effectiveness and environmental impact of advanced recycling technologies.
   - The Business and Industry Association (BIA) supported the bill, arguing it would attract sustainable businesses and boost the economy.

### **Next Steps:**
The committee scheduled a **work session** to address unresolved technical questions and further evaluate **Senate Bill 367**. They also planned to review the stateâ€™s updated solid waste plan, expected in October 2022, before making a decision. The meeting concluded with a brief introduction of the next hearing on **Senate Bill 387**, which will address regulatory status and advanced recycling facilities.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted a significant divide between those who see advanced recycling as an economic and environmental opportunity and those who view it as a risky, insufficiently regulated process that could exacerbate pollution. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing environmental protection, economic growth, and technological innovation in legislative decision-making.
