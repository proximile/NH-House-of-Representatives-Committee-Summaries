The April 6, 2022, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee focused on several key legislative proposals, including feasibility studies for a pier at Hampton Beach, bridge naming initiatives, and property management issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Feasibility Studies for Hampton Beach Pier (Senate Bills 346 and 378)**
The committee extensively discussed two related bills—**Senate Bill 346** and **Senate Bill 378**—which propose feasibility studies for constructing a pier at Hampton Beach. Key points included:

1. **Purpose and Benefits**: The pier aims to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, veterans, and others who cannot currently access the jetty. It would also serve as a tourist attraction and potentially enhance safety by aiding search and rescue operations.

2. **Location and Feasibility**: The original proposal to build the pier over the jetty was amended to consider a location **south of Boar’s Head** due to concerns about safety, maintenance, and environmental challenges such as high tides and shallow waters. The feasibility study would assess the viability, costs, and community impact of the pier.

3. **Funding and Costs**: Initial estimates suggested the study could cost up to **$1.5 million**, far exceeding the original $25,000 allocation. **Senate Bill 378** appropriates **$150,000** for the study, with the understanding that design costs typically represent about 10% of total construction costs. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of this funding and the potential for rising costs.

4. **Timeline**: The study is due by **November 1, 2022**, but many representatives questioned whether such a thorough study could be completed in such a short timeframe. Suggestions were made to extend the deadline or involve local businesses in funding preliminary work.

5. **Community and Stakeholder Involvement**: Local stakeholders, including the Hampton Beach Area Commission, business owners, and emergency services, have been consulted. The commission, chaired by former Senator Nancy Stiles, would oversee the study.

6. **Concerns and Questions**: Representatives raised concerns about:
   - **Parking**: Ensuring adequate handicapped-accessible parking for the pier.
   - **Maintenance**: Identifying ongoing maintenance costs and potential funding sources, such as concessions or community contributions.
   - **Weather Impact**: Evaluating how winter storms and other weather conditions would affect the pier’s durability.
   - **Management**: Determining which state agency (e.g., Parks and Recreation, Fish and Game) would manage the pier.

7. **Votes and Next Steps**: The committee voted **14-6** in favor of moving **Senate Bill 346** forward with a recommendation to pass. **Senate Bill 378** is expected to proceed to the Finance Committee and then the full legislature for approval. If passed, the study would inform future legislative action.

### **Senate Bill 201: Naming Bridges**
The committee unanimously supported **Senate Bill 201**, which proposes naming two bridges in New Hampshire:
- The **Joseph Garrity Memorial Bridge** in Romney, honoring a state trooper who died in the line of duty.
- The **David Riley Bridge** in Center Harbor, honoring a dedicated citizen who contributed significantly to the town.

The committee voted **22-0** to recommend the bill for passage.

### **Senate Bill 278: Piscataqua River Turning Basin Project**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 278**, which reallocates funds from a 2019 project in Rye Harbor to the Piscataqua River Turning Basin Widening Project. The project aims to improve navigation safety for larger vessels by expanding the turning basin from 800 to 1,200 feet. Testimony highlighted the economic and safety benefits for the seacoast region. The committee voted **21-0** to recommend the bill for passage.

### **Senate Bill 378: Disposal of Highway or Turnpike-Funded Real Estate**
The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 378**, which allows the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) to transfer certain properties at less than market value to third parties for preservation, stewardship, or environmental benefits. The bill was introduced in response to a historical railroad depot in Newington that the town does not want to own but a historical society wishes to preserve. NHDOT officials emphasized the need for flexibility in transferring properties, particularly mitigation sites, to third parties for better stewardship. The committee debated the bill’s language, focusing on ensuring public benefit and proper oversight through covenants in the deed transfers. Concerns were raised about the potential for properties to fall into disrepair or misuse, but the inclusion of reversion clauses in the deeds was seen as a safeguard. The bill remained under discussion for further refinement.

### **General Discussions**
The committee debated the broader implications of the bills, including the oversight of property transfers, the role of the Long-Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee, and the need for specific language to protect the state’s interests. The focus was on ensuring that property transfers serve public interests and are properly managed.

### **Outcome**
The committee moved forward with recommendations to pass **Senate Bills 201** and **278**, while **Senate Bill 378** remained under discussion for further refinement. The discussions emphasized the importance of careful planning, community input, and oversight to ensure the feasibility, sustainability, and public benefit of the proposed projects.
