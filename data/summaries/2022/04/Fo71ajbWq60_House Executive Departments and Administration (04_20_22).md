The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee on Executive Departments and Administration held a work session on **Senate Bill 383**, which pertains to land surveying services. The meeting focused on discussing and proposing amendments to the bill. Key points and decisions from the session include:

1. **Concerns with the Bill**: Members identified significant issues with the bill, particularly the provision that allows the board to act as both judge and jury in adjudicating civil penalties, which was deemed problematic and potentially unworkable. There was also concern about the lack of an appeal process to superior court.

2. **Proposed Amendments**:
   - **Change from Class B to Class A Misdemeanor**: The committee agreed to increase the severity of the penalty for unlicensed land surveying from a Class B to a Class A misdemeanor, which includes potential jail time.
   - **Deletion of Problematic Sections**: Lines 11-20, which outlined the board's adjudication process, were recommended for deletion due to concerns about fairness and due process.
   - **Reporting to the Attorney General**: The board would be required to report findings of unlicensed activity to the Attorney General for prosecution, rather than handling it internally.
   - **Non-Resident Licensure**: The bill would be amended to align with existing laws (RSA 310a69) regarding non-resident licensure, ensuring consistency and clarity.

3. **Indemnification of Injured Parties**: There was a strong emphasis on ensuring that individuals harmed by unlicensed surveying practices are indemnified, though further legal advice was deemed necessary to address this issue effectively.

4. **Registry of Deeds and Planning Boards**: While not part of the bill, there was discussion about requiring the registry of deeds and planning boards to only accept documents from licensed surveyors, which could be addressed in future legislation.

5. **Motion to Amend**: The subcommittee moved to adopt the proposed changes, including the deletion of problematic sections, the addition of reporting requirements, and the alignment with existing non-resident licensure laws.

Overall, the subcommittee expressed a desire to improve the bill but acknowledged that some issues, such as indemnification and judicial oversight, would require further work and could be revisited in future sessions. The meeting concluded with a motion to amend the bill based on the discussed changes.
