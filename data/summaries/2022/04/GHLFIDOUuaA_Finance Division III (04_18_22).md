The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on April 18, 2022, focused on discussing and amending two bills: **SB 412** and **SB 422**. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **SB 412**:  
   - The bill aimed to correct an error in the budgeting process related to Medicaid rates for nursing homes and other providers.  
   - The intent was to increase rates by 5% to help providers pay competitive wages and improve census numbers.  
   - An amendment was introduced to clarify that any unspent funds from the appropriation would lapse to the general fund at the end of the fiscal year (June 30, 2023).  
   - The amendment passed unanimously, and the bill, as amended, was recommended to the full Finance Committee with an "ought to pass" (OTP) recommendation.

2. **SB 422**:  
   - This bill sought to establish an adult dental benefit under Medicaid, which currently does not exist.  
   - It was similar to **HB 103**, which had already passed the House. The goal was to make the two bills identical.  
   - Key provisions included:  
     - No co-pay for dental cleanings (aligned with commercial insurance practices).  
     - Coverage for removable prosthodontics for elderly, developmentally disabled, and other specific populations.  
     - Funding for the program would come from a Centene settlement fund, with an additional $2.4 million allocated for a "risk corridor" to address potential financial risks.  
   - An amendment was introduced to align the bill with HB 103, which passed unanimously.  
   - The bill, as amended, was recommended to the full Finance Committee with an OTP recommendation.

Additional notes:  
- The committee discussed the importance of fairness in providing dental benefits, drawing parallels to dental care for military personnel.  
- Dr. Sarah Finney, Medicaid Dental Director, clarified that individuals in the acquired brain disorder waiver would also be eligible for removable prosthodontics.  
- The meeting concluded with administrative tasks, including assigning committee report writing and closing remarks.  

The session was marked by unanimous support for both bills and their respective amendments.
