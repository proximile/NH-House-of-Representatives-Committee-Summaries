The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on April 27, 2022, focused on two key legislative discussions: amendments to a bill defining "health facility" and a bill addressing workplace violence prevention in healthcare settings. Both segments highlighted collaborative efforts to refine legislative language, address stakeholder concerns, and advance proactive measures.

### Amendment 1864: Defining "Health Facility"
The first segment centered on **Amendment 1864**, which aimed to clarify the definition of "health facility" and address language related to urgent care facilities licensed under RSA 151. Representative Ripple proposed modifications to streamline the amendment, including removing redundant references to "network of three or more clinics" and aligning the wording with existing definitions. After a detailed discussion, the committee unanimously voted 7-0 to adopt the amendment with the proposed changes. The chair acknowledged the complexity of the bills addressed over the three-day meeting period and commended the committee for their diligent work. The segment concluded with the adjournment of Division III.

### Workplace Violence Prevention in Healthcare Facilities
The second segment focused on a bill designed to establish a workplace violence prevention program for healthcare facilities. Key aspects of the discussion included:  
1. **Bill Overview**: The bill emphasizes transparency and public accountability while avoiding punitive measures like fines. It includes provisions for incident reporting, confidentiality, and the creation of a commission to oversee the program.  
2. **Amendments and Changes**:  
   - Definitions, such as "health facility," were clarified, and language was streamlined to improve readability.  
   - Reporting requirements were adjusted to allow flexibility in rulemaking, with specific reporting dates removed.  
   - Emphasis was placed on de-identification of personal information and the principle of data minimization.  
3. **Voluntary Participation**: The amended bill makes participation voluntary for state-operated facilities, encouraging compliance through public transparency and organic pressure rather than mandates or fines.  
4. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Hospital Association and the New Hampshire Nurses Association expressed strong support for the bill, recognizing it as a proactive step toward protecting healthcare workers. They noted that while the bill could be further refined in future sessions, it represents a significant advancement in addressing workplace violence.  
5. **Technical Edits**: Several technical changes were proposed to enhance clarity and consistency, such as replacing "or" with "and" in specific sections and adding references to "hostile words."  
6. **Next Steps**: The committee planned to finalize the amendments and prepare for a vote, ensuring the bill aligns with stakeholder goals and legislative intent.  

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the committeeâ€™s commitment to refining legislative language and addressing critical issues in healthcare. The adoption of **Amendment 1864** and the collaborative effort to advance the workplace violence prevention bill demonstrated a balance between transparency, accountability, and practicality. The discussions reflected a proactive approach to improving healthcare legislation, with stakeholders playing a vital role in shaping the outcomes. The meeting concluded with a focus on finalizing amendments and preparing for the next steps in the legislative process.
