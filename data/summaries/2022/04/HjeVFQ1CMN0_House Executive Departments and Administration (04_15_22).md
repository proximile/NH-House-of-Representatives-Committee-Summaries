The transcript is from a New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee work session on **Senate Bill 282**, which focuses on acupuncture licensing regulations. The discussion primarily revolves around aligning SB 282 with **House Bill 1192**, which had already passed both the House and Senate. The key points include:

1. **Alignment of Bills**: SB 282 was intended to be identical to HB 1192, but there was a minor difference in wording. The subcommittee debated whether to amend SB 282 to match HB 1192 or to let SB 282 die since HB 1192 was already progressing to the governor. The consensus was to **let SB 282 expire** to avoid redundancy.

2. **Community Acupuncture**: Representatives from the acupuncture community, including **Molly Gendro**, **Diane Chase**, and **Elizabeth Rob**, explained the differences between **community acupuncture** (group treatment in reclining chairs) and private room acupuncture. They highlighted the need for licensing changes to make it easier for practitioners to get licensed in New Hampshire, particularly through **reciprocity agreements**.

3. **Licensing and Continuing Education**: The discussion focused on **current active NCCAOM (National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine) certification** and whether it should be required for licensing. Some argued that requiring current active status was burdensome, as it involves paying dues to a trade organization. The subcommittee considered adding language to allow **equivalent certifications** or **prior NCCAOM certification** with proof of continuing education.

4. **Amendments**: The subcommittee proposed amendments to HB 1192 to clarify licensing requirements, particularly around **continuing education (CEUs)**. They discussed adding language to allow the board to approve alternative CEU pathways, rather than mandating NCCAOM certification.

5. **Effective Date**: To avoid conflicts, the subcommittee proposed that any amendments to SB 282 take effect **one minute after HB 1192** is adopted.

6. **Next Steps**: The subcommittee planned to meet again to finalize the amendment and vote on it. They encouraged stakeholders to review the draft amendment and provide feedback before the next meeting.

Overall, the session aimed to streamline licensing requirements for acupuncturists, address concerns about redundant regulations, and ensure that community acupuncture practices were accommodated.
