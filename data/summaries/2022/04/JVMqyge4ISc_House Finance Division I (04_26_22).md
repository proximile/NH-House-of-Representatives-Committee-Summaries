### **Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Finance Division I – April 26, 2022)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on April 26, 2022, covered a wide range of legislative topics, including election processes, law enforcement reimbursements, retirement system adjustments, building code regulations, economic development, and election integrity. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Election Processes and Integrity**
Several bills addressed election processes and voter confidence, with significant debate on their implications:

- **Senate Bill 418 (SB 418)**:  
  - This bill requires provisional ballots for first-time voters who register on Election Day without presenting an ID. These voters would receive a packet to send their provisional ballot to the Secretary of State's office for verification.  
  - Concerns were raised about potential disenfranchisement of active military voters, conflicts with federal law (UOCAVA), and New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration process. The bill could also lead to costly legal challenges, similar to a previous unconstitutional bill (SB3).  
  - The committee voted for an interim study to address these issues, and the bill’s effective date was delayed to 2023 to avoid implementation in the upcoming primary.

- **Senate Bill 366 (SB 366)**:  
  - This bill mandates an audit of ballots cast in elections to increase voter confidence in the accuracy of voting machines.  
  - It requires the Secretary of State’s office to conduct a high-speed scanner recount of ballots from two towns in the primary and four in the general election, to be completed by noon on the Friday after the election.  
  - Estimated costs range from $50,000 to $100,000, primarily for purchasing or renting high-speed scanners.  
  - While some representatives questioned the necessity and cost-effectiveness, others supported it as a deterrent to potential tampering. The committee voted 4-3 to pass the bill, with concerns about its practicality and financial burden.

#### **2. Law Enforcement and Public Safety**
- **Senate Bill 303 (SB 303)**:  
  - This bill seeks to equalize reimbursement rates for transporting prisoners with those of court security officers.  
  - Sheriffs and law enforcement associations supported the bill, citing inadequate current rates and difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel.  
  - The bill passed unanimously.

---

#### **3. Retirement System Adjustments**
- **Senate Bill 363 (SB 363)**:  
  - This bill allows certain employees hired before 2011 to buy additional service years to improve their retirement benefits or retire earlier.  
  - The cost is fully borne by the individuals, with no fiscal impact on the state.  
  - The bill passed unanimously.

---

#### **4. Building Code Regulations**
- **Senate Bill 443 (SB 443)**:  
  - This bill addresses issues with local amendments to state building and fire codes, ensuring they are reviewed for compliance and published for transparency.  
  - The bill aims to standardize codes across municipalities, reducing confusion for contractors and inspectors. It includes provisions for additional clerical support for the Building Code Review Board and the State Fire Marshal’s office.  
  - Supported by various stakeholders, including construction associations and the Building Code Review Board, the bill passed.

#### **5. Economic Development and Local Manufacturing**
- **Senate Bill 438 (SB 438)**:  
  - This bill prioritizes the use of American-made structural steel in public construction projects, aligning with "Buy American" principles.  
  - Supporters emphasized its potential to keep tax dollars within New Hampshire, support local jobs, and strengthen the state’s economy. The bill is seen as a way to level the playing field for local steel fabricators competing with foreign manufacturers, particularly from Canada.  
  - The bill includes provisions for waivers to ensure compliance does not compromise project timelines, quality, or costs.  
  - The committee voted unanimously (7-0) to recommend the bill with an "ought to pass" recommendation, citing its economic and national security benefits.

#### **6. Environmental and Municipal Concerns**
- **Senate Bill 267 (SB 267)**:  
  - This bill addresses invasive species control and herbicide subsidies for municipalities.  
  - It was amended to clarify language and passed with support.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Election Integrity and Voter Confidence**: Both SB 366 and SB 418 aimed to address concerns about election integrity, though their practicality, cost, and potential legal challenges were debated.
- **Economic Responsibility**: SB 438 highlighted efforts to support local businesses, create jobs, and reduce reliance on foreign markets.
- **Public Safety and Fairness**: SB 303 and SB 443 focused on improving law enforcement funding and standardizing building codes for public safety and clarity.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Several bills, including SB 363 and SB 266, emphasized minimal or no fiscal impact on the state.

The meeting reflected the committee’s efforts to balance legislative priorities with fiscal responsibility, legal considerations, and practical implementation.
