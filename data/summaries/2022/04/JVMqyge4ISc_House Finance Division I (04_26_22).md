**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (April 26, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on April 26, 2022, addressed several key bills, focusing on retirement system reforms, election security, procurement policies, and law enforcement reimbursements. Here’s a detailed overview of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Senate Bill 363: Retirement System Changes**  
   - The bill addresses concerns for employees hired before 2011 who face reduced retirement benefits due to changes made that year. It allows these employees to buy service credits to lower the minimum retirement age or improve benefits, provided they cover the full actuarial cost.  
   - The fiscal impact is minimal, limited to programming costs for the retirement system.  
   - The bill received unanimous support from the committee and was endorsed by stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Police Association and Troopers Association, who emphasized its potential to retain law enforcement personnel.  

2. **Senate Bill 438: Buy American for Structural Steel**  
   - This bill mandates the use of American-made structural steel in publicly funded construction projects to support local manufacturers and the economy.  
   - Proponents, including steel fabricators and business owners, argued that it keeps tax dollars in the state, supports local jobs, and strengthens the economy through the economic multiplier effect. Opponents raised concerns about increased costs and supply chain issues, but supporters countered that the long-term benefits outweigh short-term savings.  
   - The bill includes waivers to protect public interests and ensures competitive pricing. It passed unanimously in committee and was recommended for further review in the executive session.  

3. **Senate Bill 366: Ballot Audit Bill**  
   - The bill mandates audits of ballots cast in elections, requiring the Secretary of State’s office to conduct recounts using a high-speed scanner for selected voting locations.  
   - Estimated costs range between $50,000 and $100,000, primarily for purchasing the scanner and conducting audits.  
   - While the bill aims to increase voter confidence in election machines, some representatives questioned its necessity and cost-effectiveness, arguing that New Hampshire already has secure elections. The committee voted 4-3 to recommend the bill for further review by the full Finance Committee.  

4. **Senate Bill 418: Provisional Ballots for First-Time Voters Without ID**  
   - The bill requires provisional ballots for first-time voters in New Hampshire who lack identification. Voters have seven days to provide ID; otherwise, their votes are removed from the totals.  
   - Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with federal law (UOCAVA), which guarantees military and overseas voters 45 days to return ballots. Testimony also highlighted constitutional issues and the risk of disenfranchising voters. The committee voted 4-3 to recommend the bill for interim study.  

5. **Senate Bill 303: Reimbursement for Sheriff’s Transportation of Prisoners**  
   - The bill seeks to increase reimbursement rates for sheriffs transporting prisoners to match the rates paid to court security officers ($120.18 for a full day, $60.09 for a half day).  
   - Testimony emphasized recruitment challenges at the current reimbursement rates ($65 for a full day, $35 for a half day). The committee unanimously voted to recommend the bill for passage.  

6. **Senate Bill 443: Building Code Updates**  
   - The bill addresses inconsistencies in local amendments to building and fire codes, requiring the state to review and publish these amendments to ensure compliance with state codes. It also includes provisions for administrative support to handle the increased workload.  

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
- **Economic and Workforce Support:** Bills like SB 363 (retirement system changes) and SB 438 (Buy American for steel) were designed to support local workers, businesses, and the economy, receiving broad support from stakeholders.  
- **Election Security and Voter Confidence:** SB 366 (ballot audits) and SB 418 (provisional ballots) sparked debates about balancing election integrity, voter confidence, and compliance with federal law.  
- **Fair Compensation and Recruitment:** SB 303 (sheriff reimbursements) highlighted the need for fair compensation to address recruitment challenges in law enforcement roles.  
- **Unified Support:** Many bills, including SB 363 and SB 438, passed unanimously or with strong support, reflecting bipartisan agreement on their importance.  

The meeting concluded with motions to recommend several bills for passage, interim study, or further review, demonstrating the committee’s focus on balancing fiscal responsibility with the needs of New Hampshire’s workforce, economy, and election systems.
