The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 14, 2022, focused on several labor-related bills, including **Senate Bills 276, 377 FN, 209, and 345**, as well as **House Bills 209 and 345**. The discussions centered on regenerative manufacturing, workers' compensation for state troopers, electronic wage payments, youth employment regulations, and payroll card usage. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points and debates:

### **Regenerative Manufacturing and Tax Incentives (SB 276)**  
- **Senate Bill 276** aims to promote **regenerative manufacturing** in New Hampshire by offering tax breaks and tuition forgiveness to businesses and skilled workers in this field.  
- The **Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI)** received a $60 million grant from the Department of Defense to develop body parts and organs, with the goal of establishing a manufacturing ecosystem in the state.  
- Concerns were raised about the lack of progress reports from the New Hampshire Business Finance Authority. An amendment proposed a $1 million appropriation for the program, with the finance committee ensuring its inclusion in the budget.

### **Workers' Compensation for State Troopers (SB 377 FN)**  
- **Senate Bill 377 FN** addresses gaps in workers' compensation for state troopers injured while operating police vehicles during commutes to or from extra-duty assignments (e.g., construction details or funerals).  
- The bill creates a presumption that such injuries are occupationally caused, even if the trooper is technically "off-duty."  
- Questions were raised about whether this coverage should extend to other law enforcement agencies.  

### **Electronic Wage Payments (SB 209 and HB 209)**  
- **Senate Bill 209** and **House Bill 209** propose amendments to allow **electronic wage payments**, such as direct deposit and payroll cards, for employees.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - Employers must replace lost or destroyed payroll cards within 24 hours, with instant-issue cards available for immediate replacement.  
  - Employees must have a fee-free option to withdraw their full pay at least once per pay period.  
  - Employers are liable for late wage payments if employees cannot access their wages due to technical issues.  
- **Concerns**:  
  - The Department of Labor highlighted issues with payroll cards, including forced usage, lack of transparency about fees, and technical problems.  
  - Some representatives expressed concerns about the potential for fees and the need for clear disclosures, particularly for unbanked workers.  

### **Youth Employment Regulations (SB 345 and HB 345)**  
- **Senate Bill 345** and **House Bill 345** aim to update and clarify outdated labor laws regarding youth employment, particularly for 14-17-year-olds.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - Allows 14-year-olds to clear tables and remove empty containers, including glasses with residual alcohol, in restaurants.  
  - Simplifies **night work regulations**, proposing a hard limit of 10 PM for 17-year-olds, replacing the confusing current law that restricts shifts after 8 PM.  
  - Sets a maximum of 35 hours per week during the school year for 16-17-year-olds, removing restrictions based on school days.  
- **Testimony and Concerns**:  
  - **Mike Summers** of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association supported the bill, citing confusion with current night work restrictions.  
  - **Mike Sullen** of Aroma Joe’s emphasized the bill’s potential to retain employees who want to work more hours without violating labor laws.  
  - Some representatives raised concerns about teens balancing work, sleep, and school responsibilities, suggesting a 9 PM limit on school nights or capping hours at 24 per week during the school year.  
  - The Department of Labor noted confusion around current night work laws and highlighted complaints from parents about teens working late hours.  

### **Procedural Challenges and Amendments**  
- The committee faced tight deadlines, with some bills needing to be reported out by noon to proceed to a second committee.  
- Amendments were proposed to address specific labor-related issues, including incorporating language from **HB 1076** into **SB 209** and ensuring financial components were handled by the Finance Committee.  
- The committee chair encouraged members to submit amendments promptly to meet legislative deadlines.  

### **Overall Themes**  
- The meeting emphasized the need to modernize labor laws, particularly around wage payments and youth employment, while balancing the needs of businesses, workers, and vulnerable populations.  
- Concerns about accountability, transparency, and accessibility were central to discussions on tax incentives, payroll cards, and youth labor regulations.  
- Employers and stakeholders advocated for flexibility in labor laws to address workforce shortages and retain employees, while some representatives prioritized protecting workers’ rights and well-being.
