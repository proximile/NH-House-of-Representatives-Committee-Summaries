**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (04/22/22)**

The New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on April 22, 2022, addressed a wide range of topics, including the economic viability of Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) for therapeutic cannabis, updates on mental health and healthcare workforce initiatives, and improvements to the state’s developmental disabilities (DD) system. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) and Therapeutic Cannabis**
1. **Economic Viability Challenges**:
   - ATCs face economic sustainability concerns, particularly with the potential passage of low-tax or no-tax recreational cannabis legislation, which could create competitive pressures.
   - Current legislation does not allow ATCs to convert to for-profit entities, a model adopted by most states. Efforts to change this, such as Senate Bill 38 in 2021, were vetoed twice by the governor, and a veto override narrowly failed in the House.
   - Approximately 13,000 patients are served by ATCs, with numbers stabilizing. Increasing patient counts is seen as critical to improving ATC viability, while declining numbers could force price increases.
   - The therapeutic cannabis law mandates four licensed ATCs. If one closes, the state must issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to fill the gap, which would be resource-intensive.

2. **Legislative and Programmatic Efforts**:
   - Representative Abrami recommended that any future recreational cannabis legalization include a pathway for ATCs to participate in adult-use cannabis.
   - The Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board supported adding qualifying medical conditions (e.g., insomnia, autism spectrum disorder, opioid use disorder) and improving patient education and labeling requirements.
   - The board also discussed the potential impact of recreational cannabis on the therapeutic program, noting that most states with recreational cannabis maintain their medical programs, though patient numbers often decline.

### **Mental Health and Healthcare Workforce**
1. **Hampstead Hospital Update**:
   - Commissioner Lori Shibinette reported that Hampstead Hospital is set to close in mid-May, with a budget and contract approved for a third-party operator, Recovery Solutions. Efforts are underway to ensure staff stability and employment continuity.

2. **Mental Health Investments**:
   - A contract with HCA for additional inpatient mental health beds has been delayed but is expected to return to the Governor and Council before summer.

3. **Healthcare Workforce Roundtable**:
   - A recent roundtable focused on healthcare workforce recruitment and retention, with actionable items expected within 60 days. Proposals included upfront scholarship payments for nursing assistants and marketing campaigns to attract diverse candidates.

4. **Legislation**:
   - SB 376 funds mental health training for police officers, and SB 458 addresses workplace safety for healthcare workers.
   - HB 103, which includes a dental benefit for Medicaid recipients, has passed the Senate and is scheduled for a finance committee hearing.

### **Developmental Disabilities (DD) System Improvements**
1. **Medicaid Reimbursement and Conflict of Interest**:
   - The committee discussed issues with Medicaid billing and conflicts of interest in the 1915(c) waivers, which require separate entities for service provision and case management.

2. **System Enhancements**:
   - A 2020 report from the Governor’s Commission on Disabilities identified 13 areas for improvement, including intensive treatment services, transition supports, workforce quality, and cost management.
   - The Department is developing a new rate methodology based on individual needs using the Supports Intensity Scale (SIS) assessment and revising service definitions to improve quality and consistency.

3. **Direct Billing and IT Upgrades**:
   - The state is transitioning to a direct billing system for Medicaid providers and upgrading IT systems to enhance efficiency and data tracking.

4. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - The Department emphasized the importance of involving self-advocates, family members, and providers in shaping DD system improvements.

### **COVID-19 and Public Health**
1. **COVID-19 Update**:
   - Commissioner Shibinette reported increasing COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, stressing the importance of vaccination and natural immunity.
   - Wastewater testing for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is ongoing, with plans to transition testing to the public health lab in the fall.

### **Legislative Oversight and Task Forces**
1. **Precision Medicine Task Force**:
   - A task force on precision medicine was proposed, with recommendations to include members from various healthcare sectors and legislative bodies.

2. **Data Collection and Oversight**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of data collection, de-escalation techniques, and legislative oversight in healthcare settings to protect workers and ensure quality care.
