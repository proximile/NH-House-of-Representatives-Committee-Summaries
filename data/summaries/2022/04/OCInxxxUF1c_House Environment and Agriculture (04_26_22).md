**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (April 26, 2022):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on April 26, 2022, to discuss and vote on several bills related to advanced recycling, animal health, and other environmental and agricultural matters. The meeting included robust debates, amendments, and votes, as well as lighter moments of camaraderie and appreciation. Here is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **Advanced Recycling and Post-Use Polymers Bill:**
   - The committee discussed a bill aimed at clarifying definitions and processes related to advanced recycling and post-use polymers. The bill addressed when plastics cease to be considered solid waste and become feedstock for recycling.
   - **Amendment:** An amendment strengthened the bill by prioritizing the use of post-use polymers generated within New Hampshire and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Representative Bixby proposed additional language to clarify that advanced recycling facilities must adhere to all state and federal environmental laws, including clean air and water regulations. The amendment also specified that products of advanced recycling cannot include hydrocarbons marketed or used as fuel, ensuring that fuel use does not count toward recycling goals.
   - **Debate:** While the amendment was widely supported as an improvement, some committee members expressed concerns about the bill’s readiness, traceability of materials, and potential environmental risks. Representative Murray highlighted New Hampshire’s history with pollution and stressed the need for clear regulations. Representative Dutzy raised concerns about corporate accountability, referencing superfund sites.
   - **Vote:** The committee voted 9-7 in favor of the "Ought to Pass as Amended" (OTPA) motion for the bill. A minority report was planned to outline dissenting views.

2. **Senate Bill 367 (Advanced Recycling and Manufacturing Facilities):**
   - This bill addressed the regulatory status of advanced recycling facilities, which convert plastics into raw materials or products like lubricants, coatings, and new plastics.
   - **Subcommittee Recommendation:** The subcommittee voted 4-3 in favor of an **interim study**, citing the need for further analysis of the technology's environmental impact, energy use, and feedstock sourcing. Concerns were raised about unclear definitions, emissions, and the lack of independent scientific data.
   - **Final Vote:** The full committee rejected the interim study motion with an 11-9 vote, allowing the bill to move forward. Representative Bixby’s amendment was discussed but not finalized, as it required further review by the Department of Environmental Services (DES).

3. **Senate Bill 368 (Animal Health Certificates):**
   - This bill addressed the transfer of ownership of dogs, cats, and ferrets without an official health certificate, which is currently illegal but lacks enforcement penalties.
   - **Amendment:** Representative Pearl introduced an amendment to add a penalty clause, making it a misdemeanor for anyone (not just pet vendors) to transfer animals without a health certificate. The amendment also capped the revolving fund at $75,000 to address concerns about potential misuse of fines.
   - **Final Vote:** The committee unanimously passed the bill as amended, 16-0, and recommended it for the consent calendar.

### **Other Highlights:**

- **Committee Picnic Proposal:** Representative Bixby suggested organizing a committee picnic over the summer, potentially at a farm, to foster camaraderie. The idea was well-received, and further planning was discussed.
- **Gift Presentation:** The Dog Owners of the Granite State presented a custom painting of the state dog to the committee as a token of appreciation for their work on behalf of animals and pet owners.
- **Closing Remarks:** The meeting concluded with gratitude for the committee’s hard work and collegiality, and plans for future activities and tours were mentioned.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes:**
- **Advanced Recycling:** The discussions on advanced recycling bills highlighted the complexity of the technology, with debates over its environmental benefits, energy use, and regulatory clarity. While concerns were raised, the committee ultimately decided to proceed with the bills rather than delay them for further study.
- **Animal Health:** SB 368 focused on closing a legal loophole by adding penalties for transferring animals without health certificates, ensuring enforcement of existing laws.
- **Committee Unity:** The meeting balanced serious policy discussions with moments of camaraderie and appreciation, reflecting the committee’s collaborative spirit.

Both SB 367 and SB 368 moved forward, with SB 368 heading to the consent calendar and SB 367 awaiting further amendments and discussions. The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing environmental and agricultural issues while fostering a collegial atmosphere.
