The NH House of Representatives meeting on April 27, 2022, focused on two main topics: the establishment of a separate office for advocacy in special education and the discussion of two key bills, **SB 401** and **SB 381**. Hereâ€™s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Special Education Advocacy Office**:
The meeting highlighted the urgent need to address systemic issues in special education services through the creation of a dedicated advocacy office. Key points included:

1. **Advocacy for Special Education**: Representatives debated whether the new office should be co-located within the existing **Office of the Child Advocate (OCA)** or established as a separate, independent entity. Representative Jess Edwards emphasized the importance of aligning missions and ensuring proper support, suggesting that a separate office might be more effective to avoid conflicts of interest and workload management.

2. **Parental Concerns**: Jennifer Pike, a parent of a child with autism, stressed the need for staff with specialized knowledge in special education law, disability, and the IEP (Individualized Education Program) process. She expressed concerns about the current lack of expertise in the existing office and the potential for the new office to be ineffective if not properly staffed.

3. **Role of the OCA**: The discussion considered whether the OCA, which currently tracks data and trends, could handle education-related complaints if properly resourced. However, there was a consensus that a separate office for special education advocacy would be more effective.

### **SB 381: Special Education Advocate**:
The committee revisited **SB 381**, which proposes the creation of a **special education advocate**. Key discussions included:

1. **Reconsideration Motion**: The bill had previously been voted **6-1** to be placed on the Interim Study List (ITL) due to concerns about overlapping responsibilities between the OCA and the proposed special education advocate. Senator Reagan explained that the amendment would remove education-related responsibilities from the OCA and establish a separate special education advocate, appointed by the governor with council approval.

2. **Public Testimony**: Advocates like **Kate Shea** and **Darlene Gildersleeve** highlighted systemic failures in special education services and urged the committee to establish an independent advocate to address these issues effectively.

3. **Debate on Independence**: **Cassandra Sanchez**, the newly appointed Child Advocate, argued that the OCA should retain education oversight, emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach to child advocacy. However, several representatives, including **Heath** and **Cordelli**, supported separating the special education advocate from the OCA, citing the unique expertise required for special education issues and the need to avoid duplication of efforts.

4. **Committee Consensus**: The discussion emphasized the need for a **separate, specialized advocate** to address the complex challenges in special education, with the committee leaning toward supporting the amendment to create an independent office.

### **SB 401: Infrastructure Funding**:
The committee also discussed **SB 401**, which addresses funding for infrastructure projects like bridges, roads, and dash cams. Key points included:

1. **Amendment Approval**: The committee discussed an amendment (**2022-1844h**) to SB 401, motioned by Representative Petry and seconded by Representative Keith. After minimal discussion, the committee voted **5-0** to accept the amendment.

2. **Department of Transportation (DOT) Efforts**: The committee acknowledged the DOT's efforts and the work of budget analyst Mickey Landrigan, expressing confidence that the amended bill would benefit constituents, particularly in the Rhoden Bridge area.

### **Key Themes**:
1. **Special Education Advocacy**: The meeting underscored the importance of creating a dedicated office to address the unique needs of children with disabilities in the education system, while ensuring that the new office is well-staffed and capable of making a meaningful impact.
2. **Infrastructure Funding**: The committee unanimously approved an amendment to streamline **SB 401**, focusing on infrastructure funding and expressing confidence in the DOT's efforts.
3. **Public Testimony**: Highlighted the urgent need for reform in special education services, with parents and advocates calling for an independent office to prioritize the needs of children and families.

The session concluded with a commitment to further review the amendment and ensure clarity in the roles and responsibilities of the proposed special education advocate.
