### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (04/19)

The April 19th meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee covered a wide range of topics, with a primary focus on healthcare licensing, labor agreements, workforce recruitment, and case management services. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and debates:

---

### **1. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) – Senate Bill 274**
- **Purpose**: SB 274 seeks to prohibit the state from mandating **Project Labor Agreements (PLAs)** in state construction contracts, promoting open competition.
- **Key Arguments**:
  - **Opposition**: Union representatives and some legislators argued that PLAs ensure fair wages, safety standards, and workforce training. They warned that banning PLAs could jeopardize **federal funding**, particularly under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which often requires PLAs for grants over $35 million. Opponents also highlighted successful PLA projects that benefited local economies and workers.
  - **Support**: Merit-based contractors and business representatives argued that PLAs impose union work rules, increase costs, and exclude non-union contractors. Supporters emphasized that the bill preserves a free market and protects New Hampshire contractors from being forced into labor agreements.
- **Federal Funding Concerns**: Opponents stressed that the bill could conflict with federal labor standards, potentially reducing New Hampshire’s eligibility for infrastructure funding.
- **Outcome**: The bill faced significant opposition due to concerns about federal funding and labor practices, with further discussion expected.

### **2. Healthcare Licensing and Workforce Issues**
- **Emergency Licensing Extensions – Senate Bill 277**:
  - The bill extends emergency licensing authorizations for healthcare workers, initially implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, to address workforce shortages.
  - **Key Points**: The committee debated whether to extend licenses to **2023 or 2024**, with concerns about lost revenue from waived fees. Amendments were proposed to align the bill with renewal schedules and remove the "no cost" provision for mail-order pharmacy licenses.
  - **Outcome**: The committee planned to revisit the bill with draft amendments.

- **Recruitment and Retention Incentives – Senate Bill 226**:
  - The bill proposes enabling legislation to allow the Division of Personnel to establish paid recruitment and retention incentives, including bonuses and referral fees, to address high vacancy rates in state departments (e.g., 34% for security staff, 50% for mental health clinicians).
  - **Concerns**: Discussions focused on fairness, competitive wages, and the potential impact on employee unions.
  - **Outcome**: The bill includes a repeal date of July 1, 2023, for evaluation and potential inclusion in the next budget cycle.

- **Telehealth Licensing – Senate Bill 382**:
  - The bill clarifies that healthcare providers offering telehealth services to patients in New Hampshire must be licensed in the state, as services are deemed to occur where the patient is located.
  - **Key Points**: The bill addresses patient safety, insurance coverage, and the need for clear jurisdictional rules. It also allows the state to enter into reciprocity agreements with other states to streamline licensing for out-of-state providers.

### **3. Case Management Services and Licensing**
- **Senate Bill 333**:
  - The bill aims to clarify the licensing of case management agencies under **RSA 151:2-b**, addressing confusion created by recent changes from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
  - **Key Issues**:
    - **Conflict-Free Case Management**: Federal Medicaid waiver requirements mandate that case management agencies do not directly provide services to avoid conflicts of interest. New Hampshire is under a corrective action plan to address non-compliance.
    - **Stakeholder Concerns**: Case management agencies emphasized their long-standing compliance with licensing requirements and the need to maintain protections for patients.
  - **Proposed Amendments**: HHS proposed a cleaner amendment to clarify definitions and ensure compliance with federal requirements, avoiding unintended consequences for healthcare providers.
  - **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on the bill, with further discussion expected after reviewing RSA 151.

### **4. Auctioneer Licensing – Senate Bill 225**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to eliminate the requirement for licensed auctioneers to carry a $25,000 performance bond, which has never been used to settle disputes.
- **Rationale**: The auction industry has shifted significantly to online sales, which are not regulated by the state. The bill aims to modernize licensing laws and reduce unnecessary expenses for auctioneers.

---

### **5. Oversight Committee for Licensing**
- **Proposal**: Discussions centered on creating an oversight committee for the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** to address issues between boards, commissions, and OPLC administration.
- **Support**: OPLC Director Lindsey Courtney expressed support for the committee but suggested broadening its scope to allow OPLC to bring concerns about boards to the committee’s attention.

---

### **6. Broader Themes and Implications**
- **Federal-State Tensions**: Many discussions highlighted the challenges of aligning state licensing laws with federal requirements, particularly in healthcare and labor agreements.
- **Workforce Shortages**: Recruitment and retention issues in state departments, especially healthcare and corrections, were a recurring theme, with proposed solutions including incentives and telehealth licensing reforms.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Testimonies from contractors, union representatives, healthcare providers, and case management agencies underscored the importance of balancing regulatory clarity with flexibility to protect workers, patients, and businesses.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a complex interplay between state autonomy, federal compliance, and stakeholder interests. Key bills like SB 274 (PLAs), SB 277 (emergency licensing), and SB 333 (case management licensing) sparked intense debate, with outcomes likely to shape New Hampshire’s labor practices, healthcare workforce, and regulatory framework. The committee’s focus on amendments and further discussions indicates a commitment to addressing these issues thoughtfully and collaboratively.
