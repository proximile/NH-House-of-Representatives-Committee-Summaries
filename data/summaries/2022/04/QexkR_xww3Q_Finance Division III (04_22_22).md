### **Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (04/22/22)**

The NH House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on April 22, 2022, focused on two key legislative initiatives: **Senate Bill 459 (SB 459)**, addressing workforce safety in healthcare settings, and **Senate Bill 458 (SB 458)**, concerning the replacement of the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC) and broader juvenile justice reforms. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing public safety, financial implications, and the well-being of vulnerable populations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Senate Bill 459: Workforce Safety in Healthcare Settings**
**Objective**: SB 459 aims to address workplace violence in healthcare settings through data collection, the formation of a commission, and the development of best practices, rather than increasing criminal penalties for assaults on healthcare workers.

**Key Discussions**:
- **Mandatory vs. Voluntary Compliance**: The primary debate centered on whether the program should be mandatory or voluntary. Proponents of a mandatory program argued it would ensure uniformity, accountability, and protection for healthcare workers across all facilities. Opponents, however, raised concerns about the financial burden on hospitals, particularly smaller or struggling institutions, and suggested making the program voluntary to avoid unfunded mandates.
- **Financial Implications**: The fiscal note estimated $272,000 annually for staffing and implementation at two facilities, with a third likely to follow. Concerns were raised about the financial strain on hospitals and the potential for incomplete data collection if participation were voluntary.
- **Confidentiality and Reporting**: The bill includes provisions for annual reporting to the commissioner, with employee names and job titles reported but patient names omitted. Confidentiality issues were discussed, with emphasis on protecting individuals’ identities.
- **Stakeholder Support**: The bill was developed with input from key stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Hospital Association and the New Hampshire Nurses Association. Testimony highlighted the prevalence of workplace violence in healthcare, with 37% of nurses in a pilot study reporting physical aggression and 73% experiencing some form of violence in the previous six months.
- **Next Steps**: The group agreed to invite additional stakeholders, such as NAMI and the Disability Rights Center, for further input. Amendments were proposed to balance the need for a robust program with financial and operational considerations.

### **2. Senate Bill 458: Replacement of the Sununu Youth Services Center**
**Objective**: SB 458 proposes replacing the SYSC with a smaller, secure facility. The Senate version recommended an 18-bed facility, while the House version proposed a 6-bed facility.

**Key Discussions**:
- **Facility Size and Design**: Concerns were raised about the adequacy of a 6-bed facility, given the current average daily census of about 12 youth (ranging from 8 to 16) and the need to separate populations (e.g., males, females, gang-affiliated individuals). A smaller facility was seen as insufficient to accommodate peak populations and ensure safety.
- **Therapeutic vs. Correctional Model**: There was a strong push to transition from a correctional model to a therapeutic, home-like environment. Emphasis was placed on evidence-based practices, trauma-informed care, and staff trained in adolescent brain science. The current SYSC was criticized for feeling like a jail rather than a therapeutic setting.
- **Public vs. Private Operation**: The group advocated for a publicly operated facility, citing concerns about transparency, accountability, and safety in private facilities. Public oversight by the Office of the Child Advocate was seen as critical to ensuring the well-being of children.
- **Impact of House Bill 254 (HB 254)**: HB 254, which restricts the types of offenses for which juveniles can be incarcerated, was discussed. Some lawmakers expressed concern that HB 254 might not reduce the census at SYSC as intended and could lead to more juveniles being charged as adults, complicating housing arrangements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).
- **System of Care**: Investments in community-based behavioral health services, such as the **Fast Forward** program and **Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST)**, were highlighted as key to reducing the need for secure facilities. While these programs have shown positive results, their full impact will take time to materialize.

**Financial and Workforce Challenges**:
- Workforce shortages in social services and mental health were identified as a significant barrier to implementing new programs effectively.
- The fiscal implications of transitioning to a smaller facility were debated, with calls for accurate fiscal notes to reflect current policy decisions.

**Legislative Process**:
- The committee faced a tight timeline, with amendments due by Tuesday night to allow the full finance committee to vote on Wednesday. The rapid legislative process underscored the challenges of thoroughly vetting policy decisions within limited time frames.

### **3. Broader Themes and Takeaways**
- **Public Safety vs. Child Welfare**: The discussions emphasized the need to balance public safety with the best interests of children, particularly in juvenile justice reform. A therapeutic, child-focused approach was advocated over punitive measures.
- **Systemic Reforms**: Both bills highlighted the importance of systemic reforms—whether in healthcare workforce safety or juvenile justice—through data-driven policies, stakeholder collaboration, and evidence-based practices.
- **Financial and Workforce Considerations**: Financial implications and workforce shortages were recurring themes, underscoring the challenges of implementing new programs and ensuring their sustainability.
- **Long-Term Impact**: While investments in community-based services and preventative measures were praised, it was acknowledged that their full impact would take time to materialize.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of addressing workplace violence in healthcare and reforming the juvenile justice system. Both SB 459 and SB 458 reflect a commitment to protecting vulnerable populations, but the discussions highlighted the challenges of balancing policy goals with financial realities and workforce constraints. The committee planned to continue refining the bills with proposed amendments, stakeholder input, and further analysis to ensure effective and comprehensive solutions.
