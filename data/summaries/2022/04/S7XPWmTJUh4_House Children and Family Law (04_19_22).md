### **Bills and Discussions**

#### **SB 336**
The committee unanimously voted **14-0** to pass this bill, with no objections or significant discussion recorded.

#### **SB 326**
A motion to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** the bill sparked debate. Representative Yokela argued against the bill, stating the work could proceed without a study commission. Representatives Long and Grossman supported the bill, highlighting its importance for early childhood development and its bipartisan backing. The motion to ITL failed **9-5**, and the bill was passed.

#### **SB 144**
Representative Nelson moved to ITL this bill, expressing concerns that absentee policies in child care programs could lead to unnecessary costs and limit access for other children. Representatives Long and Altschiller opposed the motion, arguing that the bill was a pilot program designed to address child care needs and deserved a chance. The motion to ITL passed **8-7**.

#### **SB 457**
Representative Belanger moved to ITL this bill, citing concerns about the proposed commission’s effectiveness and preferring to collaborate with the Department of Insurance for solutions. The motion to ITL passed **8-7**.

#### **SB 431**
Representative Yokela proposed an amendment to this bill, arguing it would give judges more flexibility to determine child support based on the child’s best interest rather than rigid guidelines.

The discussion highlighted differing perspectives on balancing judicial flexibility with clear guidelines to ensure fair outcomes for children and families.
