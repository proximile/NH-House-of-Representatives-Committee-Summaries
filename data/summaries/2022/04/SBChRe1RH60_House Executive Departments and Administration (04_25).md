The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 25th focused on a wide range of legislative issues, with particular emphasis on healthcare, licensing, child welfare, and drug pricing transparency. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Child Welfare and Interstate Compacts**
1. **House Bill 397 (Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children)**:
   - The bill addresses the outdated 1960 compact, which has been ineffective in managing child placements across state lines. Issues include lack of clarity on placement types, dispute resolution, and uniform application.
   - A new compact was proposed to establish a regulatory body, clarify placement rules, and ensure safer environments for children. The amendment referenced the tragic case of Harmony Montgomery, emphasizing the need for protections in cross-state placements.
   - The transition plan ensures no disruption in services, and the new compact requires approval from 35 states due to its critical nature. Stakeholders, including the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and DCYF, supported the bill.
   - The **Pearson Amendment** (Amendment 1759) removed the compact from SB 397 while retaining critical language, passing 10-9. The committee ultimately voted to pass the bill with the amendment.

2. **Senate Bill 224 (Children’s Environmental Health Day)**:
   - The bill proposed recognizing the second Thursday in October as Children’s Environmental Health Day. However, the committee unanimously voted to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**, citing opposition to creating new memorial days.

### **Healthcare and Licensing**
3. **Senate Bill 450 (Prescription Drug Affordability Board - PDAB)**:
   - The bill aimed to enhance transparency and accountability in drug pricing by clarifying and simplifying the PDAB’s operations. Key changes included defining manufacturers, standardizing pricing units, and establishing an appeals process for fees.
   - Testimonies from **Gary Merchant** (PDAB Chair) and **Senator Tom Sherman** highlighted the board’s progress and the need for cost-effective drug pricing. Public testimonies from **AARP volunteers** shared personal stories of financial hardship due to high drug costs.
   - Concerns were raised about the fee structure, leading to amendments to remove the $500 minimum fee and align fees with other state boards. The bill ultimately passed with amendments.

4. **Senate Bill 382 (Telehealth Licensing)**:
   - The bill proposed prohibiting out-of-state telehealth providers from serving New Hampshire residents without a state license. Concerns about limiting access to care led to a failed motion to ITL, and the bill passed 13-6.

5. **Senate Bill 277 (Emergency Medical Licensure)**:
   - The committee debated continuing education requirements for medical providers, particularly those out of practice for several years. Representative Marsh proposed amendments to address these concerns, and the bill passed 18-1.

6. **Senate Bill 333 (Case Management Licensing)**:
   - Discussions focused on the need for conflict-free case management under federal requirements. The **Marsh Amendment** removed a contentious section added by the Senate, passing 18-1.

### **Other Key Bills and Amendments**
7. **Senate Bill 330 (Oversight Committee)**:
   - An amendment addressed concerns about the oversight of the OPLC, removing references to the Boxing and Wrestling Commission and adjusting reporting timelines. The bill passed with amendments.

8. **Senate Bill 357 (PTSD Training for First Responders)**:
   - An amendment clarified training requirements for first responders, including dispatchers and corrections officers, allowing for online training. The bill passed with amendments.

9. **Senate Bill 383 (Land Surveyors)**:
   - An amendment addressed unlicensed practice and non-resident licensure, removing the board’s ability to prosecute unlicensed practice but strengthening investigative powers. The bill passed with amendments.

10. **Senate Bill 282 (Acupuncture Licensing)**:
    - An amendment resolved disagreements among acupuncturists by adding a third pathway for licensure and updating terminology. The bill passed with amendments.

11. **Senate Bill 358 (JLCAR Expansion)**:
    - An amendment proposed dividing the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) into three divisions to reduce workload and involve more House members. The amendment was adopted, and the bill passed.

12. **Senate Bill 274 (Project Labor Agreements)**:
    - The bill aimed to prohibit project labor agreements (PLAs) on state contracts. Testimonies revealed PLAs have never been used in New Hampshire, and the committee voted 12-7 to ITL.

### **General Themes**
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Many bills focused on improving transparency, particularly in drug pricing and licensing.
- **Federal Compliance**: Discussions emphasized the importance of aligning state regulations with federal requirements, especially in Medicaid and case management.
- **Practicality and Clarity**: Members sought to avoid unnecessary legislative complexity and ensure clarity in language to address immediate needs without overloading the legislative process.
