**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (April 11, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on April 11, 2022, to discuss several key pieces of legislation aimed at improving energy efficiency, expanding renewable energy access, enhancing broadband and wireless connectivity, and reforming energy-related regulatory processes. The meeting highlighted a range of initiatives designed to address the state’s energy, environmental, and infrastructure challenges.

### **Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Programs**
1. **Senate Bill 269-FN**: This bill proposes the creation of a commission to study energy-saving weatherization programs, with a focus on expanding access to propane and oil users. The goal is to ensure equity across all energy sources, particularly for low-income households. Supporters, including the New Hampshire Department of Energy and the Home Builders Association, emphasized the need for comprehensive stakeholder input, while opponents raised concerns about potential new fees on propane and oil consumers. The commission’s composition and potential overlap with existing programs were also discussed.

2. **Energy Efficiency and Low-Income Assistance**: Representatives discussed the need to consolidate energy efficiency programs and improve weatherization efforts for existing homes. Testimony highlighted the financial challenges faced by low-income homeowners and renters in improving energy efficiency. Quality oversight of contractors was emphasized to prevent subpar work.

### **Renewable Energy Initiatives**
1. **Senate Bill 270 (Community Solar Program)**: Introduced by Senator Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, this bill establishes a low- to moderate-income community solar program. It uses anonymized utility data to identify eligible households, allowing them to receive bill credits for solar energy and reduce electricity costs. The program addresses privacy concerns and received strong support.

2. **Senate Bill 424 (Renewable Natural Gas)**: This bill allows gas utilities to recover costs for procuring renewable natural gas (RNG) from sources like landfills and animal waste. While supporters highlighted RNG’s potential to reduce methane emissions and diversify energy sources, critics raised concerns about environmental impacts and costs to ratepayers. The bill is positioned as a pilot program with a 5% cap on RNG usage.

3. **Senate Bill 268 (Offshore Wind Energy)**: This bill establishes a framework for New Hampshire to assert regulatory authority over offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine through **federal consistency**. It aims to protect fisheries, marine habitats, and transit lanes while ensuring economic benefits for the state. The bill also creates a coastal fund and advisory board to manage mitigation efforts.

### **Broadband and Wireless Connectivity**
1. **Senate Bill 395 (Broadband Matching Grant Initiative)**: Introduced by Senator Jay Kahn, this bill aims to improve broadband access in underserved areas by creating a matching grant program within the existing broadband fund. The initiative leverages federal and state funds and partnerships with service providers to address "dead spots" in cellular and internet service.

2. **House Bill 395 (Wireless Deployment Grant Initiative)**: This bill focuses on expanding wireless connectivity in underserved areas, emphasizing public safety, healthcare, and education. It proposes using funds from the Broadband Fund and aligning with federal initiatives like **FirstNet**. An amendment was discussed to clarify eligibility criteria and ensure the sustainability of wireless infrastructure.

### **Regulatory Reforms**
1. **Senate Bill 429-FN (Site Evaluation Committee Reforms)**: This bill proposes changes to the **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)**, including allowing agency designees to participate, reducing the quorum to five members, and updating fees. The bill aims to address operational challenges such as inadequate funding and staffing. Long-term reforms, including integrating the SEC into the **Department of Energy (DOE)** and transferring adjudicative responsibilities to the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**, were also discussed.

### **Public Safety and Infrastructure**
1. **Waste Disposal and Landfills**: Concerns were raised about the near-monopoly of large corporations in waste disposal and the need for long-term planning for industrial facilities. It was noted that New Hampshire does not face an immediate capacity crisis for waste disposal.

2. **Fee Structures and Permitting**: Representatives debated the fairness of fee structures for energy projects reviewed by the PUC and SEC. They emphasized that industries, not ratepayers, should bear the costs of permitting processes to maintain regulatory autonomy.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Energy Equity**: Several bills focused on expanding access to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs for low-income households, ensuring fairness across energy sources.
- **Environmental Protection**: Legislation aimed at offshore wind, renewable natural gas, and weatherization emphasized balancing economic benefits with environmental safeguards.
- **Infrastructure Improvement**: Broadband and wireless initiatives highlighted the importance of reliable connectivity for public safety, healthcare, education, and economic development.
- **Regulatory Efficiency**: Reforms to the SEC and PUC sought to streamline processes, improve public participation, and address funding and staffing challenges.

The meeting concluded with plans for an executive session to vote on several bills, underscoring the committee’s commitment to addressing New Hampshire’s energy, environmental, and infrastructure needs in a comprehensive and equitable manner.
