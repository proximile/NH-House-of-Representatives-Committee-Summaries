**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (April 15, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 15, 2022, focused on administrative rules, with significant attention given to child care licensing regulations. The discussions highlighted ongoing challenges faced by child care providers and state agencies, emphasizing the need for process improvements, regulatory flexibility, and collaboration. Key points from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Child Care Licensing Rules**
1. **Fingerprinting and Background Checks**:
   - Child care providers face delays in obtaining fingerprinting appointments, which are required for federally mandated background checks. The state is working to address this by acquiring more fingerprinting machines and improving appointment availability, aiming for a one-week turnaround.
   - Background check results must be sent directly to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and cannot be shared across agencies due to federal restrictions. This has led to redundant checks for individuals working in multiple roles.
   - A study committee is being formed to explore centralizing background checks across agencies to reduce redundancy and streamline the process.
   - Delays in receiving eligibility cards for employees who have been fingerprinted were also raised as a concern, despite the department cashing checks for these services.

2. **Evacuation Plans**:
   - Providers questioned the requirement for off-site evacuation drills, particularly for programs that do not take children off premises, arguing that it is unnecessary and burdensome.

3. **Informal Dispute Resolution**:
   - Concerns were raised about the fairness and transparency of the dispute resolution process, especially regarding the posting of information on state websites.

4. **Professional Development**:
   - Suggestions were made to include training on appropriate discipline for young children in required professional development courses.

5. **Sick Child Policies**:
   - Providers argued that rules around excluding sick children from care and outdoor activities are too restrictive, removing their discretion to make decisions based on individual circumstances.

6. **Time Frames for Departmental Response**:
   - Providers highlighted the lack of timely responses from the Child Care Licensing Unit (CCLU) regarding corrective action plans and other paperwork, which hampers their ability to remain in compliance. Efforts are being made to improve response times, with a goal of meeting the newly implemented 21-day requirement.

### **Workforce and Regulatory Challenges**
1. **Workforce Shortages**:
   - Both child care providers and state agencies are struggling with workforce shortages, which impact the timely processing of background checks and other administrative tasks. Providers emphasized the severe staffing crisis in the child care industry, exacerbated by stringent licensing requirements and difficulty finding qualified staff.
   - Providers requested more flexibility in hiring assistants and other staff to help mitigate the crisis.

2. **Overregulation**:
   - Providers argued that the extensive and complex licensing rules set programs up for failure and called for simplification and more user-friendly regulations.

### **Financial and Compliance Concerns**
1. **Federal Requirements and Penalties**:
   - Non-compliance with federal child care regulations could result in significant financial penalties for the state, potentially affecting funding for child care scholarships and program support.

### **Testimonies and Responses**
- Kristen Byron and other child care providers testified about the challenges they face, including overregulation and the impact on their ability to operate effectively.
- Melissa Clement, Chief of the Child Care Licensing Unit, responded to concerns, particularly around fingerprinting, stating that it is a federal requirement managed by the state police.

### **Other Administrative Rules**
- The committee also discussed other administrative rules, including those related to occupational therapy licensing and pet vendor regulations, with specific concerns about rule clarity and enforcement.

### **Outcome**
- The committee approved the proposed administrative rules but acknowledged the ongoing challenges faced by child care providers and committed to addressing minor corrections and improving processes where possible.
- A motion was made to cancel the continued meeting on this topic, as the rules were approved.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the significant challenges faced by child care providers in New Hampshire, particularly around staffing, regulation, and compliance. It called for more collaborative and flexible approaches to licensing and enforcement, with a focus on reducing redundancy, improving response times, and addressing workforce shortages. The state committed to working with providers to ensure that administrative rules support rather than hinder the child care industry.
