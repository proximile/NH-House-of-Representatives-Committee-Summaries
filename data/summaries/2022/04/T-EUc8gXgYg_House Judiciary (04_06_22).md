**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Judiciary, 04/06/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 6, 2022, focused on a range of legislative bills addressing issues such as right-to-know laws, tenant protections, competency restoration, and remote meetings. The discussions highlighted the complexities of these issues and the need for balanced, effective solutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **Right-to-Know Laws and Public Transparency**
1. **Senate Bill 301**:
   - Addressed procedures for violations under the Right-to-Know Law, focusing on document requests and court backlogs.
   - Concerns were raised about the bill’s applicability statewide and its failure to address meeting issues under RSA 91A.
   - Suggestions included clarifying language around the definition of government records and ensuring equitable enforcement.

2. **Senate Bill 339**:
   - Proposed allowing certain volunteer boards within the Department of Safety to conduct virtual meetings, exempting them from physical quorum requirements.
   - The bill aimed to increase participation, reduce travel burdens, and maintain transparency through public notice, roll call votes, and minutes.
   - Virtual meetings were praised for increasing accessibility during the pandemic, though technical challenges like poor audio quality were noted.

### **Tenant Protections and the Housing Crisis**
1. **House Bill 217** and **Senate Bill 217**:
   - These bills sought to extend the eviction notice period from 30 to 60 days for tenants facing eviction due to property renovations or sales.
   - Supporters argued that the extended notice period would help tenants find alternative housing in a tight rental market, where vacancy rates are below 1% and median rents are nearly $1,500 for a two-bedroom apartment.
   - Landlords and property managers expressed concerns about increased costs, delayed renovations, and potential abuse of the extended notice period.
   - The discussion emphasized the broader housing crisis, including the lack of affordable housing and the need for long-term solutions.

2. **Landlord-Tenant Mediation Program (Senate Bill 216)**:
   - Proposed a commission to study the Landlord and Tenant Mediation Program, which has a reported success rate of up to 80% in preventing evictions.
   - The program was praised for resolving disputes without evictions, but legislative support was needed to expand its reach.

### **Competency Restoration and Insanity Definitions**
1. **Senate Bill 392**:
   - Addressed the competency restoration process for individuals deemed incompetent to stand trial due to severe psychiatric illness or intellectual deficits.
   - New Hampshire is the only state without a formalized process, resulting in low restoration rates (below 40%, compared to 80% nationally).
   - A working group was proposed to address systemic issues, involving stakeholders from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Corrections, and mental health professionals.
   - The bill also highlighted the need to update the outdated definition of insanity (last amended in 1918) and align New Hampshire’s practices with national standards.

### **Remote Licensing Board Hearings**
1. **Senate Bill 222**:
   - Allowed licensing boards to conduct remote hearings to address quorum issues and reduce travel burdens for board members.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential loss of transparency and public participation in physical meetings.
   - The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) noted challenges with in-person meetings post-pandemic but did not take a position on the bill.

### **Criminal Investigations and Judicial Efficiency**
1. **Senate Bill 288**:
   - Focused on access to records for criminal investigations, particularly in insurance fraud cases.
   - Testimony emphasized the need for strict protections on sensitive information shared between law enforcement and the insurance department.

2. **Senate Bill 297**:
   - Aimed to simplify the process of obtaining out-of-state discovery and testimony for litigation in New Hampshire.
   - Supporters argued it would improve judicial efficiency, reduce delays, and lower legal costs, aligning New Hampshire with 43 other states that have adopted this uniform act.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Balancing Stakeholder Interests**:
   - Many bills, such as those addressing tenant protections and remote meetings, highlighted the need to balance competing interests (e.g., tenants vs. landlords, transparency vs. accessibility).

2. **Systemic Challenges**:
   - Discussions on competency restoration and the housing crisis underscored systemic issues requiring coordinated, long-term solutions.

3. **Impact of the Pandemic**:
   - The pandemic’s influence was evident in discussions on remote meetings, evictions, and the housing market, with many bills seeking to formalize temporary solutions (e.g., virtual meetings, extended eviction notice periods).

4. **Need for Legislative Clarity**:
   - Several bills required clearer language or definitions to prevent unintended consequences, such as abuse of extended eviction notices or confusion around remote meeting transparency.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ efforts to address pressing issues in public transparency, tenant protections, mental health, and judicial efficiency. While there was broad agreement on the need for reform, the discussions highlighted the complexities of crafting legislation that balances competing interests and addresses systemic challenges. The proposed bills represent steps toward improving these systems, but further refinement and stakeholder collaboration will be essential to ensure effective and equitable outcomes.
