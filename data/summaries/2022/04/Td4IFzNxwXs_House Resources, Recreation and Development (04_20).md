### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee Meeting (04/20)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on April 20 to discuss a range of bills addressing environmental, public health, and historical preservation issues. The meeting was marked by collegiality and collaboration, with members expressing appreciation for the constructive dialogue. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

---

#### **1. Stormwater Utility and Shoreline Septic Systems**  
The committee examined the financial and infrastructure implications of adopting a **stormwater utility system**. Concerns were raised about the lack of understanding of the bill, particularly among realtors, and the need for municipalities to become more comfortable with the mechanism. Additionally, the issue of **nitrogen pollution from individual septic systems** was highlighted as a significant environmental problem, with challenges related to private property rights and the costs of upgrades. The committee agreed to an **interim study** to further explore the bill and gather municipal input.

#### **2. African-American Burial Sites (Senate Bill 258)**  
The bill aimed to preserve and protect African-American gravesites from the period of American enslavement. While some representatives supported the bill as a long-overdue measure to address historical injustices and ensure respect for these burial sites, others raised concerns about the language of the bill, particularly the involvement of the **Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire**, a private entity, in fiduciary responsibilities. The committee voted **13-8** in favor of an **interim study** to address these concerns and refine the bill.

#### **3. Aquatic Invasive Species**  
The committee received a presentation from the **Exotic Aquatic Weeds and Species Committee**, joined by experts from the New Hampshire Rivers Council, DES, and New Hampshire Lakes. Key points included:  
- **Threats**: Aquatic invasive species such as variable milfoil, fanwort, and Asian clams pose significant risks to New Hampshire’s water bodies, impacting ecosystems, property values, tourism, and recreational activities.  
- **Mitigation Efforts**: Programs like **Lake Hosts**, **Weed Watchers**, and **River Runners** rely on volunteers to prevent, detect, and manage invasive species through boat inspections and early detection.  
- **Funding and Challenges**: Prevention is the most cost-effective approach, but funding is limited, and volunteerism is declining. Mobile and stationary boat cleaning stations (e.g., CD3 units) are being piloted to address the spread of invasive species.  
- **Legislative Needs**: More resources and legislation are needed to combat the growing threat.

#### **4. Lead in Drinking Water (Senate Bill 452)**  
The committee debated SB 452, introduced by Senator Lou D’Alessandro, which aims to reduce lead exposure in schools and child care facilities. Key points included:  
- **Health Risks**: No level of lead is safe for children, with even low exposure causing irreversible cognitive and behavioral harm.  
- **Current Situation**: Testing revealed widespread lead contamination in New Hampshire schools, with 40% reporting lead in drinking water and 10% exceeding the federal action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb).  
- **Proposed Solution**: SB 452 would establish a **health-based limit of 5 ppb** for lead in drinking water, require testing, and mandate notification of parents if lead levels are high.  
- **Funding**: The state has allocated $1.8 million from the Water Trust for lead pipe removal in schools, but only $70,000 has been spent due to COVID-19-related school closures.  
The committee voted to **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)** the bill, as similar provisions were included in **HB 1421**, which had already passed the Senate with amendments.

#### **5. Personal Watercraft Restrictions (Senate Bill 305)**  
SB 305 addressed restrictions on personal watercraft in specific areas, such as Hampton Falls and Newcastle-Rye estuaries. The bill allows personal watercraft to operate at headway speed in designated channels to minimize environmental impact. The committee **unanimously voted to pass** the bill, recognizing its practicality and support from marine patrol.

---

#### **6. Sewage Disposal Systems (Senate Bill 257)**  
SB 257 proposed enabling municipalities to incorporate sewage disposal systems into their stormwater utilities. Concerns were raised about potential unintended consequences and the need for further study, particularly regarding private septic systems. The committee voted to send the bill to **interim study** for further evaluation.

---

#### **Conclusion**  
The meeting concluded with a focus on balancing public health, environmental protection, and practical considerations. Members emphasized the need for increased funding, volunteer engagement, and legislative action to address critical issues such as aquatic invasive species, lead contamination, and historical preservation. Several bills were sent to interim study for further refinement, reflecting the committee’s commitment to thorough and thoughtful policymaking.
