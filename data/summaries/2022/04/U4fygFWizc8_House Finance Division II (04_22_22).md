**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (04/22/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on April 22, 2022, addressed a range of critical issues, including transportation funding, infrastructure projects, public safety initiatives, and education services. The discussions focused on the allocation of funds, implementation of safety measures, and compliance with federal mandates. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the key topics and decisions:

---

### **Transportation Funding and Infrastructure**

1. **Allocation of Transportation Funds**:
   - The committee debated the distribution of **$66 million** in transportation funds, particularly for municipal bridge and road maintenance. Two primary options were considered: direct allocation to towns or distribution through the **State Aid Bridge Program**, which involves a cost-sharing process with municipalities but is slower due to bureaucratic procedures.
   - Concerns were raised about delays in funds reaching towns, prompting suggestions to expedite the process by directly apportioning funds to municipalities for use on any road or bridge maintenance.
   - The committee also discussed prioritizing "red-listed" bridges (those in critical condition) while ensuring equitable distribution based on the number or size of bridges in each town.

2. **Dash Cameras in State Vehicles**:
   - The **Department of Transportation (DOT)** sought authorization to install dash cameras in fleet vehicles for safety and liability purposes. The cameras would protect employees and help identify vehicles involved in accidents or damage to state property.
   - To address privacy concerns, video footage would be stored for no more than **three days** unless needed for legal or insurance claims.

3. **Grant Program for Local Dash Cameras**:
   - A **$1 million grant program** for local law enforcement to implement dash and body cameras was discussed. The program had already distributed funds to **29 communities**, with **$120,000** remaining for a second round of applications.
   - The grant allows communities to choose their preferred camera models and hosting solutions, ensuring flexibility based on local needs.

### **Public Safety and Police Training**

1. **Senate Bill 376 (Police Training Funding)**:
   - **SB 376** proposed **$1.1 million** (potentially increasing to **$1.2 million**) to fund the training of police officers, particularly in **crisis intervention (CIT)** for mental health situations. The training would cover **234 municipalities**, including towns, cities, sheriff's departments, and correctional facilities.
   - The cost per officer was estimated at **$4,700**, with eight courses at **$12,500 each** over eight months. The funds were requested to be **non-lapsing** due to the training extending beyond the fiscal year.
   - A personal anecdote highlighted the importance of mental health awareness in law enforcement, emphasizing the necessity of the training.

### **Education and Special Services**

1. **House Bill 401 (Special Education Funding)**:
   - **HB 401** addressed the extension of special education services to students up to age **22**, in compliance with federal **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)** requirements. Currently, services end at age **21**, risking federal violations and potential lawsuits.
   - The **Attorney General's office** warned of legal risks if the law was not changed. A **study committee** was proposed to review the establishment of a mental health review board for police shootings, though some members questioned the need for a separate board, suggesting integration into existing structures.
   - The estimated cost was **$18,000 per student**. The **Department of Education** had **$1.4 million** in unspent special education funds, which could cover costs for one year. The committee considered making the funds **non-lapsing** and adjusting the effective date to **upon passage** to address the immediate legal risk.
   - An amendment was proposed to have the **Department of Education** cover costs for students aged **21 to 22** for the **2023-2024 fiscal year**.

2. **Other Discussions**:
   - The committee briefly discussed **House Bill 36**, which allocates **$66 million** in highway funds for state aid, bridge repairs, and formula aid. The **Municipal Association** suggested language to allow towns to expend these funds without a town meeting, which the committee considered adopting.

### **Upcoming Work Sessions**
- The committee scheduled further discussions on **Senate Bill 401** (transportation funding and bridge maintenance) and other unresolved issues. The next work session was set for **Tuesday, April 26, 2022**.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of efficiently allocating funds while ensuring compliance with federal mandates, improving infrastructure, and enhancing public safety.
