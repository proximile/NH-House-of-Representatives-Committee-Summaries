**Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting Meeting (April 27, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting convened on April 27, 2022, to discuss **Senate Bill 200 (SB 200)**, which pertains to the redistricting of federal congressional districts. The meeting focused on several proposed amendments, with debates centering on fairness, competitiveness, population distribution, and historical context. Key points from the discussion include:

### **Overview of the Discussion**
1. **Focus on Redistricting Maps**: The committee reviewed the 2012 map and other maps considered over the past eight months. Members debated whether to make radical changes or minor adjustments to the districts, with some advocating for significant revisions to reflect current political and demographic realities.

2. **Competitiveness of Districts**: A major point of contention was the competitiveness of the proposed districts, particularly **Congressional District 2 (CD2)**. Some members argued that the current map lacks competitiveness, while others defended the proposed changes as fair and reflective of the state's political balance (60-40 over the past decade). Representative Barry, the sponsor of **Amendment 2022-1708h**, emphasized that the map gives Republicans a chance to compete in CD2 without guaranteeing a win, aligning with the governor's call for competitiveness.

3. **Population and Geographic Considerations**: The amendments aimed to address population deviations and avoid splitting cities or towns. Members discussed the challenges of creating coherent districts given New Hampshire's population distribution and geographic diversity. Representative Barry's amendment sought to keep economic communities together, use county lines, and minimize population deviation, particularly focusing on the I-93 economic corridor, the state's largest population center.

### **Key Amendments Debated**
1. **Amendment 2022-1708h**: This amendment, proposed by Representative Barry, aimed to create districts that reflect the state's electoral balance and promote competitiveness. It passed with an 8-7 vote, and SB 200 was subsequently passed with the amendment by the same margin. The bill will now proceed to the House floor for a vote before potentially being sent back to the Senate for further consideration.

2. **Amendment 1736**: Proposed by Representative Bergeron, this amendment sought to create competitive districts with minimal disruption by moving the town of Hampstead from Congressional District 1 to District 2, reducing the population deviation to just 51 people. Representative Barry opposed the amendment, arguing that it made the districts less competitive and did not align with the principle of least change. The amendment ultimately failed with a vote of 7 to 8.

3. **Amendment 1523**: A non-germane amendment to SB 200 was discussed, but no motion was made regarding it.

### **Historical Context and Principles**
Representative Barry criticized the current redistricting process for being based on a map from 1880, which was designed to suppress the Catholic vote. He argued that the state should not continue to make minor adjustments to an outdated map, given the significant population shifts since then. He emphasized the importance of creating districts that keep communities of interest together and meet legal and constitutional requirements.

### **Debate on Competitiveness and Incumbency**
There was significant debate over what constitutes a competitive district and the importance of keeping communities of interest together. Representative Barry challenged the committee to define competitiveness, arguing that his map met all legal requirements and provided a fresh approach to redistricting. Representative Bergeron questioned whether Barry's amendment favored certain candidates by moving several candidates from Congressional District 1 to District 2. Barry denied this, stating that he did not consider incumbents or candidates when drawing the map.

### **Next Steps**
The committee discussed the bill's future, including the possibility of a committee of conference if the Senate disagrees with the House's amendments. The governor has previously expressed concerns about the bill's competitiveness, adding another layer of complexity to the process.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the contentious and complex nature of redistricting, with debates over fairness, competitiveness, and geographic representation. The committee ultimately supported Representative Barry's amendment, moving SB 200 forward in the legislative process while underscoring the challenges of balancing legal requirements, historical context, and political considerations.
