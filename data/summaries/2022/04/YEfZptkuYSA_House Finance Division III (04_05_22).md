The New Hampshire House Finance Division III meeting on April 5, 2022, focused on discussing amendments to Senate Bill 422 (SB 422) to align it with House Bill 103 (HB 103). The primary goal was to make SB 422 identical to HB 103, with three key changes:

1. **Removable Prosthetic Coverage**: The word "removable" was added to specify coverage for prosthetic devices, agreed upon by the department and HB 103's sponsor.
2. **Cost Sharing Exclusion**: Diagnostic and preventive services were excluded from cost-sharing provisions, ensuring these services remain accessible without financial barriers.
3. **Risk Corridor Adjustment**: A $2.4 million adjustment was made to address a risk corridor related to inflated pharmacy costs reported by Centene, requiring repayment to the federal government.

Representative Shapiro explained that the cost-sharing exclusion for diagnostic and preventive care was based on research showing that 99% of commercial plans already exclude such cost-sharing, aiming to avoid barriers to essential care. Brooke Belanger from the Department of Health and Human Services clarified the risk corridor mechanism, which protects the state from overpayments to managed care organizations due to decreased utilization during COVID-19. The $2.4 million repayment to CMS was part of a broader settlement with Centene.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the extensive collaborative efforts and a commitment to continue moving forward with the legislation.
