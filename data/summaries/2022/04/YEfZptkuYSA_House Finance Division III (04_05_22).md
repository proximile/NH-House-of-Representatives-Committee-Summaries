The transcript captures a New Hampshire House Finance Division III meeting focused on discussing and amending **Senate Bill 422 (SB 422)**. The primary goal of the discussion was to align SB 422 with **House Bill 103 (HB 103)**, which is currently in the Senate. Key points of the meeting include:

1. **Amendment to SB 422**: Representative Ripple introduced an amendment to SB 422, which replaces the entire bill with HB 103, incorporating three specific changes:
   - Addition of the word "removable" in the context of prosthetic coverage.
   - Exclusion of cost-sharing for diagnostic and preventive services.
   - Reintroduction of a $2.4 million risk corridor calculation, originally removed from HB 103, to address a settlement with the federal government.

2. **Cost-Sharing Changes**: Representative Shapiro explained that the exclusion of cost-sharing for diagnostic and preventive care aligns with 99% of commercial dental plans, ensuring no financial barriers to essential care. This change was a compromise to maintain access while addressing concerns about utilization.

3. **Risk Corridor and Settlement**: Brooke Belanger from the Department of Health and Human Services clarified that the $2.4 million risk corridor was added to protect the state against inflated costs reported by Centene, a managed care organization. This amount is being returned to the federal government as part of a broader settlement agreement.

4. **Final Remarks**: Dr. Finney and other participants expressed gratitude for the collaborative efforts and years of work invested in the bill. The meeting concluded with the committee preparing to move forward with the amended bill.

Overall, the discussion centered on technical amendments to align SB 422 with HB 103, address cost-sharing concerns, and finalize financial settlements with the federal government.
