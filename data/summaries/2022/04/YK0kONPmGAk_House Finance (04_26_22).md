**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on April 26, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 26, 2022, to discuss several key economic development projects, funding initiatives, and legislative amendments. The meeting was divided into two primary segments: the Balsams Redevelopment Project and the review of various Senate bills and amendments. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **1. The Balsams Redevelopment Project**
The Balsams Redevelopment Project was a central focus of the meeting, with extensive discussions on its economic significance, funding, and legislative support.

- **Project Overview**: The initiative aims to revitalize the historic Balsams resort in the North Country, including its golf course and surrounding areas. The project is seen as a critical driver of economic growth for Colebrook, Dixville, and the broader region.
  
- **Funding and Costs**: The total project cost is estimated at over $200 million. Specifically, road improvements for Golf Links Road are now projected at $4.1 million, up from an initial estimate of $2.6 million. The state is being asked to fund these improvements to meet standards before transferring ownership to the developer, Leslie Otten.

- **Economic Impact**: Representatives and community leaders emphasized the project’s potential to create jobs, boost property tax revenue, and revitalize the struggling North Country economy. The resort has been closed for over a decade, and its reopening is viewed as a beacon of hope.

- **Road Ownership and Maintenance**: The state would upgrade Golf Links Road and then transfer ownership to the developer, who would maintain it as a private road. Concerns were raised about the road’s future if the developer were to go bankrupt, with assurances that ownership would remain with the Balsams.

- **Developer’s Financial Package**: Otten is collaborating with financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Provident Bank to finalize the project’s funding. Plans include a 400-room hotel, second homes, and other developments.

- **Legislative Process**: The discussion highlighted the need to align the project’s funding with the state’s 10-year highway improvement plan without disrupting other projects.

### **2. Key Senate Bills and Amendments**
The second segment of the meeting focused on several Senate bills and amendments, primarily related to funding and policy decisions.

- **Senate Bill 227**: This bill was amended to include corrections officers and passed with strong support (15 in favor, 3 opposed, 2 abstentions).

- **Senate Bill 371**: A $3 million appropriation to the Lead Paint Hazard Fund was approved to provide interest-free loans for lead paint remediation in rental units (19 in favor, 1 opposed).

- **Senate Bill 445**: This bill allocated $122.1 million from federal funds (American Rescue Plan Act) for a broadband matching grant program. The eligible grant was raised from 50% to 75% of total project costs. Despite debates over cost-effectiveness, the bill passed (19 in favor, 1 opposed).

- **Senate Bill 402**: This bill allowed communities to apply for state aid covering up to 50% of the non-federal share of FEMA-approved repairs. It passed with overwhelming support (19 in favor, 1 opposed).

- **Senate Bill 409**: Focused on disaster relief loans, this bill included amendments specifying eligibility, repayment terms, and hazard mitigation requirements. It passed unanimously (20 in favor).

- **Senate Bill 412**: This bill addressed a budgeting error that resulted in lower-than-intended reimbursement rates for nursing homes. A $5 million appropriation was proposed to ensure a 5% reimbursement rate increase, and the bill passed unanimously (20 in favor).

- **Senate Bill 422**: This bill, related to adult dental Medicaid benefits, was amended to align with a similar bill (HB 103) to ensure passage. The amendment passed (17 in favor, 2 opposed), and the bill itself passed (16 in favor, 3 opposed). A minority report was filed.

- **Non-Germane Amendment to Senate Bill 401**: This amendment proposed funding for the Dixville-Colebrook Road Project, which supports the Balsams Redevelopment. Contingencies were included to ensure the project only proceeds if financing for the resort is secured. There was discussion about the project’s exclusion from the state’s 10-year transportation plan and its potential economic impact.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the House’s commitment to economic development, particularly in the North Country, and its focus on addressing funding and policy challenges. The Balsams Redevelopment Project emerged as a top priority, with strong support for its potential to transform the region’s economy. Additionally, the House advanced several bills aimed at improving infrastructure, public health, and disaster relief, reflecting a broad legislative agenda to benefit the state and its residents.
