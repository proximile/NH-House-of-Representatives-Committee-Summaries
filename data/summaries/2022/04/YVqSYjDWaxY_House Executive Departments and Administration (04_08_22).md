### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Executive Departments and Administration Meeting (04/08/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on April 8, 2022, to discuss and deliberate on several key bills aimed at addressing systemic issues in the state’s retirement system, procurement policies, and administrative processes. The meeting featured detailed testimonies, amendments, and discussions on the following bills:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **SB 363: Retirement System Flexibility**
- **Purpose**: This bill allows certain Group 2 retirement system members (middle-tier employees hired before 2012) to purchase additional years of service to reduce their retirement eligibility period. It is designed to retain employees impacted by retirement system reforms enacted in 2012.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Employee Retention**: The bill is seen as a tool to retain employees, particularly in high-stress roles such as correctional officers and state troopers, who testified about the physical and mental challenges of their jobs.
  - **Cost and Fairness**: Employees bear 100% of the cost of purchasing service years, estimated at $40,000-$45,000 per year. While this ensures no financial burden on the state or local governments, concerns were raised about the affordability and fairness for employees nearing retirement.
  - **Support**: The New Hampshire Police Association and Troopers Association endorsed the bill, highlighting its potential to address retention issues in public safety roles. However, some questioned whether the high cost would deter employees from taking advantage of the option.

#### **SB 438: Buy American Bill**
- **Purpose**: This bill mandates that state and local procurement policies prioritize the use of American-made materials, particularly structural steel, in publicly funded construction projects.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Economic Impact**: Testimonies emphasized the economic multiplier effect, where spending $1 on domestic steel generates $1.50 in local economic activity, compared to no economic benefit from foreign steel.
  - **Support for Local Industries**: Representatives from New Hampshire-based steel fabrication companies highlighted the challenges of competing with foreign firms, which often benefit from government subsidies and favorable exchange rates.
  - **Case Examples**: Instances were cited where New Hampshire projects were awarded to foreign fabricators, resulting in lost opportunities for local businesses and workers.
  - **Environmental and Ethical Considerations**: Domestic steel was noted to be more environmentally friendly (96% recycled material) and adhere to higher safety standards.
  - **Amendments**: The bill includes specific definitions, metrics, and a waiver process to ensure compliance and feasibility.

#### **SB 443: Streamlining Building Code Amendments**
- **Purpose**: This bill aims to centralize and streamline the process of local amendments to building codes, ensuring they are accessible to contractors, architects, and other stakeholders.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Representatives and stakeholders supported the bill, citing its potential to reduce confusion and inconsistencies across towns and municipalities.
  - **Concerns**: Some raised concerns about the administrative burden on small towns, though it was clarified that only towns with building inspectors would be affected.
  - **Amendments**: Procedural steps were discussed, including ensuring amendments are reviewed by the Building Code Review Board before enforcement.

#### **SB 313: Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) Reforms**
- **Purpose**: This bill resolves conflicts between the OPLC and licensing boards regarding fee-setting authority and removes statutory fees for certain boards, granting the OPLC authority to set fees.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to eliminate a study committee (as a similar study is included in SB 330) and correct fee allocation issues for the Mechanical Licensing Board.
  - **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the removal of expertise requirements for board appointments and the OPLC’s role in rule adoption. Representatives emphasized the need for clarity and consultation with boards during rulemaking.
  - **Support**: The HVAC Association and OPLC expressed support for the bill, noting the need to correct language regarding fee deposits.
