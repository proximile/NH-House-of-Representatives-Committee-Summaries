### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting Meeting (04/14/22)

On April 14, 2022, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting convened to discuss and vote on proposed redistricting maps for the state’s Senate and Executive Council districts. The meeting was marked by intense debates over fairness, partisan bias, and the preservation of communities of interest, reflecting the contentious nature of the redistricting process. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

#### **Key Discussions and Testimonies**
1. **Senate Redistricting Plan (SB 240)**:
   - **Support and Criticism**: Some representatives supported SB 240, arguing that it met legal and constitutional requirements for population equality. However, critics raised significant concerns:
     - **Partisan Gerrymandering**: The maps were accused of favoring Republicans, creating a 16-8 veto-proof majority in the Senate even in a 50-50 vote split. Democratic-leaning districts were "packed," reducing their influence.
     - **Communities of Interest**: Critics argued that the maps split communities with shared interests, such as school districts and public health regions. For example, District 9 spans 70 miles from the Vermont border to Bedford, encompassing areas without common concerns.
     - **Rural and Minority Representation**: Smaller counties like Cheshire were divided into multiple districts, potentially disadvantaging rural and minority voters.

2. **Executive Council Redistricting Plan (SB 241)**:
   - **Criticism**: The proposed Executive Council maps were also criticized for partisan bias. District 2 was accused of "packing" Democratic-leaning towns, while other districts were heavily Republican, reducing competitiveness and voter influence.
   - **Population Adjustments**: Senator James Gray, who presented the maps, emphasized the need to balance population deviations due to demographic shifts, particularly population growth in southern and eastern New Hampshire and declines in the north.

3. **Public Testimony**:
   - **Opposition to Gerrymandering**: Members of the public, including Olivia Zink (Open Democracy Action), Linda Bundy, and others, testified against the proposed maps. They argued that the maps undermined election integrity, reduced competitiveness, and ignored communities of interest.
   - **Call for Fairness**: Testifiers urged the committee to adopt alternative maps, such as those from the Mapathon or minority proposals, which were praised for being more compact, competitive, and aligned with communities of interest.
   - **Voter Apathy**: Concerns were raised that gerrymandered districts lead to voter apathy, as voters in non-competitive districts feel their votes don’t matter. Safe districts also reduce accountability, as elected officials may focus only on their base.

4. **Committee Debates**:
   - **Senator Gray’s Defense**: Senator Gray defended the maps, stating that population equality was the primary legal requirement. He acknowledged challenges in maintaining communities of interest and admitted that incumbency protection was a consideration to avoid pitting sitting senators against each other.
   - **Questions from Representatives**: Committee members questioned the rationale behind certain district boundaries and the criteria used for redistricting. Concerns were raised about the sprawling nature of some districts and the potential lack of effective representation for rural areas.

#### **Votes and Outcomes**
1. **SB 240 (Senate Redistricting Plan)**:
   - Passed with a 7-8 vote, reported as "ought to pass." Critics argued the plan worsened gerrymandering compared to the 2011 maps.

2. **SB 241 (Executive Council Redistricting Plan)**:
   - A minority proposal to amend the plan was rejected (7-8), and the Senate’s version passed (8-7), reported as "ought to pass." Critics argued the plan favored Republicans and split high school districts and counties.

#### **Future Agenda**
The committee scheduled a meeting for the following Friday to consider congressional district maps using SB 200 as a vehicle.

#### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the tension between adhering to legal requirements for population equality and striving for fair, competitive, and community-focused redistricting. Key issues included:
- **Partisan Gerrymandering**: Accusations that the maps favored Republicans and undermined voter confidence.
- **Communities of Interest**: Concerns about splitting shared communities, particularly in rural areas.
- **Voter Representation**: Criticisms that the maps reduced competitiveness and led to voter apathy.
- **Legal vs. Fair Representation**: Debates over whether the maps met legal requirements while failing to ensure fair representation.

The committee faced significant pressure to balance these competing priorities, with public testimony and internal debates emphasizing the need for transparency, fairness, and accountability in the redistricting process.
