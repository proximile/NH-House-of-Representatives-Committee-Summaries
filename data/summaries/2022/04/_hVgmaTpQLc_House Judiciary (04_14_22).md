The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on April 14, 2022, to discuss and vote on a wide range of bills, addressing issues from charitable organizations and landlord-tenant disputes to remote meetings and privacy protections. The meeting was characterized by respectful and collaborative discussions, with members engaging in detailed debates and proposing amendments to address various concerns.

### **Key Bills and Outcomes**

#### **Charitable Organizations and Nonprofits**

After adopting **Amendment 1443-H** (20-1), which addressed concerns raised by stakeholders like the Attorney General's office and the Lottery Commission, the committee passed the bill as amended (11-10).
