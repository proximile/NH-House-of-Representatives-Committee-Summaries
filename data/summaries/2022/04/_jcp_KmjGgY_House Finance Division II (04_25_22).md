The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on April 25, 2022, addressed several critical education-related bills and amendments, focusing on special education, school funding, and accountability measures. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Special Education Transition and Extension of Services**
The meeting began with a focus on the challenges faced by students with disabilities transitioning from special education to adult services. Key points included:
- **Transition Challenges**: Students often face a lack of coordination between school districts and area agencies when they age out of special education at 21, leading to inadequate support and a "falling off the cliff" effect.
- **Proposed Amendment**: An amendment was discussed to extend eligibility for special education services to age 22, aligning with federal law (IDEA) and ensuring students can complete their school year even if they turn 22 during that year. This aims to provide smoother transitions and better prepare students for adult life.
- **Funding and Legal Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the financial impact on school districts, particularly if budgets were already finalized without accounting for this extension. There is also a risk of lawsuits if the state does not comply with federal law, as seen in cases like the Rhode Island *KL* decision.
- **Interagency Coordination**: Representatives emphasized the need for better coordination between school districts and area agencies to ensure continuity of services. Disability rights advocates stressed the importance of providing services beyond age 21, noting that most states already do so.

### **Senate Bill 420: Extraordinary Needs Grant**
The discussion then shifted to Senate Bill 420, which proposes an "Extraordinary Needs Grant" for school districts with low property valuations and high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Key points included:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to provide additional funding to economically disadvantaged districts to meet educational needs.
- **Amendments**: Technical and title amendments were proposed to align the bill’s language with fiscal data and remove a costly special education grant section.
- **Funding Source**: The grant would be funded through the Education Trust Fund, with an estimated cost of $14.7 million to $15 million.
- **Accountability Plan**: The House added a requirement for districts to complete an accountability plan detailing how funds will be used, raising concerns about administrative burdens and costs (up to $3.1 million collectively).
- **Distribution of Funds**: The grant targets districts with the greatest need, with some districts potentially receiving no funding if they are deemed to have sufficient resources.

### **Accountability Measures for School Funding**
The meeting also addressed accountability measures for school funding, particularly for districts receiving state aid. Key points included:
- **Accountability Requirements**: Representatives debated the level of detail required for districts to report on state fund usage, with some advocating for simpler measures like tracking student performance improvements.
- **Federal vs. State Accountability**: The overlap between state and federal accountability requirements (e.g., ESSA) was noted, with many districts already familiar with these processes through federal funding programs.
- **Funding Distribution**: Concerns were raised about the distribution of funds, with a small number of towns receiving the majority of the funding, potentially misaligning with the program’s intent.
- **Charter Schools and EFAs**: The funding is intended for district public schools, not charter schools or Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs), which are funded by state dollars.

### **Senate Bills 381 and 394: Special Education Advocacy and Services**
The meeting concluded with discussions on Senate Bills 381 and 394, related to special education advocacy and extending services. Key points included:
- **Senate Bill 381: Advocate for Special Education**: The bill proposed creating a new office for a special education advocate, but concerns were raised about the advocate’s lack of authority. The committee recommended an interim study, citing flaws in the policy.
- **Senate Bill 394: Extending Special Education Services**: This bill aimed to extend special education services to age 22, with an amendment proposing short-term funding using excess appropriations from the Department of Education’s budget. Concerns were raised about long-term funding, unfunded mandates, and potential issues with area agencies refusing to provide services.
- **Legal and Fiscal Concerns**: Attorney Jerry Zelin argued that the Rhode Island court case does not necessarily apply to New Hampshire and raised constitutional concerns about unfunded mandates. The fiscal impact statements were criticized for potentially underestimating costs.

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**
- The committee voted to **interim study** Senate Bill 381, delaying further action.
- For Senate Bill 394, the amendment was discussed, but no final decision was made during this session.
- The committee planned to revisit Senate Bill 420 and other bills in upcoming sessions, including those related to law enforcement training, special education, and transportation funding.
