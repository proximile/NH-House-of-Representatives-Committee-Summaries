The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee meeting on April 11, 2022, focused on several bills and discussions related to search and rescue operations, bear damage compensation, and other wildlife-related issues. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Search and Rescue and EMS Licensing**: The committee discussed a bill that would allow search and rescue volunteers to provide basic first aid, such as splinting, without needing to be licensed EMS providers. This change would streamline rescue operations in remote areas, where volunteers often arrive before EMS. The bill was supported as it would improve efficiency and safety in rescue missions.

2. **Senate Bill 260**: The committee voted 15-0 to recommend the bill for passage. The bill aimed to clarify and support search and rescue operations, ensuring volunteers could assist without legal conflicts.

3. **House Bill 1091 (Search Warrants)**: The bill addressed the authority of Fish and Game officers to conduct searches based on reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause. The committee decided **not to recommend** the bill for future legislation, citing concerns about potential overreach and the lack of clear evidence of problems with the current system. Colonel Jordan, the Fish and Game enforcement officer, expressed willingness to work on improving the language of the existing statute.

4. **House Bill 1201 (Bear Damage Compensation)**: This bill dealt with compensation for property damage caused by bears. Recent changes required property owners to implement mitigation strategies to receive compensation for repeat incidents. The committee voted 16-0 **not to recommend** the bill for future legislation, as the new rules were still being implemented, and there was insufficient data to justify further changes.

5. **Other Updates**:
   - The committee discussed the hike safe card, ammunition regulations, and tree stand removal requirements.
   - A Fish and Game Commission meeting was announced for May 10th in Seabrook, inviting public participation.
   - The chair thanked the committee for their work throughout the year.

Overall, the meeting focused on refining legislation to improve search and rescue operations, wildlife management, and property damage compensation, while emphasizing the need for careful consideration and data-driven decisions.
