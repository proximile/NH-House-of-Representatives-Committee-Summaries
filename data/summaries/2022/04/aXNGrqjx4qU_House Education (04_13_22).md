**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (04/13/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on April 13, 2022, to discuss and vote on several key education-related bills and amendments. The meeting focused on addressing critical issues in special education, school funding, property taxes, and advocacy for families of children with disabilities. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and actions taken during the session:

---

### **1. Special Education Eligibility and Funding**
The committee extensively debated **Senate Bill 394**, which addresses the eligibility age for special education services in New Hampshire. Key points included:
- **Amendment Proposals**: 
  - **Representative Cordelli** proposed aligning the bill with federal law, defining a "child with a disability" as individuals aged 3 to 21, inclusive. This amendment aimed to avoid litigation risks following court decisions in Rhode Island and Connecticut.
  - **Representative Mullen** proposed establishing a **Special Education Eligibility Commission** to study the implications of extending services to students up to age 21, including fiscal impacts, Medicaid eligibility, and coordination with state agencies.
- **Legal and Compliance Concerns**: Members discussed the **Rhode Island court decision** (2018), which mandated special education services through the school year in which a student turns 21. New Hampshire risks lawsuits if it does not comply with this federal interpretation.
- **Fiscal and Operational Implications**: Concerns were raised about the costs to local school districts, state adequacy grants, and Medicaid. Representatives also debated potential inequities, such as non-special education students aged 21 not receiving the same services as their peers with disabilities.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to vote on the Cordelli amendment and further discuss the Mullen amendment, with the bill likely proceeding to the finance committee.

### **2. Education Funding and the Extraordinary Need Grant**
The committee deliberated on **Senate Bill 420**, which establishes an **Extraordinary Need Grant** for schools in districts with high poverty levels and low property valuations. Key discussions included:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to provide additional funding to poor school districts to improve student outcomes, addressing resource disparities between wealthy and poor districts.
- **Accountability Measures**: Amendments introduced accountability requirements for how grant funds are used. Some representatives argued that these measures were necessary to ensure effective use of funds, while others felt they were **insulting** to poor districts already doing their best.
- **Fairness and Equity**: Concerns were raised about applying accountability measures only to poor districts, while wealthier districts receiving similar grants were not subject to the same scrutiny.
- **Impact of Funding**: Representatives debated whether additional funding would meaningfully improve student outcomes, with some emphasizing the role of resource disparities in educational achievement.
- **Teacher Turnover**: The discussion highlighted challenges like teacher turnover in poor districts, where educators often leave for higher-paying jobs in wealthier districts.
- **Roll Call Vote**: The committee passed **Amendment 1381**, which added accountability measures to the bill, with **19 votes in favor** and **0 against**.

### **3. Property Taxes and Education Funding Inequities**
The meeting addressed broader issues of education funding and property taxes, focusing on the regressive nature of property taxes and their impact on school funding. Key points included:
- **Property Tax Concerns**: Representatives discussed how rising property values do not reflect residents' ability to pay, leading to disparities in education funding between towns like Hudson and Berlin.
- **State Responsibility**: The state’s constitutional obligation to ensure all students have access to an adequate education was emphasized, with proposals for additional state support to underfunded districts.
- **Amendments and Bills**: 
  - **Amendment 1478**, which aimed to adjust funding formulas, failed with a vote of 10 to 9.
  - **Senate Bill 420** passed with amendments, focusing on equitable education funding.
  - **House Bills 236 and 352** addressed teacher loan forgiveness and FERPA modifications, respectively, with discussions highlighting inequities in loan forgiveness for middle school teachers compared to high school teachers.
- **Future Meetings**: The committee planned to address remaining bills, including those related to cooperative school boards and student loan forgiveness.

### **4. Special Education Funding Amendments**
The committee discussed amendments to **Senate Bill 420** focused on special education funding:
- **Amendment 1384**: Proposed by Representative Ladd, this amendment adjusted special education funding by breaking it into two categories, allocating different amounts per student based on IEP areas. It passed unanimously (19-0).
- **Amendment 1477**: Proposed by Representative Luno, this amendment aimed to double the **extraordinary needs grant** for the neediest districts but failed to pass (10-9).
- **Amendment 1478**: Proposed by Representative Luno, this amendment sought to replace the **extraordinary needs grant** with a **fiscal capacity disparity grant**, but it was not voted on during the session.
- **Key Themes**: Discussions emphasized the need for targeted aid to low-income districts, increased funding for special education, and the potential for property tax relief through state education funding.

### **5. Office of the Advocate for Special Education**
The committee debated **Senate Bill 381**, which proposes the establishment of an **Office of the Advocate for Special Education**. Key points included:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to create an independent office to support families navigating the special education system, addressing issues like lack of transparency and inadequate support.
- **Arguments in Favor**: Proponents, including **Representative Cordelli**, highlighted the high number of complaints to the DOE and the need for systemic oversight and advocacy.
- **Concerns and Opposition**: Critics questioned the necessity of a new office, suggesting the existing **Office of the Child Advocate** could handle special education advocacy more efficiently. Concerns were also raised about the lack of enforcement authority and the potential for added bureaucracy.
- **Voting and Reconsideration**: The initial vote failed **9-10**, but a motion for reconsideration passed **10-9**, bringing the bill back for further discussion. The bill was ultimately moved forward, though debate highlighted ongoing divisions about its efficacy and the need for better school funding.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
1. **Special Education**: Tensions between addressing immediate legal risks (e.g., compliance with federal law) and conducting comprehensive studies of broader implications.
2. **Education Funding**: Efforts to address funding inequities between wealthy and poor districts, with debates over accountability, fiscal impact, and the role of property taxes.
3. **Advocacy and Support**: The need for better support for families of children with disabilities, with mixed opinions on whether a new office or existing resources would be more effective.
4. **Fiscal Constraints**: Balancing the need for increased funding with the state’s limited financial resources, particularly in areas like special education and low-income districts.

Overall, the meeting reflected a commitment to addressing critical issues in education while navigating complex legal, financial, and systemic challenges.
