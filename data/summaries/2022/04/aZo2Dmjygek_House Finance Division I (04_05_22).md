The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on April 5, 2022, focused on two key bills: **Senate Bill 227** and **Senate Bill 371**.  

1. **Senate Bill 227**:  
   - The bill addresses suicide among first responders and corrections personnel, classifying suicide as a work-related cause of death for these groups.  
   - The committee discussed amendments to clarify the inclusion of probation, parole, and corrections line personnel, as well as volunteer EMTs and firefighters.  
   - There was debate over the language of the bill, particularly whether "death by suicide shall be considered a work-related cause of death" creates a presumption or requires investigation. Representatives agreed the bill mandates recognition of suicide as work-related but still requires an investigative process.  
   - An amendment was proposed and unanimously approved to align the bill with previous House legislation (House Bill 1319) and include corrections personnel in the definition of police officers.  
   - The bill, as amended, passed unanimously.

2. **Senate Bill 371**:  
   - This bill relates to funding for lead paint remediation in housing units.  
   - Testimony highlighted the ongoing need for funding to address lead paint in pre-1978 housing, with estimates suggesting thousands of units still require remediation.  
   - The bill was seen as consistent with a 2019 compromise that increased lead testing requirements in exchange for funding assistance for property owners.  
   - The committee unanimously approved the bill.

The meeting concluded with no immediate plans for further sessions, pending additional bills to review.
