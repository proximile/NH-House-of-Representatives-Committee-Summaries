The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on April 5, 2022, focused on discussing a bill related to exceptional disaster relief loans for municipalities affected by natural disasters, particularly flooding. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Loan Repayment Requirements**: The bill mandates that municipalities must repay the full amount of any disaster relief loan received from the state, with no forgiveness mechanism. This ensures the program remains a "net-zero" for the state, as the funds are expected to be fully reimbursed, primarily through FEMA assistance.

2. **FEMA Reimbursement**: The loans are intended to provide immediate funding to towns for disaster recovery, with the expectation that FEMA will reimburse the costs. However, there is a lengthy timeline (up to a year) for FEMA to determine reimbursement amounts, which raises concerns about the speed of the process.

3. **Mitigation Funds**: Representatives emphasized the importance of municipalities applying for FEMA mitigation funds to prevent future disasters. Suggestions were made to include language in the bill requiring towns to seek mitigation funds as part of the loan approval process.

4. **State Aid Programs**: Existing state programs, such as the State Aid Bridge Program and highway block grants, were discussed as additional resources for municipalities. However, these programs often have long waiting periods and matching requirements that small towns struggle to meet.

5. **Timeliness of Assistance**: Concerns were raised about the two-week window for the Governor and Council to approve disaster relief loans. While some representatives felt this was manageable, others questioned whether it was fast enough to address urgent needs.

6. **Amendments and Clarifications**: The committee considered potential amendments to clarify terms like "anticipated assistance" and ensure the bill aligns with FEMA requirements. The consensus was to leave the repayment requirement intact to avoid jeopardizing FEMA reimbursements.

7. **Related Legislation**: The discussion also touched on Senate Bill 402, which proposes the state share 12.5% of the FEMA match with municipalities. This bill was seen as interconnected but would require further review.

The committee agreed to reconvene on April 13 to finalize amendments and address outstanding questions before the billâ€™s deadline on April 28.
