The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on April 5, 2022, focuses on discussions surrounding disaster relief loans for municipalities, particularly in the context of FEMA reimbursements. Key points include:

1. **Loan Repayment**: The committee clarified that the disaster relief loan program is designed as a zero-sum game, meaning municipalities must repay the full amount borrowed without forgiveness or interest. This ensures the state does not incur a loss.

2. **FEMA Reimbursement**: The loans are intended to provide immediate funding to towns for disaster recovery, with the expectation that FEMA will reimburse the costs. However, there were concerns about delays in FEMA’s reimbursement process and potential disputes over repayment amounts.

3. **Mitigation Funds**: Representatives emphasized the importance of applying for FEMA mitigation funds to prevent future disasters, suggesting that municipalities should be required to seek such funds to remain eligible for state loans.

4. **Governor and Council Authority**: The bill excludes the fiscal committee from the approval process, leaving it to the Governor and Council to expedite loan disbursement. This raised questions about oversight and the potential for flexibility in repayment terms.

5. **Small Town Challenges**: Representatives highlighted the financial struggles of small towns, particularly in funding bridge and road repairs, and discussed existing state aid programs like the 80-20 matching State Aid Bridge Program.

6. **Related Legislation**: The committee briefly discussed Senate Bill 402, which proposes a 50-50 cost-sharing model for FEMA’s 25% match requirement, and considered whether to address both bills as a package.

7. **Timeline and Process**: Concerns were raised about the timeline for loan approval and FEMA reimbursement, with some questioning whether the two-week window for Governor and Council action is sufficient.

Overall, the meeting focused on ensuring the disaster relief loan program is efficient and fair while addressing the financial challenges faced by municipalities in disaster recovery. The committee planned to reconvene to finalize amendments and address outstanding questions.
