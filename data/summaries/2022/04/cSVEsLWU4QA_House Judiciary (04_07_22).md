**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting (April 7, 2022)**

### **Senate Bill 375 (Charity Protection Act)**  
**Purpose**: SB 375 aims to prevent overregulation of charitable organizations in New Hampshire by prohibiting state agencies from imposing additional filing or reporting requirements without legislative approval.  
**Sponsor**: Senator William Gannon introduced the bill, emphasizing its goal of reducing administrative burdens on charities and ensuring resources are directed toward helping those in need.  
**Support**: Senator Jay Kahn supported the bill, particularly an amendment to raise the financial audit threshold for nonprofits from $1 million to $2 million in annual revenue.  
**Concerns**: Some committee members questioned the necessity of the bill, as there is no current evidence of regulatory overreach in New Hampshire.  
**Opposition**: The Business and Industry Association (BIA) opposed the bill, arguing it unfairly restricts one party’s access to the courts.  
**Outcome**: The committee called for further discussion and recessed to continue deliberations.

### **Senate Bill 296 (Complaint Procedures in Human Rights Cases)**  
**Purpose**: SB 296 seeks to amend RSA 354-A to allow only the complainant (not the respondent) to remove a discrimination case from the Human Rights Commission to court after a finding of probable cause.  
**Sponsor**: Senator Harold French framed the bill as a fairness measure to protect employees from being forced into court by employers.  
**Testimony**: The Human Rights Commission’s Executive Director, Ani Malik, testified but did not take a position on the bill, stating the Commission would follow whatever law is enacted.  
**Opposition**: The BIA opposed the bill, arguing it unfairly limits one party’s access to the courts and raises constitutional concerns, including the right to a jury trial.  
**Discussion**: Committee members sought clarification on the current process and the potential impact of the bill on case adjudication. The NHCHR faces significant delays in resolving cases, often taking three to five years due to limited staffing and resources. Proponents argued the bill would protect complainants, especially self-represented individuals, from the financial and procedural challenges of court. Opponents, including attorneys representing employers, countered that removing the respondent's right to transfer the case to court could lead to further delays and imbalances in the process.  
**Outcome**: The committee continued discussions, with suggestions to improve the system through increased resources and streamlined processes.

### **Senate Bill 302 (Personal Privacy Protection Act)**  
**Purpose**: SB 302 seeks to protect the privacy of donors to 501(c)(3) organizations by keeping their names private, inspired by Supreme Court decisions like *AFP v. Bonta*.  
**Sponsor**: Senator Regina Birdsall introduced the bill, emphasizing its bipartisan support and alignment with Supreme Court rulings protecting donor privacy.  
**Support**: Proponents, including the ACLU, Americans for Prosperity, and the Philanthropy Roundtable, argued the bill protects donors from retaliation, harassment, and unwanted solicitations, fostering charitable giving and upholding First Amendment rights.  
**Opposition**: Critics, including the Attorney General's Office, Open Democracy Action, and the New Hampshire Center for Nonprofits, argued the bill reduces transparency in charitable governance, hinders oversight, and could enable fraud or misuse of funds. Concerns were also raised about its impact on state oversight of 501(c)(3) organizations administering state programs, such as the New Hampshire Educational Freedom Account program.  
**Technical Concerns**: Representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services and the New Hampshire Lottery Commission highlighted potential conflicts with federal requirements and existing statutes governing charitable gaming.  
**Debate**: Legislators discussed balancing donor privacy with the need for transparency in political and charitable activities. Questions were raised about the bill's impact on campaign finance, lobbying disclosures, and municipal elections.  
**Outcome**: The committee considered potential amendments to address technical issues and exemptions, particularly for charitable gaming and federal compliance, and planned to reconvene for further discussion.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
The meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between regulatory oversight, fairness in legal processes, and the protection of individual rights. Key themes included:  
- **Charity Regulation**: SB 375 aimed to reduce administrative burdens on charities, but concerns were raised about its necessity and potential unintended consequences.  
- **Human Rights Procedures**: SB 296 sought to protect complainants in discrimination cases, but opponents argued it could create imbalances and delays.  
- **Donor Privacy**: SB 302 aimed to protect donor privacy and First Amendment rights, but critics warned it could reduce transparency and hinder oversight of charitable organizations.  

The committee recessed with plans to continue deliberations on all three bills, emphasizing the need for balanced solutions that address stakeholder concerns while upholding fairness, efficiency, and transparency.
