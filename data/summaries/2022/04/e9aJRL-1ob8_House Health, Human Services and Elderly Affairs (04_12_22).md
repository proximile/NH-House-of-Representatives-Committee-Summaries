The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 12, 2022, convened the Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee to discuss a wide array of legislative bills and amendments. The session addressed critical issues ranging from healthcare worker safety, maternal and child health, behavioral health services, and public health programs to regulatory adjustments in childcare, acupuncture, and elder care. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Workplace Violence in Healthcare Settings (SB 459)**
- **Purpose**: Senate Bill 459 aims to address the rising incidents of workplace violence in healthcare settings by establishing a **New Hampshire Health Care Workplace Safety Commission**, mandating data collection on violent incidents, and clarifying laws around warrantless arrests in healthcare facilities.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - **Data Collection**: Requires hospitals and urgent care centers to implement workplace violence prevention programs and report incidents annually.
  - **Commission Creation**: Modeled after the Healthcare Quality and Safety Commission, it will analyze trends and recommend solutions.
  - **Warrantless Arrests**: Allows police to make warrantless arrests for assaults on healthcare workers if further violence is imminent, even if the assault has already occurred.
- **Support and Opposition**: The bill received strong support from healthcare associations like the **New Hampshire Hospital Association** and **New Hampshire Nurses Association**, citing the increased violence during the pandemic. However, some representatives, including **Dan McGuire** and **Jess Edwards**, raised concerns about over-criminalization, particularly for non-physical incidents like verbal aggression.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed (12-9) after extensive debate, with amendments to address concerns about mental health considerations and the practicality of warrantless arrests.

### **Behavioral Health and Child Welfare (SB 416)**
- **Purpose**: Senate Bill 416 focuses on improving behavioral health outcomes for children in out-of-home placements by requiring evidence-based functional behavioral assessments and intervention plans.
- **Key Points**:
  - Aims to reduce costly institutional placements by ensuring appropriate care and keeping children connected to their families and communities.
  - Concerns were raised about the availability of qualified professionals and challenges in emergency situations.
  - Amendments were proposed to clarify assessment qualifications and delay the effective date to 2024 for workforce development.
- **Outcome**: The bill moved forward with amendments, reflecting a collaborative effort among stakeholders, including the **Office of the Child Advocate** and the **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**.

### **Maternal Health and Postpartum Care (SB 407)**
- **Purpose**: Senate Bill 407, the **Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act of 2022**, seeks to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months for new mothers.
- **Key Arguments in Favor**:
  - Addresses rising maternal mortality rates and postpartum health issues like depression, heart failure, and infections.
  - Leverages federal matching funds under the **American Rescue Plan**, minimizing state costs.
  - Framed as a **pro-life measure** by supporters, including the Catholic Church, to protect both mothers and babies.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives expressed concerns about long-term funding if federal support sunsets and the need for broader healthcare reforms.
- **Outcome**: The committee moved forward with a recommendation to pass the bill, acknowledging its potential to significantly improve maternal and child health outcomes.

### **Public Health Programs (SB 403, SB 430, SB 423)**
- **SB 403 (WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program)**: The bill aimed to reestablish the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program, providing $30 vouchers for fresh produce. Concerns about feasibility and inflationary impacts led to a motion to recommend it as **"Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL)**.
- **SB 430 (Health and Human Services Omnibus Bill)**: This comprehensive bill addressed multiple areas, including Medicaid reimbursement for birthing centers, opioid treatment programs, and developmental services for young adults. Amendments were debated to refine the bill, with a final vote of 19-1 to pass it with amendments.
- **SB 423 (Closed-Loop Referral System)**: The bill aimed to replace the fax-based referral system with a secure, digital system, emphasizing privacy protections and individual consent. It passed unanimously (21-0) in the executive session.

### **Childhood Adverse Experiences (SB 444)**
- **Purpose**: Senate Bill 444 expands New Hampshire’s system of care for children aged 0-5 to address adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and prevent long-term negative impacts.
- **Key Components**:
  - Workforce expansion and pilot programs for early intervention.
  - Evidence-based interventions and support for family resource centers.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed (15-6) with strong support for its focus on early intervention and prevention.

### **Regulatory Adjustments and Other Bills**
- **Auricular Therapy (SB 290)**: The bill sought to deregulate auricular therapy, allowing non-acupuncturists to perform it with minimal training. The debate centered on balancing access with safety concerns. An amendment passed (13-8), but concerns about the bill’s language and potential risks remained unresolved.
- **Guardianship and Parental Rights**: Discussions included granting DHHS guardianship of children following the surrender of parental rights, with amendments proposed to ensure transparency and accountability.
- **Therapeutic Cannabis Program**: Proposals aimed to reduce administrative burdens, including removing criminal background checks for caregivers and allowing conditional employment for alternative treatment center agents.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Healthcare Worker Safety**: SB 459 addressed the urgent need to protect healthcare workers from violence, though concerns about over-criminalization and mental health considerations were raised.
- **Maternal and Child Health**: SB 407 and SB 416 highlighted the importance of extending postpartum care and improving behavioral health services for children, with both bills moving forward with amendments.
- **Public Health Programs**: SB 403, SB 430, and SB 423 focused on improving access to nutritious food, streamlining health and human services, and enhancing referral systems, with mixed outcomes.
- **Regulatory Adjustments**: Bills like SB 290 and proposals related to the therapeutic cannabis program aimed to reduce barriers and expand access, though debates on safety and oversight persisted.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of healthcare legislation, the importance of balancing access with safety, and the need for collaborative efforts to address the diverse needs of New Hampshire’s population.
