Advocates highlighted its public health and economic benefits, including reducing emergency room costs and improving access to care.
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Discussions centered on co-pays for dental services, with concerns about patient no-shows and their impact on small dental practices.

- **Sponsor**: Senator Regina Birdsall, who chairs the Commission on PTSD in First Responders.
- **Support**: Testimony from Chief David Goldstein (Franklin Police) and Justin Breton (Manchester Police) highlighted the high suicide rates among first responders, with a 1:4.5 ratio of line-of-duty deaths to suicides in law enforcement.
- **Concerns**:
  - Questions arose about whether volunteers (e.g., EMTs and firefighters) would be covered and how work-related suicides would be determined.
  - Senator Birdsall clarified that investigations would determine eligibility.
- **Fiscal Impact**: Minimal, as the hope is that no suicides occur, but the bill is seen as a necessary step to support survivors.

### **3. Disaster Relief and Recovery**

#### **Senate Bill 409 (SB 409): Disaster Relief Loans for Communities**
- **Purpose**: Provides non-interest-bearing loans to small communities recovering from natural disasters, such as the 2021 storms in Cheshire and Sullivan Counties.
- **Sponsor**: Senator Suzanne Prentice.
- **Support**: The bill aims to help communities like Acworth, which faced $1 million in damages, by providing immediate funds while waiting for FEMA reimbursement.
- **Concerns**:
  - Questions were raised about the feasibility of grants instead of loans and the process for negotiating repayment terms if FEMA reimbursements fall short.
  - Senator Prentice emphasized the bill’s importance for small towns with limited budgets.
- **Collaboration**: Discussions explored combining SB 409 with **HB 1665**, which establishes a municipal road and bridge disaster relief fund.
- **Outcome**: The bill received strong support, with a focus on ensuring equitable access to resources for small municipalities.

#### **Disaster Relief and FEMA Assistance**
- **Challenges**: Small towns face difficulties accessing timely financial assistance for disaster recovery, particularly when FEMA reimbursements are delayed.
- **State Role**: The state’s role in providing interim loans to municipalities was debated, with emphasis on aligning loans with FEMA eligibility to avoid duplication of benefits.
- **Department of Safety and Homeland Security**: Explained the FEMA process, including damage assessments, timelines for reimbursement, and the distinction between emergency repairs and long-term mitigation.

### **4. Lead Paint Hazard Remediation**

#### **Senate Bill 371 (SB 371): Lead Paint Hazard Remediation Fund**
- **Purpose**: Seeks a $3 million appropriation to replenish the Lead Paint Hazard Remediation Fund, managed by the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority.
- **Details**:
  - The fund provides zero-interest loans to property owners to remediate lead paint hazards, particularly in older housing stock, to protect children from lead poisoning.
  - Since its creation in 2019, the fund has rehabilitated over 300 housing units but is nearly depleted despite ongoing need.
  - Loans are repaid when properties are sold, but repayment is slow due to the nature of rental properties.
- **Preferred Method**: Encapsulation (covering lead paint with durable materials) is the more cost-effective method compared to complete removal.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about loan terms, eligibility criteria, and the potential for federal funding to supplement state efforts.
