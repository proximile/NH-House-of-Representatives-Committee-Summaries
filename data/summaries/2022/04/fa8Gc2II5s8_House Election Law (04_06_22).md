**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee Meeting (April 6, 2022)**

On April 6, 2022, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Election Law Committee convened to discuss several bills related to election processes, voter accessibility, and election integrity. The meeting covered a range of topics, from absentee ballot processing to primary election scheduling, with input from legislators, the Secretary of State’s office, and other stakeholders. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed:

---

### **Absentee Ballot Processing**
1. **Pre-processing of Absentee Ballots**  
   The committee discussed the pre-processing of absentee ballots, which allows local clerks to open outer envelopes ahead of time. Concerns were raised about the potential loss of separate affidavits, emphasizing the need for clarity in the law to ensure these affidavits remain attached to the ballots.

2. **SB 365: Absentee Ballot Outer Envelopes**  
   This bill, introduced by Senator Gray, eliminates the requirement for an outer envelope for absentee ballots returned in person, streamlining the process for voters. However, the Disability Rights Center raised concerns about potential risks for voters with disabilities, particularly those using the accessible absentee voting program. They proposed an amendment to ensure affidavits for these voters are securely attached to their ballots.

3. **Bill 427: Absentee Voter Registration**  
   This bipartisan bill modifies the absentee voter registration process and expands the language for absentee voting to include physical disability, illness, or other medical conditions. The Secretary of State’s office suggested further defining "physical disability" to ensure clarity. The bill had previously passed the Senate unanimously.

### **Election Integrity and Audits**
1. **Bill 366: Ballot Audits**  
   This bill requires the Secretary of State to conduct an audit of ballots cast in the 2022 state primary and general elections using a random selection of AccuVote machines. The purpose is to test the accuracy of the machines rather than the election results. The bill was recommended by a study committee.

2. **SB 242: Disqualification of Election Officials**  
   Introduced by Senator Gray, this bill aligns language in statutes regarding who can serve as election officials, addressing discrepancies between two statutes (658:24 and 659:58). Questions from representatives focused on absentee ballot processing and the role of moderators in handling ballots when their names appear on them.

---

### **Primary Election Scheduling**
1. **SB 328: Date of the State Primary Election**  
   This bill proposes moving the state primary election from September to the second week of August to give candidates more time to campaign for the general election. While Grant Bossie (representing Senator Gray) highlighted the Senate’s preference for an August primary, concerns were raised about voter turnout during summer months, recruitment of election workers, and the impact on local election officials. The Secretary of State’s office also expressed reservations about potential lower voter turnout in August.

### **Election Technology and Accessibility**
1. **SB 364: Use of Electronic Poll Books**  
   This bill adjusts the time lag for updating electronic poll books from 10 to 30 minutes, providing more flexibility for poll workers. Testimony from Patricia Lovejoy (Deputy Secretary of State) and others emphasized the benefits of electronic poll books, including faster processing and increased adoption by municipalities.

### **Penalties for Election-Related Offenses**
1. **Bill 405: Vandalism of Political Signs**  
   This bill increases penalties for vandalism of political signs, treating it as an infringement on First Amendment rights. Developed with input from the Attorney General’s office, the bill raised concerns about the subjective nature of terms like "intimidation" and "discouragement" and the severity of penalties for such offenses.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to hold public hearings on the remaining bills and scheduled an executive session for the following week to act on all bills, with a focus on Bills 242, 328, 364, and 405. Throughout the meeting, representatives and stakeholders emphasized the importance of addressing practical implications, including voter accessibility, election worker recruitment, and the potential unintended consequences of proposed changes.

**Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance election integrity, voter accessibility, and operational efficiency. Discussions underscored the need for clear definitions, consistent language in statutes, and careful consideration of the impact of proposed changes on voters and election officials. The committee’s work will continue through public hearings and executive sessions to finalize recommendations on the discussed bills.
