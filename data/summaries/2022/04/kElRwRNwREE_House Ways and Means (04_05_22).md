### Comprehensive Summary of NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (04/05/22)

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on April 5, 2022, to discuss several key bills, focusing on tax policy, business regulations, and charitable gaming. The meeting highlighted complex fiscal, policy, and procedural considerations, with debates centered on fairness, competitiveness, and revenue impacts.

#### **1. Senate Bill 435: Net Operating Losses (NOLs) and Tax Code Alignment**
The committee extensively discussed **Senate Bill 435**, which addresses the treatment of **net operating losses (NOLs)** in New Hampshire’s tax code. Key points included:

- **Double Apportionment Issue**: New Hampshire is the only state that requires multi-state companies to apportion their NOLs twice, rendering them nearly worthless. The bill seeks to eliminate this practice, aligning the state with others and improving fairness for businesses.
- **Federal Conformity**: The bill proposes updating New Hampshire’s tax code to conform with the **2018 federal tax code**, particularly the **80% limitation** on NOL deductions. Currently, the state references the 1996 federal code, creating inconsistencies.
- **Fiscal Impact**: Removing double apportionment would result in a **revenue loss**, though adopting the 2018 federal standard would mitigate some losses. The bill also addresses the **10-year carry-forward limitation** and **$10 million cap** on NOLs, which could further impact state revenues.
- **Testimony and Concerns**: Representatives from **NextEra Energy** and the **Business and Industry Association (BIA)** testified that the current system disadvantages multi-state businesses. However, concerns were raised about the 80% cap potentially harming small businesses recovering from losses, such as those affected by the pandemic.
- **Broader Policy Questions**: Legislators debated whether New Hampshire should fully conform to federal tax changes or maintain selective decoupling, emphasizing the need to balance fairness, competitiveness, and fiscal responsibility.

#### **2. Senate Bill 343: Room Occupancy Tax Revenue Distribution**
The committee also discussed **Senate Bill 343**, which proposes establishing a committee to study the distribution of **room occupancy tax revenue** to municipalities. Key highlights included:

- **Purpose**: The study aims to address disparities in revenue distribution, particularly for small towns with high tourism but small populations (e.g., Gorham), which often bear infrastructure costs without receiving adequate revenue.
- **Concerns**: Some questioned the need for a study, as similar issues have been discussed in the past, while others argued it was necessary to ensure fair revenue allocation.
- **Technical Details**: The **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA)** explained that the current system does not track revenue by location, but the RIM system could be modified to do so with legislative changes.

#### **3. Senate Bill 318: Local Authority and Zoning**
The committee briefly touched on **Senate Bill 318**, which examines the legislature’s authority over local municipalities’ zoning and planning powers. Key points included:

- **State Authority**: New Hampshire is not a home rule state, meaning municipalities only have powers granted by the legislature, which could theoretically revoke or modify those powers.
- **Implications**: The discussion highlighted ongoing debates about the balance of state and local authority, particularly in areas like zoning and planning.

#### **4. Charitable Gaming: Senate Bills 316 and 318**
The committee also addressed two bills related to **charitable gaming**:

- **Senate Bill 316**:
  - **Lucky 7 Ticket Changes**: Eliminates the requirement for prizes over $1,200 to be paid by check, replacing it with a W2G form for tax documentation. This change aims to address logistical issues and streamline operations.
  - **Charity Gaming Facilities**: Allows licensed facilities to sell Lucky 7 tickets without operating a bingo game, reducing unnecessary burdens and increasing revenue for charities.
  - **Support**: The **New Hampshire Charity Gaming Operators Association** testified in favor of the bill, emphasizing its potential to boost charitable revenue and modernize regulations.

- **Senate Bill 318**:
  - **Extended Gaming Hours**: Proposes extending hours for games of chance from 11 a.m.–1 a.m. to 8 a.m.–4 a.m. to accommodate different schedules and enhance competitiveness with neighboring states.
  - **Support**: Advocates argued that extended hours would increase participation and revenue, particularly in tourist-heavy areas.
  - **Concerns**: Committee members raised issues about potential increases in drunk driving and local impacts, though it was noted that municipalities could set stricter hours through local ordinances.

#### **Key Themes Across All Discussions**
1. **Fairness and Competitiveness**: Many bills aimed to make New Hampshire’s tax and regulatory systems fairer and more competitive with neighboring states, particularly for businesses and tourism-related industries.
2. **Revenue Impacts**: Fiscal considerations were central to discussions, with legislators weighing the potential revenue losses or gains from proposed changes.
3. **Local vs. State Authority**: Debates highlighted the tension between state control and local autonomy, particularly in areas like zoning and gaming regulations.
4. **Streamlining Processes**: Several bills focused on reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens, such as the double apportionment of NOLs or the requirement for bingo games in charitable gaming facilities.

#### **Next Steps**
The committee scheduled a work session to finalize decisions on the bills, particularly **Senate Bill 435**, and considered whether to adopt amendments or address specific issues like the double apportionment problem. The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing economic growth, fiscal responsibility, and fairness in New Hampshire’s legislative process.
