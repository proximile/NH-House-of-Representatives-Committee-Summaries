### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (April 12, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on April 12, 2022, to discuss several key legislative proposals and initiatives related to waste management, invasive species, animal welfare, and advanced recycling technologies. The meeting included detailed discussions, testimonies, and amendments to multiple bills, with a focus on environmental protection, resource management, and regulatory frameworks. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **1. Solid Waste Management and Recycling**

**Senate Bill 380 (SWAG Amendments):**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes changes to the **Solid Waste Working Group (SWAG)** to enhance its role in evaluating and managing waste management systems in New Hampshire.
- **Key Points**:
  - SWAG will assess whether to prohibit landfills from accepting waste from municipalities without solid waste management plans, including out-of-state municipalities.
  - The bill explores the need for new waste disposal capacity and criteria for selecting landfill sites.
  - **Support**: The Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) testified in favor, aligning the bill with New Hampshire’s waste reduction goals.
  - **Outcome**: The committee voted 13-0 to recommend the bill for passage, placing it on the consent calendar.

**Senate Bill 379 (Solid Waste Management Fund):**
- **Purpose**: Establishes a fund to support waste diversion, recycling, and hazardous waste reduction.
- **Key Points**:
  - The fund leverages federal funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law ($350 million over five years) to assist municipalities and private entities in improving recycling infrastructure.
  - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about long-term funding sustainability and potential federal strings attached to grants.
  - **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (17-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

**Advanced Recycling (Senate Bill 367):**
- **Purpose**: Addresses advanced recycling technologies, such as pyrolysis, which convert plastics into liquid feedstock for manufacturing.
- **Key Points**:
  - Proponents highlighted the potential to reduce landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions, with examples from states like Ohio, Georgia, and Texas.
  - Critics, including CLF, raised concerns about environmental risks, lack of transparency, and the classification of advanced recycling as incineration rather than manufacturing.
  - **Regulatory Concerns**: Discussions focused on emissions, feedstock testing, and the need for stringent regulatory frameworks.
  - **Outcome**: The committee planned further work sessions to address unresolved issues.

### **2. Invasive Species Management**

**Senate Bill 267 (Invasive Species Program):**
- **Purpose**: Establishes an **Upland Invasive Species Program Coordinator** within the Department of Agriculture to manage invasive species like Japanese knotweed and bittersweet.
- **Key Points**:
  - The program aims to coordinate statewide efforts, provide education, and implement control measures (mechanical, cultural, biological, and chemical).
  - **Funding**: Includes a $150,000 appropriation to initiate the program, with the goal of creating a permanent position in the next budget cycle.
  - **Amendment**: References to environmental NGOs were removed to avoid perceived political bias, passing unanimously (17-0).
  - **Outcome**: The bill received broad support, emphasizing the need for a coordinated approach to protect ecosystems, property values, and tourism.

**Aquatic Invasive Species Presentation:**
- **Threats**: Invasive species like milfoil, fanwort, and water chestnut harm ecosystems, recreation, tourism, and property values.
- **Management Efforts**: Prevention, early detection, rapid response, and long-term management are funded primarily by boat registration fees and local contributions.
- **Community Involvement**: The importance of education and community engagement was highlighted as critical to effective management.

### **3. Animal Welfare and Pet Vending Regulations**

**Senate Bill 368 (Pet Vending and Agricultural Hearings Officer):**
- **Purpose**: Addresses the unlicensed sale of live animals and establishes an **Agricultural Hearings Officer Revolving Fund** to handle fines and hearings related to violations.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill increases fines for repeated violations of pet vending laws to deter unlicensed sales.
  - A contracted hearings officer would handle violations, reducing the burden on the Department of Agriculture.
  - **Concerns**: Testimony from the **Dog Owners of the Granite State** raised issues about potential unintended consequences, such as increased animal hoarding and conflicts of interest with the hearings officer being funded by fines.
  - **Outcome**: The committee recessed the hearing and planned to continue discussions on April 19, 2022, with potential for a work session to address unresolved issues.

### **4. Environmental and Regulatory Concerns**

- **Hazardous Waste Testing**: Landfills routinely test for hazardous constituents to ensure proper disposal.
- **EPA Regulations**: New Hampshire’s solid waste rules exceed EPA standards under the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle D.
- **PFAS and Emerging Contaminants**: Discussions touched on monitoring and managing PFAS and other emerging contaminants in air and water emissions.
- **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)**: CLF advocated for EPR for packaging, emphasizing local processing of recyclables.

---

### **Next Steps**
- The committee planned to reconvene on **April 19, 2022**, to continue discussions on **SB 368** and **SB 367**, with potential work sessions to address unresolved issues.
- **SB 267**, **SB 379**, and **SB 380** were approved and moved forward to the consent calendar.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Waste Management**: Emphasis on reducing landfill reliance, improving recycling infrastructure, and exploring advanced recycling technologies.
- **Invasive Species**: Recognition of the need for coordinated statewide efforts to manage invasive species in both upland and aquatic environments.
- **Animal Welfare**: Focus on deterring unlicensed pet sales while addressing concerns about enforcement and unintended consequences.
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: Ongoing discussions about the environmental and public health implications of advanced recycling and the need for stringent regulations.

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing complex environmental and agricultural issues through legislative action, stakeholder collaboration, and careful consideration of regulatory and funding mechanisms.
