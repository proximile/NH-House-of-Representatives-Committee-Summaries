**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting on April 15, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on April 15, 2022, to address a wide range of fiscal matters, including funding requests, program approvals, infrastructure needs, and state government operations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

### **Funding Requests and Program Approvals**
1. **Housing Initiative**: A $100 million housing initiative was introduced to tackle the state’s housing crisis, focusing on increasing affordable and available housing. The program includes funding for municipalities, zoning updates, and demolition of uninhabitable buildings. Concerns were raised about ensuring funds primarily support affordable housing rather than high-income projects. The initiative passed 8-2.

2. **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**:
   - **Hampstead Hospital**: A funding request for Hampstead Hospital was approved unanimously, covering 21 positions, seven of which require new hires.
   - **General Funding**: A separate funding request for HHS was also approved unanimously.

3. **Pilot Program Concerns**: A representative raised concerns about a four-week pilot program mentioned in an article, which they had not received information on. It was noted that a memo might have been lost or not shared.

### **State Government Operations and Recruitment**
1. **Application System Issues**: The committee discussed the state’s outdated job application system, managed by Infor, and explored options for upgrading to a cloud-based solution or procuring a new system from vendors like Oracle or Workday. Immediate improvements are needed to enhance the user experience for job seekers and hiring managers.

2. **Recruitment and Retention**: Efforts to streamline recruitment and retention were outlined, including simplifying personnel rules, creating a statewide recruitment unit, and addressing a 20% vacancy rate in state government.

3. **Veterans’ Preference**: Concerns were raised about the lack of functionality in the application system to identify jobs offering veterans’ preference. This issue will be reviewed to ensure veterans can effectively search for and apply for relevant positions.

### **Infrastructure and ARPA Funding**
1. **Water and Wastewater Systems**: The committee allocated $150 million in ARPA funds to address critical infrastructure needs, focusing on disadvantaged communities, flood resilience, and PFAS contamination. Over $2 billion in infrastructure needs were identified.

2. **Fish and Game Department**: Discussions included hatchery upgrades and funding for drone purchases to support environmental improvements.

### **Department of Safety and Judicial Branch**
1. **Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Drones)**: The committee discussed the use of drones for surveillance and privacy concerns. Policies to protect privacy, including obtaining search warrants for surveillance, were reviewed. The item was tabled pending further review of written policies.

2. **Mental Health Docket**: Chief Justice Gordon McDonald presented a plan to address the emergency room boarding crisis by creating a centralized mental health docket and converting marital master positions to circuit judge positions. This would ensure hearings for involuntary emergency admission petitions are held within three days.

### **Prescription Drug Affordability and Education**
1. **Prescription Drug Affordability Board**: Representative Merchant provided an update on the rulemaking process, aiming to finalize the draft by the April 25th meeting.

2. **Department of Education**: Commissioner Frank Edelblut and CFO Tammy Vallancourt discussed the department’s housing situation, including the impact of asbestos and staff relocation. Plans for future facilities and ongoing capital projects were also addressed.

### **Community College Expansion for LPNs**
1. **LPN Training Program**: The committee discussed expanding Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) training at community colleges. Questions were raised about the percentage of graduates staying in New Hampshire and how to make students aware of financial opportunities.

### **Recognition and Acknowledgments**
1. **Karen Lucas**: The Chief Financial Officer of HHS, Karen Lucas, was thanked for her years of service as she prepares to leave state employment.

2. **Joey Bouchard**: The committee recognized Joey Bouchard, a retiring state employee, for his decades of service and dedication, praising his professionalism and commitment to the state.

### **Transparency and Future Plans**
The meeting concluded with discussions on transparency, program administration, and the need for timely updates on initiatives like the housing program. The next committee meeting was scheduled for May 20, 2022, with plans for future presentations to address ongoing questions and concerns.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on addressing critical fiscal and operational challenges while ensuring transparency and efficiency in state government programs.
