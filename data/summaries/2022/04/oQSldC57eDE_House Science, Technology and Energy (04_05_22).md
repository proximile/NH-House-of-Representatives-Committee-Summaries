**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (04/05/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on April 5, 2022, to discuss several energy-related bills, focusing on net metering, renewable energy expansion, and administrative improvements. Key bills addressed included **Senate Bills 259, 261, 262, 264**, and **House Bill 262**, alongside discussions on offshore wind development and the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC). Here’s a cohesive summary of the meeting:

### **Net Metering and Renewable Energy Expansion**
1. **Senate Bill 261**:  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes quarterly (instead of annual) payments for customer generators under net metering for excess electricity fed into the grid.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Advocates, including small business owner **Packy Campbell**, argued that **monthly payments** would better align with cash flow needs, making solar investments more viable for small businesses and low-income individuals.  
     - **Dual-axis solar trackers** were highlighted as a technology that reduces peak grid demand and lowers electricity costs.  
     - Utilities like **Eversource** raised concerns about the **administrative costs** of implementing more frequent payments, requesting **cost recovery language** in the bill.  
     - The NH Department of Energy noted that the bill would only apply to **grandfathered customer generators** (pre-June 2017) and suggested amendments to align with the sponsor’s intent.  
     - The committee acknowledged the need for amendments to balance benefits for solar generators with utility implementation challenges.  

2. **Senate Bill 259**:  
   - **Purpose**: Expands net metering eligibility to entities like the **University System of New Hampshire** and quasi-public entities by amending definitions of "municipal host" and "political subdivision."  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Supporters, including **Clean Energy New Hampshire**, emphasized the bill’s role in expanding renewable energy opportunities for municipalities.  
     - Concerns were raised about potential **cost shifts to ratepayers** and the need for clarity on the term "quasi-public entity."  
     - The committee discussed the need for clear definitions and expanded eligibility to promote renewable energy adoption.  

3. **Senate Bill 262**:  
   - **Purpose**: Expands net metering for businesses with loads between 1 and 5 megawatts, requiring 80% of energy produced to be consumed on-site.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill aims to encourage on-site renewable energy generation while preventing **cost-shifting**.  
     - It addresses **group net metering** issues, allowing existing self-generators to join net metering groups, and launches an investigation to improve the **interconnection process** for self-generators.  
     - Large manufacturers supported the bill, citing the need to control energy costs and meet sustainability goals.  
     - The NH Department of Energy raised technical concerns, such as unclear provisions if energy consumption drops.  

4. **House Bill 262**:  
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on **net metering** and **solar array sizing**, particularly for small customer generators like fire stations or schools.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill proposes allowing these entities to participate in **group net metering** and addresses **solar array sizing** (up to 125% of annual consumption, capped at 5 megawatts).  
     - Concerns were raised about **cost-shifting** and inconsistencies in **interconnection costs**, prompting calls for a study to address disparities.  
     - Supporters advocated for increasing the **small generator cap** from 100 kilowatts to 500 kilowatts to benefit more businesses.  
     - Due to its complexity, the committee considered forming a **subcommittee** for further examination.  

### **Administrative and Regulatory Improvements**
1. **Senate Bill 256**:  
   - **Purpose**: Establishes a committee to study the feasibility of replacing the **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)**, which oversees energy project siting.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The SEC faces challenges with **funding**, **staffing**, and meeting quorum.  
     - The study would evaluate the SEC’s structure, funding, and potential replacement to improve efficiency.  

2. **Senate Bill 440**:  
   - **Purpose**: Directs the **Office of Offshore Wind Industry Development** to develop criteria for evaluating **power purchase agreements (PPAs)** for offshore wind energy.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill aims to protect **New Hampshire ratepayers**, ensure cost-effectiveness, and respect environmental and fisheries interests.  
     - Discussions centered on whether the bill was necessary, given the office’s existing responsibilities.  

3. **Senate Bill 264**:  
   - **Purpose**: Transfers authority over the **Low-Income Electric Assistance Program (EAP)** from the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)** to the **Department of Energy (DOE)**.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill codifies the EAP in statute, maintaining its funding mechanism (a 1.5-mill charge per kilowatt-hour) and ensuring no changes to the program’s structure.  
     - It allows the DOE to use a **non-adjudicative hearing process** to streamline administrative decisions.  
     - The bill was widely supported as a **"good government" initiative**, with backing from the **Consumer Advocate**, **DOE**, and **New Hampshire Legal Assistance**.  

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Fairness and Accessibility**: Advocates emphasized the importance of timely compensation for renewable energy producers and expanding net metering opportunities for small businesses and municipalities.  
- **Administrative Challenges**: Utilities raised concerns about the **costs** and logistical burdens of implementing more frequent payments and expanding net metering programs.  
- **Clarity and Oversight**: Discussions highlighted the need for clear definitions, regulatory improvements, and legislative oversight to ensure effective energy policy implementation.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to consider amendments, form subcommittees for complex bills, and continue discussions to address technical and regulatory issues.  

Overall, the meeting reflected ongoing efforts to balance renewable energy expansion, affordability, and administrative efficiency in New Hampshire’s energy policies.
