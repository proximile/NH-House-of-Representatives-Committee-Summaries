**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting - House Finance Division II (04/13/22)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on April 13, 2022, focused on discussions surrounding two pieces of legislation, **SB 402** and **SB 409**, which address disaster relief and hazard mitigation funding for municipalities. The deliberations centered on balancing the need for swift and effective disaster recovery support with concerns about potential misuse, duplication of benefits, and the financial burden on municipalities. Key points from the meeting include:

### **SB 402: Disaster Relief Grants**
- **Purpose**: SB 402 grants the governor the authority to disburse funds to municipalities affected by disasters, even without an emergency declaration. The bill was amended to be more open-ended, enabling the governor to act quickly in disaster situations.
- **Concerns**:
  - **Grant vs. Loan**: Unlike SB 409, which offers non-interest loans, SB 402 provides grants. Some representatives opposed the open-ended nature of the grants, fearing misuse or duplication with FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) funding.
  - **Duplication of Benefits**: State grants could reduce FEMA eligibility, as FEMA might consider state funds an additional source, potentially disqualifying municipalities from federal aid.
  - **Mitigation Efforts**: Grants might reduce incentives for municipalities to invest in disaster mitigation plans, as they would not need to repay the funds.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Representative Walt proposed an amendment to limit SB 402's scope, ensuring state funds are only used for non-FEMA-eligible expenses or the municipality's share of the FEMA match. This aimed to prevent duplication of benefits and clarify the bill's intent.
- **Suggestions**: Some representatives recommended focusing on SB 409 first, allowing it to operate for a few years before considering additional legislation like SB 402.

### **SB 409: Non-Interest Loans for Disaster Recovery**
- **Purpose**: SB 409 allows municipalities to apply for non-interest loans from the state for disaster recovery, with the expectation that FEMA will reimburse a portion of the costs. This was seen as a more controlled approach compared to SB 402.
- **Amendments**:
  - Clarified language around anticipated FEMA assistance.
  - Proposed requiring municipalities to apply for hazard mitigation grant funding to reduce future disaster impacts.
- **Hazard Mitigation Funding Debate**: There was extensive discussion on whether municipalities should be mandated to apply for hazard mitigation grants. Concerns were raised about the costs and feasibility of such applications, with some arguing for flexibility to account for extenuating circumstances.
- **Eligibility for Future Assistance**: Amendments suggested that municipalities failing to seek hazard mitigation funding could be ineligible for future disaster assistance. Some representatives proposed softer language, such as "may not be eligible" rather than "shall be ineligible."

### **Combining SB 402 and SB 409**
- There was consideration of combining the two bills to streamline legislation, as both address financial assistance to municipalities affected by disasters. The main difference is that SB 402 does not require a state of emergency declaration.

### **Mitigation Plans and Future Assistance**
- Representatives emphasized the importance of municipalities having and implementing hazard mitigation plans, which are required to receive federal disaster funds. Progress on these plans could be a condition for future state assistance.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee decided to recess and reconvene on April 19 to finalize decisions on both bills, with the intent to refine SB 402 to address concerns about its open-ended nature and to finalize amendments to SB 409.

### **Overall Themes**
- **Swift Relief vs. Risk Management**: The discussion highlighted the need to provide timely disaster relief while mitigating risks such as misuse, duplication of benefits, and reduced incentives for mitigation efforts.
- **Equity and Clarity**: Representatives aimed to ensure that state funds are used effectively and equitably, particularly for smaller municipalities with limited resources.
- **Proactive Mitigation**: The importance of proactive hazard mitigation planning and funding was a recurring theme, with an emphasis on reducing future disaster risks.

In summary, the meeting underscored the complexity of crafting legislation that balances immediate disaster recovery needs with long-term risk reduction and financial accountability. The committeeâ€™s deliberations reflected a commitment to refining the bills to address these challenges effectively.
