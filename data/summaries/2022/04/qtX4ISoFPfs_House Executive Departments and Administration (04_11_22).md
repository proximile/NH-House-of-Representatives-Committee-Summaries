**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on April 11, 2022**  
The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 11, 2022, focused on several bills related to healthcare licensing, professional regulations, and administrative updates. The discussions centered on modernizing outdated laws, addressing workforce shortages, and improving patient access to care, particularly in rural areas. Below is a detailed summary of the key bills and discussions:

---

### **Senate Bill 228: Modernizing Physician Assistant (PA) Regulations**  
**Purpose**: SB 228 aims to update regulations governing Physician Assistants (PAs) in New Hampshire to align with modern healthcare practices, improve access to care, and make the state more competitive with neighboring states like Vermont and Maine.  

**Key Provisions**:  
1. Combines supervisory and practice agreements into a single **collaboration agreement**, simplifying administrative processes.  
2. Clarifies liability: PAs are responsible for their care, while physicians are only liable if directly involved in patient care.  
3. Allows PAs to **directly bill insurers** where permitted by federal law.  
4. Exempts PAs from needing a collaboration agreement during emergencies or disasters.  
5. Permits PAs to volunteer at events (e.g., summer camps, charity races) without a collaboration agreement.  

**Discussion**:  
- **Senator Jeb Bradley**, the bill’s sponsor, emphasized that the bill does not expand PAs’ scope of practice or remove their legal "tether" to supervising physicians.  
- Stakeholders, including the **NH Society of Physician Assistants** and the **NH Medical Society**, supported the bill, highlighting its focus on streamlining regulations without compromising oversight or patient safety.  
- Concerns about liability were addressed, with PAs required to carry **professional liability insurance**.  

**Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (17-0) and was seen as a common-sense update to PA regulations.

### **Senate Bill 313: Clarifying Authority of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**  
**Purpose**: SB 313 clarifies the OPLC’s authority to set fees for licensing boards, removes contradictory statements in board policies, and addresses disagreements among boards.  

**Discussion**:  
- **Representative Scitec** raised concerns about the OPLC’s structure, suggesting it should report to the **Department of Administrative Services (DAS)** rather than directly to the governor.  
- **Representative Schmidt** supported these concerns, describing the OPLC’s structure as "too loosely goosey" and in need of a better legal framework.  
- **Representative Schuett** mentioned efforts to create an **oversight committee** for the OPLC to reduce friction between the administration and licensing boards.  

**Outcome**: The bill, as amended by the Senate, passed unanimously (17-0).

### **Senate Bill 284: Expanding Optometry Practice for Glaucoma Treatment**  
**Purpose**: SB 284 updates the statute to allow optometrists to treat all forms of glaucoma, not just primary open-angle glaucoma, and removes outdated restrictions, such as requiring optometrists to consult with ophthalmologists for certain cases.  

**Discussion**:  
- Optometrists testified that current restrictions are unnecessary, inefficient, and hinder patient access to care, particularly in rural areas.  
- Representatives debated the historical context of the 2002 restrictions but ultimately passed the bill as is, as stakeholders were satisfied with the proposed changes.  

**Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (17-0).

### **Senate Bill 330: Study Committee on Licensing Boards**

**Discussion**:  
- Testimony supported the study committee to address reciprocity issues and streamline licensing processes.  
- The committee emphasized the importance of addressing regulatory stagnation and improving licensing efficiency.  

**Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously.

### **Senate Bill 277: Extending Emergency Healthcare Licensing**  
**Purpose**: SB 277 extends the OPLC’s authority to issue emergency healthcare licenses until January 31, 2024. This program was initially implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to address workforce shortages.  

**Discussion**:  
- Concerns were raised about the lack of fees for these licenses and the potential for individuals to avoid permanent licensure.  
- Supporters argued the program is vital for addressing healthcare provider shortages, especially in rural areas.  

**Outcome**: The bill was discussed, with no final vote recorded in the transcript.
