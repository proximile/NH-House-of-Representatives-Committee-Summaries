#### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Population Equality and Legal Standards**  
   - The committee stressed adherence to the principle of "one person, one vote," ensuring districts have equal populations.  
   - Reference was made to court cases from New Jersey and West Virginia regarding population deviation standards.  
   - Governor Sununu’s proposed map, discussed in the context of **Amendment 1523H**, had a population deviation of approximately 1,028.  
   - Testifiers, including Olivia Zinke from Open Democracy Action, emphasized the need for population equalization in line with the Supreme Court’s “one person, one vote” principle.

2. **Proposed Map Adjustments**  
   - Specific adjustments were discussed to reduce population deviations, such as swapping the towns of Loudon and Epsom, which would improve population balance.  
   - The proposed map shifted 25 towns, affecting 152,337 people.  
   - Governor Sununu’s map, presented by Representative Griffin, split four counties and was described as a potential vehicle for redistricting work, particularly in light of expected vetoes of previously passed maps.  

3. **Competitiveness**  
   - The proposed map was noted to be more competitive than the previous proposal but less competitive than the current map.  
   - Testifiers, including Coreen Dodge and Liz Tentarelli, called for fair representation that does not favor any political party and urged the creation of competitive districts.  
   - Barbara Griffin questioned the rationale behind splitting certain counties and emphasized the importance of competitive districts.  

4. **County Cohesion and Community Interests**  
   - There was debate about keeping counties together to maintain community cohesion and reduce disruptions.  
   - Suggestions included grouping Belknap, Carroll, Strafford, and Rockingham counties with Manchester and Pelham for better alignment.  
   - Historical context was referenced, with Griffin highlighting significant population shifts since the 1880s and questioning the rationale for current district boundaries.  

5. **SB 200 and Non-Germane Amendment**  
   - Senator Gray introduced **SB 200**, which aimed to increase the number of commissioners in a specific location from three to five. However, he noted the bill was unnecessary due to existing legislation.  
   - **Amendment 1523H**, a non-germane amendment proposed by Representative Griffin, focused on congressional district mapping and provided a mechanism for the committee to continue its redistricting work.  

6. **Public Input and Transparency**  
   - The committee emphasized the importance of public hearings and transparency in the redistricting process.  
   - Testifiers, including Liz Tentarelli from the League of Women Voters, urged the committee to strive for more inclusive maps that represent urban, suburban, and rural areas.  
   - Members were encouraged to submit amendments and maps for public review.  

7. **Historical Context**  
   - The committee referenced historical redistricting practices, noting that New Hampshire’s congressional districts have seen minimal changes since the 1880s, with adjustments primarily made to equalize population shifts.  
   - Griffin’s reference to an 1880 map highlighted the significant population shifts over time and the need to reconsider historical district boundaries.

#### **Next Steps**
