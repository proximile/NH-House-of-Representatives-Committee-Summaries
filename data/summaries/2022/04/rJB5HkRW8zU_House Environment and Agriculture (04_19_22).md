**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (April 19, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on April 19, 2022, to address several key issues, including advanced recycling, the unlicensed sale of live animals, and a proposed agricultural hearings officer revolving fund. The meeting also included logistical planning for a visit to a veterinary pathology lab.

### **Segment 1: Coordination for Veterinary Pathology Lab Visit**
The meeting began with a discussion about coordinating a visit to the veterinary pathology lab led by Rob Gibson, who had expressed interest in providing a tour. The lab is located near another point of interest, prompting the committee to plan both visits simultaneously. The task of organizing the details and selecting a date was assigned, and the segment concluded with well-wishes for safe travels and a reminder of the next meeting.

### **Segment 2: Senate Bill 367 – Advanced Recycling and Manufacturing Facilities**
The committee delved into **Senate Bill 367**, which addresses the regulatory status of advanced recycling and manufacturing facilities. The discussion focused on balancing environmental protections with the economic and waste management benefits of advanced recycling.

#### **Key Discussion Points:**
1. **Feedstock Sourcing and Waste Reduction**:
   - Concerns were raised about whether New Hampshire could supply sufficient recyclable feedstock locally or if materials would need to be imported. Imported materials could risk contributing to landfills if they fail to meet processing standards.

2. **Advanced Recycling Process**:
   - Representatives from the **American Chemistry Council (ACC)**, including **Craig Cookson**, explained the advanced recycling process, which involves pre-processing recyclables to meet tight specifications. Rejected materials are returned to their source or disposed of according to solid waste regulations.

3. **Regulatory Framework**:
   - The bill seeks to classify advanced recycling facilities as manufacturing rather than waste facilities, exempting them from solid waste regulations. Clarity was needed on when recyclables transition from being classified as solid waste to feedstock.

4. **Environmental and Health Concerns**:
   - Questions were raised about potential contamination from hazardous materials or medical waste. The ACC assured that stringent testing and controls are in place to prevent hazardous materials from entering the recycling process.

5. **Economic Benefits**:
   - Advanced recycling could create a revenue stream for communities by creating demand for non-recycled plastics and reducing financial pressure on municipalities by diverting waste from landfills.

6. **Federal and State Oversight**:
   - The **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** confirmed that advanced recycling facilities would be subject to existing air and water quality regulations, as well as federal EPA requirements, particularly if they produce fuel products.

7. **Proposed Amendments**:
   - The committee discussed amendments to clarify language in the bill, particularly regarding the definition of feedstock and ensuring that the bill does not inadvertently allow the production of fuel from recycled materials, which would not count toward New Hampshire's recycling goals.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
The committee aimed to promote advanced recycling as a sustainable waste management solution while ensuring robust environmental protections and clear regulatory oversight. Precise language in the bill was deemed essential to address concerns about feedstock sourcing, facility operations, and the classification of recyclables.

### **Segment 3: Senate Bill 368 – Unlicensed Sale of Live Animals and Agricultural Hearings Officer Revolving Fund**
The meeting concluded with a discussion of **Senate Bill 368**, which addresses the unlicensed sale of live animals and establishes an agricultural hearings officer revolving fund.

#### **Key Discussion Points:**
1. **Advanced Recycling Debate**:
   - The segment began with a continuation of the advanced recycling discussion, focusing on whether recycled products should be used as fuel or as feedstock for manufacturing plastic products. Concerns were raised about regulatory clarity and the need to reduce waste and increase recycling.

2. **Senate Bill 368 (SB 368)**:
   - The bill aims to address unlicensed pet vendors transferring animals without proper health certificates. Debate centered on increasing fines for violations, with some representatives questioning the effectiveness of raising fines to $5,000 without proper enforcement mechanisms.
   - The **American Kennel Club (AKC)** testified, expressing concerns that the bill focuses on penalties for licensed vendors rather than addressing unlicensed transfers. They suggested amendments or sending the bill to study for further refinement.

3. **Amendment Proposal**:
   - A proposed amendment would maintain the current $1,000 fine (removing the increase to $5,000) and establish a $75,000 cap for the revolving fund to hire hearing officers. The amendment also seeks to address enforcement gaps by allowing administrative fines for unlicensed transfers of animals without health certificates.

4. **Hearing Officers**:
   - The revolving fund would enable the Department of Agriculture to contract hearing officers to handle violations, reducing the burden on department staff and improving enforcement and compliance.

5. **Public Feedback**:
   - Online feedback showed strong opposition to the bill, with 43 opposed and 9 in favor. Representatives emphasized the need for clarity in the bill’s language, particularly around health certificates and certificates of transfer.

6. **Future Steps**:
   - A non-germane amendment hearing was scheduled for the following Tuesday to finalize the amendment and move the bill forward. The committee also considered a field trip to the UNH McFarland Research Greenhouse to learn about their agricultural research activities.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
The committee focused on refining SB 368 to address enforcement challenges in the pet vendor industry, balancing penalties, improving compliance, and ensuring animal health and safety. Proposed amendments aimed to streamline the bill and address public and stakeholder concerns.
