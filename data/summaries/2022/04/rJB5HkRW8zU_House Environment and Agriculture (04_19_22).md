**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Environment and Agriculture (April 19, 2022)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on April 19, 2022, focusing on several key legislative bills related to animal welfare, advanced recycling, and agricultural enforcement mechanisms. The discussions centered on **Senate Bills 367 and 368**, with stakeholders and representatives addressing regulatory frameworks, enforcement challenges, and amendments to improve the proposed legislation.  

### **Senate Bill 368: Animal Welfare and Enforcement**  
The primary focus of SB 368 is the unlicensed sale of live animals and the establishment of the **Agricultural Hearings Officer Revolving Fund**. Key discussions included:  
1. **Enforcement Challenges**:  
   - Stacy Ober of the **American Kennel Club (AKC)** testified that the current law, which classifies unlicensed transfers as misdemeanors, is inadequately enforced due to insufficient collaboration with law enforcement and the Department of Justice (DOJ).  
   - Ober opposed the proposed increase in fines for pet vendors from $1,000 to $5,000, arguing that the current maximum fine is rarely utilized. She emphasized that the lack of enforcement, not the penalties, is the core issue.  

2. **Health Certificates and Loopholes**:  
   - A significant concern was the sale of pets without veterinary exams or health certificates, which bypasses existing regulations. Ober urged immediate action to close this loophole rather than waiting for future legislation.  

3. **Hearing Officer and Revolving Fund**:  
   - The bill proposes creating a hearing officer position to streamline enforcement of animal welfare violations, funded by a revolving fund capped at $75,000 annually.  
   - To avoid conflict of interest, the committee agreed to maintain the current $1,000 fine for consistent violations but introduced a new $1,000 administrative fine for transferring animals without proper documentation.  

4. **Two-Track System and Inspections**:  
   - The Department of Agriculture operates a two-track system, with criminal cases handled by law enforcement and administrative cases managed internally. The hearing officer would focus on administrative enforcement, particularly in cases involving multiple violations.  
   - Inspectors highlighted poor record-keeping, especially in rescue operations, as a common issue affecting disease control and animal health.  

5. **Amendments and Future Steps**:  
   - The committee discussed a **non-germane amendment** to address concerns raised during testimony, with a hearing scheduled for the following Tuesday.  
   - Future plans included visits to the University of New Hampshire’s McFarland Research Greenhouse and Veterinary Pathology Lab to learn more about their research activities.  

### **Senate Bill 367: Advanced Recycling and Manufacturing Facilities**  
SB 367 addresses the regulatory status of **advanced recycling facilities**, classifying them as manufacturing rather than waste management entities. Key points included:  
1. **Purpose and Scope**:  
   - The bill clarifies that post-use polymers (recyclable plastics) are not classified as solid waste once sorted and processed.  

2. **Feedstock and Waste Management**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the availability of local recyclable feedstock and the potential need to import materials from other states.  
   - Discussions focused on managing rejected materials and ensuring compliance with solid waste regulations.  

3. **Contamination and Quality Control**:  
   - Advanced recycling facilities are incentivized to maintain high feedstock quality, as they pay for materials and rely on their consistency for processing.  

4. **Regulatory Framework**:  
   - The bill subjects advanced recycling facilities to manufacturing regulations rather than solid waste regulations, while the Department of Environmental Services (DES) retains inspection authority to ensure environmental compliance.  

5. **Amendments and Stakeholder Concerns**:  
   - Amendments were proposed to refine the bill’s language, particularly around inspection authority and the definition of advanced recycling products.  
   - Stakeholders sought assurances about hazardous material handling, recycling costs, and the economic benefits of turning waste into revenue streams.  

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
- **Enforcement Over Penalties**: Across both bills, the emphasis was on improving enforcement mechanisms rather than increasing penalties. Stakeholders highlighted the need for better collaboration between regulatory bodies and law enforcement.  
- **Education and Compliance**: Education was seen as a critical tool for ensuring compliance with animal welfare and recycling regulations.  
- **Amendments and Refinements**: Both bills underwent discussions about amendments to address stakeholder concerns, refine language, and ensure clarity in regulatory frameworks.  
- **Economic and Environmental Balance**: The discussions aimed to balance economic opportunities with environmental goals, particularly in advanced recycling and animal welfare enforcement.  

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of collaboration, education, and effective enforcement in achieving the legislative goals of SB 367 and SB 368. The committee aimed to refine the bills to address stakeholder concerns while ensuring they are practical and enforceable.
