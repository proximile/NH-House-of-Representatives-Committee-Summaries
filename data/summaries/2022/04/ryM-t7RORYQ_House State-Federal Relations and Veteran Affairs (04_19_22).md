The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 19, 2022, focused on **Senate Bill 360**, which pertains to **National Guard education benefits**. The bill proposes allowing members of the New Hampshire National Guard to transfer their tuition waiver benefits to an eligible spouse after completing a six-year service obligation and re-enlisting for an additional four years. This is intended as a **recruitment and retention tool** for the National Guard, recognizing that military families also serve when a member is in the military.

**Key Points from the Discussion:**

1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to retain National Guard members by offering educational benefits to their spouses, addressing challenges in recruitment and retention. New Hampshire has one of the smallest National Guard forces per capita in the country, and the military faces nationwide recruitment struggles.

2. **Eligibility**: To qualify, a National Guard member must complete their initial six-year service contract and re-enlist for an additional four years. The benefit can then be transferred to a registered spouse, allowing them to attend classes at the New Hampshire Community College System.

3. **Pilot Program**: The bill is structured as a **five-year pilot program**, set to expire in July 2027, allowing the community college system to evaluate its budgetary impact before potential renewal.

4. **Exclusion of Children**: The bill specifically excludes children from eligibility. This decision was made to encourage military families' children to join the military themselves rather than rely solely on transferred benefits.

5. **No Fiscal Impact**: The program involves no direct state funding. Instead, it relies on tuition waivers provided by the community college system, with no financial transaction between the state and the colleges.

6. **Support for the Bill**: Testimonies from Major General David Mikulitis (Adjutant General of the NH National Guard) and Kevin Grady (State Veterans Advisory Committee) emphasized the bill’s potential to retain experienced personnel and support military families. The community college system also supports the bill, as it does not significantly impact their operations.

7. **Executive Session Outcome**: The committee voted **13-9** in favor of the bill, recommending it "ought to pass." It was subsequently placed on the consent calendar for further legislative action.

The bill is seen as a **win-win** for New Hampshire, supporting military families, retaining skilled personnel, and enhancing the state’s workforce without imposing financial burdens on the state.
