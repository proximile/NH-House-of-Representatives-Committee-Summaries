### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (April 12, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on April 12, 2022, to discuss a range of bills addressing transportation, vehicle regulations, and related policies. The meeting focused on balancing innovation, convenience, and economic considerations with privacy, safety, and environmental concerns. Below is a consolidated summary of the key discussions and bills covered during the meeting:

---

#### **1. Mobile Service Garages (Senate Bill 389)**  
The committee debated the feasibility and regulation of **mobile service garages**, which provide vehicle maintenance and inspections at large employers' sites. Proponents highlighted the convenience for employees and the potential for state inspections to be conducted at these mobile units. However, concerns were raised about the high capital investment, the practicality of moving the service between locations, and the need to ensure a level playing field with traditional brick-and-mortar inspection stations. The bill aims to define and regulate mobile service garages, requiring them to meet specific criteria, such as having a lift, insurance, and a physical office.

---

#### **2. Decal Plates (Senate Bill 309)**  
This bill proposes allowing organizations like the **New Hampshire Towing Association** and **Jesus Across the Border** to issue decals for multi-use license plates. These decals would serve as fundraising tools and promote awareness, particularly for New Hampshire's move-over law, which aims to protect roadside workers. The New Hampshire Towing Association emphasized the safety benefits of increased awareness through these decals.

---

#### **3. Access to Motor Vehicle Records (Senate Bill 311)**  
The bill would permit motor vehicle-related businesses and healthcare providers to obtain personal information from driver's licenses or non-driver identification cards with the holder's consent. Critics raised concerns about the broad and undefined scope of "motor vehicle-related business purposes" and "healthcare business purposes," arguing that it could lead to privacy violations. The bill includes restrictions on the collection, retention, and use of such information.

---

#### **4. Toll Violations and DMV Holds (Senate Bill 442)**  
This bill addresses toll violations and the process of placing a DMV hold on vehicles with unpaid tolls. Concerns were raised about the time and cost involved in the process, with suggestions to shorten it to save time and taxpayer money. Officials noted that the state recoups more money from tolls than it spends on enforcement. The bill also proposes suspending vehicle registration immediately after 30 days of non-payment and prohibiting transfers to family members to prevent toll evaders from circumventing penalties.

---

#### **5. Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Fund (Senate Bill 447)**  
The bill establishes a fund for **electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure** using federal grants. It aims to support EV charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and commercial properties, and allows for private contracting. **Clean Energy New Hampshire** endorsed the bill, emphasizing the need for New Hampshire to remain competitive in the EV market.

---

#### **6. Driver’s Licenses for Visa Holders (Senate Bill 308)**  
This bill addresses the ability of agricultural workers (H2A visa holders) to drive with foreign licenses in New Hampshire. Current law does not recognize foreign licenses, leading to fines for employers and workers. The bill proposes reciprocity for foreign licenses, particularly for seasonal agricultural workers, to avoid unnecessary burdens.

---

#### **7. Voter Registration and Social Security Numbers (Senate Bill 449)**  
This bill sparked significant debate over requiring individuals to provide either their full Social Security number or the last five digits when registering to vote or renewing their driver’s license. **Privacy concerns** were a major focus, with opponents arguing that the bill could violate the state’s constitutional privacy protections. Proponents, however, argued that it would improve election integrity by streamlining voter verification and reducing the need for affidavits. The bill also ties into a related "portal bill" for verifying voter information, though the portal does not yet exist.

---

#### **8. Electric School Bus Pilot Program (Senate Bill 417)**  
This bill establishes a pilot program for **electric school buses**, funded by the Volkswagen settlement and other federal grants. Electric buses offer health and environmental benefits by reducing diesel emissions and idling. They also feature **vehicle-to-grid technology**, allowing them to serve as energy storage and potentially generate revenue for school districts. While the upfront cost of electric buses is higher, maintenance and fuel savings are significant. The program will cover the incremental cost of electric buses and require data collection to evaluate its effectiveness.

---

#### **9. Driver's License Scanning and Storage**  
Concerns were raised about a bill allowing businesses like Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens to scan and store driver's licenses, potentially leading to widespread retention of personal data. Hospitals supported the bill, emphasizing the need to prevent fraud and ensure patient safety, especially in compliance with federal regulations like HIPAA and the FTC's Red Flag Rules.

---

#### **10. License Plate Scanning**  
A bill allowing private property owners to use license plate readers for access control was discussed. The system is intended for properties like gated communities or businesses needing to manage vehicle entry. The bill prohibits recording or photographing vehicle occupants and ensures that plates are not retained after scanning.

---

#### **11. Driver's License Reciprocity**  
This bill aims to establish reciprocity for driver's education programs across states, allowing New Hampshire to recognize out-of-state programs that meet its standards. It also imposes penalties for out-of-state offenses as if they occurred in New Hampshire.

---

#### **12. Retention of Social Security Numbers**  
A bill proposing the retention of the last four digits of Social Security numbers by the DMV for voter verification purposes was discussed. The goal is to streamline voter registration and reduce the need for affidavits, especially for individuals without IDs. Concerns were raised about privacy and the potential for misuse.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance innovation and convenience with privacy, safety, and environmental considerations. Bills like **SB 417 (Electric School Bus Pilot Program)** and **SB 447 (EV Infrastructure Fund)** underscore New Hampshire’s commitment to sustainability and public health. Meanwhile, discussions around **SB 449 (Voter Registration)** and **SB 311 (Access to Motor Vehicle Records)** reflect ongoing debates over privacy and data security. The committee decided to delay executive sessions on some bills to allow more time for research and consideration, with plans to reconvene on April 26, 2022, to finalize recommendations.
