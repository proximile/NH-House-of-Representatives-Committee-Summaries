- **Outcome**: The bill was passed unanimously, recognizing the need for modernization in the state’s employee classification system.

### **Retiree Health Benefits (Senate Bill 356)**
- **Purpose**: Update the billing and collection process for state retirees’ health benefits to comply with Medicare regulations.
- **Key Changes**: 
  - Eliminate retroactive enrollment and disenrollment, which is prohibited by federal law.
  - Remove the requirement for certified mail notices for late payments, reducing unnecessary costs.
- **Cost Savings**: The Department of Administrative Services highlighted significant savings achieved by transitioning to a fully insured Medicare Advantage plan and leveraging federal subsidies.
- **Public Testimony**: Retiree Roy Schweiker proposed an amendment to allow retirees to choose between medical and drug benefits separately, arguing it would save the state money and provide better options for retirees.

### **Mental Health Counseling Compact and Child Placement (Senate Bill 397)**
- **Mental Health Counseling Compact**:
  - **Purpose**: Join an interstate compact to streamline licensing for counselors moving to New Hampshire from other compact states, addressing workforce shortages in mental health services.
  - **Support**: The Department of Defense supports the compact to facilitate licensure for military personnel transitioning to civilian life.
  - **Telehealth Provisions**: Allow counselors licensed in other compact states to practice in New Hampshire without obtaining a New Hampshire-specific license, provided they adhere to New Hampshire’s laws and regulations.
- **Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC)**:
  - **Purpose**: Update New Hampshire’s participation in the ICPC to improve interstate communication and child welfare.
  - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the fiscal impact and the transition from the old ICPC to the new one, ensuring New Hampshire does not end up in legal limbo if the new compact does not reach the required 35-state threshold.

### **Recovery Housing Requirements (Senate Bill 223)**
- **Purpose**: Adjust square footage requirements for recovery housing to align with national standards.

- **Support**: The bill is supported by the fire marshal, recovery housing advocates, and lawmakers, aiming to increase access to recovery housing for individuals struggling with substance use disorders.
- **Concerns Addressed**: Lawmakers questioned whether the reduced space would lead to overcrowding or resemble jail cells. Advocates clarified that recovery houses must still provide communal living spaces, kitchens, and bathrooms, ensuring a supportive environment.
- **Outcome**: The bill received broad support, with no opposition noted, and is seen as a minor but necessary adjustment to improve recovery housing accessibility.

### **Overall Tone and Outcome**
