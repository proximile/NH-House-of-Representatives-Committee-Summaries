### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (April 6, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on April 6, 2022, to discuss a series of Senate bills addressing insurance regulations, health insurance exchanges, and financial incentives for COVID-19 vaccinations. The meeting also included a discussion on the oversight of the Public Deposit Investment Pool (PDIP). Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions:

---

### **Insurance Regulations**
Several bills were introduced to modernize and clarify New Hampshire’s insurance statutes, with broad support from the insurance industry and the Department of Insurance.

1. **Senate Bill 354**: Introduced by Senator Soucy, this bill proposes updates to the Department of Insurance’s licensing statutes. Key changes include defining “good cause” for license non-issuance, clarifying that license renewal fees are non-refundable, resolving conflicts in statutory law regarding banks selling credit life and accident insurance, and requiring businesses selling insurance to hold appropriate licenses.

2. **Senate Bill 204**: Introduced by Senator Cannon, this bill modifies the definition of “covered claim” in the New Hampshire Insurance Guaranty Association Act to ensure that policies remain covered in the event of insurer insolvency, regardless of subsequent transfers.

3. **Senate Bill 205**: Also introduced by Senator Cannon, this bill allows the Insurance Department to apply administrative fund overages to reduce future assessments rather than carrying them over into future fiscal years.

4. **Senate Bill 206**: Introduced by Senator French, this bill removes prepaid legal contracts from Insurance Department regulation and clarifies consumer guarantee contracts (service contracts). It also amends the department’s investigation statute to allow flexibility in adopting rules related to consumer investigations.

5. **Senate Bill 207**: Also introduced by Senator French, this bill clarifies that a company’s cost of retaining an outside expert for reviewing annual statements will be credited toward their administrative fees for the subsequent year only, rather than being carried over into future years.

6. **Senate Bill 208**: Introduced by Senator Kavanaugh, this bill proposes a comprehensive update and modernization of RSA 408, the statute regulating life insurance. It removes outdated provisions, updates language to align with modern standards, and reorganizes the statute for clarity.

### **Discount Medical Plans and State-Based Health Insurance Exchange**
Two bills focused on health-related insurance regulations and market structures were discussed.

1. **Senate Bill 285**: Introduced by Senator Cavanaugh, this bill updates regulations for **Discount Medical Plan Organizations (DMPOs)**, incorporating provisions from the **National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Model Law 98**. Key updates include enhanced registration requirements, minimum capital requirements ($150,000 net worth), and procedures for registration renewal. Concerns were raised about the vague definition of “good character” in the registration process.

2. **Senate Bill 121**: Introduced by Senator Rosenwald, this bill allows New Hampshire to explore transitioning from the federal **Healthcare.gov** marketplace to a **state-based health insurance exchange**. Potential benefits include **$4 million in annual savings** by reducing the 2.75% federal assessment fee, greater local control, and improved data integration with state Medicaid programs. Concerns centered on whether savings would directly benefit consumers and the costs of implementing a state-based exchange.

### **Public Deposit Investment Pool (PDIP)**
**Senate Bill 272** proposes the establishment of a study committee to review the oversight and operation of the PDIP, a cooperative investment pool for public funds managed by the New Hampshire Banking Department. Key discussion points included:

1. **Purpose of the Study**: The committee would examine the PDIP’s performance, safety, diversification, and rate of return, as well as the Banking Department’s role in its oversight. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts of interest, as the PDIP invests funds outside the state.

2. **Testimony and Concerns**: Stakeholders highlighted the PDIP’s growth to approximately $237 million in assets and its current yield of 0.2489%. Questions were raised about low returns compared to other investment options and the need for liquidity to meet municipalities’ short-term cash flow needs.

3. **Advisory Committee**: The PDIP is overseen by an advisory committee that includes representatives from various municipal and state entities.

### **State-Based Health Insurance Exchange and COVID-19 Vaccination Incentives**
The discussion also covered the potential establishment of a state-based health insurance exchange and financial incentives for COVID-19 vaccinations.

1. **State-Based Exchange**: Benefits include greater control over data and integration between state agencies, while concerns focus on potential loss of federal consumer protections and the complexity of implementation. Private vendors like **Get Insured**, **Deloitte**, and **Optum** were mentioned as key players in providing technology solutions.

2. **Financial Incentives for COVID-19 Vaccinations**: A bill was proposed to allow health insurers to offer financial incentives for individuals who provide proof of full COVID-19 vaccination at the time of enrollment. This is seen as a way to reduce healthcare costs and insurance premiums by preventing costly hospitalizations.
