**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on April 6, 2022 (House Commerce and Consumer Affairs)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 6, 2022, to address a range of legislative matters related to commerce, consumer affairs, and insurance. The meeting was divided into four segments, focusing on state-based health insurance exchanges, COVID-19 vaccine incentives, insurance regulation updates, and the Public Deposit Investment Pool (PDIP). Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. State-Based Health Insurance Exchange and COVID-19 Vaccine Incentives**

#### **State-Based Health Insurance Exchange**
- **Purpose and Benefits**: Representatives explored transitioning from the federal Healthcare.gov platform to a state-based health insurance exchange. Potential benefits include better integration with state Medicaid agencies, greater control over data, and long-term cost savings. States like Pennsylvania have successfully implemented state-based exchanges, serving as models for potential savings and improved efficiency.
- **Challenges and Concerns**: Establishing a state-based exchange is complex, with an estimated timeline of 2.5 to 3 years and initial costs ranging from $4 million to $8.9 million. Concerns were raised about the state’s ability to manage the system effectively, given past technology implementation issues (e.g., the Bridges child protection system). Additionally, some representatives worried about the potential loss of federal consumer protections, such as essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
- **Public Testimony and Vendor Role**: Constituents voiced opposition to the state-based exchange, citing concerns about consumer protections and the state’s track record with technology. Discussions also highlighted the role of private vendors like Deloitte and Optum in providing technology solutions, as well as the possibility of developing a homegrown exchange.

#### **COVID-19 Vaccine Incentives**
- **Legislation Details**: The bill would allow insurers to offer financial incentives (e.g., gift cards) to individuals who provide proof of full COVID-19 vaccination at enrollment. The goal is to reduce healthcare costs by encouraging vaccinations, which lower hospitalization rates.
- **Scope and Challenges**: The legislation is voluntary for insurers and applies only to the state-regulated full-risk insurance market (small and large group markets). Concerns were raised about verifying vaccination status, defining "fully vaccinated," and whether the bill is too late given high vaccination rates. Federal guidance on such incentives is unclear, necessitating state-level legislation.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Some representatives and constituents expressed ethical concerns about incentivizing vaccines, viewing it as coercive or exploitative. Personal stories of adverse vaccine reactions were shared, raising questions about safety and morality.

### **2. Insurance Regulation Updates**

Several Senate bills were discussed to modernize and clarify insurance regulations in New Hampshire:
- **Senate Bill 354**: Amends insurance licensing statutes, defining "good cause" for license non-issuance and clarifying licensing requirements for banks and businesses selling insurance.
- **Senate Bill 204**: Clarifies the definition of "covered claim" in the New Hampshire Insurance Guaranty Association Act, ensuring policies issued by non-members are not covered.
- **Senate Bill 205**: Modifies the Insurance Department’s administrative fund management, allowing overages to reduce future assessments across the board.
- **Senate Bill 206**: Removes prepaid legal contracts from Insurance Department regulation, as no complaints have been filed in over a decade.
- **Senate Bill 207**: Clarifies that a company’s cost of retaining an outside expert for annual statement reviews will be credited towards assessed administrative fees for the subsequent year.
- **Senate Bill 208**: Updates and modernizes RSA 408, which regulates life insurance, repealing outdated provisions and aligning with modern practices.

These bills generally received support from the insurance industry and committee members, with no significant opposition voiced.

### **3. Discount Medical Plan Organizations (DMPOs) and State-Based Health Benefit Exchange**

#### **Senate Bill 285: Discount Medical Plan Organizations**
- **Purpose**: Amends registration requirements for DMPOs, which offer health service discounts but are not insurance providers. The bill introduces minimum capital requirements ($150,000 net worth) and procedures for registration renewal, suspension, and revocation.
- **Concerns and Support**: Concerns were raised about the vague term "good character" in determining eligibility, with suggestions for specific criteria like background checks. The Insurance Department supports the bill, emphasizing the need for better oversight to prevent confusion between DMPOs and health insurance.

#### **Senate Bill 121: State-Based Health Benefit Exchange**
- **Purpose**: Explores alternatives to the federal health insurance marketplace, potentially saving money and gaining more control over New Hampshire’s health insurance market.
- **Discussion**: Currently, New Hampshire pays a 2.75% fee on premiums through the federal exchange, costing approximately $7.8 million annually. The bill would enable the Insurance Department to evaluate private, off-the-shelf solutions for a state-based exchange, potentially reducing costs by 40-50%. Savings could be used to lower premiums or fund reinsurance programs.
- **Concerns**: Representatives questioned how savings would be allocated and whether consumers would directly benefit. The bill is enabling legislation, requiring further approval before implementation.

### **4. Public Deposit Investment Pool (PDIP)**

#### **Overview and Study Committee**
- **PDIP Background**: Established in 1992, the PDIP manages approximately $235 million in short-term public funds for municipalities, schools, and other entities, prioritizing safety, liquidity, and competitive returns.
- **Senate Bill 272**: Proposes a study committee to review the PDIP’s oversight and operations, particularly the Banking Department’s role. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts of interest, as the Banking Department oversees both state-chartered banks and the PDIP, which invests funds outside the state.
- **Testimony**: Supporters of the study committee, including the New Hampshire Bankers Association, emphasized the need to explore whether the PDIP’s management could be improved or relocated to another entity. Critics questioned the fund’s low returns and suggested more aggressive investment strategies for long-term funds.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Local Control and Cost Savings**: Discussions emphasized the benefits of state-based health insurance exchanges and PDIP reforms in reducing costs and increasing local control.
2. **Regulation and Oversight**: Both the DMPO and health insurance exchange discussions highlighted the need for better regulation and oversight to protect consumers and ensure transparency.
3. **Ethical and Practical Concerns**: The debate over COVID-19 vaccine incentives and the PDIP’s investment strategies raised ethical questions and practical challenges, underscoring the complexity of these issues.
4. **Next Steps**: The committee considered the need for further investigation and refinement of the proposed legislation, with stakeholders expressing willingness to collaborate on addressing concerns.

The meeting concluded with no final decisions made, but the discussions laid the groundwork for future legislative action.
