The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 11, 2022, focused extensively on education-related legislation, particularly addressing **special education services**, **funding**, and **advocacy**, as well as **concurrent enrollment programs** and **charter school responsibilities**. The discussions centered on several key bills and amendments, highlighting the complexities of aligning state policies with federal mandates, addressing fiscal constraints, and ensuring equitable access to education for all students, especially those with disabilities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates from the meeting:

### **Special Education Services and Funding**
1. **Senate Bill 394 (SB 394)**:  
   - The bill proposes extending special education services for students with disabilities until the end of the school year in which they turn 21, rather than terminating services on their 21st birthday. This change aims to prevent abrupt cutoffs and allow students to complete their academic year.  
   - Concerns were raised about a federal court ruling (KL v. Rhode Island Board of Education) that mandates services through age 22, potentially requiring New Hampshire to extend services further. This could lead to significant financial implications, estimated at millions of dollars annually.  
   - Senator Jay Kahn suggested forming a **study commission** to examine the feasibility and costs of extending services through age 22, ensuring alignment with state and federal laws while addressing fiscal challenges.  
   - Testimonies from parents and school districts highlighted the difficulties in navigating special education services and the need for clear policies to support students and families.

2. **Special Education Funding Amendments**:  
   - Representative Rick Ladd proposed amendments to increase funding for special education, particularly for students with severe disabilities (e.g., autism, traumatic brain injury), by adjusting the **differentiated aid formula**. The amendments would add approximately $14 million to the budget.  
   - Rising costs of special education services, exacerbated by the pandemic, were emphasized, with Ladd arguing that current funding levels are insufficient to meet students’ needs.  

3. **Office of the Advocate for Special Education (SB 381)**:  
   - The bill proposes creating an independent **Office of the Advocate for Special Education** to address systemic issues, collect data, and ensure students receive appropriate services.  
   - Parents testified about challenges in accessing services, retaliation, and the burden of navigating complex systems. However, the **Office of the Child Advocate** opposed the bill, arguing it duplicates their existing responsibilities. They proposed amending the bill to integrate the special education advocate into their office, saving approximately $317,000.  
   - Discussions focused on the advocate’s role in improving the IEP process, reducing inefficiencies, and influencing systemic change.

### **Charter Schools and Special Education (SB 238)**
- **Senate Bill 238** requires charter schools to enter into **Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)** with resident school districts to clarify roles and responsibilities for providing special education services.  
- Concerns were raised about the ambiguity of the bill’s language, particularly whether MOUs should be **district-level agreements** or **per-student agreements**. Stakeholders emphasized that IEPs already address individual student needs, and MOUs should focus on district-level logistics, such as service provision and funding.  
- The **Department of Education** is expected to develop a guide to assist districts and charter schools in creating MOUs, addressing issues like reimbursement and collaboration.  
- Challenges include the administrative burden of managing MOUs for charter schools serving students from multiple districts and the state’s shortage of special education staff.

### **Concurrent Enrollment and Dual Enrollment Programs (SB 421)**
- **Senate Bill 421** addresses dual and concurrent enrollment programs, particularly for **career and technical education (CTE)** and **STEM courses**.  
- The bill proposes streamlining funding processes, allowing payments to be triggered at the start of a course rather than upon completion. It also aims to include students from **non-public schools** in these programs.  
- Representatives from the community college system highlighted the program’s success and the need for fairness and process improvements.  
- Discussions emphasized the importance of ensuring **homeschooled students** have access to early college courses and dual enrollment opportunities.

### **Education Funding and Accountability**
- **Grant Accountability**: Representative Ladd proposed amendments requiring districts to submit annual reports demonstrating progress in areas funded by grants, ensuring accountability and effective use of funds.  
- **Senate Bill 420**: Introduced by Senator Hennessey, the bill directs $14 million in funding to districts based on **poverty levels** and **access to resources**. Ladd’s amendments aimed to increase funding for special education across all districts, regardless of poverty levels, arguing that all students with disabilities deserve adequate support.  
- Representatives debated the balance between addressing poverty and ensuring equitable funding for special education, acknowledging the complexity of education funding and the need for further discussion.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing legal requirements, fiscal constraints, and the needs of students with disabilities. Key themes included the need for clarity in legislation, collaboration among stakeholders, and equitable funding for special education. The committee planned to continue discussions on proposed amendments and funding mechanisms during their next session, with a focus on improving education policies and ensuring all students have access to the resources they need.
