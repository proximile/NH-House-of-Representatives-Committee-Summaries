### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (04/11/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on April 11, 2022, focused on several critical issues related to special education, charter schools, and education funding. The discussions highlighted systemic challenges, proposed legislative solutions, and the need for improved support and accountability to ensure equitable and adequate education for all students, particularly those with disabilities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

#### **1. Independent Special Education Advocate (SB 381)**
The meeting opened with a passionate discussion on the need for an **independent special education advocate** to address systemic failures in New Hampshire’s special education system. Parents and advocates shared personal stories of navigating complex IEP (Individualized Education Program) and 504 plan processes, often requiring costly legal assistance to secure basic services. They highlighted systemic issues such as retaliation against families advocating for their children, poor academic outcomes for students with disabilities, and disproportionate challenges faced by low-income families, single parents, and families of color.

- **Proposed Solution**: **SB 381**, introduced by Senator John Reagan, calls for the establishment of an **Office of Advocate for Special Education** to provide independent oversight, streamline processes, and reduce the need for legal intervention. Advocates argued this would save money in the long term by preventing costly litigation and improving student outcomes.
- **Opposition**: The **Office of the Child Advocate** opposed the bill, suggesting it would create redundancy. Instead, they proposed expanding their office to include a special education advocate, which would save approximately $317,000. However, concerns were raised about their lack of expertise in special education law.
- **Committee Concerns**: Representatives questioned the advocate’s role, authority, and potential to become overwhelmed with complaints. The debate underscored the urgent need for reforms to ensure students with disabilities receive the support they are legally entitled to.

#### **2. Special Education Services in Charter Schools (SB 238)**
The committee discussed **SB 238**, which requires charter schools to enter into **Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs)** with resident school districts to clarify roles and responsibilities for providing special education services.

- **Purpose**: The bill aims to improve collaboration between charter schools and districts, ensuring timely and appropriate services for students with disabilities.
- **Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the feasibility of creating MOUs for charter schools serving students from multiple districts, as well as the timing of reviews before the school year starts. The **Department of Education** committed to developing a guide to help streamline the process.
- **Stakeholder Input**: Representatives from the **New Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators** supported the idea of MOUs but emphasized the need for clear guidelines and collaboration to address staffing shortages and service delivery.

#### **3. Age Limits for Special Education Services (SB 394 and HB 1513)**
The committee debated extending special education services beyond the current cutoff age of 21, particularly in light of a recent federal court ruling (**K.L. v. Rhode Island Board of Education**) that mandates states provide services until age 22 if significant public funding exists for adult education programs.

- **Proposed Changes**: **SB 394** and **HB 1513** propose allowing students to complete the school year in which they turn 21 or 22, respectively. Representative Glenn Cordelli suggested an amendment to extend services through the end of the semester in which a student turns 22.
- **Fiscal Impact**: Extending services to age 22 could cost the state between $3.3 million and $11 million annually, raising concerns about the financial burden on taxpayers and school budgets.
- **Policy Implications**: The committee discussed the need for smoother transitions to adult services and considered creating a study commission to explore the financial and policy implications of these changes.

#### **4. Education Funding and Special Education (SB 420)**
The committee reviewed **SB 420**, which addresses **adequate education grants** and **special education funding**. Representative Rick Ladd proposed amendments to increase funding for students with more severe disabilities, arguing that current funding levels are insufficient.

- **Differentiated Aid**: Ladd suggested adjusting the funding formula to provide more support for specific special education categories (e.g., autism, traumatic brain injury) that require additional resources.
- **Grant Accountability**: Amendments were proposed to require districts to demonstrate how grant funds are used to improve student achievement and growth.
- **Broader Policy Debate**: The committee discussed whether to prioritize funding for poverty-stricken districts or provide additional support for special education across all districts. Ladd emphasized that every student, regardless of their community’s wealth, deserves adequate support.

#### **5. Dual and Concurrent Enrollment for Career and Technical Education (SB 421)**
The committee also discussed **SB 421**, which expands **dual and concurrent enrollment programs** for career and technical education (CTE) students, including those in non-public schools.

- **Purpose**: The bill aims to broaden access to CTE opportunities by allowing non-public schools to develop policies for student participation.
- **Funding Mechanism**: Payments for dual enrollment programs would be triggered at the start of the course rather than upon completion, streamlining administrative processes.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about how non-public schools, including micro-schools without certified teachers, would meet program requirements. It was clarified that instructors must meet the same standards as community college adjunct faculty.

#### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
The meeting highlighted several overarching themes:
1. **Systemic Challenges in Special Education**: Parents, advocates, and legislators emphasized the need for systemic reforms to address inadequate services, legal barriers, and the emotional toll on families.
2. **Fiscal Impact**: Many discussions centered on the financial implications of proposed changes, particularly extending special education services and increasing funding for students with disabilities.
3. **Equity and Access**: Legislators sought to ensure equitable access to education and support for all students, regardless of their district’s wealth or their enrollment in charter or non-public schools.
4. **Collaboration and Accountability**: The importance of collaboration between charter schools and districts, as well as accountability in the use of grant funds, was a recurring theme.

The committee concluded by emphasizing the need for continued dialogue and refinement of legislative proposals to address these complex issues effectively.
