The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 6, 2022, covered a range of critical topics related to environmental protection, historical preservation, and resource management. The discussions were divided into three key segments:

### **1. Protection and Recognition of African-American Burial Grounds**
The first segment focused on a bill aimed at protecting and restoring African-American burial grounds from the era of enslavement. The discussion highlighted the historical context of these sites, including the stories of Ona Judge, an enslaved woman who escaped from George Washington’s household, and Samson Battis, an African-American Revolutionary War veteran. These narratives underscored the neglect and lack of control over burial sites for enslaved individuals. The bill seeks to ensure these sites are recognized, protected, and restored, with provisions for descendant community involvement, repatriation of remains, and respectful commemoration. Organizations like the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire would represent descendant communities in advising on appropriate rituals and markers. The bill draws parallels to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and emphasizes minimal financial impact while establishing penalties for violations. The broader historical significance of honoring African-American contributions to New Hampshire’s history, such as the story of Wentworth Cheswell, was also highlighted. The committee plans to execute the bill and other pending legislation on April 20, 2022.

### **2. Stormwater Utilities and Nitrogen Pollution Management (SB 257)**
The second segment centered on **SB 257**, a bill enabling municipalities to establish stormwater utilities to manage nitrogen pollution, particularly in the Great Bay watershed. The bill addresses EPA MS4 regulations requiring communities to reduce nitrogen levels in water bodies. Stormwater utilities would regulate and fund efforts to mitigate pollution from sources like stormwater runoff, septic systems, and fertilizers. The bill is enabling legislation, allowing municipalities to design tailored programs, including fee structures and incentives for septic system upgrades. Concerns were raised by the New Hampshire Association of Realtors about potential fees and mandates on private septic systems, while supporters, including representatives from Dover and the Department of Environmental Services (DES), emphasized the urgency of addressing nitrogen pollution to avoid EPA fines. The bill aligns with federal funding opportunities like the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) and promotes an adaptive management framework for improving water quality.

### **3. Stormwater Management Equity and Personal Watercraft Regulations (SB 305)**
The final segment addressed two main topics:  
   - **Stormwater Management and Equity**: The discussion focused on equitable funding for stormwater management through utilities, public-private partnerships, and property taxes. The goal is to base charges on contributions to stormwater contaminants rather than property value. Dover’s approach includes setting fees for property owners but offering credits for implementing best management practices like rain gardens. The committee emphasized the importance of septic systems in reducing contaminants and the need for flexibility and local control in addressing stormwater issues.  
   - **Personal Watercraft Regulations (SB 305)**: The bill seeks to revise restrictions on personal watercraft (e.g., jet skis) in sensitive estuaries and channels around Hampton Falls and Hampton Harbor. It aims to allow personal watercraft access at headway speed (slow speed) to balance environmental protection with recreational use. Testimonies highlighted concerns about environmental damage to marsh areas, while proponents argued for fair access, noting that boats are already permitted in these areas. The bill is seen as a compromise to protect fragile ecosystems while accommodating responsible recreational use.

### **Overall Summary**
The meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s efforts to address historical injustices through the protection of African-American burial grounds, manage environmental challenges like nitrogen pollution through stormwater utilities, and balance recreational use with the protection of sensitive coastal ecosystems. The discussions emphasized the importance of community involvement, equitable solutions, and proactive measures to achieve these goals.
