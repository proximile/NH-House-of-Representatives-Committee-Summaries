The transcript is from a New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III work session on April 13, 2022, focusing on **SP 412**, a bill related to Medicaid funding for nursing facilities. The key discussion points are:

1. **Medicaid Funding for Nursing Facilities**: Henry Lipman, Medicaid Director, explained that the budget includes a lump sum for nursing facility costs, but a 5% budget increase does not necessarily translate to a 5% rate increase for facilities due to factors like patient days, acuity, and facility costs. He noted that nursing facilities faced challenges due to decreased patient days during the COVID-19 pandemic and staffing shortages.

2. **Rate Adjustments**: Initially, the rate increase was 1.6%, but adjustments in October and January raised it to 5%. However, concerns were raised about sustaining this rate in FY 2023 if patient days increase.

3. **Legislative Intent**: The bill aims to ensure a 5% rate increase is maintained for FY 2022 and FY 2023. A $5 million contingency fund was proposed to address potential shortfalls in FY 2023, with unspent funds lapsing back to the general fund.

4. **Communication Issues**: Representative Robson expressed frustration about not being informed earlier about the funding challenges, emphasizing the need for better communication between the department and legislators.

5. **Support for the Bill**: Representatives and stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Healthcare Association, voiced support for the bill, acknowledging the financial pressures nursing facilities face due to the pandemic and rising labor costs.

6. **Other Bills**: The division also discussed support for **SP 422**, the Medicaid dental benefit bill, aligning it with existing legislation.

The session concluded with tentative agreement on supporting both bills, pending further discussion and voting.
