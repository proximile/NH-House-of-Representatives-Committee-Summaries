**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting – House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee (April 13, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Consumer Affairs convened on April 13, 2022, to discuss several key bills addressing consumer protection, health care, alcohol distribution, and online marketplace transparency. The meeting featured robust discussions on proposed legislation, with input from stakeholders, state agencies, and legislators. Below is a cohesive summary of the key segments:

---

### **1. Consumer Protection and Cruelty-Free Cosmetics (SB 202)**
**Senate Bill 202** aims to prohibit the sale of cosmetic products in New Hampshire that have been tested on animals. Introduced by Senator David Waters, the bill seeks to ensure that cosmetics sold in the state are cruelty-free. Key provisions include:
- **Definitions and Exceptions**: The bill allows exceptions when no non-animal testing alternatives exist for safety reasons and protects retailers from liability.
- **Support**: The Humane Society of the United States and WS Badger Company testified in favor of the bill, citing the growing demand for cruelty-free products and the availability of alternative testing methods.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about exemptions for foreign entities, enforcement mechanisms, and the feasibility of non-animal testing methods.

The bill received bipartisan support, with a commitment to refine its language for effective implementation.

### **2. Transparency in Online Marketplaces (SB 355)**
**Senate Bill 355** focuses on regulating high-volume third-party sellers on platforms like Amazon and Walmart to combat organized retail theft, counterfeit goods, and deceptive practices. Key elements include:
- **Seller Verification**: Online marketplaces must verify and disclose seller information (e.g., contact details) for high-volume sellers (200+ transactions or $5,000+ in annual sales).
- **Consumer Protection**: The bill aims to increase transparency and ensure consumers know who they are purchasing from.
- **Enforcement Challenges**: Discussions highlighted difficulties in prosecuting overseas sellers and the burden on law enforcement. The bill shifts some responsibility to platforms by requiring them to verify sellers.
- **Support**: The New Hampshire Retail Association, law enforcement, and Walmart expressed strong support, emphasizing its role in deterring theft and protecting consumers.
- **Exemptions**: Platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are exempt, as transactions occur directly between buyers and sellers.

The bill received widespread support, with 21 in favor and 2 opposed, and is seen as a critical step in addressing online retail theft and counterfeit goods.

### **3. Direct Shipment of Alcohol (SB 340)**
**Senate Bill 340** proposes increasing the allowable direct shipment volume of beer from 27 gallons to 50 gallons for both in-state and out-of-state shippers. Key points include:
- **Rationale**: Senator Gary Daniels introduced the bill to address a beer distributor nearing the current limit. The Liquor Commission supported the increase to 50 gallons.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Beer Distributors opposed the bill, arguing it unfairly singles out beer while excluding wine and spirits, potentially disrupting the three-tier alcohol distribution system.
- **Fairness Concerns**: Committee members questioned whether the limit should be increased for all alcohol types, not just beer. The Liquor Commission’s role in the decision-making process was also discussed.

The public hearing concluded with three supporters, one neutral party, and one opponent. The committee planned to address unresolved issues in subcommittee meetings.

### **4. Health Insurance and Balanced Billing**
The discussion focused on health insurance costs, balanced billing, and consumer protection. Key topics included:
- **Associated Health Plans**: The potential for groups like real estate agents to form associated health plans to reduce costs was explored, alongside concerns about adverse selection destabilizing the insurance market.
- **Balanced Billing**: The No Surprises Act, which protects consumers from unexpected medical bills, was compared to New Hampshire’s balanced billing law. The Insurance Department proposed amendments to align state and federal regulations.
- **Dispute Resolution**: The role of the Insurance Department in resolving disputes between providers and insurers was debated, with concerns raised about the lack of state-level experience with the federal independent dispute resolution process.
- **Pilot Program**: A pilot program to reduce health care costs for Granite Staters was proposed, with the Hospital Association supporting the amended bill.

The meeting emphasized the need to align state and federal laws, protect consumers, and explore innovative solutions to reduce health care costs.

### **5. Condo/Homeowner Associations and Health Plan Pilot (SB 324 & SB 286)**
**Senate Bill 324** addresses disputes within condominium and homeowner associations by requiring internal dispute resolution boards. Key points include:
- **Purpose**: The bill mandates that associations handle disputes internally, without creating a state-run board.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about board composition, fairness, and protections against retaliation for residents who file complaints.

**Senate Bill 286** proposes a pilot program for association health plans, allowing small businesses and self-employed individuals to pool together to reduce health insurance costs. Key details include:
- **Scope**: The pilot would include up to 1,000 participants and be overseen by the Department of Insurance.
- **Rationale**: The high cost of health insurance in New Hampshire is a burden on families and businesses. The bill seeks to introduce innovation and competition into the market.
- **Implementation**: The pilot would expire in 2025, with the option for future legislators to extend or expand it.

Both bills aim to address persistent issues—disputes in associations and high health insurance costs—through innovative, locally controlled solutions.
