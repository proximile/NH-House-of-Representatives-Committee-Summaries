The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on April 27, 2022, addressed several key bills and amendments, with discussions focusing on consumer protection, public safety, and industry concerns. Here is a comprehensive summary of the proceedings:

### **Senate Bill 202 (Prohibiting Sale of Cosmetic Products Tested on Animals)**
The committee debated two amendments to this bill. The first amendment, which replaced the entire original bill, was criticized for being overly broad and potentially having unintended consequences, particularly for essential products like pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and food additives that require animal testing. Despite concerns, this amendment passed with a narrow 10-9 vote. A second amendment (1656h) aimed to expand the ban to all products tested on animals, not just cosmetics. However, this motion failed with a 7-5 vote, as members raised concerns about the broader impact and potential risks to essential industries.

### **Senate Bill 355 (Requiring Online Marketplaces to Disclose Information to Consumers)**
This bill sought to address issues with online marketplaces, such as the sale of counterfeit or stolen goods. While some representatives argued for immediate action to protect consumers and retailers, others supported an interim study to further examine the issue. The committee ultimately voted 10-9 in favor of an interim study, delaying immediate legislation.

### **Senate Bill 319 (Relative to Vaccine Status and Wellness Incentives)**
The committee reconsidered this bill, which would allow health carriers to offer incentives for vaccinations. Supporters viewed it as an enabling measure to promote public health, while opponents feared it could lead to unintended consequences, such as penalizing those who decline incentives. The committee voted 11-8 to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, effectively halting its progress.

### **Senate Bill 340 (Consumer Shipment of Alcohol)**
This bill initially proposed removing limits on direct-to-consumer alcohol delivery, allowing manufacturers to deliver any amount to consumers. Concerns were raised about public safety, underage drinking, and potential loopholes. The Liquor Enforcement Division testified that they found no immediate safety issues but acknowledged the complexity of the matter. An amendment to address these concerns was ultimately withdrawn due to procedural issues, and the committee unanimously voted 19-0 to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate. The bill was recommended for interim study.

### **Procedural Discussions**
Throughout the meeting, the committee navigated procedural complexities, including reconsideration of motions and corrections to amendments. There was debate over whether to hold public hearings on the amendments, with some members emphasizing the need for further due diligence. Confusion arose regarding the status of certain bills and amendments, leading to discussions about whether to proceed with interim studies or reconsider previous motions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee's efforts to balance consumer protection, public safety, and industry concerns while addressing complex legislative issues. Key decisions included advancing an amendment to Senate Bill 202, recommending interim studies for Senate Bills 355 and 340, and deeming Senate Bill 319 inexpedient to legislate. The committee also planned a luncheon following the session.
