### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (April 14, 2022)

The meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on April 14, 2022, focused on several key legislative issues, including tax policies, gaming regulations, and the distribution of room occupancy tax revenues. The discussions highlighted themes of local versus state control, the impact on small businesses, and revenue stabilization. Below is a cohesive summary of the key segments:

---

### **Tax Policy Discussions**
1. **Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**:
   - **Threshold Changes**: The committee discussed the impact of raising the BPT and BET thresholds, which has exempted thousands of smaller businesses (with profits below $100,000) from paying these taxes.
   - **Conformity with Federal Tax Code**: Concerns were raised about the complexities of aligning with the federal Internal Revenue Code, particularly the potential for creating different tax treatments for businesses based on arbitrary thresholds. Some members suggested maintaining conformity with the old code might simplify the process.
   - **Revenue Implications**: The committee noted that not conforming to the federal 85% rule would result in a $4.5 million revenue loss in the first year, while removing double apportionment would lead to an $18 million decrease in revenue.

2. **Senate Bill 435: Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryover**:
   - The bill aligns New Hampshireâ€™s NOL rules with federal guidelines, capping NOL deductions at 80% of taxable income and extending the carryover period to 10 years.
   - **Debate**: Concerns were raised about the impact on small businesses, which may struggle with the 80% cap during recovery periods. Suggestions were made to create exemptions or tiers for small businesses, but no amendments were proposed during the meeting.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was supported as written, with some members expressing interest in future amendments to protect small businesses. The committee voted 21-1 to pass the bill, with Representative Schomburg voting against it and planning to submit a minority report.

### **Gaming Regulations**
1. **Senate Bill 318: Extending Hours for Games of Chance**:
   - The bill proposes extending the hours for games of chance, allowing operations from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m., with the possibility of extending to 4 a.m. after a public hearing and local governing body approval.
   - **Key Amendments**:
     - **Amendment 1494** (Rep. Elmi): Focused on flexibility for municipalities to manage hours, especially in winter, to avoid parking and snowplowing issues.
     - **Amendment 1513** (Rep. Brownie/Rep. Ames): Clarified that municipalities retain authority to regulate hours, addressing concerns about state overreach.
   - **Debate**: Concerns were raised about municipalities losing authority to regulate hours, particularly in residential areas. Supporters argued the bill provides flexibility for businesses while allowing local control.
   - **Outcome**: Amendment 1513 failed (12-10), but the bill itself passed (14-8) and will move to the regular calendar.

### **Room Occupancy Tax Revenues**
1. **Senate Bill 343: Study Committee on Room Occupancy Tax Revenues**:
   - The bill proposed a study committee to examine room occupancy tax revenues and their distribution to municipalities.
   - **Debate**: Opponents argued the bill opens the door to reallocating state taxes, which should remain state-controlled. Supporters felt the study was necessary to address inequities in tax distribution, especially for municipalities with high tourism.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** the bill (17-5).

### **Key Themes**
1. **Local vs. State Control**: Debates centered on whether municipalities should retain authority over regulations like gaming hours and tax revenues.
2. **Small Business Concerns**: Several representatives emphasized the need to protect small businesses, particularly in the context of NOL carryover rules and tax thresholds.
3. **Revenue Stabilization**: Proponents of SB 435 highlighted its role in stabilizing state revenue during economic downturns.

### **Process and Next Steps**
- **Straw Poll and Amendments**: The committee considered conducting a straw poll to gauge readiness for decision-making and discussed the possibility of proposing amendments. A meeting was scheduled for April 27th to further address potential amendments.
- **Reflections on the Process**: Representative Tucker expressed appreciation for the collaborative process, noting that the diverse talents and experiences of committee members, along with input from knowledgeable witnesses and the Division of Revenue Administration (DRA), helped in reaching informed decisions.

The meeting concluded with no further sessions scheduled for the following week, and Representative Schomburg was tasked with finalizing the minority report on SB 435.
