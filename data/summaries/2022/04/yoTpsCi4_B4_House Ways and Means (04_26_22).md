**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (April 26, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on April 26, 2022, to discuss several key bills, focusing on transparency, fee authority, and solid waste management. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting:

### **Senate Bill 379 (SB 379)**
- **Purpose**: The bill re-establishes the Solid Waste Management Fund to support municipalities in managing solid waste, particularly recycling and landfill capacity. It removes an outdated surcharge on out-of-state waste, which was deemed unenforceable under the Interstate Commerce Clause.
- **Discussion**:
  - The fund is designed to accept federal money for grants to municipalities facing waste management challenges.
  - Concerns were raised about transparency and accountability in how funds are received and spent. Representative Uhler emphasized the need for clear reporting requirements.
  - The committee noted that the bill does not involve state appropriations and is intended to leverage federal funds.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (16-0) to recommend the bill "ought to pass" without amendments, recognizing the urgent need for solid waste management solutions in the state.

### **House Bill 1097 (HB 1097)**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses the taxation of New Hampshire residents working remotely for out-of-state employers.
- **Discussion**:
  - The Senate Ways and Means Committee requested changes to remove references to specific tax sections (BPT and BET) to avoid confusion. The revised language focuses on employer-employee income.
  - The committee discussed the proposed amendments and agreed to revisit the bill after the Senate’s vote for further review.
- **Next Steps**: The committee plans to schedule a meeting with Representative Major in early May to discuss revenue estimates and finalize their decision on concurrence.

### **Senate Bill 313 (SB 313)**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses the authority of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to set fees for various professional boards. It aims to clean up statutory language to resolve conflicts between the OPLC's fee-setting authority and the fees set by individual boards.
- **Discussion**:
  - Representative Carol McGuire, Chair of the House Executive Departments and Administration (EDNA) Committee, explained that the bill removes outdated fee references and aligns statutes with the OPLC’s authority.
  - The committee discussed the need to ensure that fees cover operational costs and are consistent across boards. Some boards, like accountancy, are well-managed, while others struggle to cover costs.
  - Representative Almy proposed an amendment to further clarify fee authority for additional boards not addressed in the original bill.
- **Outcome**: The committee unanimously approved SB 313 with the amendment, ensuring clarity and consistency in fee-setting authority.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Transparency and Accountability**: Both SB 379 and SB 313 emphasized the importance of clear reporting and oversight to ensure funds and fees are managed appropriately.
2. **Fee Authority and Oversight**: SB 313 focused on streamlining fee-setting authority under the OPLC, ensuring financial sustainability across professional boards.
3. **Solid Waste Management**: SB 379 addressed the state’s solid waste crisis by re-establishing a fund to support municipalities, leveraging federal funding to tackle waste management challenges.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the committee voting to pass both SB 379 and SB 313, with the latter including an amendment for additional clarity. The committee also agreed to revisit HB 1097 after the Senate’s vote and to schedule a meeting with Representative Major to discuss revenue estimates in early May. Members prepared for upcoming sessions with no further business discussed.
