The NH House of Representatives meeting on April 13, 2022, addressed several critical issues, including funding for nursing homes, disaster relief for municipalities, and broadband expansion. The discussions centered on legislative bills aimed at addressing immediate and long-term challenges in these areas, with a focus on financial support, infrastructure development, and ensuring equitable access to resources.

### Nursing Home Funding Crisis
The meeting highlighted the severe financial and staffing challenges facing nursing homes in New Hampshire, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Key points included:
- **Financial and Staffing Crisis**: Nursing homes are grappling with rising costs of utilities, food, supplies, and pandemic-related expenses, leading to significant financial losses. Facilities like Golden View Healthcare Center have had to close units, forcing patients to seek care out of state.
- **Retroactive 5% Rate Increase**: A retroactive 5% reimbursement rate increase, initially included in the budget but not implemented, was crucial for nursing homes that had budgeted based on this expectation. Without it, facilities incurred substantial losses, such as $138,000 in the first quarter for Golden View.
- **Reimbursement Issues**: Nursing homes are reimbursed based on 2018-2019 costs, not current expenses, resulting in a 45% funding shortfall when accounting for increased costs and budget neutrality factors.
- **Community Impact**: Closures and reduced capacity at nursing homes have broader implications for healthcare, community programs, education, and local economies.
- **Legislative Oversight**: Representatives sought clarity on why the 5% increase was not implemented and requested detailed explanations to prevent future bureaucratic oversights.
- **Future Needs**: While the 5% increase is a start, long-term solutions are needed, including competitive wages to retain staff and additional funding to stabilize the industry. Industry leaders, including Brendan Williams of the NH Healthcare Association, emphasized the urgency of addressing these issues to prevent further closures.

### Disaster Relief Funding
The meeting also addressed two bills aimed at providing financial assistance to municipalities affected by natural disasters:
- **Senate Bill 409 (Ready Loan Provision)**: Establishes a zero-interest loan program for towns to address immediate emergency needs while awaiting FEMA reimbursement. Towns must repay the loan once FEMA funds are received.
- **Senate Bill 402 (Grant Provision)**: Provides grants to cover the 10% non-FEMA share of disaster recovery costs, with no repayment required. The bill includes retroactive funding to July 1, 2021, to support towns affected by disasters in 2021.
- **Key Concerns**: Legislators raised concerns about potential duplication of benefits with FEMA, but it was clarified that the grant would only cover costs not reimbursed by FEMA. SB 402 is designed for long-term recovery needs, while SB 409 provides immediate relief.

### Broadband Expansion
The meeting also discussed Senate Bill 445, which aims to expand broadband access in underserved areas:
- **Broadband Matching Grant Initiative**: The bill makes technical changes to Senate Bill 85, passed in 2021, to expand broadband access using federal ARPA funds. The match ratio was adjusted from 50-50 to 75-25 to support more projects, especially in underserved communities.
- **Funding Allocation**: The bill allocates $122 million from federal funds for broadband expansion, with potential for an additional $100 million. It includes provisions for the Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA) to use funds for other purposes if they align with federal rules.
- **Discussion and Support**: Representatives raised concerns about the "make ready" process, the challenge process, and infrastructure ownership post-construction. Industry stakeholders, including Chris Hodgdon from Comcast and Michael Lacata from the NH Electric Co-op, supported the bill, emphasizing the need to focus on unserved areas and the high costs of rural broadband projects.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the importance of addressing critical issues in healthcare, disaster recovery, and infrastructure development. Key legislative efforts included:
- Providing retroactive funding to nursing homes to mitigate financial losses and stabilize the industry.
- Establishing loan and grant programs to support municipalities affected by natural disasters, ensuring timely and equitable recovery.
- Expanding broadband access in underserved areas, leveraging federal funds to improve connectivity for remote work, education, and community services.

The discussions highlighted the need for continued collaboration between state and federal entities, as well as the importance of clear legislative oversight to ensure promised funding is delivered effectively.
