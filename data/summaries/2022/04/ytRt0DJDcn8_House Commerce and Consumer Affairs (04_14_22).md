**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (04/14/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 14, 2022, focused on a wide range of issues related to commerce and consumer affairs, with discussions on online marketplaces, health insurance, consumer protection, ethical concerns, and regulatory frameworks. Key highlights from the meeting include:

### **Online Marketplaces and Consumer Protection**
1. **Private Sellers vs. Third-Party Sellers**:  
   Representatives debated whether new regulations should apply to private sellers on platforms like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. Concerns were raised about distinguishing between private sales and high-volume third-party sellers, particularly regarding the sale of new versus used merchandise.

2. **Organized Crime and Stolen Goods**:  
   The committee discussed the need for laws to prevent organized crime from selling stolen goods, such as ATVs and chainsaws, through online marketplaces. The focus was on closing legal loopholes that allow criminals to exploit these platforms.

3. **Consumer Protection and Fraud Prevention**:  
   A bill requiring online marketplaces to disclose certain information to consumers was discussed. Supporters argued it would protect consumers from fraud, especially from overseas third-party sellers (e.g., China), while opponents believed existing laws and market practices already addressed the issue. The NH Police Association testified in support of the bill.

### **Health Insurance and Healthcare Services**
1. **Health Insurance Pilot Program**:  
   The committee voted against a proposed health insurance pilot program, citing concerns about potential adverse selection and lack of cost savings. Federal preemption was also noted as a barrier to implementing effective cost-lowering measures.

2. **Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements (MEWAs)**:  
   Discussions included the feasibility of MEWAs and purchasing alliances for health insurance. Concerns were raised about the need for critical mass to manage insurance risks and the costs of starting such programs.

3. **Mental Health Parity**:  
   Senate Bill 373, addressing mental health parity and compliance with federal guidelines, was discussed as part of broader efforts to improve healthcare access and equity.

4. **Balanced Billing**:  
   A motion was made to conduct an interim study on balanced billing in healthcare services, pending clarity on federal regulations and ongoing legal cases.

### **Ethical Concerns and Industry Practices**
1. **Cosmetic Testing on Animals**:  
   The committee debated a bill prohibiting the sale of cosmetic products tested on animals. Supporters emphasized ethical concerns and historical industry practices, while opponents argued the market had already addressed the issue. Concerns were also raised about exemptions and whether the bill unfairly targeted one industry.

### **Alcohol Distribution and Sales**
1. **Direct-to-Consumer Alcohol Shipments**:  
   A bill allowing direct shipment of beer to New Hampshire residents was debated. Concerns were raised about fairness, the three-tier alcohol distribution system, and the potential impact on state revenue. The bill was ultimately rejected.

2. **Liquor Manufacturers at Farmers’ Markets**:  
   Discussions also included a bill allowing liquor manufacturers to sell products at farmers’ markets. Questions were raised about consistency with other legislation and the impact on the three-tier alcohol distribution system.

### **Manufactured Housing Parks**
1. **Resident Protections**:  
   The committee discussed a bill related to the sale of manufactured housing parks, focusing on protections for residents and the role of lenders. Concerns were raised about potential retribution against residents who oppose certain decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans for potential subcommittee work and scheduling for future sessions. The discussions highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing consumer protection, ethical considerations, and regulatory frameworks while addressing emerging challenges in commerce and healthcare.
