### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (05/18/2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a Committee of Conference meeting on May 18, 2022, to discuss and reconcile differences on several key bills, including **HB 1106**, **HB 1221**, **HB 355**, **HB 1256**, **HB 1293**, and **HB 1397**. The discussions spanned a range of issues, from environmental contamination and housing regulations to tax policy and emergency services funding. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **HB 1293: PFAS Fund, Septic Systems, and Cluster Development**
- **PFAS Fund Allocation**: The committee discussed a $25 million allocation to the PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) fund to address contamination in private wells and municipalities. The Senate added amendments to clarify the fund's use, particularly for communities like Merrimack heavily affected by PFAS. The funding was secured by the Senate President and is expected to be reimbursed through lawsuits against companies like 3M.
- **Septic System and Well Regulations**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) highlighted procedural issues with septic system and well applications, advocating for more time to request additional information without outright denials. This was particularly urgent given the housing crisis and the need to avoid delays in housing permits.
- **Cluster Development**: Representative Power raised concerns about the inadvertent removal of cluster development provisions from the statute. DES acknowledged the oversight and worked to reinstate the language.
- **Amendments and Process Frustrations**: Multiple amendments, including **Amendment 1825 S** and **Amendment 2004 H**, were discussed to address technical issues and clarify language. However, there was significant confusion and frustration among legislators about the rushed process, lack of proper vetting, and unclear amendments. Some advocated for a recess to allow for further review.

---

### **HB 1106: Commission on Demographic Trends**
- **Background**: The Commission on Demographic Trends, established in 2018, was inadvertently removed in **HB2** (2021) despite still being active. The Senate representative apologized for the oversight and sought to reinstate the commission.
- **Role of the Commission**: The commission analyzes demographic trends, migration goals, and long-term state planning, particularly around budget impacts and population changes.
- **Outcome**: The House agreed to reinstate the commission, acknowledging the error in **HB2**.

---

### **HB 1221: Business Profits Tax Reduction and Municipal Aid**
- **Proposal**: The bill proposed reducing the Business Profits Tax (BPT) from 7.6% to 7.5% and included a one-time $28 million payment to cities and towns for retirement costs to help property taxpayers.
- **Debate**: There was discussion over whether the funds would directly reduce taxes or be used for other purposes. The committee ultimately concurred with the Senate’s position, supporting the tax reduction and the one-time municipal aid.

---

### **HB 355: Keno Screen Displays**
- **Proposal**: The bill aimed to allow businesses with lottery licenses to display Keno screens, expanding beyond bars and restaurants.
- **Concerns**: The House opposed allowing screens in grocery stores and convenience stores, citing concerns about aesthetic impact and creating "mini casinos."
- **Outcome**: The Senate proposed a compromise to allow one screen per business, but the House rejected this. The Senate ultimately acceded to the House’s position, agreeing to revisit the issue in the next session.

---

### **HB 1256: Medicaid Reimbursement Rates for Ambulance Services**
- **Background**: New Hampshire’s Medicaid reimbursement rates for ambulance services are the lowest in New England at 38% of Medicare rates, compared to 100% in Maine and 74% in Vermont.
- **Proposal**: The committee debated increasing reimbursement rates to 50% of Medicare, requiring $2.3 million in state and federal funds. A 15% increase ($887,000 total) was proposed as a step toward this goal.
- **Concerns**: Some members questioned whether the funding would be sufficient and whether the state has the authority to raise rates in a committee of conference. There was agreement that more comprehensive solutions would be needed in future budget cycles.
- **Outcome**: The committee supported the Senate’s amendments to increase reimbursement rates, acknowledging the crisis in emergency medical services.

---

### **Gunstock Mountain Resort Amendment**
- **Context**: An amendment was proposed to change the governance of Gunstock Mountain Resort, transitioning from appointed commissioners to elected ones. This followed controversy over the current commission’s actions, which were seen as politically motivated and detrimental to the resort’s operations.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the current system was failing, citing a $9 million surplus under the previous management team, which was dismantled. Over 3,600 petition signatures supported the change.
- **Opposition**: Some members questioned the amendment’s germaneness to the bill and argued it should go through the standard legislative process.
- **Outcome**: The committee remained divided on the amendment, with plans to revisit the issue.

### **General Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Crisis Management**: Discussions highlighted reactive measures to address emerging crises, such as PFAS contamination, housing permit delays, and workforce shortages in emergency services.
2. **Budgetary Oversight**: There was frustration over the lack of proactive planning in addressing long-standing issues, such as Medicaid reimbursement rates and demographic trends.
3. **Compromise and Future Planning**: The committee emphasized the need for future budget cycles to address these issues systematically rather than relying on last-minute amendments.
4. **Process Concerns**: Several members expressed concerns about amendments being added without proper hearings or being non-germane to the original bills.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of reconciling differences between the House and Senate on key legislative issues. While agreements were reached on some bills, such as reinstating the Commission on Demographic Trends and increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for ambulance services, other issues, like the Gunstock amendment and Keno screen displays, remained contentious. The committee acknowledged the need for more thorough review and planning in future sessions to address ongoing challenges effectively.
