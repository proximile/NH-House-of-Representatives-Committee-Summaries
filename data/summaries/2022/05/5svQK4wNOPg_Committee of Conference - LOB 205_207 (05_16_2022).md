The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on May 16, 2022, focused on several key bills: **HB 1099**, **HB 103**, **HB 1439**, and **HB 1662**. The discussions revolved around amendments, procedural issues, and the practical implementation of these bills, particularly in areas of housing, healthcare, and employment practices.

### **HB 1662: Homelessness and Housing Assistance**
1. **Purpose and Funding**:
   - The bill aims to address homelessness and housing insecurity by appropriating $5 million to towns and cities. This funding is a response to reduced homelessness program funding in the biennial budget and the end of ARPA rent subsidies.
   - Funds will be distributed statewide based on Medicaid enrollments by town, ensuring all 234 towns receive support. Local governments have flexibility to use the funds for rent subsidies, shelter payments, or other housing-related assistance.

2. **Key Debates and Concerns**:
   - **At-Risk Definition**: There was debate over the inclusion of the term "at-risk" in the bill, with concerns about its vagueness and potential for broad interpretation. The House ultimately voted against this amendment due to procedural issues and the need for further policy review.
   - **Use It or Lose It**: Concerns were raised about funds lapsing if not spent by June 30, 2023. Suggestions included adding reporting requirements to track usage.
   - **Procedural Issues**: Some representatives expressed discomfort with attaching large appropriations outside the regular budget process.

3. **Support and Next Steps**:
   - The bill received bipartisan support in the Senate, passing unanimously. Proponents emphasized its necessity in addressing rising homelessness post-COVID-19.
   - The committee agreed to move forward, with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) providing guidance to towns for implementation.

### **HB 1099: Medical Freedom and Supplemental Nutrition**
1. **Medical Freedom**:
   - The bill prohibits requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for receiving DHHS benefits or services. Debate centered on whether this provision was redundant, given similar measures in other legislation.

2. **Supplemental Nutrition Program**:
   - The committee discussed funding for a farmers' market nutrition program, with proposals ranging from $10,000 to $300,000. The Senate proposed $100,000, while some representatives advocated for $30,000, citing administrative feasibility.
   - The committee decided to reconvene to finalize funding decisions.

### **HB 103: Medicaid Dental Benefits**
- The bill establishes a dental benefit under the state Medicaid program. The House delegation accepted the Senate’s position, and the committee unanimously agreed to concur with the Senate’s version.

### **HB 1439: Healthcare Facility Visitation Policies**
1. **Key Provisions**:
   - The bill aims to ensure patients are not left alone and that visitation policies are clearly communicated.
   - Discussions included moving provisions into the patient bill of rights rather than licensing statutes and adding the phrase "No Patient Left Alone" to the bill.

2. **Debates and Concerns**:
   - Some senators suggested alternative wording, such as "No Patient Without Their Loved Ones."
   - There was debate over requiring hospitals to provide written visitation policies upon request, with concerns about the burden on healthcare workers. Suggestions included using existing patient information packets instead.

### **HB 1662: Association Health Plans (Pilot Program)**
- The bill proposed a pilot program for association health plans, which was previously voted down by the commerce committee due to concerns about adverse selection and economic viability.
- While the Senate supported the pilot program, the House remained skeptical, citing lack of interest from insurance companies and the impracticality of a small-scale program.

### **Other Discussions**
1. **Electronic Wage Payments**:
   - A proposal to allow employers to pay wages via direct deposit or payroll cards was discussed. Supporters argued it modernizes wage payments, while critics expressed concerns about complexity and the burden on businesses, particularly regarding the 24-hour replacement requirement for lost or damaged cards.
   - The House favored sending the bill to interim study for simplification and further review.

2. **Third-Party Seller Information**:
   - A proposal requiring third-party sellers to provide certain information to online marketplaces was briefly discussed. The House delegation voted to remove this item from the bill, though the rationale was not detailed.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted tensions between modernizing policies and ensuring they are practical and not overly burdensome for businesses and local governments. Key themes included:
- **Procedural Adherence**: Significant debate occurred over whether new amendments could be introduced in the committee of conference.
- **Local Flexibility**: Many bills emphasized local control, allowing towns and healthcare facilities to tailor solutions to their specific needs.
- **Policy Simplification**: The House stressed the importance of clear, simplified legislation, particularly in areas like wage payments and healthcare documentation.

The committee planned to reconvene to finalize unresolved issues, particularly funding decisions and wording for healthcare visitation policies.
