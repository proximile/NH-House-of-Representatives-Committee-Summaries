The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference met on May 16, 2022, to discuss **House Bill 1547** and **House Bill 1661**. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **House Bill 1547**: The committee agreed to accede to the Senate's amendment, which included a $25 million appropriation. The House Finance Committee had reviewed the funding and found it appropriate. A minor typographical error (Section 2 instead of Section 2A) was noted but could be resolved during the enrolled bill process. The prime sponsor, Representative Mooney, expressed satisfaction with the Senate amendment. The committee concluded without the need for a formal vote.

2. **House Bill 1661**: The committee discussed several amendments and unresolved issues, particularly concerning **SB 400** and **SB 430**:
   - **SB 400**: Concerns were raised about sections 83, 92, and 93, which involve municipal authority over residential developments and workforce housing. The House opposed bypassing local voter or governing body approval. The committee agreed to work on revised language to address these concerns, ensuring local control and voter approval.
   - **SB 430**: The House and Senate were at odds over **Amendment 1044**, which the Senate had previously non-concurred with due to concerns about its impact on critical access hospitals. The House clarified that they were unwilling to discuss SB 430 without Amendment 1044, effectively removing it from consideration. The committee recessed to allow time for further discussion and resolution of these issues.

The meeting was recessed and scheduled to reconvene at 9:30 AM on Wednesday to finalize the language and resolve outstanding disagreements.
