The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference discussing **House Bill 1547** and **HB 1661**. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **House Bill 1547**:  
   - The committee opened discussions on HB 1547, which included a $25 million appropriation added by the Senate.  
   - The House Finance Committee reviewed the funding and found it appropriate.  
   - The committee agreed to accept the Senate’s amendments without objections.  

2. **House Bill 1661**:  
   - The committee focused on **SB 400** and **SB 430**, which were part of HB 1661.  
   - **SB 400**: Discussions centered on amendments related to residential developments and workforce housing. Concerns were raised about municipalities bypassing voter approval for housing projects. The Municipal Association was consulted to draft language ensuring voter or governing body approval for such projects.  
   - **SB 430**: The Senate had non-concurred with an amendment (1044) added by the House, which the Senate found problematic, particularly for critical access hospitals. The House clarified that SB 430, including the non-concurred amendment, was no longer part of the discussion.  

3. **Key Concerns**:  
   - The House emphasized the importance of local control and voter approval for housing developments.  
   - The Senate insisted on retaining certain sections (83, 92, 93) of SB 400, while the House sought modifications to ensure voter input.  

4. **Outcome**:  
   - The committee recessed to allow time for the Municipal Association to draft revised language for SB 400.  
   - They planned to reconvene at 9:30 AM on Wednesday to finalize the discussion and reach an agreement.  

Overall, the meeting highlighted disagreements over local control and funding for housing projects, with both sides working to find common ground.
