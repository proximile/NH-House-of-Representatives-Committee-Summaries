The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on May 18, 2022, focused on **HB 1661**, addressing several key amendments and sections of the bill. The discussion centered around three main areas: **sections 83, 92, and 93**, which involved **housing, economic development, and voter participation** in municipal decisions. Key points of debate included:

1. **Section 83**: The committee debated whether to use "shall allow" or "may permit" in language related to workforce housing incentives for municipalities. Representative Turcotte argued for "may permit" to avoid mandating municipalities, while Senator Bradley's amendment proposed "shall allow." A potential compromise included adding a **sunset clause** to review the policy's effectiveness after five years.

2. **Sections 92 and 93**: These sections addressed **economic development districts** and **voter approval** for financing. While Senator Bradley's amendment and Representative Turcotte's proposal had slightly different language, both aimed to ensure voter participation in municipal decisions. The committee agreed that both amendments effectively achieved the same intent.

3. **HB 430**: This bill, which included provisions for **nursing incentives at Glencliff Home** and **kinship care homes**, was a point of contention. The committee decided **not to include HB 430** in HB 1661 due to concerns about adding too many provisions to the bill, which could jeopardize its passage.

The meeting ended with the committee agreeing to **reconvene the next morning** to finalize decisions on the remaining sections. The primary goal was to ensure HB 1661, which focuses on **career and technical education (CTE) programs** and **economic development**, could move forward without being weighed down by additional provisions.
