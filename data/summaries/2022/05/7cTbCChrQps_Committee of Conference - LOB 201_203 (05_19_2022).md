The transcript captures a Committee of Conference meeting in the New Hampshire House of Representatives focused on reconciling differences between the House and Senate versions of **HB 1299** and **HB 1476**. Here’s a summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **HB 1299**  
The committee discussed an amendment aligning the appeals process for Fish and Game decisions with existing procedures. The amendment ensures that appeals go from the chief to the executive director. Senator Avard confirmed the Senate's agreement to the amendment, and the committee adopted it without further debate.

### **HB 1476**  
The bulk of the meeting centered on **HB 1476**, which addresses pretrial detention and bail conditions for repeat offenders. Key points include:  
1. **House Position**: Focused on repeat offenders, particularly for Class B misdemeanors, and proposed stricter detention rules for individuals arrested multiple times while on bail.  
2. **Senate Position**: Emphasized violent crimes and sought to ensure that individuals charged with serious offenses are brought before a judge rather than a bail commissioner.  
3. **Compromise**: After lengthy debate, the committee agreed to merge the two positions:  
   - Retain the Senate’s focus on violent crimes.  
   - Modify the House’s language to include Class B misdemeanors for individuals with two prior misdemeanor or felony charges, ensuring they are detained for up to 24 hours pending a judge’s hearing.  
   - Remove language restricting personal recognizance (PR) bail to comply with constitutional requirements.  
4. **Final Agreement**: The compromise amendment was drafted and approved, with both sides agreeing to the changes.
