The transcript captures a Committee of Conference meeting in the New Hampshire House of Representatives focused on **House Bill 1299** and **House Bill 1476**. The key discussions and outcomes are as follows:

### **House Bill 1299**:
- The committee discussed an amendment to align the appeal process for Fish and Game decisions with existing procedures. The amendment specifies that appeals of decisions made by the chief of wildlife go to the executive director. 
- Senator Avard and the Senate members accepted the amendment, and the House agreed to the Senate's position. The meeting concluded with mutual agreement.

### **House Bill 1476**:
- The committee debated amendments to address **repeat offenders** and **violent crimes**, particularly concerning bail and pretrial detention. The House and Senate positions differed on how to handle repeat offenses and the conditions for detaining individuals pending a hearing.
- The House version focused on **Class B misdemeanors**, while the Senate version emphasized **violent crimes**. Both sides sought to ensure that repeat offenders face stricter consequences, such as being held without bail until a judge’s hearing.
- Key points of contention included:
  - Whether to include **Class B misdemeanors** (e.g., petty theft, DWI) in the detention provisions.
  - The use of **"shall" vs. "may"** in the language, with "shall" implying mandatory detention and "may" allowing judicial discretion.
  - The removal of **personal recognizance (PR) bail** for individuals who violate bail conditions multiple times.
- After extensive debate and multiple recesses, the committee reached a compromise:
  - **Class B misdemeanors** were retained, but only for individuals with **two prior misdemeanor or felony charges** (making it their third offense).
  - The language was changed to **"shall"** to mandate detention for up to 24 hours pending a judge’s hearing.
  - The provision restricting **PR bail** was removed to align with constitutional concerns about indigent defendants' access to bail.
- The final amendment was drafted and agreed upon, and the committee prepared to file the report.

The meeting concluded with appreciation for the compromise and acknowledgment of the tight deadline. The committee successfully resolved differences between the House and Senate positions, ensuring the bill could proceed to a vote.
