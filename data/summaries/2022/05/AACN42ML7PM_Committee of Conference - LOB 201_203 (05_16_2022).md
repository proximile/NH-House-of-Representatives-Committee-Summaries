The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on **House Bill 2022** on **May 16, 2022**, focused on resolving disagreements between the House and Senate on several key issues. Here are the main points discussed:

1. **Scenic and Cultural Byways Council**:  
   - The House passed **HB 1269** in the previous session, which eliminated the Scenic and Cultural Byways Council. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will now handle the upkeep and updates of these byways, as the council had not met for years. This change was supported by the DOT.

2. **Remote Meetings for the Transportation Council**:  
   - The House preferred removing language allowing for remote meetings of the Transportation Council, citing recent actions to limit remote meeting provisions. However, concerns were raised about maintaining quorum, especially for members with health issues or those located out of state.

3. **Ev Infrastructure Funding**:  
   - The House insisted on removing EV infrastructure funding language from the 10-year plan, arguing that it effectively created a dedicated fund without proper oversight. The Senate, however, emphasized the need to clarify priorities and ensure flexibility for state and federal grants.

4. **Ownership of Continental Boulevard**:  
   - The House and Senate were at odds over the ownership of Continental Boulevard. The House wanted to transfer ownership, while the Senate preferred it remain with the DOT for the time being. This issue remained unresolved.

5. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee agreed to recess and reconvene on **Wednesday, May 18, 2022**, at **10:30 a.m.** to continue discussions, primarily focusing on the Continental Boulevard ownership issue.

The meeting highlighted ongoing disagreements between the House and Senate, with the need for further negotiation to reach a resolution.
