The transcript captures a Committee of Conference meeting on **House Bill 624** held on May 17, 2022. The primary focus was on **Section 5** of a Senate amendment to the bill, which pertains to **net energy metering for hydroelectric generators** (RSA 362-A:9, Section 20). The House expressed concerns about Section 5, as it was added late in the legislative process and had not been reviewed by House committees. Key issues raised by the House included:

1. **Lack of Review**: House committees had not heard or voted on Section 5, leaving many questions unanswered, such as the cost implications, the necessity of the amendment, and its impact on entities like Brookfield.
2. **Process Concerns**: The House argued that legislation impacting costs must first be heard in the House, and Section 5â€™s late introduction bypassed this requirement.
3. **Unanswered Questions**: Concerns were raised about energy storage facilities, cost-shifting, and the amendment's necessity, with no clear answers provided during the meeting.

The **Senate** defended Section 5, stating it addressed a technical issue related to hydroelectric facilities and was consistent with previous legislation (HB 315 and HB 91). A compromise was suggested by Senator Watters to add a **two-year sunset provision** to Section 5, allowing time to address concerns while enabling the amendment to take effect temporarily. However, the House remained **uncomfortable** with moving forward, citing unresolved questions and procedural issues.

Ultimately, the House maintained its position that Section 5 should be **removed** from the bill. The meeting ended without agreement, and the Committee of Conference was **adjourned**.
