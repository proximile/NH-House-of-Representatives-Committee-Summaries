The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting held on May 18, 2022, addressed several key bills, with a particular focus on **HB 1476**, **HB 307**, **HB 1011**, and **HB 1333**. The discussions highlighted the challenges of reconciling differing legislative priorities and balancing individual rights with public safety.

### **HB 1476: Bail Reform and Repeat Offenders**
The committee primarily focused on **HB 1476**, which addresses bail reform and repeat offenders. Key points from the discussion included:
- **House Version**: The House version targets repeat offenders, particularly those arrested while out on bail, proposing to detain individuals for up to 36 hours for third or subsequent offenses, even for non-violent misdemeanors. This version aims to prevent rapid reoffending.
- **Senate Version**: The Senate version focuses on **violent offenders** and sex crimes against children, requiring them to appear before a judge rather than a bail commissioner.
- **Disagreement on Priorities**: Senators argued that violent crimes are the more pressing issue, while House members emphasized the political reality that the House is unlikely to pass the Senate’s more stringent version. Representative Barry noted that the House has repeatedly rejected similar proposals targeting violent offenders, often by wide margins.
- **Compromise and Next Steps**: The committee struggled to find a compromise, with the Senate unwilling to accept the House version and the House unable to support the Senate’s focus on violent crimes. The discussion ended with a decision to **recess and reconvene the next day**, with the hope of finding a solution before the legislative deadline.

### **HB 307: Gun Rights and Public Property**
The committee also debated **HB 307**, which pertains to the regulation of firearms on public property. Key points included:
- **Removal of the Word "Use"**: The committee debated the removal of the word "use" in the bill, with senators arguing that municipalities should retain the authority to regulate the **use** of firearms in public spaces like parks and trails.
- **Balancing Rights and Safety**: Concerns were raised about **reckless firearm use** in public areas, citing incidents where property was damaged. Some members emphasized the need to balance Second Amendment rights with public safety.
- **Private Property Rights**: The discussion touched on **private property rights**, with worries that removing "use" could allow municipalities to regulate private gun ranges.
- **Clarifying "Lawful Use"**: The committee considered adding **"lawful use"** to the bill to clarify that lawful activities, such as self-defense or hunting, would remain protected.

### **HB 1011: Restitution for Vandalism**
The committee discussed **HB 1011**, which involves restitution for vandalism. Key points included:
- **Restoring Restitution Provisions**: The committee agreed that **restitution** is crucial for compensating victims of property damage, especially in cases involving public property or historical sites.
- **Amending the Bill**: The committee proposed **amending the bill** to include restitution, allowing judges to impose fines or restitution based on the severity of the damage.

### **HB 1333: DUI Look-Back Period**
The committee addressed **HB 1333**, which deals with the look-back period for repeat DUI offenses. Key points included:
- **House Proposal**: The House proposed a **20-year look-back period** for repeat DUI offenses.
- **Senate Preference**: The Senate preferred the current **10-year look-back period**.
- **Balancing Reform and Public Safety**: Some members argued that a 20-year look-back is too long, as it could unfairly penalize individuals who have reformed over time. Others countered that repeat offenders pose a public safety risk and should face stricter penalties.
- **Potential Compromise**: The discussion highlighted the need for **data-driven decisions** and potential compromises, such as a **15-year look-back period**.

### **Overall**:
The meeting centered on finding common ground between House and Senate positions, balancing individual rights with public safety, and ensuring that laws are clear and enforceable. The committee aimed to address conflicting statutes and clarify ambiguities in the legislation. The focus on **HB 1476** revealed a divide between the House and Senate on how best to address repeat offenders and violent crimes, with no immediate resolution in sight. The committee decided to **recess and reconvene the next day** to continue discussions and find solutions before the legislative deadline.
