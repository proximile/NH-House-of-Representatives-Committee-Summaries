The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on May 17, 2022, addressed two bills: **HB 1466** and **HB 1487**.

### **HB 1466: Off-Label Use of Prescription Drugs**
- The committee discussed amendments to clarify the legal framework for prescribing FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses, ensuring they meet the same standard of care as on-label prescriptions.
- A proposed amendment emphasized shared decision-making between healthcare professionals and patients, requiring informed consent for off-label use. The consent form must include potential benefits, risks, alternative treatments, and disclosure of off-label use.
- The amendment also addressed concerns about the time and effort required for the Board of Medicine to approve forms and ensure sound scientific evidence supports off-label use.
- The committee agreed to the amendment, which will be drafted for final approval.

### **HB 1487: Withdrawal from the Vaccine Registry**
- The bill allows individuals to withdraw from the vaccine registry using a notarized form instead of requiring a healthcare provider's signature.
- The Senate proposed language to differentiate between adults and minors, ensuring parents or guardians can sign for minors.
- The committee discussed the consequences of withdrawing, such as the need to maintain personal vaccination records and potential impacts on emergency medical care.
- An amendment was proposed to clarify that the form provided by the Department of Health must include information about the consequences of withdrawal, emphasizing personal responsibility for maintaining vaccination records.
- The committee agreed to the amendment, and the bill was finalized.

Both bills were addressed with amendments to improve clarity and ensure proper implementation. The committee of conference concluded after finalizing the language for both bills.
