**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (May 10, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on May 10, 2022, to address a wide range of education-related topics, focusing on both immediate legislative actions and future studies. The meeting was divided into two segments, with discussions ranging from charter school funding to curriculum changes and interim study assignments. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

1. **Charter Schools and Building Aid**  
   - Members debated the complexities of charter school funding, particularly their exemption from state building aid. A report was proposed to outline recommendations for future legislation, and there was a suggestion to form a commission to study the issue further. The committee acknowledged the challenges of addressing school building aid given the state’s limited funding and existing debt.

2. **Philosophy in High School Curriculum**  
   - The committee discussed the possibility of introducing a half-year philosophy course for high school students. While some members supported the idea, others questioned whether it should be mandatory or integrated into existing curricula. Concerns were raised about the readiness of high school students for such a course and the potential for controversy in teaching philosophy.

3. **Background Checks for Education Providers**  
   - The need for background checks for all employees and volunteers in education settings, including non-public schools and service providers, was discussed. The Department of Education’s role in conducting these checks was clarified, and the complexity of implementing such measures was acknowledged.

4. **Incentive Grants for School Districts**  
   - A proposal to provide grants to districts that improve assessment scores was reviewed. Members considered how to measure improvement, especially for high-performing schools, and discussed the potential fiscal implications of such a program.

5. **Freedom of Speech on College Campuses**  
   - A bill related to freedom of speech and association on college campuses was discussed. The committee noted improvements in campus policies and decided against further study, as the issue had been previously addressed.

   - A bill concerning parental input and teacher responsibilities was referred to a subcommittee for further study.

2. **HB 1141 (Special Education in Charter Schools)**

   - A bill to study the use of local produce and nutrition in school meal programs was assigned to a subcommittee.

4. **HB 1295 (Classroom Recordings and Observers)**  
   - A bill requiring reports on school policies regarding classroom recordings and observers was left to individual members to pursue, with no formal subcommittee formed.

5. **HB 1313 (Discrimination in Higher Education)**  
   - The committee opted to work directly with higher education institutions rather than conduct a formal study.

6. **HB 1366, HB 1399, and HB 1679 (Cooperative School Governance)**  
   - These bills, addressing cooperative school reapportionment, withdrawal, and dissolution, were combined for a comprehensive study.
