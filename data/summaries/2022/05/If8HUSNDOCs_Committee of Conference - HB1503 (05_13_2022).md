The transcript captures a contentious discussion during a New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting regarding **HB1503** and the attachment of a separate steel-related bill to it. Key points include:

1. **HB1503 Progress**: The bill initially appeared ready for approval after passing through the Senate Finance Committee but encountered complications when the steel bill was attached to it during a late-night session.

2. **Steel Bill Controversy**: The steel bill, which provides subsidies for the steel industry, was added to HB1503. Some representatives expressed opposition, arguing it sets a precedent for subsidizing other industries (e.g., lumber) and is unrelated to the original bill’s intent.

3. **Senate’s Position**: The Senate opposed the attachment of the steel bill, viewing it as inappropriate and a "slap in the face" to HB1503. They emphasized the importance of HB1503 and sought to keep it alive by attaching it to another bill.

4. **House’s Perspective**: House representatives defended the steel bill, highlighting its importance in protecting jobs and industries in New Hampshire. They argued that such measures are necessary to support local businesses and skilled labor.

5. **Political Tensions**: The discussion revealed frustrations between the House and Senate over procedural issues, with both sides accusing each other of mishandling bills and attaching non-germane amendments.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to reconvene to resolve the dispute, with some members urging reconsideration of the steel bill’s inclusion and others advocating for the passage of HB1503 without it.

Overall, the meeting underscored the challenges of legislative compromise and the broader debate over industry subsidies and procedural fairness.
