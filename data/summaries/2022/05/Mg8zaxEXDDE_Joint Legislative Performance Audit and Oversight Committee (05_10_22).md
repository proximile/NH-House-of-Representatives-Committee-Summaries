The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Legislative Performance Audit and Oversight Committee met on May 10, 2022, to discuss several audit-related topics. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Board of Dental Examiners and OPLC Audit**: Steve Smith, Director of the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) division, provided an update on the audit of the Board of Dental Examiners and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC). The audit process has been lengthy, with a draft expected by the end of the month and a final presentation anticipated by September. The audit involves complex interactions between the board and OPLC, with ongoing challenges in obtaining coherent and complete responses.

2. **Mental Health, Energy, and Special Education Audits**: The committee discussed upcoming audits for the Mental Health Department, Department of Energy, and Special Education. Scope statements were prepared, and field work is expected to begin soon. Concerns were raised about the increasing costs and number of students in special education, and the committee expressed interest in understanding the reasons behind these trends.

3. **Medical Subsidy Audit**: The audit of the medical subsidy program has been completed, and a letter summarizing the findings has been vetted by the Department of Administrative Services and the New Hampshire Retirement System. The letter will be distributed to legislative leadership.

4. **Education Freedom Account Program**: The committee considered a request for a performance audit of the Education Freedom Account program, which has seen higher-than-expected participation. The audit would examine eligibility controls, expenditures, and student outcomes.

5. **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**: There was a suggestion to audit the OPLC itself, given complaints from various boards about its oversight. However, it was noted that OPLC is still undergoing significant transition, and an audit at this time might be premature. The committee decided to revisit this topic after the current audit of the Board of Dental Examiners is completed.

6. **Secretary of Stateâ€™s Division of Archives and Record Management**: A suggestion was made to audit this division to review its policies and procedures, especially since it has been led by an acting director for about 12 years.

7. **Public Lake Access**: The committee discussed the issue of public access to lakes and other public bodies of water. It was suggested to reach out to the Public Water Access Advisory Commission for more information.

The committee also addressed various other topics, including the impact of remote learning on students, the immunization program, and the need for more data on specific learning disabilities. The meeting concluded with expressions of appreciation for the work of the performance auditors, and the next meeting was scheduled to be called by the chair.
