**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Fish and Game and Marine Resources (May 23, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 23, 2022, convened to discuss critical issues related to fish, game, and marine resources. The session, led by Representative Tim Lang, chairman of the House Fish and Game Committee, featured presentations, discussions, and international collaboration, emphasizing conservation, economic impact, and sustainable practices. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **1. Conservation and Industry Challenges**
- **Lobster Industry and Whale Protection**: The meeting addressed the implementation of new regulations, such as breakaway lines, to protect endangered right whales from entanglement in lobster trap lines. Lobstermen raised concerns about the financial and operational challenges of recovering traps after lines break, stressing the need for industry collaboration and support.
- **Fish and Game Management**: New Hampshire prioritizes conservation over commercialization, with inland fishing being recreational and commercial fishing limited to the seacoast, primarily lobster fishing. The state collaborates with regional organizations like the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to set sustainable catch limits.

### **2. Economic Impact and Tourism**
- **Hunting and Fishing Tourism**: The discussion highlighted the significant economic contributions of hunting and fishing tourism, particularly in northern New Hampshire. Tourists, including corporate executives, spend on licenses, guides, accommodations, and dining, boosting the local economy. Initiatives like free fishing days aim to encourage participation and promote outdoor activities.
- **Commercial Fishing**: While commercial fishing, especially lobster, plays a key economic role, its decline due to regulatory and economic factors was noted. Sport fishing, contributing over $180 million annually, remains a vital economic driver.

### **3. Education, Sustainability, and Enforcement**
- **Education and Hunter Safety**: The Fish and Game Department’s efforts in education, hunter safety courses, and sustainability programs were praised. The department’s self-funding model, supported by license sales and outdoor activities, benefits the state’s economy and tax rates.
- **Law Enforcement**: Officers monitor compliance with fishing and hunting regulations, with commercial fishermen often self-reporting violations to protect their livelihoods. Historical challenges like overharvesting and habitat loss have shaped New Hampshire’s conservation efforts, leading to the recovery of species such as deer, moose, and black bears.

### **4. Legislative Process and Public Involvement**
- **Legislative Framework**: The committee outlined how fish and game-related bills are introduced, reviewed, and passed. Bills often originate from constituents or the Fish and Game Department, undergoing public hearings, committee reviews, and legislative votes before reaching the governor for approval.
- **Public Hearings**: Public involvement is encouraged through hearings where citizens, industry stakeholders, and researchers provide input to ensure balanced decision-making.

### **5. International Collaboration**
- **International Participants**: Representatives from Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Comoros, Cape Verde, Angola, and Madagascar shared their experiences in fisheries and marine conservation. They expressed interest in adopting New Hampshire’s sustainable practices and conservation models in their home countries.
- **Comparative Legislation**: A representative from Angola inquired about wildlife-related legislation and penalties in New Hampshire, where most violations result in fines, with serious offenses leading to misdemeanors or felonies. License revocation serves as a significant deterrent.

---

### **6. Sustainable Practices and Future Directions**
- **Sustainability**: The importance of sustainable fishing practices, such as catch-and-release, was emphasized for generating economic benefits without depleting resources. Participants discussed the potential for sport fishing to balance conservation and economic interests.
- **Collaboration and Innovation**: The meeting underscored the need for collaboration between stakeholders, innovative solutions to conservation challenges, and the promotion of outdoor recreational activities.

Attendees were encouraged to reach out with further questions, and contact information was shared for future communication.
