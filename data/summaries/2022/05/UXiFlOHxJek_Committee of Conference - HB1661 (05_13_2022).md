The transcript captures a Committee of Conference meeting for HB 1661 on May 13, 2022, where lawmakers discussed various aspects of the bill, including amendments, unresolved issues, and scheduling. Key points include:

1. **HB 1661 Overview**: The bill addresses Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs, aligning school calendars and allowing students to earn graduation credits through CTE courses. An amendment clarifies competency approval by local school districts rather than the State Board of Education.

2. **Amendments and Discussions**:
   - **CTE Amendment (1998-H)**: Approved unanimously, focusing on competency-based credit approval.
   - **Senate Bill 430**: Attached to HB 1661, it deals with health and human services. A key issue is whether to keep a misdemeanor provision for confidentiality violations in child protection cases or reduce it to a violation. The department prefers retaining the misdemeanor.

   - **HB 1476**: Related to bail issues, it was agreed to handle it separately in its own Committee of Conference.

3. **Workforce Housing and Land Use**: Sections 83, 89, and 90 of HB 1661 address workforce housing and expedited court reviews. The House proposed deferring these sections to an interim study bill (HB 1389), but the Senate emphasized the importance of workforce housing incentives.

4. **Parking Garage Funding**: The committee discussed funding for a legislative parking garage, with a proposed $9.35 million allocation. Further discussion was deferred for offline conversations.

5. **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to recess and reconvene on Monday, May 16, at 11:30 a.m. to finalize unresolved issues, including the misdemeanor/violation debate, workforce housing sections, and parking garage funding.
