**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (May 24, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on May 24, 2022, to discuss a range of bills retained for interim study. The meeting focused on procedural matters, the formation of subcommittees, and the potential impact of proposed legislation on energy efficiency, weatherization, and other key issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **1. Energy Savings Weatherization Program (SB 269)**
- **Commission Study Proposal**: The committee discussed the creation of a commission to study methods for maintaining an energy savings weatherization program aimed at reducing overall energy consumption for New Hampshire families. The commission would also explore expanding fiscal participation of propane and oil users in the state’s energy programs, similar to electric and natural gas users.
- **Concerns and Amendments**: Members raised concerns about the fiscal participation of propane and oil users, with discussions about potentially removing or amending this language in future legislation.
- **Subcommittee Formation**: A subcommittee was formed to further examine SB 269, review its implications, and make recommendations for future legislation.

### **2. Net Metering for Customer Generators (HB 1248)**
- The committee deemed HB 1248 underdeveloped and considered forming a subcommittee to study it further. However, some members questioned the necessity of additional study.

### **3. Purchase of Energy from Limited Producers (HB 1635)**
- HB 1635 was largely superseded by Senate Bill 321. The committee agreed that further study of this bill was unnecessary.

### **4. Telecommunications Antennas and Wireless Radiation (HB 1644)**
- HB 1644, which addresses the placement of telecommunications antennas and the health effects of wireless radiation, sparked significant discussion. The committee decided to form a subcommittee to explore the issue further, with a meeting scheduled for May 31st.

### **5. Municipal Group Hosting for Renewable Energy (SB 259)**
- SB 259, which imposes limitations on municipalities in group hosting for renewable energy, was discussed. The committee agreed to form a subcommittee to study whether these restrictions should be lifted.

### **6. Transfer of Authority Over Low-Income Electric Assistance Program (SB 264)**
- SB 264, concerning the transfer of authority over the low-income electric assistance program, was debated for its potential to accumulate funds and impact federal funding. The committee decided to form a subcommittee to study the issue.

### **7. Reducing Contractor Pre-Qualifications for Weatherization Programs (SB 269)**
- SB 269, which focuses on reducing contractor pre-qualifications for weatherization programs, was discussed for its potential impact on federal funding. The committee decided to form a subcommittee to investigate further.

### **Procedural and Logistical Discussions**
- **Subcommittee Logistics**: The chairs of the subcommittees were assigned, and it was clarified that subcommittee meetings would be open to all committee members, but only subcommittee members would vote on recommendations.
- **Future Legislation**: The committee discussed the process for recommending future legislation, including the timeline for filing legislative service requests (LSRs) and the role of current and future legislators in introducing bills based on the committee's recommendations.
- **Closing Remarks**: The chair thanked the members for their hard work during the session and acknowledged those who would not be returning. The meeting concluded with plans for a group lunch and reminders about upcoming events, including a multi-state legislative tour to Block Island and the Speaker's ice cream social.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting emphasized the need for thorough study and fact-based decisions, particularly on issues like energy efficiency, wireless radiation, and weatherization. The committee planned to coordinate with other departments and stakeholders to ensure comprehensive analysis and recommendations. The discussions and decisions made during this meeting set the stage for future legislative action aimed at addressing New Hampshire’s energy and technology needs.
