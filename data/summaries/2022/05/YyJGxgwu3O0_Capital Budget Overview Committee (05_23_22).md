The New Hampshire House of Representatives Capital Budget Overview Committee meeting on May 23, 2022, began with the approval of the minutes from the March 28, 2022, meeting. The committee then addressed a request from the Department of Administrative Services to transfer $80,968 from a completed capital project (DoIT New Computer Room Fire System) to another project (Spalding Roof Replacement) that was underfunded. Karen Rantamacki, Director of Plant and Property, and Ted Copper, Administrator for the Division of Public Works, presented the request, explaining that the funds would cover the shortfall, with the remainder coming from the operating budget. After brief clarification, the committee approved the transfer.

The meeting also included informational items from the Department of Transportation, Environmental Services, Administrative Services, and the University System of New Hampshire, with no questions raised by committee members. The committee then set future meeting dates: September 19, 2022, and November 28, 2022, both at 10:15 AM, with the latter likely being the final meeting before the new committee is formed post-election. The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which was passed unanimously.
