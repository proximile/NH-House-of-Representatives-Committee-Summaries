The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Joint Committee on Tax Expenditure Review, held on May 23, 2022. The focus of the discussion was the **Career and Technical Education (CTE) Center Tax Credit Program**, which provides tax incentives to businesses that donate time, equipment, or money to CTE centers. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Program Overview**:  
   - Businesses can receive a 50% tax credit for donating time (e.g., internships) or money, and a 100% tax credit for equipment donations.
   - The program is designed to support CTE centers by encouraging partnerships with businesses, particularly in industries like advanced manufacturing.

2. **Program Performance**:  
   - In 2020, $89,000 in tax credits were claimed, and in 2021, $87,000 was claimed. The program’s cap is $500,000 annually, but it has not been fully utilized.
   - Only five businesses participated in the program in both 2020 and 2021, with Pinkerton Academy being the primary beneficiary.  

3. **Challenges**:  
   - Outreach and awareness are ongoing issues. Many businesses may not be aware of the tax credit or are not submitting the necessary paperwork.
   - The program is set to be repealed in 2026 unless extended, adding urgency to increase participation.

4. **Outreach Efforts**:  
   - The Department of Education, particularly Nicole Levesque, has been actively working to increase awareness among businesses and CTE centers.
   - Efforts include direct outreach to employers, guidance to CTE centers, and leveraging program advisory committees to promote the tax credit.

5. **Future Goals**:  
   - The committee aims to increase participation by expanding outreach and encouraging more businesses to take advantage of the tax credit.
   - There is also a focus on collecting data to track the impact of CTE programs on student outcomes and workforce retention in New Hampshire.

6. **Other Discussions**:  
   - The committee briefly touched on other tax credit programs, such as the **Coos County Job Creation Tax Credit** and the **Economic Revitalization Zone Tax Credit**, which will be reviewed in future meetings.
   - There was also a mention of a $1 million allocation for veterans’ affairs, which was discussed in a separate Senate Finance Committee meeting.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the potential of the CTE tax credit program to support workforce development but underscored the need for increased outreach and participation to maximize its impact. The committee plans to revisit the program in the fall with updated data and recommendations.
