### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (05/31/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on May 31, 2022, to address various aspects of 5G technology, radiofrequency (RF) radiation, and their potential health and safety impacts. The meeting included expert presentations, legislative discussions, and public health considerations, aiming to inform future policy decisions.

#### **1. Procedural Matters and Expert Presentation**
The session began with procedural formalities, including the Pledge of Allegiance and acknowledgment of absent members. The committee reviewed interim study bills and previously overlooked legislation (House Bill 213 and Senate Bill 113), which will be addressed in the fall.

Dr. Gregory Lapin, a biomedical and electrical engineer, provided a detailed presentation on electromagnetic principles, RF safety standards, and 5G technology. He emphasized that RF used in communication technologies is non-ionizing, generating only heat in tissue and posing no risk of DNA damage. Dr. Lapin outlined safety standards set by organizations like IEEE and ICNIRP, which are based on extensive research and set exposure limits 50 times lower than harmful levels. He explained that 5G operates across low, mid, and high-frequency bands, with millimeter waves (high-band) used in densely populated areas for high-speed data but having limited propagation distances. Small cells were highlighted as a solution to improve coverage in high-density or obstructed areas.

Committee members raised questions about cumulative RF exposure, health concerns like electrosensitivity, and the applicability of safety standards. Dr. Lapin clarified that current standards are comprehensive and protective, with no evidence linking RF exposure to diseases like cancer. He also addressed the National Toxicology Program's findings, noting that safety standards are continuously reviewed.

#### **2. Health Concerns and Scientific Evidence**
The discussion focused on potential health risks associated with RF radiation, particularly from 5G. Participants acknowledged the lack of scientific evidence supporting claims of sensitivity to RF but noted that some individuals report symptoms. The distinction between correlation and causation was emphasized, with participants stressing the need for further research to understand potential health impacts.

The safety of 5G technology was explored, with experts noting that millimeter waves have limited penetration and are unlikely to cause harm. The evolution of 5G is expected to reduce radiation exposure over time. Regulatory considerations, such as setting safe distances for cell towers, were discussed, with arguments that arbitrary limits may not be effective due to the highly attenuated nature of millimeter waves.

#### **3. Legislative and Practical Considerations**
Participants expressed frustration at the lack of concrete solutions during the meeting and questioned the feasibility of legislative action. Some suggested that private solutions might be more effective in addressing public concerns. The committee agreed to reconvene in September to gather more information and explore potential solutions, particularly from vendors.

#### **4. Technological Advancements and Safety**
The meeting highlighted the evolution of antenna technology, with modern MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antennas directing signals more precisely than traditional whip antennas, reducing radiation exposure to non-targeted individuals. The discussion emphasized that 5G technology is not fundamentally different from previous generations but is more efficient. Safety standards set by the FCC were described as conservative and protective, with radiation levels from cell phones and towers compared to natural sources like sunlight.

#### **5. Public Health, Policy, and Future Directions**
Concerns about cumulative radiation exposure, particularly on children and reproductive health, were raised. Representatives debated the need for stricter regulations, such as distance limits for cell towers, and called for public education on minimizing exposure (e.g., using wired connections and turning off devices when not in use). Examples of global and local actions, such as bans or moratoriums on 5G, were noted, with New Hampshire being one of the first states to address the issue at the state level.

The meeting underscored the importance of balancing technological advancement with public health concerns, emphasizing evidence-based policies and the need for continued research. The committee considered scheduling additional meetings to further explore the issue, with some members preferring to wait until September for more research and preparation.

#### **Conclusion**
The session provided a comprehensive overview of 5G technology, RF radiation, and their potential health impacts. While experts emphasized the safety of current standards and the efficiency of modern communication systems, concerns about cumulative exposure and public health risks highlighted the need for cautious regulation and ongoing research. The committee will reconvene in the fall to continue discussions and explore potential solutions.
