### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (05/17/2022)

The Committee of Conference meeting on May 17, 2022, addressed several key bills, including **HB 1421**, **HB 1639**, **HB 1627**, and **HB 1662**. The discussions focused on funding, administrative oversight, regulatory measures, and public health initiatives. Here’s a detailed summary of the proceedings:

---

### **HB 1421: Lead in School Drinking Water**
- **Funding and Implementation**: The committee debated the appropriation of **$7.76 million** from the state’s general fund as matching funds for federal infrastructure grants aimed at addressing lead in school drinking water. This funding was required under the bipartisan infrastructure law.
- **Bottle Filling Stations**: There was discussion about the timeline for installing bottle filling stations (proposed at **180 days**) and whether schools should continue testing all sinks even after installation.
- **Outcome**: The committee agreed to the **Senate version of the bill** with minor amendments, including maintaining the 180-day installation timeline and clarifying testing requirements for other outlets.

### **HB 1639: Youth Risk Behavior Survey**
- **Opt-In vs. Opt-Out**: The committee debated whether the survey should be **opt-in** (requiring parental consent) or remain **opt-out** (parents can choose to exclude their children). The **House version** proposed an opt-in system and required annual approval by local school boards, while the **Senate version** maintained the current opt-out system.
- **Content and Privacy Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the survey’s content, including questions about sexual orientation and family military service, as well as privacy implications for students.
- **Outcome**: The committee **did not reach consensus**, leaving the current opt-out system in place without requiring local school board approval.

### **HB 1627: Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**
- **Administrative Oversight**: The discussion centered on an amendment to clarify the role and funding of the program administrator for the EFA program. The amendment aimed to define the administrator’s duties and responsibilities, ensuring transparency and avoiding conflicts with scholarship organizations.
- **Funding Mechanism**: Funding for the administrator would come from the **general fund** rather than reducing EFA scholarships, ensuring students’ accounts remain unaffected. Excess administrative funds would be returned to students.
- **Outcome**: The House and Senate reached a **consensus** on the amendment, agreeing on the need for administrative oversight and funding clarity.

### **HB 1662: Online Marketplace Regulation**
- **Regulatory Measures**: The bill aimed to regulate third-party sellers on online marketplaces to combat organized retail crime, including the sale of stolen or counterfeit goods. It required online platforms to vet high-volume sellers (200+ transactions or $5,000+ in sales annually) and collect their tax and contact information.
- **Enforcement Tools**: The bill provided the **Attorney General** with enforcement tools to address consumer protection issues related to online sales.
- **Debate**: Supporters argued it protects consumers and businesses, while critics questioned its necessity and potential regulatory burden.
- **Controversial Funding**: A **$5 million appropriation for a homeless project** was contentious, with some representatives opposing it due to budget concerns and lack of due process.
- **Outcome**: The committee **failed to reach consensus** on HB 1662. The Senate insisted on an "all or nothing" approach, while House members opposed specific components, including the homeless project funding and online marketplace regulations. The bill did not move forward.

### **Key Outcomes**
- **Agreement**: The committee agreed on the Senate version of **HB 1421** with amendments and reached consensus on **HB 1627** regarding the EFA program.
- **No Consensus**: The committee did not concur on **HB 1639** (Youth Risk Behavior Survey) or **HB 1662** (Online Marketplace Regulation), leaving the current systems in place for the former and halting progress on the latter.

The meeting concluded with unresolved debates on several contentious issues, reflecting differing priorities and perspectives among House and Senate members.
