The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on May 20, 2022, addressed a wide range of fiscal and operational matters, focusing on the allocation and management of federal COVID-19 relief funds, budget approvals, and program updates across various state departments. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions and decisions:

### **Federal COVID-19 Relief Funds and Sector-Specific Allocations**

1. **Education Funding**:
   - The state received $45 million in initial COVID-19 relief funds and an additional $10 million in IDEA pass-through funds. These were distributed to school districts via a 90% pass-through grant system, with schools required to submit budgets for approval.
   - ESSER funds (CARES, CRRSA, and ARP) were emphasized to address learning loss and support state-level activities. Concerns were raised about using one-time funds for ongoing expenses like salaries, with districts urged to avoid creating future financial cliffs.

2. **Transportation Funding**:
   - The Department of Transportation (DOT) highlighted the pandemic’s impact on transit ridership (at two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels) and aviation passenger volume (at 88%). Federal funds (CARES, CRRSA, and ARP) were used to support transit operations, cover revenue shortfalls, and mitigate pandemic effects.
   - Programs like CDL training and bus driver incentives were discussed, though some were not directly managed by DOT. Rising costs for asphalt and diesel posed challenges for transportation projects, though contractors had secured materials in advance to mitigate immediate impacts.

3. **Aviation Funding**:
   - Funds were allocated to airports for operations, maintenance, and capital projects, focusing on covering state and local matches for federal grants. Airports were required to submit eligible expenditures for reimbursement.

### **Budget Approvals and Operational Updates**

1. **Department of Transportation (DOT)**:
   - Discussions included the EZ-Pass system, delinquencies, and efforts to improve collections. The committee approved a transfer request to enhance connectivity with other EZ-Pass agencies nationwide.

2. **Department of Information Technology (DoIT)**:
   - Funding requests for software licenses, consulting services, and infrastructure upgrades were reviewed. Concerns about supply chain issues and the need for a Learning Management System (LMS) for New Hampshire Hospital were raised.

3. **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**:
   - Space utilization and renovation needs for the OPLC’s new location were discussed, with assurances that current space is adequate but requires reconfiguration for efficiency.

4. **New Hampshire Hospital**:
   - Extensive discussions covered the hospital’s waitlist, staffing challenges, and the need for renovations to increase capacity. Telehealth services and transitional housing for patients were also addressed. The committee approved funding for updated signage and other facility upgrades.

### **Public Health and Social Programs**

1. **Prescription Drug Monitoring Program**:
   - The committee addressed a funding discrepancy for the program, which was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Additional funding was approved.

2. **COVID-19 Vaccine Appointments for Elderly and Disabled**:
   - A program to assist elderly and disabled individuals in scheduling vaccine appointments was unanimously approved.

3. **Antigen Test Distribution**:
   - Initially intended for sale at liquor stores, antigen tests saw reduced demand due to federal programs and increased availability. Funds were reallocated to other public health needs.

4. **Lead in School Water Systems**:
   - Efforts to address lead in school water systems were discussed, including new legislation lowering the action level for lead and providing free testing services. Concerns were raised about the lack of reporting from schools on remediation efforts.

5. **SNAP Education and Training Program**:
   - Modifications to the program to accept and expend $230,000 in federal funds were approved.

### **Other Key Discussions and Approvals**

1. **Fish and Game Funding**:
   - Transfers of funds from the Fish and Game reserve to the operating budget for hatchery improvements and other needs were approved.

2. **Judicial Council Funding**:
   - A request for $595,000 for the Judicial Council was unanimously approved.

3. **Wi-Fi Network for Public Health and Events**:
   - Funding for a high-quality Wi-Fi network to support public health activities and events like the League of New Hampshire Craftsmen's fair was approved.

4. **Medicaid Funding for Schools and Case Managers**:
   - Updates were provided on the distribution of Medicaid funds to schools and case managers, with delays due to federal approval processes.

5. **Lottery Commission Update**:
   - A decline in scratch ticket sales and its impact on the Education Trust Fund were discussed, with the CFO of the Lottery Commission providing an overview of financial pressures.

6. **ARPA Funding Update for Education**:
   - The Department of Education provided an update on the use of ARPA funds, including plans for an interactive website to track fund usage at the state and district levels.

### **Future Meetings**
The committee scheduled future meetings for June 17, July 22, September 9, October 14, and November 18, 2022.
