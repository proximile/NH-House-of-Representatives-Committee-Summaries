### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (05/17/2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on May 17, 2022, focused on several key bills: **HB 1130**, **HB 355**, **HB 1431**, and **HB 1099**. The discussions revolved around a range of issues, including healthcare funding, parental rights in education, business regulations, and accommodations for individuals with medical needs. Here’s a detailed summary of the key points and outcomes:

---

#### **Healthcare and Social Services**
1. **WIC Program Funding (HB 1099)**:
   - The committee discussed allocating $30,000 to initiate a WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program aimed at providing fresh produce to low-income families.
   - The $30,000 would cover administrative costs, such as preparing a Request for Information (RFI) and printing coupons, while the larger food budget ($270,000) would be included in the next fiscal year’s budget.
   - The committee reached a consensus on the $30,000 allocation, with plans to incorporate the full program costs into future budgets.

2. **Postpartum Medicaid Coverage (HB 1099)**:
   - The committee addressed extending Medicaid coverage for postpartum services from two months to 12 months for families earning between 130% and 296% of the federal poverty level.
   - This provision was originally part of another bill (HB 407) but was attached to HB 1099 after the Senate rejected a related amendment (HB 1210) concerning vaccine conscience exemptions.
   - The committee agreed to support the postpartum coverage component without changes.

3. **COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements (HB 1099)**:
   - The committee reaffirmed a provision stating that no person would be required to receive a COVID-19 vaccination to access Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) benefits or services.
   - This provision was uncontested and received unanimous support.

4. **Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program and Association Health Plans (HB 1099)**:
   - The bill also included reestablishing a farmers’ market nutrition program and creating a pilot program for association health plans.
   - An amendment was proposed to the association health plan pilot program, requiring the Department of Insurance to gauge interest via an RFI before proceeding. This amendment aimed to address concerns about feasibility while protecting state-mandated coverages and compliance with federal rules.

---

#### **Marriage License and Registration (HB 1130)**:
- The bill addresses accommodations for individuals unable to appear in person for marriage license registration due to medical reasons, such as hospice care.
- A specific case was discussed where a hospice patient needed assistance, leading to a proposal that town clerks must accommodate such individuals by meeting them at a convenient location.
- Concerns were raised about potential misuse, but the amendment was ultimately agreed upon, requiring clerks to accommodate parties for medical reasons.

---

#### **Keno Expansion (HB 355)**:
- The bill proposes expanding Keno (a lottery game) to grocery stores, convenience stores, and pharmacies, beyond its current restriction to establishments that serve alcohol.
- The House version allowed Keno ticket sales but prohibited screens displaying numbers to avoid gatherings. The Senate version supported allowing screens, arguing it’s a business decision.
- The House expressed concerns about the "bad look" of screens in non-traditional venues and potential community impacts, while the Senate emphasized business autonomy and economic benefits.
- No agreement was reached, and the meeting was recessed for further discussion.

#### **Parental Rights and School Policies (HB 1431)**:
- The bill aims to ensure parental rights in education, particularly regarding student counseling and extracurricular activities.
- Concerns were raised about potential harm to LGBTQ+ youth, domestic violence victims, and children’s mental health if schools are required to disclose sensitive information to parents.
- The Attorney General’s office highlighted potential conflicts with anti-discrimination laws and federal protections for LGBTQ+ minors.
- The committee debated the balance between parental rights and children’s safety, with some members arguing that schools should not act as mental health counselors without parental involvement.
- Due to unresolved concerns, the committee decided the bill needed further work and could not proceed in its current form.

---

#### **Legislative Process and Amendments**:
- The committee worked through multiple amendments and debated whether to vote on items individually or as a package.
- They agreed to consolidate amendments, including the $30,000 WIC funding and other changes, into a single report for final approval.
- The meeting concluded with a consensus on the discussed items, and the committee planned to finalize the report by the following day.

### Key Themes and Outcomes:
- **Healthcare and Social Services**: The committee reached agreements on WIC funding, postpartum Medicaid coverage, and COVID-19 vaccination requirements, while proposing amendments to the association health plan pilot program.
- **Marriage License Accommodations**: The committee approved accommodations for individuals with medical needs to obtain marriage licenses.
- **Keno Expansion**: The debate over Keno expansion highlighted tensions between business autonomy and community impact, with no resolution reached.
- **Parental Rights in Education**: Concerns about student privacy and safety led to the decision that HB 1431 required further refinement.

The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing budgetary considerations, program feasibility, and legislative priorities, with several bills requiring additional work before final decisions could be made.
