The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee meeting on May 10, 2022, covered a wide range of topics related to revenue estimates, tax discussions, legislative updates, and economic trends. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### Revenue Estimates and Tax Discussions

1. **Revenue Estimates and Trends**:
   - The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) presented revised revenue estimates for fiscal years 2022 and 2023. FY22 revenues were $2.2 billion, $331.5 million ahead of plan, with a 22.3% increase through April. FY23 revenues were estimated at $2.1 billion, a 14.6% increase over the original plan.
   - Key taxes discussed included:
     - **Interest and Dividends (IND) Tax**: Revenues were 16.9% ahead of plan and 22% ahead of the prior year, influenced by market fluctuations and stock performance. The tax is set to be phased out by 2027.
     - **Communication Services Tax (CST)**: Underperforming due to reduced landline usage and changes in wireless billing, but positively impacted by increased video conferencing during the pandemic.
     - **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Exceeded expectations due to high property prices and low inventory, despite rising mortgage rates.
     - **Utility Property Tax**: Increased due to higher valuations, but future growth may be flat due to economic uncertainties.
     - **Business Taxes**: Significantly ahead of plan, with a 24.5% increase year-over-year, influenced by PPP loan forgiveness and potential refunds.
     - **Meals and Rentals Tax**: 20% ahead of plan but 1.8% below the prior year due to municipal revenue fund transfers.
     - **Tobacco Tax**: 5.2% below plan and 6.8% below the prior year, with potential future impacts from a federal ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.

2. **Economic Factors**:
   - Factors impacting revenue estimates included inflation, interest rates, unemployment, volatile fuel prices, and supply chain constraints. The potential for a recession was discussed, though it had not yet materialized.

### Tobacco Settlement Funds and Prevention

- The Department of Justice noted a significant increase in tobacco settlement payments due to inflation, higher tobacco company profits, and the absence of payment disputes. The first $40 million is allocated to the Education Trust Fund, with any surplus going to the general fund.
- Concerns were raised about the lack of funding for tobacco prevention programs, particularly targeting youth. A previous bill aimed at redirecting settlement funds towards prevention was sidelined during the pandemic.

### Legislative and Policy Discussions

1. **Legislative Bills and Amendments**:
   - **HB 1221**: Related to business profit tax rates, including a one-time payment for state retirement contributions. The Senate amended it to limit the payment to one year.
   - **HB 1097**: Addressed the taxation of income for New Hampshire residents working remotely for out-of-state employers, with Senate language adjustments to clarify the tax scope.
   - Other bills discussed included those related to county fairs, professional office fees, and other legislative matters.

2. **Budget and Funding Discussions**:
   - Representatives discussed various funding issues, including the allocation of $28 million for a one-time payment related to state retirement system contributions. Concerns were raised about the sustainability of such one-time payments and their impact on future budgets.
   - The Department of Insurance provided an update on revenue sources, noting a significant increase in premium taxes and licensing fees, influenced by higher insurance premiums during the pandemic.

### Insurance Premiums and Liquor Commission Revenue

1. **Insurance Premiums**:
   - The committee discussed unexpected increases in life and health insurance premiums, with life premiums rising by 10% and health premiums by 6%. Moderation in these increases was anticipated.

2. **Liquor Commission**:
   - The CFO of the Liquor Commission, Tina Demers, presented revenue data, highlighting that the state was under its planned revenue by $4.1 million but had transferred $108 million to the general fund. New stores were being opened to boost revenue, despite challenges like supply chain issues and rising transportation costs.

### Granite Advantage Healthcare Program

- Medicaid Director Henry Lipman provided updates on the Granite Advantage Healthcare Program, which saw a 71.9% increase in enrollment since March 2020 due to the public health emergency. The program is funded by liquor profits, insurance taxes, and the New Hampshire Health Plan, with no general fund money used.

### Future Projections and Planning

- The committee discussed scheduling interim studies to evaluate the viability of re-filing certain bills and planned a social gathering in September to discuss these studies informally.
- The importance of monitoring economic indicators and potential future variants of COVID-19 was emphasized.

### Conclusion

The meeting highlighted the strong performance of state revenues compared to initial projections, while also acknowledging uncertainties and potential challenges ahead. Discussions emphasized the need for targeted policy interventions in areas like tobacco prevention, housing affordability, and long-term financial planning. The committee also focused on upcoming legislative actions and the importance of careful budget considerations.
