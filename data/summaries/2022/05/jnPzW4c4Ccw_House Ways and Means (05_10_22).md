### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (May 10, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on May 10, 2022, covered a wide range of topics, including revenue projections, legislative updates, and strategic planning for key state issues. The meeting highlighted the state’s strong fiscal performance in FY 2022 but emphasized ongoing economic uncertainties for FY 2023. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

### **Revenue Projections and Economic Outlook**
1. **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) Presentation**:
   - The DRA presented revised revenue estimates for FY 2022 and FY 2023, noting significant overperformance in FY 2022 due to strong economic growth despite recession concerns.
   - FY 2023 projections were adjusted using historical growth rates, with caution about economic volatility driven by inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions.

2. **Key Tax Revenues**:
   - **Business Taxes**: FY 2022 revenues exceeded expectations due to robust GDP growth and corporate profits. FY 2023 projections assumed a 3.2% growth rate, but risks from economic downturns or corporate behavior changes were noted.
   - **Meals and Rentals Tax**: Revenues rebounded post-COVID, but net revenues were lower due to a 30% municipal fund transfer. FY 2023 estimates assumed 5% growth, with concerns about inflation and labor shortages in the hospitality industry.
   - **Tobacco Tax**: Revenues were below projections, attributed to pre-pandemic trends and Massachusetts’ ban on flavored tobacco. A potential federal ban on menthol cigarettes could further reduce revenues.
   - **Interest and Dividends Tax**: Volatile but exceeded expectations in FY 2022, driven by stock market performance. The tax is set to phase out starting in 2024, with full repeal by 2027.
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Revenue significantly exceeded projections due to higher property values and remote work trends, despite inventory shortages.

3. **Economic Concerns**:
   - The committee expressed caution about inflation, rising interest rates, and potential recessions. However, the state’s diverse economy, including defense and technology sectors, was seen as a buffer against downturns.

### **Legislative Updates and Financial Discussions**
1. **Affordable Housing and Healthcare Costs**:
   - Representatives discussed the challenge of funding affordable housing and the need for strategic resource allocation.
   - Personal health choices (e.g., smoking, obesity) were highlighted as major drivers of healthcare costs, with nearly 70% of spending tied to preventable illnesses. An amendment to expand unused funds for these issues was proposed.

2. **Tobacco and Vaping Regulations**:
   - The potential impact of an FDA ban on flavored cigars and cigarettes was discussed, including hoarding and changes in smoking habits.
   - Vaping products were noted for their exclusion from the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), with discussions on reporting requirements for vaping companies.

3. **Legislative Bills**:
   - **House Bill 1221**: Addressed business profit tax rates and a one-time payment related to state retirement system contributions, with a fiscal impact of $28 million.
   - **House Bill 1097**: Focused on taxing New Hampshire residents working remotely for out-of-state employers, with amendments to clarify language.
   - **House Bill 1584**: A county fair bill amended by the Senate to reduce funding to $250,000 for one year, requiring annual requests for funding.

4. **Revenue Updates**:
   - The Department of Insurance reported a $26.2 million favorable variance, driven by increased premium taxes and licensing fees. FY 2023 revenue was projected at $135 million, with potential fluctuations due to economic conditions.

### **Program Updates and Interim Studies**
1. **Granite Advantage Healthcare Program**:
   - Medicaid Director Henry Lipman discussed the program’s impact, noting increased enrollment due to the federal public health emergency. Enrollment is expected to normalize once the emergency ends and redeterminations are processed.

2. **Liquor Commission Report**:
   - CFO Tina Demers reported that revenue was slightly under plan due to accounting practices, but the Liquor Commission performed better than projected, partly due to new store openings.

3. **Interim Studies**:
   - The committee discussed plans for interim studies to evaluate potential legislation, with subcommittees aiming to complete work by September or October.

   - Representatives considered organizing an informal lunch or gathering in September to discuss revenue estimates and other matters.
