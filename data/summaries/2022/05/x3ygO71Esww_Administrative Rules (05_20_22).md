The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Administrative Rules Committee (JLCAR) on May 20, 2022. Key discussions and decisions included:

1. **Approval of Minutes and Consent Agenda**: The committee approved the minutes from previous meetings and the consent agenda without objections.

2. **Licensing Rules and Expired Rules**: The committee reviewed changes to licensing rules for certain practitioners, noting that some rules had expired in 2018. Concerns were raised about how licensing applications and fees were handled during the period when the rules were expired. The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) acknowledged past deficiencies in the rule-making process but stated that internal controls had been improved.

3. **Pharmacy Board Rules**: The committee discussed proposed changes to pharmacy standards, including the repeal of certain sections. The OPLC clarified that some rules had been moved to other sections for better organization and inclusivity.

4. **Occupational Therapy Rules**: The committee addressed an issue with fee citations in the rules for occupational therapists. The OPLC had worked with the board to clarify that fees apply to all allied health boards, and the committee approved the rule changes.

5. **Passenger Tramway Safety Rules**: The committee raised concerns about the creation of new licenses in the tramway safety rules. A preliminary objection was filed to allow further review of the authority for these licenses.

6. **EMS Letters of Concern**: The committee approved an interim rule allowing the Commissioner of Safety to issue letters of concern instead of license suspensions, with the understanding that issues would be addressed in future rulemaking.

7. **Environmental Standards**: The committee reviewed updates to air quality standards for landfills, which incorporated new EPA regulations. The Department of Environmental Services explained that the standards were already in effect federally, and the state was adopting them for enforcement purposes.

8. **Learn Everywhere Program**: The committee revisited the Learn Everywhere program rules, which had been previously objected to in 2019. Concerns remained about the Board of Education's authority to mandate that schools accept credits from alternative programs. A motion for a preliminary objection failed, and the committee ultimately approved the rule changes.

9. **Meeting Schedule**: The committee voted to move the June meeting from Friday to Thursday and canceled a continued meeting.

The meeting concluded with the adjournment of the session.
