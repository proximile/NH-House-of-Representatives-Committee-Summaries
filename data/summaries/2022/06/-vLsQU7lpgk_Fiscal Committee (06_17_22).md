**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting on June 17, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on June 17, 2022, to address a wide range of issues related to state employment, program funding, infrastructure improvements, and technology investments. The meeting was divided into three segments, each focusing on distinct but interconnected topics. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **1. State Employment and Workforce Challenges**
The committee began by addressing significant challenges in state employment, including recruitment and retention. Key points included:
- **State Employment Stagnation**: Concerns were raised about individuals applying for state jobs but not securing them, leading to a sense of stagnation. Efforts to address this issue were acknowledged, though it was noted that the situation might worsen before improving.
- **Retirees Returning to Work**: The committee discussed the potential for retirees to return to part-time employment due to economic pressures like inflation. Examples were given of retirees who returned to work, highlighting the benefits of hiring experienced individuals who require minimal training.
- **Non-Classified Positions**: The nature of non-classified positions in the state workforce was clarified. These roles, often political appointees or legislative employees, are temporary and not part of a structured pay scale. Specific mention was made of non-classified employees at Hampstead Hospital undergoing evaluation for their roles.

### **2. Recruitment and Retention Programs**
The committee reviewed several initiatives aimed at improving employee retention and recruitment, particularly in critical areas like direct care positions:
- **Incentive Programs**: A referral incentive program and a retention incentive program were discussed. The retention program, which includes bonuses for employees who stay for a specified period, was approved unanimously (10-0).
- **Case Management Systems**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) plans to consolidate older case management systems, leveraging existing licenses for platforms like Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics 365.
- **Judicial Branch and Department of Corrections**: The committee approved a request from the judicial branch and commended the Department of Corrections for its cost-saving efforts through the 340B pharmaceutical program. Recruitment and retention strategies in the corrections system were also discussed.
- **Sununu Youth Center**: Concerns about abuse allegations at the Sununu Youth Center were addressed, with the Department of Corrections outlining its compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and efforts to prevent such issues.

- **Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery**: A $50 million program to fund infrastructure improvements in county nursing homes was approved. The program focuses on HVAC and energy efficiency upgrades to mitigate future pandemic risks, though concerns were raised about the 60-40 funding match requirement.
