The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Education Committee meeting, held on June 7, 2022, focused on **House Bill 1229**, an interim study examining school meal programs, particularly breakfast and nutrition standards. The meeting was chaired by **Representative Sue Mullen**, with committee members including **Representative Art Ellison** and **Representative Oliver Ford**. Key topics discussed included:

1. **Interim Study Purpose**: The committee is evaluating whether further legislation is needed to address school meal programs, specifically focusing on bills like **HB 1229**, **HB 1561** (nutrition standards), **HB 1564** (breakfast programs), **HB 1657** (farm-to-school reimbursement), and **HB 1660** (breakfast bill).

2. **School Breakfast Programs**: Representatives highlighted the importance of school breakfast programs, noting that New Hampshire ranks **47th in the nation** for breakfast participation, leaving an estimated **7,800 children** without breakfast daily. The committee discussed the impact of breakfast on student performance and the potential loss of **$1.5 million** in federal funding due to low participation.

3. **Challenges and Solutions**: Challenges such as **stigma**, **startup costs**, and **staffing issues** were addressed. The committee explored solutions like **"breakfast after the bell"** programs, which have increased participation in schools like those in Nashua.

4. **Medicaid Direct Certification**: The committee discussed the potential of using **Medicaid data** to automatically certify students for free and reduced meals, reducing paperwork and increasing access. Concerns about **privacy** were addressed, with assurances that no parent-level data would be shared.

5. **Summer Meal Programs**: The committee noted the impending end of **federal waivers** that allowed universal free meals during the pandemic, which could lead to reduced summer meal access for children.

6. **Public and Charter Schools**: The committee considered whether **charter schools** and **private schools** should meet the same meal program standards as public schools.

7. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to meet with the **Department of Education** and **New Hampshire Hunger Solutions** to gather more data and develop recommendations. The interim study report is due by the end of October 2022.

The meeting emphasized the importance of addressing **child hunger** in New Hampshire and exploring legislative and programmatic solutions to ensure all students have access to nutritious meals.
