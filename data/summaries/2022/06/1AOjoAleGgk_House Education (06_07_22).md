The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House Education Committee, chaired by Representative Sue Mullen, focused on school meal programs and related legislation. The committee discussed several bills, including **House Bill 1229**, which initiates an interim study on school meal programs, and other bills addressing school breakfast, nutrition standards, and food insecurity. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Legislation Overview**: The committee reviewed multiple bills related to school meals, such as **HB 1561** (nutrition standards), **HB 1564** (breakfast programs), **HB 1657** (farm-to-school reimbursement), and **HB 1660** (school breakfast expansion). These bills aim to address food insecurity, improve nutrition, and expand access to meals for students.

2. **School Breakfast Program**: Representatives highlighted the low participation rates in school breakfast programs in New Hampshire, which ranks 47th nationally. They discussed strategies to increase participation, such as "breakfast after the bell" programs, and the benefits of ensuring students are fed for better academic performance.

3. **Federal Funding and Waivers**: The committee noted that federal waivers allowing universal free school meals during the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire in June 2022, which could lead to reduced meal access for students. They also discussed the potential loss of $1.5 million in federal funding due to low breakfast participation.

4. **Medicaid Direct Certification**: A proposed **Medicaid Direct Certification** program would streamline the process of identifying students eligible for free and reduced meals, reducing the need for parents to fill out forms. Concerns about data privacy were addressed, with assurances that only child-level data would be shared.

5. **Hunger and Food Insecurity**: Representatives emphasized the importance of addressing hunger among students, noting that food insecurity affects learning and health outcomes. They discussed the role of school nurses, teachers, and community programs in supporting students who lack access to meals.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to meet with the Department of Education to gather more data on school meal programs, costs, and participation rates. They also aim to compile questions for the DOE to address in future meetings.

7. **Broader Implications**: The committee acknowledged the need to address hunger across all types of schools, including charter and private schools, and considered the impact of poverty and homelessness on students' access to meals.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue studying the issue and potentially recommend future legislation to improve school meal programs and reduce food insecurity among students.
