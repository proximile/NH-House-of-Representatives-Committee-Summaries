The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on June 15, 2022, centered on the operations and challenges of the **New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights (NHCHR)**, particularly in handling employment and housing discrimination cases. The discussions, led by the House Judiciary Committee, highlighted systemic inefficiencies, resource constraints, and the need for legislative and process reforms to ensure fair and timely resolutions for claimants. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points covered in the meeting:

### **Key Issues and Challenges**
1. **Case Processing Delays**:
   - The NHCHR faces significant delays in processing discrimination cases, with some cases taking **over a year** to be assigned to an investigator and **3-5 years** to reach a probable cause determination. These delays often force claimants to withdraw their cases and file in court due to the **three-year statute of limitations**.
   - The commission schedules **three hearings per month**, but many cases settle or are withdrawn before reaching a hearing, contributing to a backlog.

2. **Resource Constraints**:
   - The NHCHR is **understaffed**, with only **four investigators** available to handle the volume of cases. This lack of resources exacerbates delays and hinders the commission’s ability to process cases efficiently.
   - Despite internal process improvements, the commission remains constrained by **budgetary and staffing limitations**.

3. **Right of Removal**:
   - New Hampshire is one of only **two states** that allows **respondents (defendants)** to remove cases to superior court after a probable cause finding. This practice often disadvantages claimants, particularly those who are **unrepresented** and lack the resources to navigate the court system.
   - Testimony and discussion highlighted that court rulings generally do not favor this practice, and it disproportionately burdens employees and other claimants.

4. **Impact on Claimants**:
   - Delays and the right of removal create significant challenges for claimants, especially those who cannot afford **legal representation**. Many claimants are forced to withdraw their cases or file independently in court, often facing an uneven playing field.
   - The commission is working to provide better resources for unrepresented claimants, such as **intake toolkits** and **damages worksheets**, to help them navigate the process without legal advice.

### **Proposed Solutions and Legislative Considerations**
1. **Interim Study Session**:
   - The committee decided to conduct an **interim study session** to explore the NHCHR’s operations in depth, focusing on **due process**, **timeliness**, and potential **legislative solutions**.
   - The study will include gathering more data and creating a **detailed process map** to better understand the commission’s workflow and identify areas for improvement.

2. **Potential Legislative Changes**:
   - Suggestions were made to **remove the respondent’s right of removal** to superior court, limiting it to claimants. This change would align New Hampshire with the majority of states and reduce the burden on claimants.
   - Other ideas included **revising statutory or rule-based barriers** to efficiency, such as streamlining case processing and increasing staffing levels.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Some committee members advocated for comparing New Hampshire’s processes with those of other states to identify **best practices** and potential reforms.

4. **Internal Improvements**:
   - The NHCHR has made internal process improvements, including efforts to enhance **mediation** and **conciliation**, which currently result in a **51% settlement rate** for conciliated cases. However, many cases are removed to court before hearings can occur.

### **Broader Implications**
- The discussions underscored the need for **systemic improvements** to ensure the NHCHR can effectively address discrimination cases. This includes balancing the rights of both claimants and defendants while addressing resource constraints and process inefficiencies.
- The committee emphasized the importance of **public input** and collaboration with stakeholders, including attorneys and the NHCHR Executive Director, to develop meaningful reforms.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee plans to conduct a **comprehensive review** of the NHCHR’s operations, focusing on **resource allocation**, **process efficiency**, and **legislative support**.
- The interim study session will serve as a foundation for potential legislative action in the future, aiming to create a fairer and more efficient system for resolving discrimination cases in New Hampshire.

In summary, the meeting highlighted the urgent need for reforms to address the NHCHR’s challenges, ensuring that discrimination cases are resolved in a timely and equitable manner. The committee’s focus on data-driven analysis, stakeholder input, and legislative action reflects a commitment to improving the commission’s effectiveness and protecting the rights of all parties involved.
