**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on June 22, 2022 (House Resources, Recreation and Development Committee)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on June 22, 2022, to address a wide range of issues related to environmental protection, resource management, recreational safety, and cultural preservation. The meeting was divided into three key segments, each focusing on distinct but interconnected topics.

### **Segment 1: Boat Registration Revenue Allocation and African American Burial Grounds Legislation**

1. **Boat Registration Revenue Allocation**:
   - The committee discussed the distribution of boat registration fees, currently split with 60% going to the state and 40% to towns. Concerns were raised about the $1.7 million allocated to other state agencies and the need to revise the current system to ensure proper revenue allocation.
   - The state is collaborating with the Coast Guard to find solutions that comply with federal requirements while preserving funds for external agencies. The discussion emphasized the importance of towns receiving funds for waterfront improvements, combating aquatic invasive species, and maintaining docks.

2. **African American Burial Grounds Legislation**:
   - A bill aimed at protecting African American burial sites, particularly those from the period of enslavement, was a focal point. The bill seeks to involve descendant communities in decisions regarding these sites.
   - Proposals included designating a representative organization for the African American descendant community, similar to the process for Native American graves. The bill also addresses the examination and repatriation of remains of African Americans from the period of enslavement.
   - The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire was highlighted for its efforts in commemorating African Americans in the state through markers and monuments.

The segment concluded with logistical discussions about forming subcommittees to further address these issues and the need for more input from affected communities and stakeholders.

### **Segment 2: Environmental Protection and Resource Management**

1. **PFAS Bills**:
   - The committee reviewed several bills addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water. Concerns were raised about the scientific basis for proposed maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), with the Department of Environmental Services (DES) opposing some bills due to evolving EPA guidance. The committee emphasized the need to wait for federal science to inform state policies.

2. **Renaming DES**:
   - A proposal to rename the Department of Environmental Services to the Department of Environmental Protection was strongly opposed by DES officials, citing unnecessary costs and the importance of the "services" aspect of their mission.

3. **Private Drinking Water Wells**:
   - A bill assigning oversight of private drinking water wells to DES was discussed. DES argued they already have the authority and process to address water quality issues, including arsenic contamination, without additional legislation.

4. **Off-Highway Recreational Vehicles**:
   - A bill establishing a safety program for off-highway vehicles and snowmobiles was discussed. The committee considered deferring the bill to a newly proposed commission for further evaluation, as it overlaps with existing statutes and addresses different vehicle types.

5. **Merrimack River Protection**:
   - A bill to designate part of the Merrimack River as a protected river was discussed. DES suggested following the existing statutory process for such designations and highlighted the need to address water withdrawal concerns related to PFAS contamination.

6. **Boat Registration Fees**:
   - The committee addressed issues with boat registration fees, particularly the conflict between state and town revenue collection and compliance with federal regulations. Marine Patrol and DMV officials highlighted the need for legislative changes to streamline the process and ensure compliance with federal funding requirements.

Overall, the meeting emphasized the need for careful consideration of scientific evidence, federal guidance, and existing state processes in crafting new legislation. The committee opted against forming subcommittees for most bills, planning to address them in executive sessions later in the year.

### **Segment 3: Septic Systems, Nitrogen Pollution, and Water Quality**

The committee held a work session to discuss interim study bills, particularly **Senate Bill 257 (SB 257)** and **House Bill 426 (HB 426)**, which address issues related to septic systems, nitrogen pollution, and water quality in the Great Bay Estuary and other water bodies.

1. **Nitrogen Pollution and Great Bay Estuary**:
   - The history of nitrogen pollution in the Great Bay Estuary was explained, with emphasis on the decline of eelgrass due to excess nitrogen. Nitrogen sources include wastewater treatment plants, atmospheric deposition, and fertilizers.
   - The **Great Bay Nitrogen General Permit** was introduced as an innovative approach to regulate nitrogen discharge across the watershed, allowing communities to track and reduce nitrogen emissions.

2. **Septic Systems and Utilities**:
   - SB 257 proposes the creation of septic utilities, where communities could manage and upgrade septic systems to reduce nitrogen pollution. Homeowners would pay a fee, and the utility would handle maintenance and upgrades.
   - This approach is seen as a potential solution for areas with failing septic systems, particularly in lake communities where sewering is not feasible.

3. **Challenges and Concerns**:
   - The cost to private property owners was a significant concern. While the utility model could spread costs, there were questions about whether homeowners would be forced into the system and how costs would compare to maintaining their own septic systems.
   - The committee discussed the need for additional expertise to understand the implications of the utility model and how it would be implemented.

4. **HB 426: Septic System Assessments**:
   - The bill focuses on improving septic system assessments to prevent failures and protect water quality. There was debate over the definition of "failure" and how assessments should be conducted to ensure buyers and sellers are protected.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee considered forming a subcommittee to further investigate the bills, particularly to address concerns about costs, implementation, and the science behind the proposed solutions.
   - Additional testimony from experts and stakeholders was suggested to provide clarity on the technical and financial aspects of the bills.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing various environmental and cultural issues in New Hampshire. Key discussions included the need to revise boat registration fee allocations, protect African American burial grounds, manage PFAS contamination, and improve water quality through innovative approaches to septic system management. The committee emphasized the importance of scientific evidence, federal guidance, and stakeholder input in crafting effective legislation. Plans were made to continue discussions, potentially through subcommittees, to refine the proposed bills and address outstanding concerns.
