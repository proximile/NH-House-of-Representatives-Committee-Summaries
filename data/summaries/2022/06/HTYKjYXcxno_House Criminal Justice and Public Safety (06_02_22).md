**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (06/02/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on June 2, 2022, for a work session that included discussions on multiple interim study bills and concluded with farewell remarks from a departing member. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Key Decisions and Discussions**

1. **SB 98/HB 292: Notification of Parolee/Probationer Arrests**
   - **Discussion**: The bill addressed the need for parole and probation officers to be notified when their parolees or probationers were arrested. The issue was resolved without legislation through an IT solution that automatically notifies officers of such arrests.
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously voted **not to recommend** future legislation, as the issue had been resolved through administrative measures.

2. **HB 205: Incarceration Under Suspended Sentence**
   - **Discussion**: The committee discussed whether to recommend future legislation related to incarcerated individuals petitioning to suspend their sentences. An amendment, previously worked on with the Commissioner of Corrections, was referenced. It proposed that individuals serving minimum sentences of six years or more could petition to suspend their sentence within 12 months of serving two-thirds of their sentence, while those with shorter sentences could petition after serving two-thirds of their minimum sentence.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **not to recommend** future legislation, as the amendment was incorporated into **SB 34**, which had already been signed into law.

3. **HB 253: Body Cameras for Law Enforcement**
   - **Discussion**: The bill proposed requiring law enforcement officers to use body cameras and establishing a grant program to assist agencies with the purchase of body-worn cameras. It was noted that **HB 401**, which provided grant money for body cameras, had already been signed into law.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **not to recommend** future legislation, as the issue had been addressed by **HB 401**.

4. **HB 526: Fines for Sale or Possession of Cannabis**
   - **Discussion**: The bill aimed to reduce penalties for first-time drug possession and repeal certain mandatory minimum sentences. There was debate over whether to decriminalize personal possession of cannabis, with concerns raised about the lack of an age limit in the bill.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **not to recommend** future legislation, though some members expressed support for decriminalizing personal possession of cannabis.

5. **HB 1105: Earn Time Credits**
   - **Discussion**: The bill addressed earn time credits for incarcerated individuals who complete educational or rehabilitation programs. The Commissioner of Corrections explained that the department had already paused certain tablet-based programs due to technical issues and was reviewing the process for awarding earn time credits.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **not to recommend** future legislation, as the Department of Corrections was already addressing the issue internally.

6. **HB 1127: Posthumous Exonerations and Annulments**
   - **Discussion**: The bill aimed to allow posthumous exonerations for individuals wrongly convicted of crimes, such as witchcraft in the 1600s and 1700s. Some members argued that the bill was a way to acknowledge past injustices, while others expressed concerns about revisiting historical events.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **to recommend** future legislation, with a majority supporting the bill as a way to correct historical wrongs.

7. **HB 1232: Reducing Penalties for First-Time Drug Possession**
   - **Discussion**: The bill proposed reducing penalties for first-time drug possession and repealing certain mandatory minimum sentences. There was debate over whether mandatory minimums tie the hands of judges and whether reducing penalties would encourage drug use.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **not to recommend** future legislation, with concerns raised about the potential impact on drug use and the judicial process.

8. **HB 1281: Access to Firearms Confiscated Under Protective Orders**
   - **Discussion**: The bill aimed to allow individuals subject to protective orders to have relatives access or dispose of their confiscated firearms. Concerns were raised about the potential risks of allowing access to firearms in domestic violence cases.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **not to recommend** future legislation, as the issue required further research and consultation with stakeholders, including domestic violence advocates.

### **Closing Remarks and Farewell**

- **Chairman's Remarks**: The chairman thanked everyone for their work over the past couple of years, announced the end of the work session on HB 292, and expressed appreciation for the committee's efforts. He also mentioned providing early Christmas presents (likely reports) and wished everyone a good summer and success in their races.
- **Farewell Speech**: A departing member (likely the chairman) reflected on his tenure as the first chairman of the committee, emphasizing the importance of the committee's work. He encouraged members to diligently review bills, noting that some are simple while others are complex. He expressed his well-wishes, mentioned his plans to testify on bills in the future, and hinted at returning on veto day. The meeting concluded with thanks to the committee and adjournment.

### **Key Themes**

- **Legislative Efficiency**: Several bills were not recommended for future legislation because the issues had already been addressed through other laws or administrative solutions.
- **Historical Justice**: The committee supported the idea of posthumous exonerations as a way to acknowledge and correct past injustices.
- **Public Safety Concerns**: Bills related to firearms and drug possession were approached cautiously, with concerns about public safety and the potential for unintended consequences.

The committee demonstrated a cautious approach, often deferring to existing laws or administrative solutions rather than recommending new legislation. The meeting concluded with a sense of accomplishment and appreciation for the committee's collective efforts.
