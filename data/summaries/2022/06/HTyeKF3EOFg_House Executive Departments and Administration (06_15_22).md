### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration (June 15, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on June 15, 2022, focused on several key issues related to environmental regulations, public health, and safety, with discussions centered around three main topics: grease trap regulations, massage therapy licensing, and medical spa oversight. The meeting emphasized the need for clearer regulations, better inter-agency coordination, and a balance between public safety, environmental protection, and business needs.

#### **1. Environmental Regulations and Grease Trap Requirements**  
The meeting addressed regulatory and procedural issues related to grease traps and septic systems, particularly in food establishments. Key points included:

- **Environmental Oversight**: Concerns were raised about the lack of re-inspection or permitting when businesses change ownership, potentially leading to environmental harm. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) emphasized the need for rules to protect groundwater and septic systems from grease contamination.
  
- **Case Study**: A specific case was discussed where a small restaurant transitioning to serving fried food was required to install a 1,000-gallon grease trap, despite minimal grease discharge. DES defended the requirement, citing the potential for future misuse by new owners.

- **Regulatory Overlap**: Confusion and overlap between DES rules and the state building code were highlighted, particularly regarding grease trap installation and sizing. Representatives questioned whether DES had the authority to impose rules that conflict with the building code without approval from the Building Code Review Board.

- **Proposed Solutions**: Suggestions included better communication between DES and the Building Code Review Board, studying other states' processes, and clarifying rules to avoid conflicts. A follow-up meeting in late September was proposed to develop a conceptual agreement on potential rule changes or amendments to the building code.

#### **2. House Bill 1312: Grease Trap Regulations**  
The discussion on **House Bill 1312** focused on clarifying regulations for grease traps in food establishments. Key points included:

- **Purpose**: The bill aims to address confusion between DES rules and the state building code, particularly the plumbing code. DES requires grease traps to prevent environmental contamination, while the plumbing code focuses on installation and sizing.

- **Enforcement Concerns**: Representatives criticized the rigidity of DES rules, which mandate large grease traps without considering actual grease production, leading to unnecessary financial burdens for small businesses.

- **Jurisdictional Issues**: Debate centered on whether DES rules conflict with state statutes, particularly RSA 155a, which prohibits state agencies from amending the building code without board approval.

- **Next Steps**: The committee proposed collaboration between DES and the Building Code Review Board to align rules and create a unified set of guidelines. A final recommendation report is expected in September 2022.

#### **3. House Bill 1429: Massage Therapy Licensing**  
The committee discussed **House Bill 1429**, which aims to regulate massage therapy establishments. Key points included:

- **Focus on Public Health and Safety**: The bill emphasizes sanitary conditions and hygiene in massage therapy establishments. Concerns were raised about the inclusion of law enforcement aspects, such as human trafficking and prostitution, which were seen as outside the scope of the licensing board's responsibilities.

- **Amendments**: The committee proposed removing law enforcement-related language and focusing solely on health and safety. Inspectors can report criminal activity but cannot shut down businesses directly.

- **Outcome**: The committee voted 4-0 to recommend the bill for future legislation, with a focus on refining its language.

#### **4. House Bill 1444: Medical Spa Registration**  
The discussion on **House Bill 1444** addressed the regulation of medical spas, which perform cosmetic procedures with medical implications (e.g., Botox, fillers). Key points included:

- **Public Safety Concerns**: The committee highlighted issues with "medical directors" who sell their names to spas without active oversight, potentially endangering public safety.

- **Proposed Legislation**: The bill would require registration (not licensure) of medical spas and clarify the role of medical directors to ensure proper qualifications and oversight.

- **Terminology**: The committee considered changing the term "medical spa" to "medical cosmetology" to better reflect the medical nature of the services provided.

- **Outcome**: The committee voted 3-0 to recommend the bill for future legislation, with a focus on refining the language to address public health and safety concerns.

---

#### **Additional Discussion and Outcomes**  
- **Licensing vs. Registration**: The committee debated the differences between licensing and registration, emphasizing the need to ensure public safety without overburdening businesses.
- **Inspections and Enforcement**: Qualified inspectors were deemed essential to oversee compliance with health and safety standards in both massage therapy establishments and medical spas.
- **Comparison with Other States**: The committee reviewed regulations in neighboring states like Massachusetts and Connecticut to inform their approach.
- **Next Steps**: The committee voted to recommend both **House Bill 1429** and **House Bill 1444** for future legislation, with a focus on refining their language to address public health and safety concerns while clarifying the roles of licensing boards and inspectors.
