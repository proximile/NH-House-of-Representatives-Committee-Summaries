### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (June 16, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on June 16, 2022, to discuss and approve various administrative rules across multiple departments. The meeting focused on key issues, including ignition interlock devices (IIDs), in-home supports, child care providers, opioid abatement, and emergency rules for pharmacy and safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Ignition Interlock Devices (IIDs)**
   - **Requirements and Concerns**: Drivers with suspended licenses must install IIDs to operate vehicles. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) sets standards for IIDs, including an alcohol concentration threshold of 0.020, which is stricter than the statutory violation threshold of 0.025. A former police officer raised concerns that the DMV’s standards exceed statutory requirements, potentially leading to penalties or delays for drivers.
   - **Statutory Ambiguity**: The statute does not explicitly define the alcohol concentration threshold for IIDs but penalizes drivers with a concentration of 0.025 or higher.
   - **Committee Action**: The committee accepted a late-filed conditional approval request for the rule and moved to approve it, requesting further clarification on the alcohol set point issue.

---

#### **2. In-Home Supports Rule**
   - **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Objection Response**: The committee reviewed DHHS’s response to objections regarding the in-home supports rule. After public testimony and discussion, the rule was approved, though some members expressed concerns about conflating Medicaid state plans with the in-home supports waiver.

---

#### **3. Child Care Providers Rule**
   - **Changes Proposed**: The rule would no longer allow licensed exempt child care providers to receive reimbursement before criminal records checks are completed. A revised fiscal impact statement was submitted, but concerns were raised about the process for amending fiscal impact statements under RSA 541A.

---

#### **4. Home Visiting for Prenatal and Family Support Services**
   - **Fiscal Impact**: A significant fiscal impact was noted due to statutory changes. The rule was approved without further discussion.

---

#### **5. Opioid Abatement Trust Fund and Advisory Commission**
   - **RFP Process**: Rules were proposed to establish a request for proposal (RFP) process for distributing funds from the opioid abatement trust fund. The agency filed an amended conditional approval request, and the committee discussed the delay in bringing these rules forward.

---

#### **6. Sanitary Production and Distribution of Food**
   - **Postponement**: This rule was postponed to the next meeting to allow the agency to file an amended conditional approval request.

---

#### **7. Insurance Department Rule**
   - **Long-Term Care Insurance**: A rule based on the NAIC model for long-term care insurance was discussed. Concerns were raised about the rule potentially superseding state statute, but it was clarified that the rule only specifies that certain statutes do not apply to long-term care products. The committee conditionally approved the rule, requesting rewording of a specific section for clarity.

---

#### **8. Pharmacy Board Emergency Rule**
   - **Contrast Media Shortage**: An emergency rule was proposed to allow single-dose vials of contrast media for CT scans to be used for more than one patient due to a severe shortage. The rule was deemed necessary and approved.

---

#### **9. General Meeting Procedures**
   - **Approval of Minutes and Consent Agenda**: The meeting began with the approval of previous meeting minutes and the consent agenda without objections.
   - **Postponement of Items**: Items 8a and 9a/b were postponed, with a waiver requested for 9a/b due to a response deadline before the July meeting.

---

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
   - **Legislative Intent and Public Safety**: Discussions emphasized the importance of aligning rules with legislative intent and ensuring public safety.
   - **Conditional Approvals and Amendments**: Many rules were approved with conditions or requests for further amendments to address concerns about clarity, fiscal impact, and statutory alignment.
   - **Emergency Measures**: Emergency rules, such as those for contrast media shortages, were swiftly approved to address urgent public health needs.

The meeting concluded with no further business and was adjourned.
