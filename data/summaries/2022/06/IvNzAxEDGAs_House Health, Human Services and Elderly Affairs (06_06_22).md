**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (06/06/22)**

On June 6, 2022, the New Hampshire House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened to review several health-related bills and issues, focusing on opioid treatment alternatives, COVID-19 mandates, public health policies, alternative therapies, and telemedicine. The meeting emphasized evidence-based approaches, collaboration with stakeholders, and the balance between individual rights, community safety, and local control. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Opioid Treatment and Alternative Therapies**

   - The committee reviewed **House Bill 247**, which addresses treatment alternatives for opioid use.
   - **Key Concerns**: Members expressed reservations about legislating medical treatment sequences, particularly non-opioid directives, as it could encroach on medical practice.

However, concerns were raised about mandating specific therapies without broader evidence-based approaches.
   - **Commerce Committee’s Role**: The committee agreed that insurance coverage issues should be addressed by the Commerce Committee rather than the Health Committee.
   - **Future Recommendations**: The committee recommended further legislation focusing on access and affordability of alternative therapies, avoiding overly prescriptive mandates.

   - The committee discussed **Senate Bill 290**, which permits the practice of auriculotherapy (inserting needles into the ear) under certain limitations.
   - **Regulation and Licensing**: Members emphasized the need for proper training, certification, and oversight for auriculotherapy practitioners, rather than deregulation.
   - **Integration with Pain Management**: Some members suggested integrating this bill with House Bill 247 to address pain management holistically, though others cautioned against conflating the two issues.
   - **Role of the Acupuncture Board**: The committee considered asking the Acupuncture Board to develop protocols for auriculotherapy to ensure proper regulation and training.
