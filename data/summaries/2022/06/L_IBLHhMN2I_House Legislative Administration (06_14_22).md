**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Legislative Administration Meeting (06/14/22):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Committee convened on June 14, 2022, to discuss legislative ethics, conflict of interest, recusal rules, and the specifics of **House Bill 1368**. The meeting focused on clarifying ethical standards, addressing public concerns, and refining legislative processes to ensure accountability and transparency.

### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Conflict of Interest and Recusal**:
   - Members debated the need for clearer guidelines on recusal, particularly when legislators have financial or personal interests in legislation. The discussion emphasized balancing ethical obligations with the practical necessity of maintaining a quorum for critical votes, such as budgets.
   - The committee explored whether **disclosure** of a conflict is sufficient or if **mandatory recusal** should be the standard. Some argued that disclosure alone does not mitigate conflicts, while others highlighted the challenges of recusal in cases where bills affect broad groups (e.g., property taxes or state retirement systems).

2. **Ethics and Public Perception**:
   - Concerns were raised about public perception of legislators' integrity, with frequent complaints about conflicts of interest and misconduct, particularly on social media. Members acknowledged that the public often misunderstands the limited jurisdiction of the ethics committee.
   - The committee discussed the importance of addressing these concerns to maintain trust in the legislative process.

3. **Proposed Changes to Ethics Rules**:
   - Potential amendments to ethics rules were considered, including the ability to admonish legislators for minor misconduct without formal hearings.
   - The committee debated refining definitions of **conflicts of interest**, including the terms **"economic interest"** and **"financial interest,"** for clarity. They also discussed adding exceptions for certain legislative actions, such as voting on budgets.
   - The **"Principles of Public Service,"** currently aspirational, were scrutinized. Some members suggested changing the language from **"shall"** to **"should"** to clarify that these principles are not legally binding.

4. **House Bill 1368**:
   - The work session focused on **HB 1368**, which addresses ethics, conflict of interest, and recusal rules. The committee aimed to determine whether the bill should move forward, be terminated, or be resubmitted in September.
   - A significant portion of the discussion centered on the definition of **"household member."** The current definition requires living in the same domicile, but the committee considered expanding it to include individuals who contribute to daily living expenses, even if they don’t live together (e.g., divorced couples).
   - The bill’s use of **"special interest"** was critiqued, particularly the phrase **"substantially greater than the benefit of the public at large."** Some members felt this language was unnecessary and confusing.

5. **Practical Challenges and Simplification**:
   - Legislators raised concerns about the practicality of applying ethics rules, especially in a citizen legislature where members may lack legal expertise. They noted the complexity of the ethics guidelines and the difficulty of navigating them without assistance.
   - Suggestions were made to create a **simplified decision tree**, **laminated guide**, or even an **app** to help legislators quickly determine when to disclose or recuse, rather than relying on the lengthy ethics booklet.

6. **Harassment Policy**:
   - The conversation touched on the General Court’s harassment policy, which is not enforceable by the ethics committee. Members considered whether future legislation should address this gap.

7. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee planned to review and refine their recommendations for future legislation, with a focus on clarifying ethics rules, addressing public concerns, and improving practical guidance for legislators.
   - Proposed amendments to HB 1368 included revising definitions, removing ambiguous language, and ensuring the bill provides clear and actionable guidelines.

### Conclusion:
The meeting highlighted the complexity of defining and enforcing ethical standards in a citizen legislature. The committee emphasized the need for **clarity**, **practicality**, and **accountability** in ethics rules, while balancing the challenges of maintaining a functional legislative process. Further discussions and recommendations are expected in future meetings, with the goal of fostering public trust and ensuring ethical conduct among legislators.
