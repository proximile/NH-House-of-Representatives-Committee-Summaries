**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting (06/08/22)**

On June 8, 2022, the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened to review and make recommendations on several bills previously sent to interim study. The committee focused on a range of legislative issues, emphasizing careful consideration, inclusivity, and data-driven decision-making. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Bills Reviewed and Decisions Made**

1. **House Bill 124 (Uniform Real Property Transfer on Death Act)**  
   The committee recommended **further legislation** for this bill, which seeks to adopt a uniform act related to real property transfers upon death. The motion was made by Representative Smith and seconded by Representative Sylvia.

2. **House Bill 248 (Judicial Retirement Plan)**  
   The committee decided **not to recommend further legislation**, concluding there was no continuing need for legislative action. The motion passed without discussion.

3. **House Bill 379 (Electronic Notice)**  
   The committee debated the complexities of transitioning to electronic notices, particularly under the Right-to-Know law. Concerns about accessibility for citizens without electronic access were raised. Ultimately, the committee voted **not to recommend further legislation**, though it acknowledged the issue may need future attention.

4. **House Bill 1181 (Biological Father's Right to Petition for Injunction Against Abortion)**  
   This bill sparked significant discussion. Representative Walker proposed forming a subcommittee for further study, but no other members volunteered. The committee decided **not to recommend further legislation**, leaving the option for Representative Walker and other interested parties to pursue the issue independently.

5. **House Bill 1389 (Superior Court Land Use Review Docket)**  
   The committee debated the creation of a specialized docket for land use appeals, weighing the benefits of expediting cases against resource allocation challenges. Representative Lynn, the bill’s sponsor, expressed ambivalence about its prioritization given broader judicial backlogs. The committee decided to **make no recommendation** at this time, opting to await further data from a judicial branch time study and consider the issue in the context of the upcoming budget cycle.

6. **House Bill 1435 (Support Person for Domestic Violence Victims During Testimony)**  
   The committee voted **not to recommend further legislation**, deferring to the reconstituted Domestic Violence Task Force to address the issue.

8. **Senate Bill 296 (Complaint Procedures Before the Commission for Human Rights)**  
   The committee decided to **form a study committee** to further examine the issue, with Representative McLean leading the effort.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**

- **Resource Prioritization**: The committee repeatedly emphasized the importance of allocating judicial resources effectively, particularly in light of systemic backlogs in criminal cases and small claims.  
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Decisions were often deferred pending further data, such as the judicial branch’s time study, to ensure informed recommendations.  
- **Collaborative Approach**: All votes during the session were unanimous, reflecting a cooperative and thoughtful approach to addressing complex issues.  
- **Inclusivity and Accessibility**: Concerns about ensuring legislative changes are inclusive and accessible, particularly in discussions about electronic notices and domestic violence protections, were a recurring focus.  
- **Future Considerations**: The committee acknowledged that several issues, such as electronic notices and land use dockets, may require future attention, either through independent efforts or further study.

The committee adjourned with plans to reconvene in the fall to finalize recommendations based on additional study and input.
