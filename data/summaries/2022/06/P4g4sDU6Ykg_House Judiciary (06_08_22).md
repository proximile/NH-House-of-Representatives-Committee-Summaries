The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on June 8, 2022, for a meeting that included both a general session and a work session focused on advancing and evaluating several legislative items. The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to thorough study, collaboration, and thoughtful decision-making on complex and contentious issues. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### General Session Highlights:
1. **Bill Recommendations**:
   - The committee reviewed two similar bills, noting that the first three pages were identical, with differences only on page four. Concerns were raised about the uncertainty of passing one of the bills due to its content.

2. **Study Committee Formation**:
   - Representative McLean proposed forming a study committee to examine complaint procedures and cases before the Commission for Human Rights. Representatives Wolpers, Smith, and Lorenzo expressed interest in joining, and Representative McLean was suggested to chair the committee.
   - A work group meeting was scheduled for June 15, 2022, at 1:00 PM to allow community members to contribute to the subcommittee’s work.

3. **Motions and Votes**:
   - A motion to appoint the study committee was made by Representative Wolpers and seconded. The committee voted unanimously in favor of forming the committee and postponed further decisions until its findings were reviewed.

4. **Closing Remarks**:
   - The meeting concluded with unanimous votes on all matters, and the chair acknowledged the committee’s collaborative efforts. A full committee meeting was planned for the fall to confirm or vote on the suggestions made during the session, including those from the subcommittee.

### Work Session Highlights:
The committee evaluated several bills that had been sent to interim study, deciding whether to recommend further legislation, recommend against further legislation, or establish subcommittees for further study. Key discussions and decisions included:

1. **House Bill 124 (Uniform Real Property Transfer on Death Act)**:
   - The committee recommended further legislation, with external groups expected to refine the bill for reintroduction.

2. **House Bill 248 (Judicial Retirement Plan)**:
   - The committee recommended no further legislation, as an actuarial study indicated no significant impact on state contributions.

3. **House Bill 379 (Electronic Notice)**:
   - The committee debated the complexities of transitioning from traditional newspaper notices to electronic notices, raising concerns about accessibility. Ultimately, they recommended no further legislation, acknowledging the issue’s importance but recognizing it wasn’t ready for immediate action.

4. **House Bill 1181 (Biological Father’s Right to Petition Against Abortion)**:
   - This bill sparked significant debate. While some members supported further study, others felt it was too contentious for a subcommittee. The committee decided to make no recommendation at this time, leaving the issue for future consideration.

5. **House Bill 1389 (Superior Court Land Use Review Docket)**:
   - The committee discussed the potential benefits of a specialized land use docket but deferred making a recommendation until more data from a judicial branch time study becomes available in mid-summer.

6. **House Bill 1435 (Victim’s Right to a Support Person in Domestic Violence Cases)**:
   - The committee recommended no further legislation, opting to defer to the reconstituted Domestic Violence Task Force to address the issue.

7. **Senate Bill 243 (Transfer on Death Deeds)**:
   - Similar to House Bill 124, the committee recommended further legislation, with external groups expected to refine the proposal.

### Overall Themes:
- **Collaboration and Study**: The committee emphasized the need for thorough study and collaboration with external stakeholders, particularly on complex or contentious issues.
- **Deferred Decisions**: Many decisions were deferred to allow for more data, broader legislative priorities, or alignment with task forces and external groups.
- **Unanimous Agreement**: The meeting concluded with unanimous votes on all matters, reflecting the committee’s collaborative approach.

The meeting also included lighthearted moments, such as apologies for scheduling confusion and remarks about the chair’s timing, adding a touch of levity to the proceedings. The committee’s work underscored its dedication to thoughtful and inclusive legislative processes.
