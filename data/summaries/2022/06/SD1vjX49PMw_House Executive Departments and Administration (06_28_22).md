The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee met on June 28, 2022, to discuss **HB 1061**, a bill concerning the **Midwifery Council**. The meeting began with an overview of the bill's history, which had undergone a public hearing on January 20, 2022, a subcommittee meeting on March 1, and an executive session on March 7, where an amendment was proposed and passed 18-1. The amendment aimed to restore midwives as a majority on the board, but the bill ultimately failed in a vote of 8-11 and was sent to interim study.

Key points of discussion included:
1. **Opposition to HB 1061**: The Midwifery Council, represented by Chair Sherry Stevens, opposed the bill because it would convert the council into an advisory committee under the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), stripping it of its autonomy and decision-making authority. The council argued that this would undermine the expertise of midwives and physicians in regulating the profession.
2. **Amendment Details**: The proposed amendment would have adjusted the board's composition to include one obstetrician, one pediatrician, three midwives, and possibly a public member. However, this amendment was not adopted, and the bill was sent to interim study.
3. **Concerns About Oversight**: Lindsay Courtney, Executive Director of OPLC, expressed concerns about the current structure of professional regulation in New Hampshire. She highlighted the need for oversight to ensure compliance with administrative and legal requirements, noting that active market participants (e.g., midwives) may not always prioritize public protection over professional interests.
4. **Collaboration and Future Legislation**: Both Stevens and Courtney expressed willingness to collaborate on future legislation that balances the council's autonomy with OPLC's oversight. Committee members agreed that further legislation should be pursued, using the amended version of HB 1061 as a framework.

The subcommittee unanimously recommended that future legislation be introduced to address the issues raised, with a focus on preserving midwifery autonomy while ensuring proper oversight. The full committee will review this recommendation.
