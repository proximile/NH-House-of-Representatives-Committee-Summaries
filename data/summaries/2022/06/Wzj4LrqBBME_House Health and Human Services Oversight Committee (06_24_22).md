**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (06/24/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on June 24, 2022, addressed a wide range of topics related to public health, mental health, substance abuse, and healthcare services. The meeting was divided into three key segments, each focusing on distinct but interconnected issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Cannabis Regulation and Public Health**
1. **Cannabis Pricing and Regulation**:
   - The committee highlighted the price disparity between unregulated cannabis (e.g., from caregivers) and regulated medical cannabis sold in dispensaries. Unregulated cannabis is significantly cheaper due to the absence of testing and pesticide regulations.
   - Prices in New Hampshire’s medical cannabis market were compared to Massachusetts, where recreational cannabis is more expensive due to taxes, but medical cannabis prices are comparable.
   - Senate Bill 162 was implemented, allowing patients to access all Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) in the state, fostering competition and modestly lowering prices. However, affordability remains a concern for many patients.

2. **Home Delivery and Cultivation**:
   - Discussions explored the potential benefits of allowing ATCs to offer mobile delivery services, particularly for patients with mobility or transportation issues. While ATCs are interested, current administrative rules prohibit home delivery, requiring a rule change.
   - Patients and ATCs expressed support for home cultivation of therapeutic cannabis, which could reduce costs and improve access.

3. **Public Health Concerns**:
   - The committee discussed the implementation of warning posters in dispensaries regarding cannabis use during pregnancy, lactation, adolescence, and accidental poisonings. Work is ongoing with the Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board to develop content for these warnings.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential for street cannabis to be laced with fentanyl, emphasizing the safety of the regulated cannabis market.
   - The possibility of regulating THC content in recreational cannabis products was discussed, with the aim of offering lower-potency options to mitigate risks such as psychotic reactions.

4. **Therapeutic Cannabis Program Update**:
   - Michael Holt, Section Administrator for the Division of Public Health Services, provided an annual report on the therapeutic cannabis program. The program has seen steady growth, with over 13,500 registered patients as of June 2022, primarily for chronic pain, PTSD, or cancer. Holt noted ongoing stigma among providers but emphasized that there has been no federal action against New Hampshire providers.

### **Mental Health and State Facilities**
1. **Hampstead Hospital Acquisition**:
   - Deputy Commissioner Lori Weaver provided an update on the state's acquisition of Hampstead Hospital. The transition has been smooth, with Wellpath Recovery Solutions managing clinical operations. The facility aims to meet the needs of New Hampshire's youth and families, with plans to establish the state's first psychiatric residential treatment facility (PRTF) within 180 days.
   - Staffing challenges, particularly in nursing and youth counseling, were noted, but temporary solutions have maintained stability. The hospital can accommodate 45 to 55 young people at any given time, and efforts are underway to reduce the waitlist, which currently stands at six children.

2. **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)**:
   - The SYSC is slated for closure by March 2023. The department is working on a design for a new facility but faces challenges in meeting the legislative deadline, prompting discussions about extending the closure date to ensure a smooth transition.

3. **Psychiatric Forensic Hospital**:
   - The construction of the new psychiatric forensic hospital is on track, with public information sessions and stakeholder involvement ongoing. The facility is expected to be completed by 2024 and will be located adjacent to New Hampshire Hospital in Concord.

4. **Mobile Crisis Response Teams**:
   - The committee discussed the effectiveness and funding of mobile crisis response teams. There are currently six funded teams, and the state is evaluating their impact on reducing the need for more intensive inpatient care. The committee emphasized the importance of measuring the return on investment for these teams.

### **Prescription Drug Monitoring and Substance Abuse**
1. **Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)**:
   - The PDMP’s integration with electronic health records (EHRs) was highlighted as a significant improvement, making it easier for providers to access patient prescription histories within their clinical workflow.
   - Data trends showed a decrease in opioid prescriptions but an increase in stimulant prescriptions, raising concerns about a potential stimulant epidemic. The department plans to further investigate this trend and may consider legislative action, such as requiring PDMP queries before prescribing stimulants.

### **Other Health Initiatives**
1. **Precision Medicine Task Force**:
   - Representative Jeffrey Salloway presented the final report of the interim task force on precision medicine, established under HB 1290. The report, dedicated to the late Representative Kathy Rogers, focuses on oncology and cancer treatment. Salloway highlighted the need for quality assurance in precision medicine and discussed the transition from the interim task force to a standing subcommittee under the Health and Human Services Oversight Committee.

2. **School-Based Health Services**:
   - Representative Patricia Tilly provided an update on efforts to provide clinical and mental health services in select schools. The initiative, funded through federal COVID-19 response funds, aims to support school-aged children with physical and behavioral health services. The program requires parental consent and involves partnerships with federally qualified health centers.

3. **Developmental Disabilities and Acquired Brain Disorder Waivers**:
   - Bureau Chief Sandy Farrows and Associate Commissioner Chris Santaniello updated the committee on the developmental disabilities (DD) and acquired brain disorder (ABD) waivers. They discussed the number of individuals served, funding challenges, and workforce shortages. The waivers provide community-based services as an alternative to institutional care.

4. **Dental Medicaid Expansion**:
   - The committee discussed the pending dental Medicaid expansion bill, which aims to provide benefits by next spring. The department is working on obtaining necessary waivers from CMS, and there is optimism about approval, but the committee emphasized the need for continuous oversight to ensure timely implementation.

### **Future Meetings and Task Forces**
- The committee scheduled its next meeting for September 23, 2022, to continue discussions on these issues. There was also mention of a precision medicine task force, with a suggestion to include physician representation.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to improving access to and safety of cannabis, addressing public health concerns, enhancing the prescription drug monitoring system, and expanding mental health and healthcare services across the state. The discussions highlighted ongoing challenges, such as staffing shortages and funding issues, but also showcased progress in key areas, including the acquisition of Hampstead Hospital and the expansion of dental Medicaid benefits. The committee emphasized the importance of collaboration and oversight to ensure the effective implementation of these initiatives.
