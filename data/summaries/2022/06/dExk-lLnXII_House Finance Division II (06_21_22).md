### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (06/21/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on June 21, 2022, addressed a range of critical issues, including housing development, disaster relief funding, and the implementation of a Medicaid direct certification program for school meal eligibility. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **Housing Development and Legislative Bills**

1. **Housing Development in Conway**:  
   The committee discussed the addition of approximately 500 new housing units in Conway over the next few years. While this development was viewed positively, it was noted that the units would likely be occupied quickly, underscoring the ongoing demand for housing in the region.

2. **HB 1300**:  
   The committee voted against recommending HB 1300, as the issues it addressed were deemed already resolved in prior meetings. A tentative agreement between the state and other parties was mentioned, with legal documents in the process of being finalized.

3. **HB 1665 (Municipal Road and Bridge Disaster Relief Fund)**:  
   Proposed by Representative Judy Aron, HB 1665 aimed to establish a fund to assist towns with infrastructure repairs following catastrophic events. Representative Aron highlighted the struggles of small towns like Acworth, which faced significant damage from flooding in July 2021 but lacked immediate access to funds. The committee voted for "no further action" on the bill, citing recent legislative changes (Senate Bills 402 and 409) that provide municipalities with access to loans and funding for disaster recovery. It was noted that these new mechanisms, along with increased state funding for roads and bridges, should be given time to work before creating another fund.

4. **Disaster Recovery Process**:  
   Representatives discussed the lengthy FEMA reimbursement process and the challenges small towns face in accessing immediate funds for repairs. Suggestions were made to improve the state’s ability to mobilize resources quickly during emergencies, particularly for municipal roads.

5. **Funding Allocation for Roads and Bridges**:  
   There was a call to reconsider how state funds for roads and bridges are allocated. The current population-based model was criticized, with suggestions to consider factors like the miles of road maintained by a town. This would better support small towns with extensive road networks but limited tax bases.

#### **Medicaid Direct Certification Program for School Meal Eligibility**

1. **Direct Certification Process**:  
   The current system uses automated processes to match student data with programs like TANF and SNAP, managed by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). While effective, the process is not 100% accurate and sometimes requires manual intervention by the Department of Education (DOE).

2. **Privacy Concerns**:  
   The automated system minimizes human interaction with sensitive data, using unique identifiers instead of personal information like Social Security numbers. Privacy controls similar to existing programs would apply to the Medicaid direct certification program.

3. **Impact on Title I Funding**:  
   New Hampshire receives the minimum Title I funding from the federal government, based on U.S. Census data rather than free and reduced-price lunch (FNR) data. Implementing the Medicaid direct certification program would not change total Title I funding but could affect how funds are allocated among districts.

4. **Accuracy and Eligibility**:  
   The program aims to improve the accuracy of identifying students in poverty by using Medicaid enrollment data, which is more comprehensive than traditional FNR applications. This could particularly benefit high school and middle school students who are less likely to apply for FNR programs.

5. **Opt-Out Mechanism**:  
   Parents would have the option to opt out of the FNR program at the local level, though this would not affect the state’s use of Medicaid data for funding allocations.

6. **Legislative and Implementation Timeline**:  
   The DOE has requested legislative approval before moving forward with the program. If approved, the application process would begin in the summer of 2022, with potential implementation by the 2023-2024 school year.

7. **Federal Approval and Data Sharing**:  
   The program requires approval from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to allow DHHS to share Medicaid data with the DOE. This data sharing is currently highly regulated.

8. **Concerns from Representatives**:  
   Some representatives expressed concerns about potential impacts on other federal programs, such as Carl Perkins funding for career and technical education (CTE), and the need for an opt-out provision for parents.

9. **Discussion on Enrollment and Funding Stability**:  
   The conversation also touched on the significant drop in public school enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for stability in funding allocations to school districts.

#### **Conclusion**

The meeting concluded with votes on the two bills, HB 1300 and HB 1665, both receiving recommendations for "no further action." Discussions highlighted the challenges of housing development, disaster recovery, and the complexities of implementing a Medicaid direct certification program. Key themes included the need for equitable funding allocation, improved disaster response mechanisms, and the importance of balancing privacy concerns with the benefits of automated data systems for identifying students in need.
