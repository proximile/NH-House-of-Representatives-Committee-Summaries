### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (June 13, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Interim Study Committee on House Bill 1229, focusing on school meal programs, convened on June 13, 2022. Chaired by Representative Sue Mullen, the meeting addressed a wide range of topics related to school nutrition, participation rates, funding, and future legislative priorities. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

---

#### **School Nutrition Standards**
The committee extensively discussed efforts to align school meal standards with federal dietary guidelines, particularly focusing on sodium, whole grains, and sugar levels. There was a specific emphasis on transitioning to stricter sodium standards starting in the 2023-24 school year, with a two-year adjustment period for schools and the food industry to adapt. Concerns were raised about the cost and feasibility of implementing these stricter standards, especially for smaller or underfunded schools. The American Heart Association, represented by Nancy Vaughn, emphasized the importance of improving nutritional standards and supporting universal school meals to reduce stigma and ensure stable funding for food service programs.

---

#### **Medicaid Direct Certification**
The committee reviewed a federal pilot program that allows students on Medicaid to automatically qualify for free and reduced lunch. New Hampshire has not yet applied for the program due to time constraints but may consider it for the following year. Data security concerns were addressed, with clarification that no sensitive data is exchanged with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) during the certification process.

---

#### **Breakfast Program Participation**
The committee reviewed data on school participation in the breakfast program, noting that 30 schools in New Hampshire do not currently offer breakfast. Challenges such as staffing shortages, lack of equipment, and scheduling conflicts were identified as barriers to participation. The committee emphasized the need for creative solutions to expand access to breakfast programs, including extending the school day to accommodate meal times.

---

#### **Free and Reduced Meals**
Discussions highlighted a 25% reduction in families filling out free and reduced meal applications during the pandemic, likely due to the availability of universal free meals under federal waivers. With these waivers expiring, the committee stressed the importance of outreach efforts to ensure eligible families continue to benefit from the program.

---

#### **Charter and Private School Participation**
Six public charter schools and eight private schools currently participate in the national school lunch program. The committee explored opportunities to encourage more schools to join the program, particularly those serving low-income students.

---

#### **Summer Meal Programs**
The summer meal program, which has been free for all students during the pandemic, will revert to its pre-pandemic structure, requiring applications for eligibility. The committee discussed strategies to maintain participation and ensure students in need continue to receive meals during the summer months.

---

#### **Research and Data**
The committee expressed interest in gathering more data on the impact of school meals on academic performance and student health. Representative Ford highlighted the importance of involving school nurses in data collection to better understand the connection between nutrition and student well-being.

---

#### **Committee Schedule and Future Work**
The committee is on recess for July and August, with the next meeting tentatively scheduled for the week of September 12th. Topics for future meetings include farm-to-school initiatives, homeschooling, and extending the school day for breakfast programs. The committee clarified that its role is to recommend future legislation, but individual representatives retain the ability to propose bills independently.

---

#### **Legislative Recommendations and Outreach**
The committee emphasized the need for proactive outreach to schools, families, and stakeholders to address challenges in school meal programs. Discussions also touched on the importance of stable funding and policy changes to support universal school meals, reduce stigma, and improve nutritional quality.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with well-wishes for a healthy summer and plans to reconvene in September to continue discussions on improving school meal programs. The committeeâ€™s focus remains on enhancing participation, nutritional standards, and outreach efforts to ensure all students have access to healthy and affordable meals.
