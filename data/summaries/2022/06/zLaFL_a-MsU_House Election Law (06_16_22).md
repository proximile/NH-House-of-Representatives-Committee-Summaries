### **Voting Summary and Committee Changes**
The meeting opened with a unanimous **15-0** vote on a procedural motion, with all committee members—Representatives McDonald, Haywood, Johnson, Quayley, Mooney, Bergeron, Schultz, Ward, Sandler, Hamer, Lane, Netting, Hamlet, Muirhead, and Griffin—voting in favor. 

The chairperson acknowledged the committee’s hard work, particularly in handling unusual motions and bills that could not be acted upon. They also noted significant changes to the committee’s composition, as Representatives Hayward, Sandler, and the chairperson herself would not be returning. Expressing gratitude for their contributions, the chairperson described their departures as a loss to the House and the committee. Farewell remarks included thanks for the committee’s support and respect over the past four years, along with well-wishes for a successful summer and a lighthearted dismissal of any notion that the chairperson and Representative Griffin were difficult to work with.

### **Key Bills Discussed and Outcomes**
The committee addressed five interim study bills, each of which was discussed and voted on. Interim study bills are not immediately acted upon but can inform future legislation. All five bills received a unanimous **15-0** vote not to recommend them for future legislation, with the committee citing unresolved issues, procedural concerns, and the need for significant revisions. Below is a summary of each bill and the committee’s rationale:

1. **HB 327**: Required voters to show ID when personally delivering absentee ballots.  
   - **Outcome**: Not recommended due to unresolved issues and procedural concerns.

2. **HB 480**: Addressed the verification of ballots cast in an election.  
   - **Outcome**: Not recommended, as the bill was deemed to need significant revisions to be effective.

3. **HB 524**: Required the Secretary of State to conduct random verification counts of polling place results.  
   - **Outcome**: Not recommended, though the committee acknowledged the merit of post-election audits. They suggested that a fresh bill would be more appropriate.

4. **HB 551**: Proposed making the statewide voter database publicly available in electronic format.  
   - **Outcome**: Not recommended due to privacy concerns, fiscal implications, and existing legislation that already expanded access to voter information.

5. **SB 54**: Aimed to include certain identity information on absentee ballot application forms.  
   - **Outcome**: Not recommended, as it was considered unworkable in its current form due to privacy and verification challenges.

### **Key Discussion Points**
- **Interim Study Bills**: The committee emphasized that these bills were interim studies, meaning they would not be voted on immediately but could serve as a foundation for future legislation.  
- **Post-Election Audits**: While there was broad support for the concept of post-election audits to increase voter confidence, the committee agreed that HB 524 needed significant refinement.  
- **Voter Database Access**: The committee recognized the desire for greater access to voter information but expressed concerns about privacy, security, and fiscal costs, leading to the decision not to recommend HB 551.  
- **Absentee Ballot Verification**: The committee discussed the challenges of verifying absentee ballots, including issues with signature matching and the practicality of requiring additional identification information.
