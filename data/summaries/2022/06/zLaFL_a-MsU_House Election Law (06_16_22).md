**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on House Election Law (06/16/22)**

The NH House of Representatives convened on June 16, 2022, for a session led by House Election Law Committee Chair Barbara Griffin. The meeting focused on reviewing interim study bills, which do not result in immediate legislative action but provide recommendations for future sessions. The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance and acknowledgments of substitute representatives present. Key discussions revolved around election integrity, voter confidence, and the practicality of proposed legislation.

### Key Bills Discussed:
1. **HB 327 (Voter ID for Absentee Ballots)**:  
   This bill proposed requiring voter ID for personally delivered absentee ballots. The committee revisited previous discussions and amendments, particularly regarding signature matching procedures, which had been invalidated by a court ruling due to procedural issues. The bill was ultimately recommended for further study due to unresolved concerns.

2. **HB 480 (Verification of Ballots Cast)**:  
   This bill addressed the verification of ballots cast in elections. Concerns were raised about the potential costs and logistical challenges for towns and cities, as well as the lack of restrictions on who could request recounts. The bill was seen as too open-ended and expensive, and the committee determined that further controls were necessary before moving forward.

3. **HB 524 (Hand Recounts and Post-Election Audits)**:  
   This bill aimed to increase voter confidence by requiring hand recounts at randomly selected locations using electronic counting devices. The sponsor, Representative Lang, emphasized the importance of ongoing audits to instill voter confidence, though mechanical issues in the bill needed addressing. The committee considered the bill in light of HB 1467, which mandated a one-time audit for the 2022 elections. While the concept of post-election audits was acknowledged as valuable, the committee agreed that the bill needed more work and a fresh approach.

4. **HB 551 (Voter Database Access)**:  
   This bill proposed making the statewide voter database publicly available electronically. While there was recognition of the desire for access, concerns were raised about privacy, security, and the broad nature of the bill. The committee voted not to recommend it at this time, noting that recent legislation has already expanded access to voter information.

5. **SB 54 (Absentee Ballot Application)**:  
   This bill aimed to include additional identity information for absentee ballots, such as driver's license or Social Security numbers. However, concerns about privacy, practicality, and the ability of town clerks to verify this information led the committee to vote against recommending it.

### Committee Decisions and Concerns:  
Throughout the meeting, committee members expressed concerns about the practicality, costs, and procedural challenges of the proposed legislation. The discussions highlighted the need for careful consideration and potential revisions to ensure the bills' effectiveness and feasibility in future legislative sessions. The committee ultimately voted not to recommend HB 327, HB 480, HB 551, and SB 54, citing the need for further refinement and development.

### Farewells:  
Several representatives, including Representative Hayward, Representative Sandler, and Representative Bergeron, announced they would not be returning for the next session. The committee expressed gratitude for their service and contributions, concluding the meeting with thanks to departing members and wishes for a successful summer.

### Overall Takeaways:  
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to election integrity and voter confidence while emphasizing the importance of practical, well-crafted legislation. The discussions revealed that while many of the proposed bills addressed valid concerns, they required further work to address logistical, financial, and procedural challenges effectively. The committee’s recommendations for further study and refinement reflect a cautious yet proactive approach to improving election laws in New Hampshire.
