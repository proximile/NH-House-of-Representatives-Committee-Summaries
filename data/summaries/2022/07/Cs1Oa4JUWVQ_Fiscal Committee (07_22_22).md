#### **Funding and Program Approvals**
1. **Title 10 Family Planning Funding**: The committee approved federal Title 10 funding for family planning services, including reproductive health care, cancer screenings, and education, while explicitly excluding abortion services. The vote passed 9-1 after clarifying confusion during the budgeting process.
2. **Military Affairs Programs**:
   - **STEM Program (FIS-22255)**: A Department of Defense-funded STEM program for fifth-grade students was approved unanimously. The program aims to enhance STEM education and indirectly expose students to military careers.
   - **Wellness Program (FIS-22256)**: A wellness pilot program for service members, focused on reducing substance misuse and improving physical fitness, was also approved unanimously.
3. **Broadband Expansion (FIS-22247)**: The Department of Business and Economic Affairs presented plans to expand broadband access, particularly in underserved areas. The committee unanimously approved funding for mapping and “last mile” connectivity efforts.
4. **Environmental Services (FIS-22250)**: The Department of Environmental Services received unanimous approval for funding to address lead pipes in water systems, including public mains and private connections.
5. **Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP)**: Updates were provided on the ERAP, which helps with rent and utility payments without affecting other assistance programs like LIHEAP. The committee approved funding unanimously, though concerns were raised about potential rent increases due to the program.

#### **Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and Opioid Crisis**
1. **SUD and Opioid Programs**: The committee discussed and unanimously approved funding for SUD programming, including detox beds and naloxone distribution. Despite staffing shortages in healthcare facilities, the programs were deemed critical to addressing the opioid crisis.
2. **Progress in Opioid Crisis**: New Hampshire has seen a decline in opioid overdose deaths since 2017, attributed to broad-based naloxone distribution and other strategies.

#### **Federal Funding and Compliance**
1. **Federal Fund Management**: The state received significant federal funding, including COVID-related relief, which increased the complexity of managing federal programs. The audit highlighted the need for improved compliance and internal controls, particularly in high-risk programs like Medicaid.
2. **Management Letter Recommendations**: Auditors recommended reinforcing policies and procedures, especially in IT de-provisioning processes, to enhance compliance and risk management.
