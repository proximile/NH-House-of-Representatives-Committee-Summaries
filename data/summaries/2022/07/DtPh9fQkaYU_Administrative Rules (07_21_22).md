**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (07/21/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on July 21, 2022, to review and discuss various administrative rules, focusing on compliance with statutory requirements, clarity, and proper formatting. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including tax regulations, licensing fees, pharmacy board rules, and ignition interlock devices. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Tax Regulations**
1. **Meals and Rental Tax Rates**: The committee reviewed changes to the meals and rental tax rates, noting a reduction from 9% to 8.5%. However, the Fiscal Impact Statement (FIS) did not explicitly mention this change, and the ruleâ€™s formatting did not comply with the manual. The rule was conditionally approved, pending necessary formatting adjustments.

2. **Revenue Rules and Formatting Issues**: Several revenue rules, including 702.11 and 705.01, were discussed for non-compliance with manual formatting and unclear references to forms. Staff provided replacement language for 705.01 to address these issues. The committee conditionally approved these rules, requiring updates to align with the manual.

3. **Interest and Dividends Tax**: The committee reviewed a rule set to expire in October, noting inconsistencies in the use of terms like "individual" and "person." The rule was conditionally approved, with recommendations to clarify definitions and ensure consistency with statutory language.

4. **Gross Business Profits Tax**: The committee addressed changes to rules related to the computation of gross business profits tax. A key issue was the use of "may" versus "shall" in the language regarding the commissioner's authority to adjust the formula. The department argued that "may" aligns with the statute, while the committee suggested that "shall" should be used to ensure consistency and transparency. The discussion reached an impasse, and the committee decided to postpone further consideration until the next meeting.

### **Licensing Fees**
- The committee reviewed changes to licensing rules for real estate salespersons and brokers. Issues included unclear language in the application forms and the need to clarify examination fees. The statute requires the board to set examination fees, but the rule currently states that applicants pay what the vendor charges. The committee discussed the need for a statutory change to address this discrepancy.

### **Pharmacy Board Rules**
- The committee received an update on the Pharmacy Board's rules, which were conditionally approved in May 2021. Concerns were raised about the removal of requirements for pharmacy intern registration, supervision, and protocols for the temporary absence of a pharmacist. The board formed a subcommittee to address these issues, and a formal petition for rulemaking will be presented next month.

### **Ignition Interlock Devices**
- The committee discussed proposed changes to the rules regarding ignition interlock devices, specifically the alcohol set point. Public testimony indicated concerns that the devices are not set correctly, with suggestions to set the threshold at 0.025. However, the statute RSA 265-A:37 establishes penalties at 0.025 but does not mandate the device to be set at that level. The department indicated that 0.020 is the industry standard. The committee debated the legal authority to set the device at 0.020, with some members questioning whether it constitutes a punitive action not covered by the statute.

### **Overall Outcomes**
The meeting emphasized the importance of compliance with statutory requirements, clear definitions, and proper formatting in administrative rules. Conditional approvals were granted for several rules, pending necessary revisions. Several issues, particularly those related to tax regulations and ignition interlock devices, required further review and potential statutory changes. The committee decided to postpone further consideration of some contentious issues until the next meeting.
