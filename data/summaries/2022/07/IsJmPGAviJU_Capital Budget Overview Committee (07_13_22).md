The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Capital Budget Overview Committee held a special meeting on July 13, 2022, to address **Capital Budget 22-001**, a request from the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources for approval of **Cannon Mountain's capital improvement projects**. The projects include:

1. **Snowmaking improvements**: Replacement of water pipes, snowmaking guns, and hydrants.
2. **Boiler system replacement** at the base lodge.
3. **Replacement of rope grip assemblies** on the Cannonball Quad Summit Chairlift.

The total funding requested was **$450,000**, to be drawn from the Cannon Mountain Improvement Fund. 

**Sarah Stewart**, Commissioner of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, expressed gratitude for the committee’s time, acknowledging the late submission of the request. **Chris Moreno**, the business administrator, reported that Cannon Mountain is financially healthy, with revenues exceeding costs by approximately $500,000 for the fiscal year. **John DeVivo**, Cannon Mountain’s general manager, provided project timelines, aiming for completion by **late November 2022**, pending approvals.

Committee members raised questions about the **safety-critical rope grip assemblies** and the project’s urgency. After discussion, the committee **approved the motion** to fund the projects unanimously. The next meeting was scheduled for **September 19, 2022**, with a reminder to agencies to submit requests promptly due to the upcoming election season.
