The New Hampshire House of Representatives' **Long-Range Capital Planning & Utilization Committee** held a special meeting on **July 13, 2022**, to address a single item of new business: the approval of a **20-year lease agreement** for state agency office space. The lease, **LRCP 22-019**, involves the **Department of Administrative Services** entering into an agreement with **81 Hall Street LLC** for approximately **106,400 square feet** of usable office space in Concord, NH, at a fixed annual base rent of **$1,179,400**. The space includes the **south building** of **One Granite Place**, its underlying land, and related parking areas, effective from **July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2042**.

**Key Points Discussed:**

1. **Purpose of the Lease**: The lease is part of a long-term plan to relocate the **Department of Justice (DOJ)** from its current building, which is earmarked for demolition to construct a new parking garage. The DOJ requires approximately **50,000 square feet**, while the leased building offers **100,000 square feet**, leaving **50,000 square feet** available for other state agencies or future needs.

2. **Cost and Benefits**: The lease includes an **option to buy** the building for approximately **$15 million**, which is significantly less than the cost of constructing a new building (estimated at **$400–500 per square foot**). The lease is considered a cost-effective solution for the state’s office space needs.

3. **Future Plans**: The additional space will be used temporarily as **swing space** for other state agencies during renovations of existing buildings, such as the **State House Annex**, which requires significant asbestos remediation and HVAC upgrades. The state aims to reduce leased office space in Concord by consolidating agencies into state-owned buildings.

4. **Questions and Concerns**: Committee members raised questions about the **DOJ’s space needs**, potential **expansion of bureaucracy**, and the **costs of retrofitting** the leased space for the DOJ. Commissioner **Charlie Arlinghaus** assured the committee that the DOJ’s needs were adequately addressed and that the state would manage the surplus space efficiently.

5. **Approval**: After discussion, the committee unanimously **approved** the lease agreement, **LRCP 22-019**.

The meeting concluded with thanks to the committee members for their attendance, and the next meeting was scheduled for **September 19, 2022**.
