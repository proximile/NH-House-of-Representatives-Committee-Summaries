The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on August 10, 2022, centered on the development and implementation of a claims process for victims of sexual and physical abuse at the Youth Development Center (YDC) and similar facilities. The meeting, led by Attorney General John Formella, aimed to review and approve the claims process and guidelines established under House Bill 1677, which created the YDC Settlement Fund. The discussion emphasized creating a fair, accessible, and trauma-informed process while balancing the state’s obligation to compensate victims and protect taxpayer funds.

### Key Points from the Meeting:

1. **Purpose and Legislative Intent**:  
   The meeting focused on approving a claims process designed as an alternative to traditional litigation, making it more accessible for victims. HB 1677 aims to balance victim compensation with fairness and fiscal responsibility, ensuring transparency and accountability.

2. **Claims Process Overview**:  
   - Victims can submit claims for sexual or physical abuse, which are reviewed and valued using a formulaic approach to ensure consistency.  
   - Base awards are adjusted for factors such as frequency, aggravating circumstances (e.g., severity, long-term impact), and mitigating factors (e.g., lack of proof, credibility issues).  
   - The process is designed to be user-friendly, with support for unrepresented victims, including assistance in completing claim forms.  

3. **Victim-Centered Approach**:  
   - The process acknowledges the challenges victims face, such as trauma or the passage of time, and avoids accusing them of lying while still evaluating credibility.  
   - Claimants are encouraged but not required to provide optional documentation (e.g., medical records, diaries) to support their claims.  

4. **Claim Valuation and Mitigating Factors**:  
   - Claims are valued on a case-by-case basis, with average payouts estimated at $700,000 before mitigating factors.  
   - Mitigating factors, such as lack of evidence or credibility issues, can reduce payouts, but general defenses like the statute of limitations are not considered.  

5. **Criminal Investigations and Legal Framework**:  
   - The Attorney General’s office is conducting criminal investigations into abuse allegations, with several former state employees already indicted.  
   - There is no statute of limitations for filing claims, allowing victims to come forward regardless of when the abuse occurred.  

6. **Transparency and Feedback**:  
   - Drafts of the claims process were posted online, and feedback was sought from victim witness advocates and claimants’ counsel.  
   - Concerns were raised about the complexity of the claim form, the potential for technical changes to become substantive, and the burden of proof being shifted to the state.  

7. **Special Considerations**:  
   - **Current and Incarcerated Claimants**: Current YDC residents and incarcerated individuals are eligible to file claims. Inmates have access to notaries and legal representation, though public defenders are not available for civil claims.  
   - **Advocates for Claimants**: The state will provide advocates to assist victims with the process, though these advocates will not advocate for the claimants’ positions.  

8. **Record Retention and Security**:  
   Concerns were raised about the retention, destruction, and security of sensitive records. The court system and the Department of Justice will handle records with the same privacy protections used for other private information.  

9. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee tabled the item and requested a revised submission from the Attorney General’s office to address feedback. A special meeting will be scheduled to review the revised process before the September 9th deadline.  

### Conclusion:  
The meeting underscored the importance of creating a fair and accessible process for victims of abuse while ensuring accountability and transparency. The state aims to balance the need for victim compensation with the complexities of evaluating claims from events that occurred decades ago. The committee’s feedback will help refine the process to better serve victims and uphold the integrity of the legal system.
