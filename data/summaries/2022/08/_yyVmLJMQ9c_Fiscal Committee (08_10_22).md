### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (08/10/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on August 10, 2022, to discuss the development and implementation of a claims process for victims of abuse at the Youth Development Center (YDC) and other state entities. The meeting centered on ensuring clarity, fairness, and accessibility in the process, while balancing the needs of victims with state obligations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Purpose and Background**
The claims process was established under **House Bill 1677**, which created the **YDC Settlement Fund** to provide an alternative to traditional litigation for victims of sexual or physical abuse at YDC or similar facilities. The process aims to address historical abuse claims while ensuring fairness, dignity, and respect for victims. The Attorney General’s Office (AGO) developed the process, incorporating feedback from victims’ counsel and advocates.

### **Key Components of the Claims Process**
1. **Claims Process Overview**:
   - Victims submit claims through a **claim packet**, which includes forms, documentation requirements, and optional worksheets (e.g., medical records).
   - The process is designed to be **trauma-informed** and accessible, with support for unrepresented victims.
   - Claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the **type** (sexual or physical), **severity**, **frequency**, **aggravating factors**, and **mitigating factors** of abuse.
   - The maximum payout per claim is capped at **$1.5 million**, with an average award estimated at **$700,000**.

2. **Valuation Guidelines**:
   - **Base awards** are determined using research on nationwide settlement averages.
   - **Frequency multipliers** account for multiple incidents of abuse.
   - **Aggravating factors** (e.g., use of a weapon, multiple perpetrators) increase claim value, while **mitigating factors** (e.g., lack of proof, credibility issues) may reduce it.
   - Aggravating factors are cumulative, not based solely on the highest factor.

3. **Resolution Process**:
   - If the claimant and the AGO’s designee agree on the claim value, the process concludes with a payout.
   - If there’s disagreement, claimants can:
     1. **Exit the process** and pursue litigation.
     2. Proceed to a **resolution hearing** before the administrator, which is binding and not appealable.

4. **Criminal and Civil Proceedings**:
   - The AGO is conducting a **criminal investigation** into YDC abuse allegations, with **11 former employees indicted** and trials scheduled through 2024.
   - The claims process will not be stayed by criminal proceedings, and victims retain the right to pursue litigation if dissatisfied with the claims process.

### **Concerns and Clarifications**
1. **Clarity and Accessibility**:
   - Committee members expressed concerns about the complexity of the claim packet, suggesting it be divided into separate sections for process, required information, and optional worksheets.
   - The role of an **advocate** was discussed to assist claimants with form completion, though the advocate would not represent them in the process. The cost of this service would be borne by the state.

2. **Presumption of Credibility**:
   - There was debate about the presumption of credibility for claimant statements made under oath. Some members felt this shifted the burden of proof to the state, which they found problematic.

3. **Types of Abuse**:
   - Members sought clarification on how different incidents of abuse are categorized, including whether **child-to-child abuse** would be considered.

4. **Access to Legal Representation**:
   - Concerns were raised about incarcerated claimants’ access to legal representation, as public defenders are not available for civil cases. Claimants could seek assistance from organizations like **New Hampshire Legal Assistance**.

5. **Security of Records**:
   - Questions were asked about the security of sensitive victim records submitted as part of the claims process.

### **Next Steps**
1. The committee decided to **table the item** to allow for revisions based on feedback. The AGO will withdraw the current submission and resubmit a revised package.
2. A **special meeting** will be scheduled to review the revised document before the **September 9th deadline**.
3. The **administrator** will oversee the implementation of the process, including setting up infrastructure and providing support to claimants.

### **Unprecedented Nature of the Process**
This is the first time New Hampshire—and likely any state—has established such a claims process for abuse victims. The process aims to balance the need for **fair compensation** with **taxpayer accountability**, acknowledging the challenges of valuing claims for deeply traumatic experiences.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing historical abuse claims and the state’s commitment to providing a viable alternative to litigation. The process emphasizes fairness, transparency, and accessibility, ensuring that victims are treated with dignity and respect while maintaining accountability for the state. Further refinements will be made to address concerns and ensure the process is workable for all parties.
