The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on August 18, 2022, focused on administrative rules, with several key discussions and decisions:

1. **Postponements**: The chair moved to postpone several agenda items, including automated pharmacy systems, veterinary medicine board rules, ethical standards, and municipal and county aggregation rules. The motion was seconded and passed without opposition.

2. **Minutes Approval**: The committee approved the minutes from the previous meeting without discussion or opposition.

3. **Veterinary Board Fees**: A discussion arose about expired rules for veterinary board fees. It was clarified that new rules were adopted on August 1, 2022, allowing the board to collect fees again. The board had not collected fees during the interim period but continued to process applications.

4. **Expired Rules Concerns**: Members expressed concern over the number of expired rules within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), particularly how the department managed operations without enforceable rules. DHHS acknowledged the issue and stated they were working to update and track expired rules.

5. **Vaccination Exemption Forms**: A representative raised concerns about a new vaccination exemption form that appeared to go beyond the scope of recent legislative changes (House Bill 1035). The form included additional medical questions and risk acknowledgments not mandated by the law. The committee questioned why the form was not reviewed through the proper administrative rules process and requested its removal until properly vetted.

6. **Interim Rule**: An interim rule (2022-5) related to the vaccination exemption issue was noted to be on the September agenda, though it was unclear if it addressed the form in question.

7. **Adjournment**: The meeting concluded with plans to address the vaccination exemption form issue promptly, including potential expedited revisions and coordination with DHHS and legal counsel.

Overall, the meeting highlighted concerns about expired rules, the importance of proper administrative procedures, and the need for timely updates to align with legislative changes.
