**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (September 20, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on September 20, 2022, to address critical issues related to school nutrition programs, education funding, teacher retention, student outcomes, and educational equity. The meeting focused on several key bills, including **House Bill 1229** (school meal programs) and **House Bill 1680** (education funding reform), as well as broader discussions on systemic challenges and opportunities for improvement in New Hampshire’s education system.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

#### **1. School Nutrition Programs (House Bill 1229)**
   - **Farm to School Program**: The bill proposes reimbursing schools for purchasing food from local farms, fishers, and producers, aiming to allocate 10% of school food budgets to local sources. Funding would come from a combination of federal (two-thirds) and state (one-third) sources.
   - **Challenges and Solutions**: Supply chain issues, storage, and distribution logistics were identified as barriers. Potential solutions include infrastructure improvements, the use of ARPA funds, and exploring hydroponics and food hubs for year-round produce availability.
   - **Nutrition and Hunger**: New Hampshire Hunger Solutions emphasized the role of school meals in addressing child hunger. The state ranks 47th in school breakfast participation, with stigma and logistical barriers limiting access. Direct certification for SNAP and Medicaid was proposed to streamline enrollment.
   - **Community Eligibility Provision (CEP)**: Schools with high percentages of low-income students can offer free meals to all students and receive federal reimbursement. Only three New Hampshire schools currently participate, but increased SNAP enrollment and Medicaid direct certification could expand the program.
   - **Equity and Access**: The bill aims to ensure equitable access to local food for all districts, addressing current disparities in funding and resources.
   - **Cost and Investment**: A Rockefeller Institute study highlighted a $2 return on every $1 invested in school nutrition programs, underscoring the fiscal and educational benefits.

#### **2. Education Funding and Equity (House Bill 1680)**
   - **Current Funding Model**: The existing model inadequately addresses the varying needs of districts, leading to inequities in resources and student outcomes.
   - **Proposed Reforms**: HB 1680 introduces a new funding formula based on student outcomes and district characteristics, aiming to ensure equitable access to resources. The bill includes accountability measures to tie funding to student performance.
   - **Special Education Funding**: Weighted funding formulas were discussed to address the specific needs of students with disabilities, including catastrophic costs.
   - **Accountability**: The committee emphasized the need for comprehensive accountability measures, such as tracking student outcomes, graduation rates, and long-term post-graduation success.

#### **3. Teacher Retention and Quality**
   - **Attrition Challenges**: High teacher attrition rates, particularly in lower-income districts, disrupt curriculum continuity and student learning. Financial disparities between districts make it difficult to retain experienced teachers.
   - **Teacher Support**: The importance of teacher autonomy, professional development, and evaluation systems was highlighted. School leadership was identified as crucial in fostering a positive and collaborative environment.
   - **Community Engagement**: Strong collaboration between schools, communities, and the Department of Education was seen as essential for successful school turnarounds.

#### **4. Student Outcomes and Pandemic Impact**
   - **Learning Gaps**: The pandemic exacerbated learning gaps in math and reading, with many students falling behind. Schools are focusing on remediation and addressing these challenges.
   - **Data-Driven Strategies**: Legislators stressed the need for deeper analysis of assessment data to identify specific weaknesses and guide instructional improvements.
   - **Vocational and Academic Pathways**: Some communities prioritize vocational skills (e.g., diesel mechanics, forestry) to align with local economic needs, while others emphasize college preparation.

#### **5. Broader Economic and Social Factors**
   - **Economic Disparities**: Economic and social factors, including home life and community resources, significantly impact student performance. Addressing these broader issues is essential to level the playing field.
   - **Community Impact**: The quality of local schools is tied to community economic health, with struggling schools making it harder to attract businesses and support economic growth.

### **Next Steps**
   - The committee plans to continue discussions on HB 1229 and HB 1680, focusing on refining funding models, addressing special education needs, and ensuring accountability.
   - Future meetings will emphasize data-driven decision-making, tracking individual student progress, and developing comprehensive policies to address educational inequities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of improving New Hampshire’s education system, highlighting the interconnectedness of school nutrition, funding, teacher retention, and student outcomes. The discussions emphasized the need for innovative, equitable, and sustainable solutions to support all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background or geographic location. The committee’s focus on policy changes, community engagement, and data-driven strategies reflects a commitment to addressing systemic challenges and improving educational outcomes across the state.
