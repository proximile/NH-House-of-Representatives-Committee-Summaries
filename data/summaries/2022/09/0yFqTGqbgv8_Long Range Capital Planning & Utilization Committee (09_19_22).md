The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Long Range Capital Planning & Utilization Committee meeting on September 19, 2022, covered several key agenda items related to state property management and leasing. Here’s a summary:

1. **Approval of Minutes**: The committee approved the minutes from the May 23rd and July 13th meetings.

2. **Lease Agreement for Department of Natural and Cultural Resources**: The committee approved a 10-year lease agreement for office space in Concord, NH, at a rate significantly below market value. The Department has been in the building for 30 years and sought extensions due to the lack of viable alternatives.

3. **Disposal of State-Owned Land**:
   - **Newington Parcels**: The committee approved an amendment to reduce the size and sale price of two parcels of land along the Spaulding Turnpike due to a gas line issue.
   - **Keene Parcel**: The committee approved the sale of a small parcel of land in Keene, NH, with conditions for drainage easements.
   - **Madison Parcel**: The committee approved listing a property in Madison, NH, for sale through a real estate agent.
   - **Conway Parcel**: The committee approved the sale of a property in Conway, NH, adjacent to a state maintenance shed.
   - **Sullivan Parcel**: The committee approved the sale of a small parcel in Sullivan, NH, with conditions for subdivision and drainage easements.

4. **Withdrawal of a Disposal Request**: The Department of Transportation withdrew a request to dispose of a parcel due to ongoing evaluations of its development potential.

5. **Solar Lease Proposal for Sylvester Superfund Site**: The committee tabled a proposal to lease a capped Superfund site in Nashua, NH, for a solar power generation facility. Questions were raised about the project’s timeline, the electricity’s destination, and its benefits to New Hampshire constituents. The committee requested further information from the Department of Energy and the developer before reconsidering the proposal at the next meeting.

6. **Next Meeting**: The committee scheduled its next meeting for November 28, 2022, in LOB Room 201-203.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn.
