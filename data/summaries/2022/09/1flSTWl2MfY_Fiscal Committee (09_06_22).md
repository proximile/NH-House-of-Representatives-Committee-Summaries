### **Key Aspects of the Settlement Process**

1. **Administrator and Legal Costs**:
   - The committee discussed the costs associated with hiring an administrator and a private law firm to oversee the settlement process. The administrator’s salary would be comparable to that of a superior court judge, with total costs for the administrator and legal fees estimated at up to $4 million over two years. The process may extend longer, depending on the number of claims.

2. **Settlement Awards**:
   - The average maximum settlement award was estimated at around $700,000, based on research of similar claims nationwide. However, the exact median and most frequent award amounts remain uncertain due to the variability of individual cases and incomplete information about all claimants.

3. **Trauma-Informed and Victim-Centered Approach**:
   - The process was designed with input from victim advocates and outside research to be trauma-informed. The committee discussed the rationale behind using multipliers to calculate awards, such as the frequency and duration of abuse, acknowledging that longer periods of abuse may result in higher awards due to increased trauma.

4. **Privacy and Confidentiality**:
   - Concerns were raised about protecting claimant privacy, particularly regarding information sharing within the Department of Justice. Strict protocols were established to segregate information between the criminal and civil sides of the process, though some information may need to be shared in criminal cases due to defendants’ rights.

5. **Access for Incarcerated Individuals**:
   - The committee addressed challenges faced by incarcerated individuals in filing claims, such as limited internet access and reliance on collect calls. Solutions included setting up a legal liaison to facilitate electronic access and collaborating with the Department of Corrections to enable phone communication with the administrator.

6. **County Correctional Facilities**:
   - Questions were raised about whether similar access issues would apply to county correctional facilities, but this issue had not yet been discussed.

### **Updates to the Settlement Documents**

Attorney General Formella outlined significant changes to the settlement documents based on feedback from the committee and claimants’ counsel:

1. **Document Splitting**:
   - The settlement documents were split into four separate documents for clarity, including a new notice document.

2. **Claims Process**:
   - Clarifications were made regarding claimants’ options after receiving a proposed award, including the ability to withdraw from the process and continue litigation.

3. **Definition of "Former YDC Resident"**:
   - Expanded to include current residents of YDC or the Sununu Center.

4. **Attorney Fees**:
   - Simplified language tied attorney fees to New Hampshire’s professional conduct rules.

5. **Notice Document**:
   - Expanded guidance on providing notice to potential claimants, including posting notices in courthouses, mental health centers, and other locations.

6. **Valuation Guidelines**:
   - Significant changes were made to the frequency multiplier table, reducing the number of incidents required to reach higher settlement values. The table now applies to both sexual and physical abuse claims.

7. **Aggravating Factors**:
   - Increased the value of aggravating factors, such as the presence of photographs or videos of abuse, and reduced the duration of abuse required for an aggravating factor to apply.

8. **Claim Packet**:
   - Made information optional rather than required to make the process more accessible to victims. The packet includes a claim form and worksheet, with improved line spacing and clearer instructions.

### **Administrator’s Role and Future Adjustments**

- The administrator, once appointed, will oversee the process and can request further changes from the committee. The administrator is seen as a neutral party, which may provide comfort to claimants.
- The committee emphasized the administrator’s authority to revisit and adjust the process as needed, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness to emerging issues.

### **Department of Corrections Involvement**

- The Department of Corrections provided a letter outlining its commitment to assisting residents in accessing the settlement process, including posting notices and providing access to legal resources.

---

### **Committee Questions and Feedback**

Committee members raised questions about potential disparities in how abuse is categorized for male and female victims and overlaps between categories of abuse. Formella acknowledged these issues and suggested the administrator could address them in the future.

---

### **Legislative Approval and Conclusion**

- The committee voted to approve the fiscal notes related to the settlement process, with a vote of 7 in favor and 3 opposed. The motion included a provision allowing the Attorney General to correct typos in the documents without needing further committee approval.
- Formella thanked the committee and claimants’ counsel for their feedback, emphasizing that the process is designed to be victim-centered and trauma-informed. He expressed confidence that many claimants would find the process workable.

### **Overall Takeaways**

The meeting highlighted the complexities of the YDC settlement process, including fiscal considerations, accessibility challenges for incarcerated individuals, and ongoing efforts to ensure fairness, privacy, and trauma-informed care for claimants. The committee’s approval of the fiscal notes and the outlined changes reflect a commitment to refining the process and addressing the needs of abuse survivors. Future adjustments and the administrator’s role will be critical in ensuring the process remains responsive and equitable.
