The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on September 21, 2022, focused on discussions and votes regarding proposed legislation, pension buyback programs, and interim study bills. The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing state and local authority, addressing public health and safety concerns, and ensuring equitable solutions for retirement benefits.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

#### **Legislation on Licensing and Public Health**
1. **House Bill 1191 (Massage Establishment Licensing)**:
   - The committee discussed the need to differentiate between legitimate therapeutic massage businesses and illegal massage parlors.
   - Concerns were raised about health and safety standards and the lack of state enforcement mechanisms.
   - The committee voted **not to recommend further legislation**, suggesting that local authorities should handle licensing and inspections.

2. **House Bill 1441 (Body Art Licensing)**:
   - Discussion on this bill was deferred due to the absence of the sponsor and lack of clarity on its details.

3. **Other Bills**:
   - Several bills, including Senate Bill 230 (body art licensing) and House Bill 1312, were mentioned but not discussed in detail due to time constraints or the absence of sponsors. The committee agreed to revisit these bills in a future meeting.

4. **Debate on Licensing and Local Authority**:
   - Representatives debated the balance between state and local authority in licensing and enforcing health and safety standards. Some argued for local government oversight, while others raised concerns about the lack of state-level regulation.

#### **Pension Buyback Program**
1. **SB 363 (Pension Buyback for Group 2 Members)**:
   - This bill allows certain Group 2 employees (middle-tier) to buy back up to four years of service to retire earlier under pre-2012 rules.
   - The buyback cost includes the full actuarial cost, comprising:
     - The cost of retiring earlier and receiving pensions longer.
     - Lost contributions due to early retirement.
     - A **20% risk premium** to account for uncertainties in investment performance, payroll growth, and demographics.
   - Concerns were raised about the high costs (up to $125,000 per year) and the fairness of the program, particularly for individuals who may not live long enough to recoup the costs.
