**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Science, Technology, and Energy (09/26/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on September 26, 2022, to address concerns related to radio frequency (RF) radiation, particularly from cell phone towers, 5G technology, and other wireless devices. The meeting included discussions on technical, scientific, health, and regulatory aspects, with a focus on potential legislative action, public education, and municipal empowerment. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the three segments of the meeting:

---

### **1. Technical and Scientific Concerns**
- **RF Radiation and Antenna Mechanics**: Members debated the technical aspects of RF radiation, including the cube-squared law, power distribution, and the directional nature of antennas. There was disagreement over whether radiation increases with distance from a tower, with some members emphasizing the need for precise technical measurements and data to inform decisions.
- **Health and Safety Evidence**: Testimony highlighted conflicting scientific evidence on the health risks of RF radiation, including potential links to cancer and neurological effects. While the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) no longer lists RF radiation as a possible carcinogen, concerns remain about long-term exposure, particularly for children and vulnerable populations.
- **Firefighters’ Case Study**: A cautionary example from California was shared, where firefighters experienced clusters of neurological and immunological illnesses after prolonged exposure to cell towers on their stations. This led to the International Association of Firefighters passing a resolution urging a moratorium on placing cell towers on fire stations.

### **2. Need for Legislative Action**
- **Recommendation for Further Legislation**: After extensive debate, the committee voted 5-1 to recommend further legislative action. The proposed legislation would address education, technical standards, municipal zoning regulations, and public awareness.
- **Regulatory Gaps**: Testimony from experts like Theodora Scarato (Environmental Health Trust) highlighted the lack of federal oversight, citing outdated FCC limits from 1996 and the absence of pre-market safety testing or post-market surveillance. There is no federal agency responsible for monitoring wireless radiation exposure, leading to calls for a comprehensive review of the science.
- **Local Empowerment**: Discussions emphasized the importance of empowering municipalities to regulate the placement of telecommunication towers, particularly near schools, homes, and vulnerable areas. Some members proposed creating a **model ordinance** for towns to adopt, ensuring compliance with federal laws like the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
- **Dual Standards for Cell Towers**: Representative Lewicki suggested a dual standard for regulating cell towers, with different power and distance requirements for small and large installations.

---

### **3. Public Education and Awareness**
- **Dissemination of Information**: A significant focus was on the need for education and dissemination of information to towns and communities, especially smaller ones lacking access to technical resources. Proposed legislation would prioritize public education about RF radiation and its potential effects.
- **Hardwired Solutions**: The importance of promoting hardwired alternatives to wireless technology was emphasized, with resources like Wireless Education and Reinventing Wires mentioned as tools to help municipalities and schools adopt safer technologies.
- **Electromagnetic Sensitivity (EMS)**: Personal testimonies were given by individuals who developed EMS after long-term exposure to wireless technologies, leading to significant health issues and lifestyle changes. These stories underscored the need for public awareness and protective measures.

---

### **4. Municipal Control and Zoning**
- **Setbacks and Safety Measures**: Discussions centered on the need for setbacks (e.g., 1600 feet from residential areas) and safety measures for wireless facilities, with waiver processes for exceptions. Municipalities would be empowered to set their own zoning regulations and make informed decisions about RF radiation in their communities.
- **Model Ordinance**: Some members proposed creating a model ordinance to guide towns in regulating cell phone towers and RF radiation in a way that complies with federal law while addressing local concerns.

---

### **5. Industry Influence and Federal Oversight**
- **Telecommunications Industry**: Concerns were raised about the influence of the telecommunications industry and the need for municipalities to have more control over the placement of cell towers. Testimony highlighted the importance of education and zoning bylaws to protect public health.
- **Federal vs. Local Authority**: While federal laws like the Telecommunications Act of 1996 limit local authority over wireless infrastructure, experts like Scott McCullough (Telecommunications Lawyer) noted that municipalities still have flexibility in regulating tower placement, including setbacks and safety measures.

---

### **6. Next Steps**
- The committee’s recommendation for further legislative action will be presented to the full committee for discussion and potential action. Proposed actions include addressing RF education, technical aspects, municipal concerns, and public awareness.
- The session highlighted the need for a balanced approach that includes education, technical analysis, and community involvement, as well as a comprehensive review of federal oversight and scientific evidence.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities surrounding RF radiation and wireless technologies, with a strong emphasis on public health, education, and local empowerment. The committee recognized the need for further research, updated federal safety standards, and legislative measures to address regulatory gaps and protect communities. The discussions reflected a commitment to fostering informed decision-making and ensuring public awareness about the potential risks and benefits of wireless technologies.
