**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Cooperative School Districts (09/22/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on September 22, 2022, to address the complexities and challenges surrounding Cooperative School Districts (CSDs). The meeting focused on the need for legislative reform, the formation of a study commission, and the review of several bills related to CSDs. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **1. Need for a Study Commission**
There was broad consensus on the necessity of forming a commission to thoroughly study CSDs. The commission would include diverse stakeholders such as educators, accountants, legal professionals, and superintendents to ensure a comprehensive and balanced approach. The scope of the study would address critical issues like:
- **Withdrawal from CSDs**: The legal, financial, and logistical challenges towns face when attempting to withdraw.
- **Financial Apportionment**: Fair distribution of costs and debts among member districts.
- **Board Representation**: Ensuring equitable representation for all member communities.
- **Historical Context**: Understanding the evolution of CSDs since their formation in the 1960s to improve educational opportunities through shared resources.

Participants cautioned against making the study too broad, as it could become overwhelming and dilute its effectiveness.

### **2. Challenges with CSDs**
The discussion highlighted several challenges associated with CSDs:
- **Withdrawal Process**: Attorney Jim O'Shaughnessy emphasized the legal and financial complexities of withdrawal, including the need for approval from both the withdrawing town and the cooperative. Appraising school buildings and transferring property and debt between municipalities were identified as particularly challenging.
- **Dissolution**: The dissolution of CSDs was deemed impractical and costly. Dissolution would require the cooperative to cease as a legal entity, leading to significant financial burdens and disruptions in educational continuity.
- **Local Control vs. State Intervention**: The tension between local decision-making and the need for state-level clarity and reform was a recurring theme. While some argued for maintaining local control, others advocated for state intervention to address systemic issues.

### **3. Legislative Bills**
The committee reviewed several bills aimed at addressing CSD-related issues:
- **HB 1679**: A dissolution bill criticized as a "non-starter" due to its impracticality and potential for astronomical costs.
- **HB 1399**: A bill revising the withdrawal process, particularly focusing on property disposition. It was critiqued for being "very one-sided" and favoring withdrawing districts over the remaining cooperative members.
- **HB 1366**: A bill addressing school board reapportionment to ensure fair representation.

### **4. Financial and Legal Implications**
The financial impact of withdrawal or dissolution was a significant concern. Communities withdrawing from CSDs often face substantial financial burdens, such as paying their share of existing debts and capital improvements. The challenges of appraising older school buildings and transferring property and debt between municipalities were also discussed.

### **5. Historical Context and Public Input**
The co-op system was established in the 1960s to create regional high schools and share costs among communities. However, changing demographics and financial needs have led to increased tensions and calls for reform. Public input from stakeholders, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA), emphasized the need for a comprehensive study commission rather than piecemeal legislation.

### **6. Next Steps**
The committee agreed to meet again on October 12th to finalize recommendations for the commissionâ€™s formation and scope. The goal is to develop a balanced, well-informed approach to addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with CSDs in New Hampshire.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the intricate legal, financial, and political challenges surrounding CSDs. There was a strong emphasis on the need for a thorough review and potential legislative reform to ensure the system meets the current needs of New Hampshire communities. The formation of a study commission was widely supported as a critical step toward achieving this goal.
