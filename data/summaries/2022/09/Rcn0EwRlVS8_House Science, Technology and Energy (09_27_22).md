The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Subcommittee meeting on September 27, 2022, focused on discussing **Senate Bill 259**, which seeks to expand the definition of a "municipal host" to include political subdivisions like the state of New Hampshire, housing authorities, quasi-public entities, and the Pease Development Authority. The discussion centered on whether to recommend the bill for future legislation.

Key points from the meeting:
1. **Support for Expansion**: Several members expressed support for expanding the definition to include the state, as it aligns with efforts to promote renewable energy like solar and wind power. They argued that this expansion could help reduce energy costs and support local energy projects.
2. **Concerns About Clarity**: There were concerns about the lack of clear definitions for terms like "quasi-public entities" and "housing authorities," which could lead to unintended consequences. Some members felt these terms needed clearer boundaries to avoid passing costs unfairly between groups.
3. **Amendment Needed**: It was noted that the bill in its current form is not suitable for passage but could be improved with amendments. The committee discussed the need to address municipal boundary issues and ensure the bill supports broader energy goals without creating inequities.
4. **Future Action**: The committee recommended that the bill be refiled with necessary amendments for consideration in January 2023. They emphasized the importance of refining the bill to ensure it effectively supports renewable energy expansion without unintended drawbacks.
5. **Vote Outcome**: The motion to recommend the bill for future legislation passed, with the understanding that it would need significant revisions before being reintroduced.

The meeting concluded with no further business, and the subcommittee adjourned.
