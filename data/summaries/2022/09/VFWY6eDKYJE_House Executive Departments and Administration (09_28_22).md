The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee met on September 28, 2022, to discuss **HB 1312**, which addresses issues related to **grease interceptors** and conflicts with the state building code (**RSA 155a**). The meeting focused on the findings and recommendations of an **ad hoc committee** formed over the summer to resolve these issues. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Ad Hoc Committee Work**: The committee, consisting of representatives from NH DES (Department of Environmental Services), BCRB (Building Code Review Board), DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services), the State Fire Marshal's Office, and the New Hampshire Building Officials Association, met twice in person and engaged in extensive communication and review. The committee produced a report outlining **nine action steps** to address the issues.

2. **Key Recommendations**:
   - Amend the **International Plumbing Code (IPC)** to clarify that it does not regulate piping and equipment from outside the building to the septic or sewer system, leaving DES to regulate the building sewer and municipal agencies to regulate their systems.
   - Address technical issues with drainage from restaurant sinks when hydromechanical interceptors are used.
   - Allow **interior hydromechanical separators** for certain small occupancies, which are currently permitted by waiver.
   - Amend DES rules to explicitly address grease interceptors in the waiver program and permit a **minimum 500-gallon size** for exterior gravity-type interceptors while retaining the 36-hour detention time.
   - Review and align various reference standards in DES rules and the IPC to ensure consistency.
   - Improve **training and education** for inspectors, contractors, and plumbers to ensure a standardized approach.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The recommendations aim to eliminate conflicts between regulations and provide flexibility for small businesses, particularly those with septic systems. The committee concluded that **legislative action is not required** and that the issues can be resolved through **DES rule amendments** and BCRB updates.

4. **Implementation Timeline**: DES plans to release a **fact sheet** to educate stakeholders and begin the rulemaking process, which is expected to take **6-8 months**. In the interim, DES will use its existing **waiver capability** to address issues.

5. **Grandfathering Concerns**: The committee discussed concerns about **grandfathering** existing systems, particularly for businesses that have been operating legally. DES emphasized **education over regulation**, aiming to inform businesses about the risks of not handling grease waste properly rather than forcing immediate compliance.

6. **Motion and Vote**: The committee voted unanimously to **not recommend future legislation** on the matter, trusting that the proposed rule changes and educational efforts will address the issues effectively.

The meeting concluded with appreciation for the hard work of the ad hoc committee and confidence that the recommendations will resolve the conflicts and provide clarity for small businesses.
