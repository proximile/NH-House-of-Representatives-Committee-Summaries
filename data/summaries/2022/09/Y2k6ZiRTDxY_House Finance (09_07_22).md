The NH House of Representatives meeting on September 7, 2022, focused on several legislative matters:

1. **HB 623**: The committee agreed to consider HB 623 for future legislation in the next session, with a vote of 16-2 in favor. This bill was related to education funding, though it was noted that specific funding concerns were not directly addressed in the current bill.

2. **HB 1300**: The committee discussed a request for $500,000 related to an ash landfill managed by a non-profit. It was resolved that no further legislative action was needed, as a solution had been reached with the Department of Environmental Services (DES). The vote was unanimous (17-0) to not pursue additional legislation.

3. **HB 1665**: This bill aimed to establish a municipal road and bridge disaster relief fund, prompted by damage from recent floods in the western part of the state. The committee decided no further action was necessary, as a bill had already been passed and signed by the governor to assist towns with disaster declarations. The vote was 17-0 in favor of no further action.

4. **Recognition of Representative Robert De Bears**: The committee acknowledged Representative De Bears for his years of service, particularly his work on finance and ways and means committees, as well as his dedication to caring for his mother. He announced he would not run for re-election but would instead run unopposed for county commissioner.

The meeting concluded with adjournment after these discussions and votes.
