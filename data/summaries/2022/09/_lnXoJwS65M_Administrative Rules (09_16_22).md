The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on Administrative Rules, held on September 16, 2022, addressed a wide range of topics related to proposed changes, expired rules, and regulatory oversight. The discussions focused on ensuring clarity, consistency, and adherence to statutory authority while balancing public health, safety, and individual rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the key segments:

---

### **1. Immunization Exemptions and Public Health**
The meeting began with a detailed discussion on proposed changes to administrative rules regarding immunization exemptions, particularly religious exemptions. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) proposed removing the notary requirement from the religious exemption form but introduced additional conditions, such as requiring parents to acknowledge disease risks and disclose specific medical information. Key points included:
- **Statutory Authority Concerns**: Representatives argued that the new requirements exceeded the statutory language of RSA 141-C:20-c, which only requires parents to state their religious objections to immunization.
- **Data Collection and Consent**: Concerns were raised about collecting medical data without explicit consent, potentially violating legislative intent and constitutional rights.
- **Public Health vs. Parental Rights**: While the DHHS emphasized the need for additional information to manage public health risks (e.g., school outbreaks), representatives countered that such requirements could intimidate parents and were not legally mandated.
- **Proposed Solutions**: The committee considered simplifying the form to align with statutory language, removing additional acknowledgments, and making the listing of exempted vaccines optional. The DHHS agreed to revise the form and rule text, and the decision was postponed to the October 6th meeting for further review.

### **2. Waivers, Insurance, and Public Utilities**
The committee reviewed various rules and waiver processes, emphasizing transparency and consistency:
- **Waivers**: Since 2018, 10 waiver requests were made, with 7 granted and 3 withdrawn. The committee stressed the importance of setting specific time limits for waivers and ensuring consistency in language.
- **Insurance Rules**: The committee discussed rules related to liquid reserves for life insurance policies, adding waiver language for future-proofing despite its unlikely use.
- **Charitable Trusts**: Questions were raised about the Department of Justice’s enforcement of charitable trust practices without formal rules, despite having rulemaking authority since 1987.
- **Public Utilities**: The committee conditionally approved changes to municipal and county aggregation rules, noting recent legislation (SB 265) as a point of reference.

### **3. Public Safety and Health Regulations**
The meeting also addressed rules related to public safety and health:
- **Ignition Interlock Program**: The Department of Safety proposed setting the alcohol concentration level for ignition interlock devices at 0.020, below the statutory violation level of 0.025. While the committee approved the rule, it requested the department seek statutory authority for the lower threshold.
- **Involuntary Emergency Admissions (IEA)**: The committee reviewed expired rules for the IEA process, focusing on clarifying the distinction between petitions and certificates and the timing of probable cause hearings. Conditional approval was granted, with further work requested to address these issues.
- **Immunization Registry**: Interim rules related to religious exemptions and withdrawal from the immunization registry were updated to reflect recent legislative changes (HB 1035 and HB 1487). The committee expressed concerns about the DHHS posting forms without proper approval, emphasizing the need for oversight.

### **4. Professional Licensing and Expired Rules**
The committee discussed rules governing various professions and addressed expired rules:
- **Electrologists**: The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) addressed expired rules for electrologists, previously under DHHS jurisdiction. Questions were raised about fee discrepancies and enforcement mechanisms during the expiration period. OPLC proposed revising language to align fees with PLC 1002 and committed to providing a report on activities since the rules expired.
- **Veterinary Medicine**: Expired rules from 2020 were reviewed, with OPLC prioritizing their renewal and addressing fee refunds collected during the expiration period.
- **Alcohol and Drug Use Professionals**: The committee questioned the need for additional rules when existing Department of Justice rules and PLC 200s appeared sufficient. The agency sought to formalize its practices despite the expired rules.

### **5. Revenue and Insurance Department Rules**
The committee addressed issues related to revenue and insurance regulations:
- **Revenue Department**: Concerns were raised about forms requiring signatures under penalties of perjury. The committee debated the statutory authority for such requirements and suggested legislative changes to clarify their use.
- **Insurance Department**: The committee reviewed rules related to valuation mortality tables and waiver provisions, emphasizing the need for consistent language and clarity in future rulemaking. The department agreed to remove non-model rule language and address inconsistencies.

### **6. Postponements and Future Meetings**
Several items were postponed for further review, with most moved to the October 6th meeting and a few to October 20th. The committee emphasized the importance of addressing unresolved issues and ensuring that all rule changes align with statutory authority and legislative intent.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
Throughout the meeting, the committee consistently emphasized:
- **Clarity and Consistency**: Ensuring that rules are clear, consistent, and aligned with statutory authority.
- **Public Safety and Individual Rights**: Balancing public health and safety concerns with respect for individual rights, particularly in areas like immunization exemptions and ignition interlock regulations.
- **Transparency and Oversight**: Promoting transparency in waiver processes, rulemaking, and enforcement, while addressing expired rules and fee structures.
- **Conditional Approvals**: Granting conditional approvals to allow agencies to address concerns and revise rules before final implementation.

The meeting concluded with a consensus to adjourn and reconvene on October 6th to finalize decisions on unresolved issues, ensuring that all proposed rules meet the committee’s standards for clarity, consistency, and statutory compliance.
