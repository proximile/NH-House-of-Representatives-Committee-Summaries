### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (09/28/22)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on September 28, 2022, to discuss critical issues facing the state’s Human Rights Commission (HRC) and to address broader challenges related to case backlogs, resource allocation, and procedural efficiency. The meeting was divided into three segments, each focusing on specific aspects of the HRC’s operations and potential legislative actions.

#### **Key Discussion Points and Outcomes**

1. **Case Backlog and Resource Needs**  
   The HRC is grappling with a significant backlog of approximately 250 cases, accumulated over a decade due to limited resources. While new cases are being processed efficiently, older cases remain unresolved. The committee emphasized the need for additional staffing, administrative support, and funding to address the backlog and meet statutory requirements. High turnover, driven by better-paying opportunities elsewhere, has exacerbated the issue, leading to concerns about the HRC becoming a "training agency." Members stressed the importance of stabilizing the commission by ensuring resources beyond normal operational levels.

2. **Probable Cause Standard**  
   The HRC’s application of the probable cause standard in discrimination cases was a major point of debate. While the statutory language is considered adequate, the committee raised concerns about the HRC’s process, which involves extensive investigations before determining probable cause. Some members argued that this approach effectively adjudicates cases prematurely, contrary to the standard’s intended purpose as a preliminary assessment. Suggestions included clarifying the statute to align probable cause with a simpler, triage-like determination and ensuring that commissioners, rather than investigators, play a more active role in early case review.

3. **Procedural Changes and Streamlining**  
   In February 2022, the HRC implemented internal procedural changes that increased case closures by 50%. However, the backlog persists due to ongoing new case filings. The committee discussed further streamlining processes, such as creating checklists for investigators, simplifying the initial complaint process, and updating expired HRC rules. These measures aim to reduce investigation times, expedite case handling, and improve overall efficiency.

4. **Transparency, Accountability, and Enforcement**  
   Concerns were raised about the transparency of the HRC’s decision-making process, particularly the role of investigators in determining probable cause. The committee reviewed a redacted case report to understand the level of detail involved in investigations, questioning whether such extensive work is necessary for probable cause determinations. Additionally, members discussed implementing penalties for non-cooperation by respondents and creating mechanisms for executive directors to refer underperforming investigators to the Commission for review.

5. **Comparison with Other Agencies**  
   The committee compared the HRC’s processes with those of other agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Ethics Committee, which do not require a probable cause determination before moving forward with hearings. The HRC’s more extensive process was seen as a potential barrier to timely case resolution, prompting suggestions for alignment with other agencies’ practices.

6. **Legislative Recommendations and Collaboration**  
   The committee considered recommending the reintroduction of **SB 296**, which would remove respondents’ right to remove cases after a probable cause finding. They also discussed urging the HRC and the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (GEL CAR) to update expired rules and clarify statutory language. Additionally, members proposed involving external resources, such as the New Hampshire Bar Association or law school clinics, to assist with the HRC’s caseload and provide expertise.

7. **Performance Audit and Funding**  
   There was consensus on the need for a performance audit of the HRC to identify inefficiencies and justify increased funding. Members acknowledged that the agency’s current resources are inadequate to meet its statutory obligations and stressed the importance of securing additional funding to support its operations.

#### **Report Drafting and Next Steps**  
The committee reviewed five key items to include in their report, focusing on preventing the HRC from becoming a "training agency" and ensuring resource stability. Representative Wolper raised concerns about the report-writing process, leading the chair to coordinate a meeting before the full committee session on October 19th to finalize the document. The chair thanked members for their collaborative effort and patience, expressing readiness to reconvene on October 19th.

#### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the urgent need to address the HRC’s backlog, clarify procedural standards, and secure additional resources. The committee’s discussions centered on improving efficiency, ensuring accountability, and maintaining fairness in the investigative process. Recommendations included statutory updates, procedural streamlining, and increased funding, with a focus on collaboration and transparency to enhance the HRC’s effectiveness. The committee’s final report, to be presented on October 19th, will outline these priorities and proposed actions.
