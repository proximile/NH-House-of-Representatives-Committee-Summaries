### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (September 14, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on September 14, 2022, to discuss the operations, challenges, and potential reforms of the **New Hampshire Human Rights Commission (HRC)**. The meeting focused on the HRC’s role in addressing employment, housing, and public accommodations discrimination, as well as inefficiencies in its processes. Key themes included the lengthy investigation timelines, backlog of cases, staffing shortages, and potential legislative changes to improve efficiency and access to justice. Here is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

#### **1. HRC’s Role and Purpose**
The HRC was established to provide a remedy for human rights violations, offering an accessible avenue for individuals who face discrimination but lack the financial means or legal representation to pursue private litigation. It serves as a critical resource for employees experiencing harassment or discrimination, ensuring that justice is not limited to those who can afford attorneys.

---

#### **2. Investigation Process and Challenges**
- **Probable Cause Determination**: The HRC uses a "probable cause" standard to determine whether a case should proceed, which requires sufficient evidence to suggest discrimination may have occurred. This standard is less stringent than the "more likely than not" standard used in court hearings. The committee questioned why the HRC bears the burden of interviewing witnesses during this phase, especially in cases involving pro se complainants who may not provide adequate rebuttals.
- **Lengthy Timelines**: Investigations often take months or even years, with some cases lingering in the backlog since 2011. Legislators expressed frustration over these delays, emphasizing that justice should be delivered within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within a year.
- **Case Backlog**: The HRC faces a significant backlog due to staffing shortages and resource constraints. Currently, there are only five investigators, though nine are requested. Budget limitations have delayed recruitment efforts, exacerbating the issue.

---

#### **3. Discussion of SB 296**
- **Impact of SB 296**: The bill aims to prevent respondents from removing cases to court after a probable cause finding. While this could increase the HRC’s workload, legislators debated whether the burden would be significant, given the low removal rate (e.g., 6 out of 307 cases in one year).
- **Concerns About Burden**: Some legislators worried that SB 296 might impose additional strain on the HRC, while others argued that the bill’s benefits—such as reducing delays—outweighed the potential burden.

---

#### **4. Proposed Reforms and Recommendations**
- **Streamlining Processes**: Suggestions included setting stricter deadlines, removing the 180-day waiting period for cases to be removed from the HRC to court, and appointing attorneys to handle discovery to expedite cases.
- **Performance Audit**: A performance audit of the HRC was proposed to identify underlying inefficiencies. While a financial audit was previously conducted, it did not address performance aspects. The audit process is expected to begin in October.
- **Penalty Mechanisms**: The committee explored introducing penalties or enforcement mechanisms to ensure the HRC adheres to statutory deadlines, drawing comparisons to other legal contexts where timely justice is enforced through penalties.
- **Mediation and Settlement**: The HRC’s mediation program has an 80% success rate, with most cases resolved before reaching a hearing. However, this contributes to the low number of hearings (e.g., only three hearings in a year).

---

#### **5. Broader Systemic Issues**
- **Staffing and Resources**: The HRC’s efficiency has been hindered by budget cuts and staffing shortages. Legislators acknowledged the need for urgent reforms but recognized the limitations of their interim study committee.
- **Role of Attorneys**: While the HRC assists individuals without legal representation, attorneys can expedite cases by removing them from the commission and taking them to court. However, some attorneys use the HRC’s process for free discovery, which prolongs cases.
- **Commissioners’ Role**: The commissioners, who are not necessarily attorneys, are trained to understand legal standards and make determinations on probable cause. They also oversee hearings for cases that proceed to that stage.

---

#### **6. Data Analysis and Historical Context**
A representative presented data from 2009 to 2017, showing that some years saw more cases closed than filed. This prompted a discussion on what led to those efficiencies and how they could be replicated. Legislators emphasized the need to analyze the impact of recent process changes and explore further improvements.

---

#### **7. Next Steps**
The committee agreed to reconvene on September 28th to delve deeper into these issues, with a focus on analyzing the HRC’s processes, the potential impact of SB 296, and broader systemic changes to improve efficiency and access to justice.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the HRC’s critical role in addressing discrimination but underscored the need for urgent reforms to reduce delays, streamline processes, and improve efficiency. Legislators expressed a commitment to ensuring that justice is delivered in a timely manner while preserving the HRC’s accessibility and effectiveness.
