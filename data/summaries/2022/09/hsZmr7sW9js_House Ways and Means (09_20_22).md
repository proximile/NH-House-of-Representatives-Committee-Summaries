### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (September 20, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on September 20, 2022, to address a wide range of fiscal and policy issues, focusing on revenue sources, tax policies, funding for critical programs, and interim study bills. The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to financial stability, equitable taxation, and collaborative, bipartisan decision-making. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **Revenue Sources and Stability**
- **Diverse Revenue Streams**: Representative Tucker emphasized the importance of New Hampshire’s diverse revenue sources, including taxes on charitable gaming and sports betting, which contribute to the state’s financial resilience. This broad revenue base helps mitigate the impact of economic downturns compared to states reliant on fewer revenue streams.
- **Tax Policy Debate**: The committee debated the merits of a regressive tax on cell phone bills. Some members argued for its elimination, citing its disproportionate burden on low-income residents, while others stressed the need to maintain diverse revenue sources to avoid over-reliance on any single tax.

#### **Funding for Critical Programs**
1. **County Nursing Homes**:
   - Representative Aaron proposed establishing a **capital reserve fund** to address the escalating costs of renovating or rebuilding county nursing homes. Federal guidelines requiring private rooms have increased financial strain on counties.
   - While short-term funding from ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) is available, the committee acknowledged the need for a **long-term funding mechanism** to support these essential facilities.

2. **Opioid Abatement Trust Fund**:
   - The committee discussed the allocation of funds from opioid settlements, focusing on ensuring **equitable distribution** across counties and municipalities.
   - Concerns were raised about the fairness of competitive grants, as some regions are better equipped to secure funding than others. The committee emphasized the need for **oversight** to prioritize critical programs, such as expanding access to Narcan.

The committee voted on several bills:
- **House Bill 1500**: The committee voted **13-3** not to recommend the bill for future legislation.

#### **Interim Study Bills**
