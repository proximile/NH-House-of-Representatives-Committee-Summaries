**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (September 16, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on September 16, 2022, to address a wide range of critical issues affecting the state’s healthcare and human services systems. The meeting began with procedural matters, including roll call and the approval of minutes from the June 24th meeting. Deputy Commissioner Lori Weaver provided updates on **Hampstead Hospital**, highlighting its transition to new ownership, workforce challenges, and plans for a Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF). Concerns were also raised about the potential closure of the **Sununu Youth Services Center** without a replacement plan, prompting Representative Jess Edwards to propose bills to extend the closure date and define the replacement center’s capacity.

The committee established two subcommittees: one to investigate **transparency and reporting issues** within the New Hampshire Board of Medicine following malpractice allegations, and another to focus on **precision medicine and biomarker testing** as outlined in HB 1290. Updates on **healthcare facility visitation policies** (House Bill 1439) were provided by the New Hampshire Hospital Association, emphasizing the importance of visitation for patient healing and the challenges posed by COVID-19 surges. Questions were also raised about the status of **mobile vaccine vans**, particularly regarding the vaccination of children, with the committee requesting a public-facing document from Dr. Chan detailing the scientific basis for vaccinating healthy children.

The meeting delved into broader healthcare challenges, including **workforce shortages**, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic, leading to increased reliance on travel nurses and contract labor. Discussions on **patient safety and quality of care** highlighted efforts by the New Hampshire Healthcare Quality and Safety Commission to promote high reliability organizations, just cultures, and evidence-based practices. The rise in **workplace violence** against healthcare workers was noted, with legislative efforts underway to address this through the development of a Healthcare Workplace Safety Commission. **Health inequities** were also discussed, focusing on barriers related to education, language, age, and ability to pay.

The committee reviewed progress on New Hampshire’s **10-Year Mental Health Plan**, which has seen significant advancements in crisis response systems, including the launch of the New Hampshire Rapid Response system and expanded community-based services. The state is also making strides in implementing a **Medicaid dental program**, set to begin in April 2023, aimed at improving access to dental care for Medicaid recipients. However, **workforce shortages** continue to delay the start of services for individuals on developmental disabilities and acquired brain disorder (ABD) waitlists, prompting the state to conduct a cost survey to develop a new rate methodology.

Stakeholder engagement was a recurring theme, with the Bureau of Developmental Services actively working with providers, area agencies, individuals, and families to redesign services. The committee also emphasized the need for **clarity and transparency** in visual information provided in reports to avoid public misinterpretation.

In summary, the meeting underscored the ongoing challenges in healthcare delivery, including workforce shortages, workplace violence, and health inequities, while highlighting progress in mental health services, Medicaid dental care, and stakeholder engagement. The committee’s focus on transparency, patient safety, and collaborative solutions reflects a commitment to addressing these complex issues and improving health and human services in New Hampshire.
