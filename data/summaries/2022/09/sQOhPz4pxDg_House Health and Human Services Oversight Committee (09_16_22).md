**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (September 16, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on September 16, 2022, to discuss a wide range of health and human services initiatives, addressing critical issues such as mental health, dental care, developmental disabilities, hospital operations, patient rights, workforce shortages, and public health policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions from the meeting:

### **Health and Human Services Initiatives**
1. **Mental Health Services**:
   - The state has seen a 23% increase in enrollment for wraparound services for children and families experiencing emotional disturbances. Supported housing rates were increased to expand services, with six new beds implemented across regions (20 out of 60 beds currently occupied).
   - The **Critical Time Intervention (CTI)** program was launched statewide to support individuals transitioning from inpatient care to the community, aiming to reduce readmissions.
   - **New Hampshire Rapid Response**, the state’s transformed crisis response system, has been highly utilized, with over 16,000 contacts and 4,000 community-based deployments in its first six months. Programs like **Fast Forward** provide intensive support for individuals with mental health needs.

2. **Dental Care for Medicaid Recipients**:
   - The state is progressing toward implementing a standalone dental care program for Medicaid recipients by April 1, 2023. A **Request for Information (RFI)** and **Request for Proposals (RFP)** were posted, with responses due by September 30, 2022. Efforts to recruit more dentists include student loan repayment programs.

3. **Developmental Disability Services**:
   - In fiscal year 2022, funding was allocated to 797 individuals for home and community-based care, with 71% starting services and 29% waiting due to workforce shortages. For acquired brain disorder services, 44 people were funded, with 67% receiving services and 33% waiting.
   - Stakeholder engagement is ongoing to address workforce challenges and improve service delivery.

4. **Workforce Challenges**:
   - Workforce shortages are a significant barrier across mental health, dental care, and developmental disability services. Efforts to address this include increasing pay rates, providing bonuses, and recruiting through various programs. Hospitals are also heavily reliant on traveling nurses and contract labor, which has driven up costs and impacted patient care.

### **Hospital Operations, Patient Rights, and Safety**
1. **Hospital Communication and Patient Rights**:
   - Hospitals are improving communication with patients regarding denials or revocations of visitation rights, using nurse managers, unit supervisors, or security staff. Documentation is handled through electronic medical records (EMR) or security logs.
   - Hospitals are required to inform patients about their **Bill of Rights**, though the document has not been updated since 2021.

2. **Patient Safety and Quality of Care**:
   - The **New Hampshire Healthcare Quality and Safety Commission** focuses on promoting high reliability organizations, establishing just cultures, and adopting evidence-based best practices. Efforts include addressing workplace violence, opioid safety, and adverse event reporting.

3. **Hospital Visitation Policy Updates**:
   - Updates on **House Bill 1439** highlighted efforts to ensure patients and families are informed of visitation policies through admission packets, posted materials, and online resources. Flexibility in communication was emphasized to avoid outdated information.

### **Legislative and Policy Updates**
1. **Hampstead Hospital and Sununu Youth Services Center**:
   - **Hampstead Hospital** has been operational as a residential treatment facility for three months, with plans to create a **Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF)** by the end of the year. Workforce shortages remain a challenge, but recruitment efforts are ongoing.
   - Concerns were raised about the **Sununu Youth Services Center**, which is slated to close by March 30, 2023, without a clear replacement plan. Legislators expressed worries about public safety and the potential release of high-risk youth.

2. **Transparency and Precision Medicine**:
   - A subcommittee was proposed to investigate transparency issues with the **New Hampshire Board of Medicine**, particularly in reporting malpractice claims. The motion passed unanimously.
   - The **Task Force on Precision Medicine and Biomarker Testing**, established by **HB 1290**, will continue its work, with a final report expected by November.

3. **Vaccination and Public Health**:
   - Questions were raised about the **closed-loop referral system** and the use of federal funds for **mobile vaccination vans** targeting children under five and boosters for older children. Clear public communication on the scientific basis for vaccination policies was emphasized.

### **Future Plans**
- The chair committed to forming subcommittees for transparency and precision medicine, encouraging committee members to express interest in serving on these subcommittees.

### **Key Themes**
- **Workforce Shortages**: A recurring challenge across healthcare sectors, impacting service delivery and patient care.
- **Transparency and Communication**: Efforts to improve clarity, accuracy, and public communication in healthcare policies and service delivery.
- **Mental Health and Crisis Response**: Significant progress in expanding community-based services and housing supports, with ongoing efforts to address gaps.
- **Legislative Action**: Active engagement in addressing healthcare issues, including workforce violence, mental health planning, and patient rights.

The meeting underscored the state’s commitment to expanding and improving health and human services while addressing persistent challenges such as workforce shortages, funding constraints, and the need for greater transparency.
