**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (September 9, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on September 9, 2022, to address a wide array of fiscal and policy matters. The meeting covered discussions on retention incentives, public school infrastructure, SNAP benefits, mental health services, audits, health benefits, behavioral health, emergency shelter funding, litigation, recruitment and retention programs, birth centers, business recoupment, winter maintenance, and various departmental funding requests. Below is a detailed summary of the key topics and decisions:

---

### **1. Retention Incentives and ARPA Funding**
The committee discussed retention incentives for state employees, including state police, fire safety personnel, and corrections staff. These incentives included lump-sum payments and salary enhancements, particularly for nurses in correctional facilities. The Department of Corrections requested American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding to support a 15% retention enhancement for nurses, as the department could not absorb the cost within its existing budget. The committee approved the ARPA funding request.

---

### **2. Public School Infrastructure Fund**
The committee reviewed a program aimed at improving school security, focusing on access control, emergency alerting, and surveillance. Approximately $3.8 million was allocated to 177 applications across 92 schools, with a second round of $10 million in funding being processed.

---

### **3. SNAP Benefits and Eligibility**
The committee discussed increasing the income threshold for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility from 185% to 200% of the federal poverty level. This change aims to mitigate the "cliff effect," where a slight increase in income leads to a sudden loss of benefits. The committee also explored the broader implications of this change on other programs like free and reduced-price school lunches and planned to revisit the budgetary impact in a future meeting.

---

### **4. Mental Health Services**
The committee addressed concerns about declining client numbers at community mental health centers, attributing the reduction to staffing shortages and seasonal variations. Efforts to support these centers through Medicaid rate increases and ARPA funding were highlighted.

---

### **5. Audit of Military Affairs and Veterans Services**
The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) presented an audit of the Department of Military Affairs and Veterans Services, identifying areas for improvement in financial operations, risk assessment, and documentation. The department concurred with all recommendations.

---

### **6. Health Benefits for State Employees and Retirees**
The Division of Risk and Benefits provided an overview of the state’s health benefit plans, distinguishing between self-funded plans for active employees and fully insured plans for retirees. Key points included:
- **Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP)**: The state’s Medicare Part D plan allows retention of federal subsidies for prescription drugs.
- **Aetna Contract**: A three-year contract with Aetna provides Medicare Advantage coverage for retirees at zero premium cost to the state, saving $15 million annually.
- **Cost Containment**: Strategies like procurement processes, plan design changes, and maximizing federal subsidies have reduced costs significantly.
- **Retiree Health Benefits**: Retirees now contribute a portion of health benefit costs, with Medicare retirees paying approximately $20 per month.
- **Future Strategies**: The state plans to continue exploring cost containment and preventive care initiatives.

---

### **7. Behavioral Health and Higher Acuity Services**
The committee discussed the increased demand for behavioral health services, particularly higher acuity care, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is working to secure vendors, with Solution Health being considered to offset capital costs for building services.

---

### **8. Emergency Shelter Funding**
The committee approved funding for emergency shelters, addressing homelessness in small towns with limited services. The funding allows for the use of motel or hotel rooms as temporary shelters, particularly in northern parts of the state.

---

### **9. Litigation Fund Request**
The Department of Justice requested additional funding for its litigation fund to support complex cases like YDC litigation, school funding lawsuits, and redistricting cases. The request was larger than usual due to the complexity and stage of ongoing cases.

---

### **10. Recruitment and Retention Programs**
The Department of Administrative Services presented recruitment and retention initiatives for state employees, particularly in 24/7 facilities like state police, correctional facilities, and the veterans' home. The programs include one-time bonuses and retention payments funded by ARPA and other state funds. Concerns were raised about the sustainability of these payments and the long-term need for competitive wages.

---

### **11. Birth Centers and Malpractice Insurance**
The committee discussed funding for birth centers and the impact of rising malpractice insurance costs. The state is providing one-time ARPA funds to help centers manage these costs, with the expectation that increased Medicaid rates will provide ongoing support.

---

### **12. Recoupment Program for Businesses**
The committee reviewed a program to assist businesses facing federal recoupment requirements due to COVID-19 relief funds. The program offers a two-year, interest-free repayment option for businesses that received aid but performed better than expected.

---

### **13. Winter Maintenance Program**
The Department of Transportation requested funding for winter maintenance, extending the program to state employees with commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs) who can assist with snow removal.

---

### **14. Consent Calendar and Departmental Funding Requests**
The committee approved several items on the consent calendar, including:
- **Department of Agriculture**: Funding for an agricultural position (FIS-275).
- **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**: Funding for birthing centers (FIS-277), personal care attendants (FIS-278), mobile vaccination services (FIS-304), and $15 million for SolutionHealth (FIS-305).
- **Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP)**: Reallocating funds for ERAP (FIS-317).
- **Youth and Adult Homeless Shelters**: Allocating funds for youth and young adult homeless shelters (FIS-300).
- **Department of Safety**: Replacing non-functional highway signs (FIS-302).

---

### **Key Themes and Concerns**
Throughout the meeting, committee members emphasized the importance of:
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Ensuring all funding requests are supported by quantifiable data.
- **Sustainability**: Addressing the long-term viability of one-time funding initiatives, particularly for workforce retention and housing affordability.
- **Cost Containment**: Exploring innovative strategies to manage health benefit costs and maximize federal subsidies.
- **Public Health and Safety**: Prioritizing initiatives that improve school security, mental health services, and emergency shelter access.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the hard work by various state departments and a commitment to addressing the state’s fiscal and policy challenges in future sessions.
