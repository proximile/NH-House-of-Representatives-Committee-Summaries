**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on September 15, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on September 15, 2022, for a significant session that blended legislative actions, procedural matters, and heartfelt farewells. The meeting was marked by debates on key bills, veto overrides, memorial resolutions, and special recognitions, culminating in the conclusion of the 2022 legislative session.

### **Opening Proceedings**
The session began with traditional opening formalities, including a prayer led by Reverend Bob Stewart, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the National Anthem. Leaves of absence were granted, and guests were introduced. A **memorial resolution** was presented to honor **Representative Mary Griffin**, who passed away at the age of 96 after serving 13 terms in the House.

### **Legislative Actions**
The House addressed several bills, with a focus on veto overrides and the introduction of new legislation:

1. **HB 2023-FN-A**: This bill, which appropriates funds for a state emergency fuel assistance program and supplemental electric benefits for low-income households, was introduced and passed after debate. Proponents argued it was necessary to address rising energy costs, while opponents criticized it for lacking a phase-out provision and bypassing standard legislative processes.

2. **Veto Overrides**:
   - **HB 52 (Congressional Redistricting)**: The House failed to override the governor’s veto. Opponents argued the bill unfairly altered congressional districts too close to the election.
   - **HB 275 (State of Emergency)**: The veto was sustained. The bill aimed to limit the governor’s emergency powers to 84 days unless extended by the legislature, but opponents deemed it unnecessary.
   - **HB 319 (Civics Testing)**: The House sustained the veto on a bill requiring college students to pass a U.S. citizenship test. Supporters emphasized civic education, while opponents questioned the mandate’s effectiveness.
   - **HB 1022 (Ivermectin Dispensing)**: The veto was sustained. The bill would have allowed pharmacists to dispense ivermectin for COVID-19 via standing orders, but opponents cited insufficient evidence for its efficacy.
   - **HB 1131 (School Mask Mandates)**: The veto was sustained. The bill sought to prevent schools from mandating face masks, with supporters emphasizing parental rights and opponents stressing local control.
   - **HB 1454 (Landfill Regulations)**: The House successfully overrode the veto. The bill imposes stricter regulations for siting new landfills to protect water resources. Supporters highlighted environmental protection, while opponents argued it could hinder landfill operations.
   - **HB 1625 (Buffer Zone Repeal)**: The veto was sustained. The bill aimed to repeal buffer zone restrictions around reproductive health care facilities, with supporters emphasizing free speech and opponents prioritizing public safety.
