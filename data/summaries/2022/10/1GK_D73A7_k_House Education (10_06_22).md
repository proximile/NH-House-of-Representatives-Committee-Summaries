The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 6, 2022, focused on addressing student hunger and expanding school meal programs. The discussion centered on **House Bill 1229**, which aims to improve access to nutritious meals for students across the state. Key themes and takeaways from the meeting include:

### **Student Nutrition and Hunger**
- Representatives emphasized the critical role of school meal programs, particularly breakfast, in combating student hunger and improving academic performance. High school students were highlighted as a group often missing breakfast due to early schedules.
- The committee stressed the need to ensure all students, regardless of grade level or socioeconomic status, have access to nutritious meals.

### **Program Implementation and Models**
- The committee debated whether to phase in meal programs starting with elementary schools or implement them universally across all grades. They examined successful models from other states, including **Delaware, Maine, New Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia**, to inform potential strategies for New Hampshire.
  - **Delaware**: Mandates breakfast programs in all public and charter schools, with significant state funding for food service staff.
  - **Maine**: Operates a universal no-cost meals program, supported by a dedicated fund and incentives for purchasing local produce.
  - **New Mexico**: Requires "Breakfast After the Bell" in schools with high rates of eligible students, with funding prioritized for needier schools.
  - **Vermont**: Offers universal free breakfast and lunch to eligible students, though the program faces potential repeal in 2023 unless long-term funding is secured.

### **Challenges and Solutions**
- **Funding and Data Collection**: The committee discussed the challenges of identifying eligible students, particularly those who do not apply for free and reduced meals due to stigma or lack of awareness. Using Medicaid data to identify eligible students was proposed as a potential solution.
- **Financial Implications**: Expanding meal programs would require careful financial planning, including state funding, federal reimbursements, and local district costs. The committee explored potential funding mechanisms, such as taxes on sugary drinks or expanding the sales tax.
- **Staffing and Logistics**: Concerns were raised about the costs of hiring additional food service employees, including salaries, benefits, and retirement contributions.
- **Local Agriculture and Sustainability**: Integrating local farm produce into school meal programs was discussed as a way to support both students and local farmers, though concerns were raised about the feasibility of year-round availability.

### **Legislative Recommendations and Next Steps**
- The committee concluded that no further study was needed and recommended moving forward with legislation to address student hunger. They plan to draft specific recommendations based on their discussions and present them at a follow-up meeting on October 24th.
- The Department of Education was tasked with providing updated cost estimates and participation data to inform future decisions.
- The committee will continue to analyze data and consider recommendations for funding mechanisms and program expansion, with a focus on ensuring sustainability and accessibility.

### **Overall Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing student hunger and the need for creative, sustainable solutions to ensure all students have access to nutritious meals. While the financial and logistical challenges of implementing universal school meal programs are significant, the committee expressed a strong commitment to exploring viable options and learning from successful models in other states. The discussions highlighted the importance of collaboration between state and local entities, as well as the potential for innovative funding strategies to support these critical programs.
