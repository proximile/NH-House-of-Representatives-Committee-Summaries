### **Legislative Recommendations and Votes**
1. **Senate Bill 243 (Transfer of Death on Deeds for Real Property)**

2. **Senate Bill 296 (Complaint Procedures Before the Commission for Human Rights)**

     - Allocating necessary resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

   - The committee recommended future legislation but noted the bill needed further refinement to address protections against fraud and undue influence.

4. **House Bill 248 (Judicial Retirement Plan)**
