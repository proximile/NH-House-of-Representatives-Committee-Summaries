**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (October 12, 2022)**

The meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee on October 12, 2022, covered a wide range of topics related to commerce, consumer protection, and legislative proposals. The discussions focused on addressing emerging challenges in online marketplaces, modernizing liquor licensing requirements, regulating consumer products, and balancing enforcement with practicality and safety concerns.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes:**

#### **1. Online Marketplaces and Counterfeit Goods**
   - **Issue**: The sale of counterfeit and stolen goods through third-party online platforms is a growing concern, with law enforcement struggling to track and prosecute anonymous sellers.
   - **Proposed Legislation**: A bill was discussed requiring online sellers to provide verified information (e.g., name, address, contact details) to prevent fraudulent activities. This legislation, modeled after laws in other states, aims to empower law enforcement and protect consumers and retailers, including those in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.
   - **Challenges**: Concerns were raised about interstate commerce, enforcement resources, and the effectiveness of similar laws in other states. The Attorney General’s office supported the bill but noted implementation challenges.

#### **2. Liquor Licensing and Convenience Store Regulations**
   - **$3,000 Grocery Stock Requirement**: Convenience stores selling liquor are required to maintain $3,000 worth of wholesale grocery stock, excluding alcohol, tobacco, and magazines. This rule was criticized for forcing stores to stock unsellable items, leading to waste.
   - **Proposed Changes**: The committee debated expanding the list of allowable items to include prepared foods (e.g., burritos, hot dogs) or emergency supplies (e.g., first aid kits, bottled water). Prepared foods were seen as potentially mitigating alcohol-related safety issues, but concerns were raised about additional licensing and kitchen requirements.
   - **Rule vs. Statute Changes**: The committee favored rule changes by the Liquor Commission over new legislation, encouraging the Commission to modernize its rules to reflect current consumer preferences and reduce reliance on outdated items.
   - **Enforcement Division**: The committee unanimously supported retaining the Liquor Commission’s enforcement division, emphasizing its role in education and enforcement related to alcohol and drug issues.

#### **3. Paid Family Leave and Workplace Regulations**
   - **Granite State Paid Family Leave**: The committee discussed the voluntary paid family leave program for state employees and private sector employers, administered by MetLife. Enrollment was set to begin on January 1, 2023, but concerns were raised about its sustainability, political implications, and potential perception as an income tax.
   - **Repeal of Current Paid Family Leave Law**: There was debate over repealing the existing law, which mandates reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees. Some argued that accommodations should be voluntary, while others opposed labeling pregnancy as a disability.

#### **4. Consumer Product and Safety Regulations**
   - **Food Allergy Awareness (House Bill 65)**: The bill requires food service establishments to implement allergen awareness procedures. Updated food rules, including allergen notices on menus, became effective in August 2022, with enforcement starting in September.
   - **Statewide Food Truck License**: A bill proposing a statewide food truck license was discussed to streamline operations across municipalities. However, concerns were raised about local governments’ reluctance to relinquish licensing authority, making the bill impractical.
   - **PFAS Regulation (House Bill 1589)**: The committee acknowledged the complexity of regulating PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and noted challenges faced by other states. Federal action was seen as necessary, and the bill was deemed unfeasible at the state level.
   - **Kratom Regulation (House Bill 333)**: The bill sought to regulate Kratom as a food product, but the Division of Public Health Services expressed concerns due to FDA warnings. While some argued for personal freedom, the committee leaned against recommending the bill.

#### **5. Innkeeper and Public Lodging Regulations**
   - **Innkeeper Compliance**: Concerns were raised about innkeepers not complying with regulations, particularly the requirement to “shall comply” without a warrant. A subcommittee was proposed to address the issue.
   - **Public Lodging House Inspections (House Bill 1378)**: The bill proposed requiring warrants for law enforcement to access hotel guest rosters. Law enforcement representatives testified against it, stating that current practices and case law are sufficient. The committee found the bill unnecessary.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to address modern challenges in commerce and consumer affairs, focusing on practical solutions, consumer protection, and enforcement. Key themes included balancing safety concerns with business needs, modernizing outdated regulations, and addressing emerging issues like counterfeit goods and PFAS contamination. The committee generally favored rule changes over new legislation and emphasized the importance of aligning regulations with current consumer and business practices. Future discussions will continue to explore these issues with a focus on practical, consumer-friendly solutions.
