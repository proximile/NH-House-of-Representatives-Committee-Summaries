#### **Bills Not Recommended for Future Legislation:**
The majority of bills discussed were not recommended due to concerns about complexity, enforceability, redundancy, or existing regulations. Key bills included:

1. **Senate Bill 68**: Proposed requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees. Concerns about wording and enforceability led to a 10-7 vote against recommending it.

2. **Senate Bill 121**: Related to state-based health exchanges. Unresolved issues and complexity resulted in a 17-0 vote against recommending it.

3. **Senate Bill 287**: Addressed balance billing for certain health care services. The bill was deemed duplicative of federal law, leading to a 17-0 vote against recommending it.

4. **Senate Bill 355**: Required online marketplaces to disclose certain information to consumers. Concerns about enforceability and high-dollar thresholds resulted in a 15-2 vote against recommending it.

5. **House Bill 65**: Addressed allergy awareness training for restaurant employees. Changes by the NH DHHS food safety department and concerns about staff shortages led to its rejection.

7. **House Bill 343**: Addressed reimbursing rural ambulance services. The bill was considered too complex, and a future study committee was suggested.

8. **House Bill 416**: Allowed hobby distillation of liquors. The committee deemed it moot since it’s primarily a federal matter.

17. **House Bill 1502**: Rolled into House Bill 1503, which addressed digital assets and securities.

18. **House Bill 1556**: Aimed to establish a statewide food truck license. The committee felt it was an example of local control.
