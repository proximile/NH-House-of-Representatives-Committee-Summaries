**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (10/06/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on October 6, 2022, to address several legislative bills, reflect on its work during the 2021-2022 session, and conclude its two-year legislative term. The meeting focused on energy efficiency, weatherization programs, and the review of retained bills, with discussions marked by professionalism, respect, and constructive dialogue. Key highlights include:

### **Energy Efficiency and Weatherization**
The committee acknowledged the effectiveness of weatherization and energy efficiency programs, particularly for low-income residents. However, concerns were raised about the allocation of funds, with suggestions that resources spent on initiatives like replacing refrigerators could be better directed toward weatherizing homes. Members also noted the significant federal funding expected from the **Inflation Reduction Act**, emphasizing the need for careful distribution and oversight in the coming years.

### **Retained Bills and Key Votes**
The committee reviewed eight retained bills, deciding whether to recommend them for future legislation. Notable discussions and outcomes included:

1. **House Bill 213**: Related to eliminating useful thermal energy from renewable energy classes, the bill faced opposition due to concerns about its impact on biomass and energy efficiency. The committee voted **14-4** to recommend it for future legislation.

2. **House Bill 1248**: Addressing replacement power for net metering customer generators, the bill was deemed flawed and unnecessary. The committee unanimously voted **18-0** not to recommend it.

3. **House Bill 1635**: Pertaining to the purchase of output from limited electrical energy producers, the bill was superseded by **Senate Bill 321**. The committee unanimously voted **18-0** not to recommend it.

4. **House Bill 1644**: This bill addressed the placement of telecommunication antennas and proposed a registry for residents experiencing symptoms from wireless radiation. It sparked debate, with the committee voting **15-3** to recommend it, emphasizing the need for education and local control over tower placements.

5. **Senate Bill 113**: Concerning alternative compliance payments for renewable energy obligations, the bill was not supported by its sponsor, Senator Bradley. The committee voted **16-1** not to recommend it.

6. **Senate Bill 259**: Related to municipal hosts and energy programs, the subcommittee recommended it, but the full committee voted **7-10** against it. A subsequent motion to not recommend it passed **11-6**.

7. **Senate Bill 264**: Transferring authority over the low-income electricity assistance program to the Department of Energy, the bill was deemed moot after the department withdrew its request. The committee voted **12-5** not to recommend it.

8. **Senate Bill 269**: Proposing a commission to study energy-saving weatherization programs, the bill faced skepticism. The subcommittee voted **5-1** against it, and the full committee voted **12-5** not to recommend it. Some members argued that the state already knows what needs to be done and should act rather than study further.

### **Opening and Acknowledgments**
The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and acknowledgments of retiring committee members, including **Representative Jackie Kelly Pitts**, **Representative John Mann**, **Representative Lee Oxenham**, and **Representative Peter Samsich**, for their years of service and contributions.
