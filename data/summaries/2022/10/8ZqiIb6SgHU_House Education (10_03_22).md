**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (October 3, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on October 3, 2022, focused extensively on education funding reforms, accountability, and addressing systemic disparities in the state’s public education system. The discussion centered on House Bill 1680, which proposes significant changes to the school funding model, as well as broader issues related to financial transparency, data-driven decision-making, and student achievement. Key points from the meeting include:

### **Education Funding and Financial Accountability**
1. **Challenges in Cost Disaggregation**: Members discussed the difficulty of separating costs related to "adequate education" from non-essential expenditures, such as extracurricular activities like swimming pools and football programs. The DOE 25 form, used to collect school financial data, was highlighted as a tool for this analysis, though concerns were raised about its limitations in distinguishing necessary educational costs from discretionary spending.

2. **Court Mandates and Legislative Response**: The legislature’s reluctance to fully address court mandates, particularly in light of the *Claremont* decision, was noted. This decision requires the state to ensure adequate funding for public education, but progress on reforms has been slow.

3. **Proposals for Transparency**: One representative suggested implementing a provision (Section 3, Page 12, Line 28) requiring schools to proactively report detailed financial and educational plans, rather than waiting for schools to fail over multiple years. This was seen as a way to improve transparency and accountability in education spending.

### **House Bill 1680: Key Proposals**
1. **Funding Transition and Protections**: The bill outlines a 10-year transition from 70% to 95% funding levels, with a 5-year "harmless" period to protect communities from sudden financial impacts. Transition grants will phase out over time, requiring municipalities to adapt gradually.

2. **Foundation Opportunity Grant**: The new funding model starts at 70% of the calculated Foundation Opportunity Grant, with adjustments for municipalities that benefit more from existing funding mechanisms like "excess swept" funds.

3. **Accountability and Performance**: The bill emphasizes accountability in how school funds are spent, requiring districts to report on performance outcomes and develop plans to address underperformance. It also introduces a process to identify and support underperforming schools and persistent disparities among student subgroups.

### **Data-Driven Decision-Making**
1. **Comprehensive Data Use**: Representatives highlighted the importance of using comprehensive data, including student progress and achievement metrics, to allocate funds more effectively. This marks a shift away from a "one-size-fits-all" approach, ensuring resources are targeted to districts with greater needs.

2. **Mathematics and Remediation Concerns**: Declining mathematics achievement, particularly in middle schools and post-pandemic, was a significant concern. The high number of students requiring remedial math in community colleges underscored the need for better foundational education.

### **Leadership, School Culture, and Vocational Education**
1. **Role of Leadership**: Strong leadership and positive school culture were identified as critical factors in improving student achievement. Examples were given of schools that saw significant improvements due to effective leadership, emphasizing that funding alone is not the solution.

2. **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**: CTE programs were praised for their high success rates, with 75% of students going on to college and achieving higher scores than traditional high school graduates.

### **Equity and Systemic Reform**
1. **Addressing Inequities**: The bill aims to address educational inequities by targeting resources to districts with greater needs, ensuring all students have equal opportunities. This includes addressing socioeconomic factors that impact student performance.

2. **Long-Term Vision**: Representatives acknowledged that HB 1680 represents a systemic reform, not just a minor adjustment. It requires careful consideration to ensure it effectively addresses the state’s educational challenges and prepares students for the future.

### **Upcoming Committee Work**
The subcommittee planned to finalize recommendations for HB 1680 by October 12, with the full committee scheduled to review and act on these recommendations by October 24.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the need for a more equitable, data-driven, and accountable approach to school funding. Key priorities included addressing disparities in student achievement, ensuring financial transparency, and leveraging strong leadership and school culture to drive improvements. The discussions reflected a recognition of the complexity of systemic reform and the importance of a long-term vision to meet the educational needs of all New Hampshire students.
