**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting on October 24, 2022**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on October 24, 2022, to address a wide range of education-related issues, including school funding, legislative bills, cooperative school districts, and student welfare. The meeting was divided into multiple segments, each focusing on specific topics. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. School Building Aid and Funding**
- **School Building Aid Backlog**: The committee highlighted a significant backlog of school building aid applications, totaling approximately $760 million. With the state currently funding less than $50 million annually, there is a pressing need to address this issue, especially given the state’s obligation to fund around 40% of these applications. Upcoming biennium funding projections were discussed as a potential avenue for resolution.
- **HB 1680 (School Funding)**: A bill aimed at addressing school funding disparities and providing property tax relief was not recommended by a vote of **10-9**. Opponents argued it failed to adequately support underfunded districts, while supporters stressed the importance of closing student opportunity gaps.
- **HB 1676 (Incentive Grants)**: The committee voted **10-9** to recommend future legislation on incentive grants for school districts that improve assessment scores. Critics contended it would reward already successful districts rather than addressing struggling schools.

### **2. Legislative Bills**
- **HB 1499 (Charter School Building Aid)**: Concerns were raised about making charter schools eligible for state school building aid, particularly regarding financial sustainability and resource allocation. The committee did not take a final vote on this bill.
- **HB 234 (Freedom of Speech on College Campuses)**: The committee unanimously voted **18-0** not to recommend this bill, citing improvements in campus policies and the lack of necessity for new statutes.
- **HB 1630 (Philosophy Course Requirement)**: A bill proposing a philosophy course requirement for high school students was overwhelmingly rejected by a vote of **17-1**, with the committee stating curriculum decisions fall outside their purview.
- **HB 1664 (Background Checks for Non-Public Schools)**: The committee voted **10-9** not to recommend requiring background checks for employees and volunteers at non-public schools receiving public funds, with opponents arguing existing practices were sufficient.

### **3. Cooperative School Districts**
- **HB 1399 (Withdrawal from Cooperative Districts)**: The committee debated the financial and logistical implications of school districts withdrawing from cooperative districts. Concerns about asset and liability division led to a **10-9** vote to recommend future legislation on this issue.
- **HB 1679 (Dissolution of Cooperative Districts)**: A bill requiring the dissolution of all cooperative school districts by July 2025 was unanimously rejected **18-0**, with members emphasizing the need for more thoughtful approaches to cooperative district issues.
- **Commission on Cooperative School Districts**: The committee supported establishing a commission to comprehensively study cooperative school districts, addressing issues like withdrawal, funding, and governance. However, there was disagreement over whether specific bills (e.g., HB 1399) should advance before the commission’s work was complete.

### **4. Student Welfare and Hunger**
- **HB 1229 (School Meals)**: The committee voted **5-0** not to recommend further legislation on this bill, which aimed to study school meals and student hunger. While acknowledging the importance of addressing hunger, the committee concluded no additional study was needed. Future legislation was suggested to focus on increasing participation in meal programs and accessing federal funding.
- **Cost of Universal School Meals**: Data from the Department of Education showed that providing universal breakfast and lunch to all school-aged children would cost $111.25 million annually, while limiting it to eligible students (free/reduced lunch) would cost $654,822.

### **5. Other Bills and Closing Remarks**
- **HB 1137, 1141, 1313, 1373**: These bills were not recommended for future legislation, with issues either resolved or deemed unnecessary.
- **HB 1295 (Classroom Recording and Observation Policies)**: This bill was recommended for future legislation, focusing on policies related to classroom recording and observation.
- **Closing Remarks**: The chair thanked committee members for their hard work, particularly in addressing 139 bills during the session. While progress was made on many issues, unresolved areas like cooperative school bills and school funding measures remain. The chair expressed hope for future progress and thanked specific members, including Representative Heath, for their contributions.
