**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (10/17/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on October 17, 2022, to discuss the evaluation of emerging medical technologies, particularly precision medicine, and the potential establishment of a task force to address these issues. The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing scientific rigor with legislative oversight and Medicaid considerations. Key points from the discussion include:

### **Purpose and Scope of the Task Force**
The committee debated the creation of a task force to assess the efficacy, safety, and cost of emerging medical technologies, with a focus on precision medicine. The proposed task force would evaluate whether specific technologies have scientific merit, rather than addressing funding or policy implementation. The discussion emphasized the need for scientific expertise, as legislators acknowledged their limitations in assessing complex medical advancements.

### **Composition and Expertise**
There was broad agreement that the task force should include non-legislative experts, such as academics, medical professionals, and community practitioners. The chair would have significant discretion in selecting members. Some members suggested that the task force should function as an advisory body, providing recommendations to the legislature rather than making binding decisions, given the political nature of legislative bodies.

### **Collaboration with Existing Entities**
The committee considered leveraging existing resources, such as the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), to evaluate emerging technologies. Peg Clifford, the Pharmacy Director for New Hampshire Medicaid, provided insights into how Medicaid currently assesses precision medicine and other technologies on a case-by-case basis, considering medical necessity and federal requirements. Biomarkers and diagnostic procedures are also factored into coverage decisions for high-cost drugs.

### **Challenges and Implementation**
Several challenges were identified, including the emotional and intellectual toll of evaluating life-and-death medical decisions, the potential overwhelm of the task force due to the volume of emerging technologies, and the difficulty of recruiting qualified members. The committee also debated whether the task force should operate under HHS oversight or independently.

### **Federal vs. State Oversight**
The role of federal agencies like the FDA and CDC in evaluating medical technologies was discussed, with some members expressing skepticism about the federal review process due to potential political and economic influences. The committee considered whether New Hampshire should independently review federal decisions or collaborate with neighboring states and national organizations to reduce duplication of efforts.

### **Academic Involvement**
Representative Woods proposed involving academic institutions, such as the University of New Hampshire (UNH), to leverage their expertise in emerging technologies. This suggestion aimed to enhance the task force’s scientific credibility and effectiveness.

### **Next Steps**
The chair committed to redrafting the proposal based on the committee’s feedback, with a focus on clearly defining the task force’s role, scope, and structure. The revised draft would be shared with the committee for review ahead of the next meeting on October 31, 2022.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of rigorously evaluating emerging medical technologies to balance innovation with cost and efficacy, particularly within the context of Medicaid coverage. The discussions highlighted the need for a well-defined, scientifically grounded task force to navigate the complexities of precision medicine and other advancements, while addressing the challenges of implementation and collaboration.
