**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (10/06/2023)**

The New Hampshire House Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on October 6th to discuss two interconnected topics: **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** and **toxics in packaging**, with a particular focus on **PFAS** (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing waste reduction and recycling challenges in the state while exploring strategies to mitigate harmful chemicals in packaging. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Waste Reduction
1. **Background and Goals**:  
   - The committee revisited previous recommendations, including a unanimous vote in February for an interim study on waste reduction.  
   - New Hampshireâ€™s waste reduction goals, such as a 40% diversion target set in 1999, were discussed, but the state has fallen short. Updated goals aim to reduce municipal solid waste and construction debris by 25% by 2030 and 45% by 2050.  

2. **EPR Framework**:  
   - EPR shifts waste management responsibility from municipalities to producers, incentivizing sustainable product design and packaging.  
   - Examples from Maine, Oregon, and California highlighted the complexity and long implementation timelines (up to a decade).  
   - Municipalities like Hopkinton expressed challenges with rising waste volumes and disposal costs, advocating for EPR to alleviate these burdens.  

3. **Study Commission Proposal**:  
   - The committee debated whether to establish a dedicated EPR study commission or integrate the issue into existing structures like the Solid Waste Working Group.  
   - Proponents argued a commission would provide a focused forum for stakeholder input, while others raised concerns about duplication of efforts, resource strain, and the time required to establish such a body.  
   - The Department of Environmental Services (DES) recently published a 10-year Solid Waste Management Plan, identifying EPR as a key strategy. The Solid Waste Working Group is already addressing related issues but has yet to prioritize EPR.  

### Toxics in Packaging and PFAS
1. **Model Legislation and Interstate Collaboration**:  
   - Discussions centered on adopting model legislation, potentially inspired by the **Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse (IC2)**, a national organization with participation from several states.  
   - The IC2 could serve as a centralized system for manufacturers to report compliance with EPR and toxics laws, reducing the burden of varying state requirements.  
   - New Hampshire officials emphasized learning from other states, particularly Maine, which has implemented similar laws.  

2. **Stakeholder Engagement**:  
   - The committee recognized the importance of engaging stakeholders, including producers, municipalities, recycling organizations, and environmental groups, to ensure effective and widely supported legislation.  

### Next Steps and Collaboration
1. **Future Actions**:  
   - The committee acknowledged the need for further research and discussion before making formal recommendations. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for October 25th to continue the conversation and potentially draft recommendations.  
   - Options under consideration include establishing a study commission, legislative action, or integrating EPR into existing frameworks.  

2. **Regional and Interstate Collaboration**:  
   - The committee discussed leveraging lessons from other states and regional organizations like the **Northeast Waste Management Officials Association (NEWMOA)** and the **Northeast Recycling Council (NERC)**, which are working on EPR initiatives and model legislation for PFAS.  

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing waste reduction and toxics in packaging through EPR and PFAS regulation. While there is a clear urgency to act, the committee emphasized the need for careful consideration of the most effective and efficient approach, balancing stakeholder involvement, resource constraints, and interstate collaboration. Further action will be informed by ongoing research, stakeholder input, and lessons from other states.
