The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee met on October 11, 2022, to discuss three key bills—**HB 1137**, **HB 1664**, and a bill related to background checks for individuals working with students in educational settings. The discussions centered on balancing child safety, educational autonomy, and regulatory clarity. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Background Checks in Educational Settings**
1. **Scope of the Bill**: The bill proposed requiring background checks for individuals spending time alone with students in educational settings, including public schools, micro-schools, learning pods, and homeschooling scenarios. The focus was on ensuring child safety, particularly in unsupervised settings.
2. **Micro-Schools and Learning Pods**: The committee distinguished between district-led and community-led learning pods. Prenda, a micro-school provider under contract with the State Department of Education, was noted for already conducting background checks on its guides.
3. **Homeschooling Concerns**: Some members raised concerns that homeschooling could be used to conceal child abuse, while others argued such cases are rare and that the bill overreached by imposing unnecessary regulations on homeschooling families.
4. **Accountability and Enforcement**: Questions arose about how to enforce background checks in micro-schools and homeschooling, especially when families move without notifying authorities.
5. **Criticism and Outcome**: The bill was criticized for being overly broad and potentially harmful to alternative education models. The committee voted 4-2 against recommending the bill, with some members suggesting it be revisited in future legislation or through an interim study process.

### **HB 1137: School Board Duties and Transparency**
1. **Transparency Requirements**: The bill proposed requiring school districts to post invoices, professional development topics, and per-pupil costs on their websites. Members debated whether these requirements were overly prescriptive, as many districts already have processes in place.
2. **Per-Pupil Cost Calculation**: Concerns were raised about including high-cost special education students in per-pupil cost calculations, which could skew the average and misrepresent actual costs.
3. **Parental Surveys**: The bill’s requirement for end-of-year parental surveys was contentious, with some supporting it as a tool for feedback and others questioning its necessity and enforceability.
4. **School Board Responsibilities**: Members debated the role of school boards in approving curriculum, textbooks, and educational materials, particularly in areas where boards may lack expertise. Some argued this oversight should be left to educational professionals.
5. **Ethical Standards and Public Input**: The bill included vague language about ethical standards for school board members and required public voting on contracts and multiple opportunities for public input. Members questioned the practicality and potential overreach of these provisions.
6. **Outcome**: The committee agreed **not to move forward with HB 1137 as written** but supported exploring better-defined school board duties in future legislation or through a study committee.

### **HB 1664: Background Checks for Non-Public Schools and Education Providers**
1. **Child Safety Focus**: The bill aimed to require background checks for employees and volunteers in non-public schools or education service providers accepting public funds. Supporters emphasized protecting children from potential abuse.
2. **Scope Concerns**: Some members argued the bill was too broad, particularly for homeschool cooperatives and micro-schools, where parents oversee education. Concerns were raised about government overreach and enforcement challenges.
3. **Existing Practices**: It was noted that many private schools and organizations already conduct background checks due to insurance and accreditation requirements.
4. **Narrowing the Focus**: Members suggested narrowing the bill to target scenarios where adults work unsupervised with children, such as in micro-schools or tutoring programs, rather than imposing blanket requirements.
5. **Outcome**: While the subcommittee acknowledged the importance of child safety, there was no consensus to move forward with HB 1664 in its current form. Some recommended refining the bill to address specific concerns.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
- **Balancing Regulation and Autonomy**: The committee grappled with finding the right balance between ensuring child safety and avoiding overregulation, particularly in non-public and homeschool settings.
- **Practicality and Clarity**: There was a strong emphasis on crafting legislation that is enforceable, clear, and aligned with existing statutes and practices.
- **Future Directions**: Both HB 1137 and HB 1664 were seen as needing significant revisions or further study. The committee leaned toward recommending study committees to explore school board duties and background check requirements in greater detail.

The meeting concluded without final decisions on the bills but with a commitment to continue reviewing their provisions and exploring alternative approaches in future legislative sessions.
