The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting met on October 25, 2022, to discuss two bills retained for interim study: **HB 51** (apportioning state senate districts) and **HB 53** (apportioning executive council districts). The chair acknowledged forgetting about the meeting until reminded by the clerk, prompting its scheduling at 3 PM.

**HB 51** was addressed first, with Representative Steve Smith moving that the bill not be recommended for future legislation. The committee’s report stated that the bill proposed redistricting state senate districts, but since districts had already been adopted and implemented for the 2022 election, the bill was deemed unnecessary. The motion passed with 12 in favor and 3 silent "no" votes.

Next, **HB 53** was considered, with Representative Smith again moving that it not be recommended for future legislation. The committee’s report similarly concluded that the bill, which proposed redistricting executive council districts, was unnecessary as districts had already been adopted and implemented for the 2022 election. This motion passed unanimously (12-0).

The meeting concluded in under 10 minutes, with the chair noting the redistricting committee had finished its work with unanimous votes. The meeting was then adjourned.
