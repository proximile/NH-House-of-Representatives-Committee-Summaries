The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Redistricting met on October 25, 2022, to discuss two bills retained for interim study: **HB 51** (apportioning state senate districts) and **HB 53** (apportioning executive council districts). The chair acknowledged that the meeting was initially forgotten but was scheduled after a reminder. 

For **HB 51**, Representative Steve Smith moved that the bill not be recommended for future legislation, citing that state senate districts had already been adopted and implemented for the 2022 election, making the bill unnecessary. The committee voted 12-0 (with three silent "no" votes) to report the bill as not recommended for further legislation.

For **HB 53**, Representative Smith made a similar motion, arguing that executive council districts had also been adopted and implemented for the 2022 election, rendering the bill unnecessary. The committee unanimously voted 12-0 to report the bill as not recommended for future legislation.

The meeting concluded in under 10 minutes, with the chair noting that the redistricting committee had finished its work with unanimous decisions. The meeting was then adjourned.
