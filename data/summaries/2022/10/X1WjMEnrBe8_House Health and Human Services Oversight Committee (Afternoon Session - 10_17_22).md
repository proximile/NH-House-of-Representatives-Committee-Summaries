**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (Afternoon Session - 10/17/22)**

The New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on October 17, 2022, to address critical issues surrounding transparency, accountability, and oversight in healthcare, particularly concerning the reporting of disciplinary actions against physicians and other healthcare providers. The session highlighted the complexity of balancing public safety, fairness, and transparency, with discussions focusing on the role of hospitals, the Board of Medicine, and other stakeholders in ensuring effective oversight.

### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Reporting Mechanisms and Accountability**  
   The committee examined how hospitals report disciplinary actions or adverse events to the Board of Medicine. Concerns were raised about potential gaps in reporting, especially in cases where high-earning or influential individuals might be shielded from accountability. Representatives emphasized the need for robust reporting mechanisms to ensure that all healthcare providers, regardless of their status, are held to the same standards.

2. **Credentialing vs. Privileging**  
   The distinction between credentialing (verifying qualifications) and privileging (determining what a provider is allowed to do in a hospital) was discussed. Privileging committees were highlighted as critical in identifying underperforming providers, and the committee explored ways to strengthen these processes to prevent lapses in oversight.

3. **Role of Hospital Trustees and Medical Staff**  
   Hospital trustees, who have fiduciary responsibilities to the community, were identified as key players in ensuring accountability. The committee discussed the potential for trustees and medical staff presidents to play a more active role in overseeing reporting processes and ensuring that disciplinary actions are appropriately documented and communicated.

4. **Transparency and Public Reporting**  
   A significant portion of the discussion centered on the level of transparency in reporting malpractice suits and disciplinary actions. While some members cautioned against making all lawsuits public—especially those dismissed or unproven—others advocated for transparency in cases where patient harm has been substantiated. The committee acknowledged the need to protect providers’ reputations while ensuring public trust in the healthcare system.

5. **Investigation Processes and Funding**  
   The committee recognized the Board of Medicine’s resource constraints and discussed the need for additional funding and manpower to improve its investigative and disciplinary processes. Clearer procedures for handling complaints, particularly those from patients versus other physicians or hospitals, were identified as essential for consistent and fair oversight.

6. **Challenges with Solo Practitioners**  
   The committee acknowledged the unique challenges of overseeing solo practitioners who are not part of larger healthcare organizations. Mechanisms to ensure these providers are held accountable were discussed, including potential reporting requirements and oversight processes tailored to their practice settings.

7. **Comparison to Other States and Best Practices**  
   Representatives suggested looking to other states, particularly Maine, for exemplary systems of oversight and transparency. These models were seen as potential blueprints for improving New Hampshire’s processes.

8. **Testimony and Recommendations**  
   Attorney Holly Haynes provided testimony advocating for increased transparency in reporting medical malpractice payments, reciprocal discipline, and formal complaints. She proposed creating a formal disciplinary system similar to the attorney discipline office, funded through physician licensing fees. Representative Solway presented a draft recommendation calling for healthcare organizations with internal review committees to report disciplinary actions to the Board of Medicine and for additional funding to enhance the board’s capabilities.

9. **Next Steps**  
   The committee decided to form a subcommittee to draft detailed recommendations for improving reporting and transparency. They also planned to consult with the New Hampshire Hospital Association and other stakeholders to refine their proposals. The session concluded with a commitment to ensuring that all physicians, regardless of their practice setting, are subject to appropriate oversight and that the Board of Medicine has the resources and processes needed to protect public safety.

### Overall Themes:  
The meeting underscored the importance of balancing accountability, transparency, and fairness in healthcare oversight. The committee’s discussions reflected a shared commitment to improving the Board of Medicine’s processes, addressing resource limitations, and ensuring that all healthcare providers are held to high standards of practice. By drawing on best practices from other states and engaging stakeholders, the committee aims to develop actionable recommendations that enhance public trust in the healthcare system while safeguarding the rights of providers.
