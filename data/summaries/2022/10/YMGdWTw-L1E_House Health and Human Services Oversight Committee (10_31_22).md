**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (10/31/22)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on October 31, 2022, to address critical issues related to medical oversight, patient safety, transparency, and emerging medical technologies. The meeting was divided into four segments, each focusing on specific aspects of these broad themes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

### **Transparency and Processes in Medical Oversight**

The committee began by discussing the need to improve transparency and efficiency within the Board of Medicine, particularly in handling complaints, disciplinary actions, and malpractice cases. Concerns were raised about redundant reporting processes and the need to streamline internal review committees. Representative Solway moved to revise the oversight committee’s report on the Department of Health and Human Services, emphasizing transparency and the Board of Medicine’s role. The motion was seconded and passed.

The committee highlighted the importance of increased funding and staffing for the Board of Medicine to ensure thorough investigations and expedited case processing. Professional investigators, including both physicians and attorneys, were deemed essential. Public testimony from Jim Potter, CEO of the New Hampshire Medical Society, underscored the need for better education about the disciplinary process for physicians and the traumatic impact of complaints on their careers.

### **Patient Safety and Medical Harm**

A significant portion of the meeting focused on patient safety and the prevention of medical harm. A nurse and patient advocate emphasized that preventable medical harm is a leading cause of death in the U.S., with 15,000 incidents per month among Medicare patients alone. She called for legislative action to address loopholes in reporting, such as hospitals disciplining physicians for less than 30 days to avoid mandatory reporting to the National Practitioner Data Bank. The importance of patients having access to critical information, like lawsuit settlements, was stressed to enable informed decisions about care. The committee was urged to focus on specific legislative changes rather than broad generalizations, with a call for detailed recommendations on which laws or procedures need modification.

### **Reporting and Disciplinary Processes**

The committee delved into the reporting and disciplinary processes related to medical malpractice and physician oversight. The Board of Medicine investigates malpractice cases and determines the need for discipline, which is then posted on its website. However, the board does not report malpractice payouts or claims unless they result in disciplinary action, contrasting with states like Massachusetts, which report both disciplinary actions and general malpractice claims and payouts.

Discipline can occur at both institutional (hospital) and board levels, but only board-imposed disciplinary actions are publicly reported, leaving some hospital-imposed actions undisclosed. The committee debated whether to mandate reporting of all hospital disciplinary actions, even if the board does not act. Additionally, the need for the Board of Medicine’s website to be more user-friendly and transparent was discussed, ensuring that complaints are acknowledged and disciplinary actions are easily accessible.

### **Emerging Medical Technologies and Legislative Action**

The final segment of the meeting addressed emerging medical technologies and the challenges they pose for traditional medical oversight. Representative Woods discussed the difficulties of applying traditional medical standards, such as double-blind studies, to precision medicine and biomarkers. He emphasized the need for legislative awareness and education on emerging technologies, including nanomedicine and nanotechnology.

Lindsay Courtney, the executive director of the NH Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), explained the process for handling complaints against medical professionals, including the initial screening by OPLC staff and potential escalation to the relevant board for further investigation and disciplinary action. The committee discussed the importance of providing feedback to complainants about the status and outcome of their complaints, considering whether legislative changes might be needed to improve transparency.

### **Proposed Recommendations and Next Steps**

The committee reviewed a draft report recommending the formation of a task force on emerging medical technologies to meet at least once a year, with a suggestion to increase the frequency to twice a year. The draft also included language on the need for the committee to scan emerging technologies for potential oversight. Dr. David Conway, a retired OB/GYN and current investigator for the Board of Medicine, emphasized the importance of protecting the privacy of medical professionals while ensuring public safety, arguing against publicly listing settled malpractice lawsuits, as they do not necessarily indicate poor medical practice.

The chair indicated that this would be the final meeting of the group, with some members potentially working together to craft a Legislative Service Request (LSR) based on the discussions. The meeting concluded with a focus on ensuring that future changes to the process are implemented prospectively and with adequate funding and resources to support the Board of Medicine’s mission.

### **Conclusion**

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of transparency, patient safety, and effective oversight in the healthcare system. The committee recognized the need for increased funding, streamlined processes, and legislative action to address gaps in reporting and disciplinary actions. Additionally, the challenges posed by emerging medical technologies were acknowledged, with a call for ongoing education and awareness to ensure that oversight mechanisms remain effective in a rapidly evolving medical landscape.
