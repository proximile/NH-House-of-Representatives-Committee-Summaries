The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 20th focused on detailed discussions and decisions regarding various administrative rules, with an emphasis on clarity, compliance with statutory requirements, and proper oversight. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key points covered during the meeting:

### Lottery Sales and Licensing Rules
The committee addressed the regulation of lottery sales, emphasizing that sales are only permitted through the lottery during a specific statutory period. Editorial changes were suggested to clarify this rule, ensuring that the language is precise and easily understandable.

### Electrologists and Electrology Schools
The committee reviewed rules related to the licensing requirements for electrologists and electrology schools. These rules had expired in 2017, and the agency had not provided a report on funding mechanisms during this period. The committee considered various options, including approving the rules with changes or postponing the decision to allow for further review and potential legislative action.

### Checklists and Forms
There was a discussion about the use of checklists versus forms for licensing applications. While the agency preferred checklists, the committee raised concerns about the clarity and notice provided to applicants regarding certification requirements. The committee emphasized the importance of ensuring that applicants are fully informed about the requirements they need to meet.

### Legislative Changes
The committee highlighted the need for legislative changes to address certain issues, such as the authority to require forms to be signed under the pains and penalties of perjury and the incorporation of the equalization manual into the rules. These changes would help resolve ambiguities and ensure that the rules are in line with statutory requirements.

### Conditional Approvals
Several rules were conditionally approved with specific changes requested by the committee. The agency was also asked to seek legislative changes to address some of the issues raised during the meeting. This approach ensures that the rules are implemented effectively while allowing for further refinement through legislative action.

### Final Proposals and Amendments
The committee voted on final proposals with minor amendments, such as changing the weighted mean ratio calculation method in one of the rules. These amendments were made to improve the accuracy and fairness of the rules.

### Utility Pole Attachment Rules
The committee discussed implementing the FCC's "One Touch Make Ready" program, which aims to streamline the process for attaching new equipment to utility poles. Concerns were raised about ambiguous terms in the proposal, such as "just reasonable" and "non-discriminatory," which are not clearly defined. The Department of Energy and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) have overlapping rulemaking authority, leading to jurisdictional confusion. The committee considered a motion to conditionally approve the rules with suggested language changes.

### Feeding Garbage to Swine Rules
The Department of Agriculture proposed rules for feeding garbage to swine, which included provisions for special permits granted by the commissioner. Concerns were raised about the lack of clear criteria for issuing special permits, which could lead to arbitrary decision-making. The committee discussed the need for just-in-time disease control flexibility and potential legislative changes to clarify the rules. A motion to conditionally approve the rules was passed.

### Liquor Commission Employee Incentive Program
The Liquor Commission proposed rules for an employee incentive program, which would provide monetary incentives for sales. The committee noted that this was the first time rules were being proposed for this program, and there were no prior implementations. A motion to approve the rules was passed.

### Keno at Lottery Retailers
The Lottery Commission proposed rules for Keno operations at retail locations. Issues included conflicting statutes regarding criminal history requirements for licensees and the authority to request financial information from applicants. The committee discussed the need for legislative changes to address these conflicts. The Lottery Commission requested that the retailer agreement remain outside of the rules to allow for quicker adjustments to business conditions. A motion to conditionally approve the rules was discussed, with ongoing plans to address statutory conflicts through legislation.

### Overall Focus
Throughout the meeting, the committee emphasized the importance of addressing ambiguities, jurisdictional overlaps, and statutory conflicts in various administrative rules. Several motions for conditional approvals were passed, and the committee highlighted the need for clear definitions and legislative changes to resolve outstanding issues. The goal was to ensure that the rules are effective, fair, and in compliance with statutory requirements.
