The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee meeting on October 13, 2022, focused on two primary bills: **SB 209** and **SB 377 FN**.

### **SB 209: Payroll Cards and Payment Methods**
The committee discussed whether to mandate payroll cards as a default payment method when employers and employees disagree on payment preferences. Key points included:
- **Current Law**: Employers must offer direct deposit if requested; otherwise, paper checks are the default.
- **Proposed Change**: The bill would make payroll cards the default fallback option instead of checks.
- **Concerns**: Representatives expressed concerns about fees associated with payroll cards, especially for low-income workers who may not have bank accounts. They also questioned the reliability and security of payroll cards, particularly for those living paycheck to paycheck.
- **Conclusion**: The committee unanimously voted **12-0** to recommend no further legislative action on SB 209, citing the potential harm to workers and the lack of a pressing need for change.

### **SB 377 FN: Workers' Compensation for State Troopers**
The committee reviewed a bill addressing workers' compensation for state troopers traveling to off-site job locations, particularly in cases involving post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Key points included:
- **Current Issue**: Troopers in uniform, driving state vehicles, are not covered by workers' compensation when traveling to off-site locations unless they are officially on duty.
- **Proposed Change**: The bill sought to expand coverage to include troopers traveling to and from work sites, even if technically off duty.
- **Concerns**: Representatives questioned the narrow scope of the bill, which excluded other law enforcement officers (e.g., sheriffs, fish and game officers). They also raised issues about the bill's specificity and the lack of clarity on how it relates to PTSD.
- **Conclusion**: The committee unanimously voted to recommend **future legislation** after addressing unanswered questions and broadening the scope to include other law enforcement personnel.

### **Other Notes**:
- **Supreme Court Case**: A recent New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling on workers' compensation for travel to work sites was discussed as relevant to future legislation.
- **Committee Appreciation**: Representatives expressed gratitude for the fair and effective leadership of Chairman Infantine and the collaborative nature of the committee.

The meeting concluded with a reminder of an upcoming study committee meeting on OSHA-related issues.
