The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee held a work session on October 4, 2022, to discuss two bills: **HB 426** and **SB 257**. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

### **HB 426: Shoreland Septic Systems**
- **Purpose**: Addresses pollution from underperforming septic systems in the Shoreland Zone, particularly older systems (pre-1967) that were not state-permitted and may be failing.
- **Discussion**:
  - Representative Spang explained the bill originated from a two-year study commission involving municipalities, septic designers, environmentalists, and realtors.
  - The bill proposes evaluating septic systems during property transfers, especially near water bodies, to identify and address failures without infringing on property rights.
  - Concerns were raised about costs and mandates, with some members advocating for local control and buyer responsibility rather than state-mandated inspections.
  - A motion to recommend the bill for future legislation failed (3-2), with the committee ultimately deciding **not to recommend** it for future legislation.

### **SB 257: Municipal Sewage Disposal Systems as Part of Stormwater Utilities**
- **Purpose**: Enables municipalities to incorporate sewage disposal systems into their stormwater utilities, allowing collective solutions for septic system failures.
- **Discussion**:
  - Representative Spang highlighted the bill as a tool for municipalities to address multiple septic system failures collectively, especially in areas like the Great Bay Estuary, where nitrogen pollution is a concern.
  - Some members emphasized local control, suggesting towns should decide whether to adopt such systems rather than being mandated by the state.
  - The bill was supported by DES and Dover City Council but opposed by realtors.
  - A motion to recommend the **concept** of the bill for future legislation passed (4-1), with the committee agreeing to explore the idea further while refining it.

### **Key Themes**:
- **Local Control**: Many members stressed the importance of allowing municipalities to decide how to address septic system issues rather than imposing state mandates.
- **Cost Concerns**: The financial burden of septic system evaluations and upgrades was a recurring topic, with discussions on who should bear the costs (buyers, sellers, or municipalities).
- **Environmental Impact**: The need to address pollution from failing septic systems, particularly in sensitive areas like Shoreland Zones and the Great Bay Estuary, was a central focus.

The session concluded with no further discussion, and the committee adjourned.
