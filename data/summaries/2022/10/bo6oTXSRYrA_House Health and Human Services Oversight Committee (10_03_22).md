### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (October 3, 2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on October 3, 2022, to address critical issues related to healthcare oversight, transparency, and innovation. The meeting was divided into four segments, each focusing on distinct but interconnected topics: medical malpractice and disciplinary actions, precision medicine, physician oversight, and medical licensing processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting.

---

#### **1. Medical Malpractice and Transparency**
The committee extensively discussed the transparency and reporting of medical malpractice and disciplinary actions by the New Hampshire Board of Medicine, particularly in comparison to states like Massachusetts. Key points included:
- **Reporting Discrepancies**: Concerns were raised about the lack of reported malpractice incidents in New Hampshire compared to Massachusetts, where 20 incidents were reported for a single physician. This raised questions about the adequacy of New Hampshire’s reporting practices in protecting the public.
- **Investigative Process**: Dr. David Conway, a former Board of Medicine member, explained that complaints against physicians can come from various sources, including the public, other licensees, lawsuits, or law enforcement. Investigations may result in no action, a letter of concern, or disciplinary action, with only the latter being made public.
- **National Practitioner Data Bank**: The Board queries this database to track malpractice payouts, but only cases resulting in disciplinary action are reported. The committee debated whether more information, such as ongoing investigations, should be made public to enhance transparency.
- **Legislative Considerations**: Potential changes to improve transparency were discussed, including making more information about investigations public and upgrading outdated technology used by the Board of Medicine with federal ARPA funding.
- **Balancing Transparency and Fairness**: The committee acknowledged the tension between ensuring public safety and protecting physicians’ reputations, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach.

#### **2. Precision Medicine and Biomarker Testing**
The committee also focused on the work of the Precision Medicine Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Jeffrey Salloway. Key discussions included:
- **Legislative Goals**: The subcommittee aims to draft legislation by November to improve awareness, understanding, and access to precision medicine and biomarker testing, particularly for Medicaid patients.
- **Expert Testimony**: The committee stressed the need for input from healthcare providers, pharmacists, and hospital representatives, with potential accommodations for remote testimony.
- **Challenges in Clinical Trials**: Precision medicine’s personalized nature complicates traditional clinical trial standards, raising questions about how to effectively evaluate these treatments.
- **Economic Implications**: The high cost of precision medicine and its impact on insurance premiums and healthcare systems were significant concerns. The committee explored ways to make these treatments more accessible and affordable, including industry funding and global cost-benefit analyses.
- **Historical Context and Future Directions**: Representative Woods provided a historical perspective on medical advancements, drawing parallels to precision medicine. The committee discussed the potential for a permanent subcommittee or task force to continue this work and the need for cross-sector collaboration.

#### **3. Physician Oversight and Reporting Mechanisms**
The committee addressed systemic issues in physician oversight, particularly gaps in reporting and disciplinary actions. Key points included:
- **Case Examples**: Hypothetical scenarios and real-life cases like “Dr. Death” in Texas highlighted the dangers of practitioners not being reported to the Board of Medicine.
- **Reporting Gaps**: The Board relies on complaints from licensees, insurers, and the National Practitioner Data Bank but often lacks reports from hospital credentialing committees, which may prioritize protecting peers.
- **Settlements and NDAs**: While NDAs in settlements do not limit the Board’s ability to act, concerns were raised about whether settlements are adequately reported.
- **Statutory Changes**: Attorney Holly Haynes suggested making the Board’s disciplinary actions mandatory rather than permissive and updating its website with malpractice payment data.
- **Public Testimony**: Sean McGorry shared a personal story about his sister’s death after surgery by a physician with a prior suspension, criticizing the lack of transparency in disciplinary reporting.

#### **4. Medical Licensing and Disciplinary Processes**
The final segment focused on the complexities of New Hampshire’s medical licensing and disciplinary processes. Key discussions included:
- **Comparison with Other States**: The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) was highlighted as a resource, but variations in state laws and funding make direct comparisons challenging.
- **Investigation Language**: The committee debated changing statutory language from “may investigate” to “shall investigate” to ensure all complaints are reviewed, though resource constraints were acknowledged.
- **Improving Reporting**: Suggestions included legislative changes to mandate reporting from hospital credentialing committees to the Board of Medicine.
- **Resource Needs**: The Board expressed the need for additional resources, particularly for obtaining expert evaluations in cases where in-state experts may have conflicts of interest.
- **Volunteer Liability and Time Commitment**: The legal liability of volunteer board members and the significant time commitment required (10-20 hours per month) were discussed, with state laws providing protections for those acting in good faith.

#### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several overarching themes:
- **Transparency vs. Fairness**: Balancing public safety and transparency with fairness to healthcare providers remains a central challenge.
- **Legislative Action**: The committee is considering multiple legislative changes to improve reporting, oversight, and access to innovative treatments like precision medicine.
- **Resource Constraints**: Adequate funding and resources are critical to enhancing the Board of Medicine’s effectiveness and ensuring thorough investigations.
- **Collaboration**: Cross-sector collaboration among healthcare providers, insurers, and policymakers is essential to address the economic and logistical challenges of modern healthcare.

The committee committed to continuing these discussions in future sessions, with a focus on improving transparency, oversight, and patient safety in New Hampshire’s healthcare system.
