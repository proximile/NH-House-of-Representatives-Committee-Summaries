The NH House of Representatives Legislative Administration meeting on October 19, 2022, focused on reviewing two low-priority bills. The first, **House Bill 1368**, addressed recusal procedures for members of the General Court in cases of conflicts of interest. Representative Wallace moved to recommend the bill for future legislation, emphasizing the need for clearer guidelines. The motion was seconded by Representative Sheehan, and after brief discussion, the committee unanimously voted **9-0 in favor** of recommending the bill.

The second item, **HCR9**, aimed to express appreciation for Nicole Knox Murphy's song "My 603." Representative Waller moved not to recommend the bill for future legislation, citing it as a housekeeping issue. The sponsor had already arranged for a certificate of recognition from the Speaker, making further legislative action unnecessary. The committee unanimously voted **10-0 not to recommend** the bill.

The meeting concluded with thanks to attendees and acknowledgment of members not returning the following year.
