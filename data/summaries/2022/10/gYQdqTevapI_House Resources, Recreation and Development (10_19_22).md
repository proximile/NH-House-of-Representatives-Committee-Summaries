Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **Cultural and Historical Preservation**
1. **House Bill 258 (Treatment of Discovered Human Remains)**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of collaborating with Indigenous tribes and African-American descendant communities when handling discovered human remains. The goal is to ensure cultural sensitivity and respect during reinternment processes.
   - While there was consensus on the need for further legislation, specific language and details remain unresolved. The focus is on creating a framework that respects the dignity of all people and their cultural heritage.
   - The discussion also highlighted the value of diversity in New Hampshire and the importance of equitable treatment for all groups, particularly those historically marginalized.

2. **African American Graves**:
   - Another bill addressed the handling of graves of African Americans from the period of enslavement. The committee recommended further legislation, noting the need for special considerations due to historical treatment and burial practices.

#### **Environmental and Public Health Issues**
1. **PFAS Contamination**:
   - Multiple bills addressed perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS) in water. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) testified that state and federal efforts are already underway to establish PFAS standards for surface water and drinking water. As a result, the committee voted against recommending bills such as HB 1167, HB 1440, and HB 1602, citing redundancy and technical concerns.
   - DES emphasized that most facilities, including daycares and schools, are already on public water supplies, which are tested for PFAS. The committee supported allowing existing regulatory processes to continue without additional legislation.

2. **Water Quality and Protection**:
   - **Merrimack River Protection (HB 1620)**: The bill aimed to designate part of the Merrimack River as a protected river. The committee voted not to recommend the bill but suggested addressing archaic statutory language in future legislation.
   - **Shoreland Septic Systems (HB 426)**: A subcommittee report recommended against future legislation, citing local control and existing studies. The motion passed 11-6.
   - **Septic Systems and Wastewater (HB 257)**: The committee recommended further legislation to explore enabling communities to include septic systems as part of their wastewater or stormwater utilities, despite concerns about costs and local control.

3. **Lead Testing in Schools**:
   - The committee discussed a bill from the previous year regarding lead testing in schools. While supportive of addressing the issue, no specific recommendations were made.

#### **Recreation and Development**
1. **Off-Highway Recreational Vehicle (OHRV) Safety Program (HB 1498)**:
   - The committee voted not to recommend the bill, as the issue is being addressed by a newly established commission studying OHRV statutes.

---

#### **Administrative and Regulatory Issues**
1. **Renaming DES and Oversight of Private Wells (HB 1452)**:
   - DES opposed the bill, stating it was unnecessary and costly. The committee voted 16-0 not to recommend future legislation.
