The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 13, 2022, convened by the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee, focused on a wide range of bills and discussions related to healthcare, insurance, licensing, and consumer protection. The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing affordability, innovation, and regulatory oversight in these areas. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates from the session:

### **Health Insurance and Consumer Protection**
1. **Low-Cost, One-Claim Health Insurance Plans**:  
   The committee debated the legality of low-cost, single-claim health insurance plans in New Hampshire. While affordability was emphasized, concerns were raised about the adequacy of such plans and the need for informed consent, given their limitations.

2. **Vaccine Coverage and Injury Compensation**:  
   - **Bill 1162**: This bill proposed requiring insurance companies to cover claims related to injuries from experimental vaccines, such as COVID-19 vaccines. However, no evidence of such claims being denied was presented, and no FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines exist.  
   - **Bill 592**: This bill aimed to establish a state-level vaccine injury compensation program to address gaps in the federal program. It was deemed moot due to unresolved funding and logistical challenges.

3. **Short-Term Health Insurance Plans**:  
   The committee discussed the role of short-term health insurance plans as stopgap measures for individuals between jobs or waiting for other coverage. Concerns were raised about their limited coverage and potential to mislead consumers.

4. **Health Insurance Across State Lines**:  
   A bill allowing New Hampshire residents to purchase health insurance from out-of-state companies was considered. While the idea had merit, concerns about losing state consumer protections and regulatory oversight led to skepticism about its feasibility.

5. **Balance Billing**:  
   - **HB 343**: This bill addressed balance billing by ambulance companies, a significant issue in rural areas. Suggestions included pooling resources among towns or creating a fund to assist those unable to afford services. The bill was deemed too complex and unlikely to pass in its current form.  
   - **SB 287**: This bill sought to align state law with the federal No Surprises Act to protect consumers from balance billing. Disagreements over the dispute resolution mechanism and existing federal protections led to the bill not being recommended for future legislation.

### **Professional Licensing and Insurance**
1. **Bill 1019**:  
   The committee explored replacing professional licensing with mandatory liability insurance for certain professions. While the idea was seen as creative, concerns were raised about increased costs, oversight challenges, and the potential for private insurance to enforce higher standards. The debate highlighted the tension between consumer protection and the protectionism of established industries.

### **Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders (PANDAS)**
1. **PANDAS Coverage**:  
   The committee discussed the challenges of diagnosing and treating PANDAS, a rare condition linked to streptococcal infections. The mandate for coverage of treatments like IVIG is set to expire in July 2024. Due to the lack of definitive evidence on treatment efficacy and the absence of a specific billing code, there was no consensus on extending the mandate. It was also noted that mental health coverage under the ACA already includes such conditions, making additional legislation unnecessary.

### **Chiropractic Care and Co-Pays**
1. **Chiropractic Care Co-Pays**:  
   A bill proposed reducing co-pays for chiropractic visits to match those of primary care physicians. Concerns were raised about the potential increase in insurance premiums and the existing 12-visit mandate. The bill was not recommended for further legislation, as current practices were deemed sufficient.

### **State-Based Health Insurance Exchange**
1. **SB 121**:  
   This bill proposed transitioning New Hampshire from the federal health exchange to a state-based system, potentially saving costs. However, the lack of detailed information and the need for a study committee to explore feasibility led to the bill being recommended for further study rather than immediate action.

### **Final Remarks and Procedural Updates**
The meeting concluded with representatives sharing personal anecdotes and reflections on the importance of oversight in professions impacting public safety. Procedural updates were provided, and plans were made to address pending bills in future sessions.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the complexities of healthcare and insurance policy, with a focus on balancing affordability, consumer protection, and regulatory oversight. Many bills were deemed too complex or premature, requiring further study or refinement. The discussions highlighted the need for evidence-based approaches and the importance of maintaining state-level consumer protections while exploring innovative solutions.
