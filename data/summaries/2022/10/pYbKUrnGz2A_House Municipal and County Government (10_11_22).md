The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on October 11, 2022, to discuss six interim study bills carried over from the previous legislative session. The committee's task was to decide whether to recommend each bill for future legislation or let it expire. The meeting began with procedural reminders, including the importance of using microphones correctly and waiting to be recognized before speaking.

The committee reviewed the following bills:

1. **House Bill 132**: A motion was made to not recommend it for future legislation, citing concerns about unnecessarily large lot sizes driving housing costs. The motion passed 10-7.
2. **House Bill 1155**: This bill addressed individuals serving on multiple local boards. A motion to not recommend it for future legislation passed unanimously (17-0).
3. **House Bill 1172**: This bill required composting at public housing. A motion to not recommend it passed 10-7, despite the sponsorâ€™s announcement that they had already refiled it for the next session.
4. **House Bill 1223**: This bill dealt with meeting attendance requirements for budget committee and school board members. A motion to not recommend it passed unanimously (17-0).
5. **House Bill 1289**: This bill concerned tax abatements for certain homeowners. A motion to not recommend it passed unanimously (17-0).
6. **Senate Bill 249**: This bill aimed to prohibit zoning ordinances that restrict short-term rentals. A motion to not recommend it passed unanimously (17-0).

Throughout the meeting, several representatives expressed frustration over the lack of interim study sessions, which they felt were essential for properly evaluating the bills. They argued that the process felt disingenuous, as no substantive discussion or study had occurred, and the votes were based solely on the bills' existing content. Some members criticized the process as a waste of time and resources, particularly since the bills had already been effectively "killed" by not being recommended for future legislation.

The meeting concluded with the assignment of committee members to write reports summarizing the outcomes of the votes. These reports were to be bipartisan and submitted by the end of the week for review before final submission. The session adjourned with reminders to watch for future meeting dates, likely in December.
