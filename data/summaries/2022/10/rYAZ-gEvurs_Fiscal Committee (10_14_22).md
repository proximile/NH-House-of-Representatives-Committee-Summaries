**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (October 14, 2022)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on October 14, 2022, to address a wide range of topics, including tourism, public health, environmental concerns, and funding requests. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

---

### **Tourism and Environmental Management**
1. **Tourism and Parking Fees**:  
   - The committee debated the balance between promoting tourism and managing associated costs. A proposal to increase parking fees from $5 to $10 at primary trailheads was discussed, with the aim of funding the hiker shuttle program, which costs approximately $90,000 annually. The shuttle program has been effective in reducing traffic and parking issues in popular areas.

2. **PFAS Contamination in Landfills**:  
   - The Department of Environmental Services (DES) provided a detailed briefing on the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in landfill leachate and groundwater. PFAS was detected in 91% of sampled landfills, with 77% exceeding ambient groundwater quality standards.  
   - Emerging technologies for leachate treatment, such as foam fractionation, supercritical water oxidation, and granulated activated carbon, were discussed. Pilot studies are underway, with results expected in 2023.  
   - The committee emphasized the need for pre-treatment of leachate before it reaches wastewater treatment plants and explored the possibility of regional pre-treatment facilities.  
   - Efforts to reduce PFAS use in manufacturing and secure additional funding for remediation, including federal grants and state trust funds, were highlighted.

### **Public Health and COVID-19**
1. **COVID-19 Vaccines**:  
   - Dr. Benjamin Chan, the state epidemiologist, presented a science brief on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, particularly for children. He emphasized that New Hampshire’s recommendations are based on an independent review of over 120 peer-reviewed studies, not solely on federal guidelines.  
   - The committee discussed concerns about Florida’s non-evidence-based guidance on vaccines for children, contrasting it with New Hampshire’s evidence-based approach.  
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reiterated its recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination for all eligible individuals, including children.

2. **Telehealth Program for COVID-19 Treatment**:  
   - A proposed telehealth program to provide Paxlovid and other therapeutics to COVID-19 patients was introduced. The program aims to make treatment more accessible, especially in rural areas, and will be free of charge. Public awareness campaigns are planned to promote the program.

3. **COVID-19 Testing and Medicaid Automation**:  
   - The committee approved $228,000 for new COVID-19 testing technology to improve efficiency in state facilities.  
   - A $750,000 ARPA funding request for Medicaid eligibility automation was also approved, aimed at streamlining processes as the federal Public Health Emergency unwinds.

### **Funding Requests and Program Approvals**
1. **Pilot Program for Developmental Disabilities**:  
   - The DHHS requested approval for a pilot program to address service gaps for individuals with developmental disabilities aged 18-21. The committee approved the request, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive plan and funding breakdown. A detailed report is due by February 1, 2023.

2. **Sununu Youth Services Center Staffing**:  
   - The committee approved funding to address critical staffing issues at the Sununu Youth Services Center, which is struggling with recruitment and retention. The funding will provide bonuses for staff working overtime to maintain operations until the center’s mandated closure on March 30, 2023.

3. **Lottery Sales Decline**:  
   - The committee discussed a $6.7 million decline in lottery sales, attributing it to a return to pre-COVID sales levels and rising prices of essential goods like food and gas, which reduce discretionary spending on lottery tickets.

4. **Other Funding Approvals**:  
   - The committee approved several funding requests, including:  
     - $500,000 in federal fund reallocation for DHHS.  
     - A grant for a demonstration program to enhance home and community-based services for seniors, with no impact on the general fund until 2026.  
     - $20 million in State Revolving Fund (SRF) funds for community center projects.

### **Fee Adjustments and Resource Management**
1. **Cannon Mountain Ski Area Fees**:  
   - The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources proposed modest fee increases for Cannon Mountain ski area, justified by market studies and the need to maintain the viability of state resources. Discounts for New Hampshire residents, state employees, and seniors will remain in place.

2. **Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP)**:  
   - The committee discussed the end of the ERAP and its potential impact on local welfare budgets. Plans are in place to transition people off the program gradually, with additional funding requests pending.

### **Program Efficiency and Workforce Challenges**
1. **SWEEP Initiative**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the decentralized nature of the SWEEP initiative, which aims to improve efficiency and address workforce challenges in state agencies. The committee emphasized the need for a centralized program manager to ensure best practices and track manpower savings.

2. **Medicaid Enhancements**:  
   - The committee discussed the potential end of Medicaid enhancements tied to the Public Health Emergency, with assurances that there would be no clawback of improperly awarded benefits.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the approval of several motions and funding requests. The committee emphasized the importance of evidence-based decision-making, efficient resource management, and collaboration across state agencies to address pressing issues such as PFAS contamination, public health, and workforce challenges. Detailed plans and reports are expected in the coming months to guide future actions.
