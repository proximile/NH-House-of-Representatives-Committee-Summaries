The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee held a subcommittee work session on October 18, 2022, to discuss **House Bill 1111**, which had been referred for interim study. The bill aimed to establish a commission to study **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)**, a concept focused on making manufacturers responsible for the recyclability and waste reduction of their products and packaging.

The subcommittee, with guest Representative Davis (who did not have voting rights), reviewed a draft report and discussed potential recommendations for future legislation. Key points of discussion included:

1. **Options for Recommendation**: The subcommittee considered three primary options:
   - Recommending a **commission** to study EPR.
   - Recommending a **study committee** focused on EPR.
   - Not recommending any action.

2. **Study Committee vs. Commission**:
   - A **study committee** would consist solely of legislators and could act more quickly and narrowly on specific issues.
   - A **commission** would include both legislators and stakeholders, offering broader representation but potentially delaying the process due to the need for appointments.

3. **Focus on RSA 149-M**: The discussion centered on how EPR could be integrated into **RSA 149-M**, the state statute governing solid waste management. The subcommittee considered whether to focus narrowly on updating this statute to include EPR principles.

4. **Testimony and Priorities**: Testimony from stakeholders, including municipalities and the Department of Environmental Services (DES), highlighted the need to address increasing waste and tipping fees. DESâ€™s Solid Waste Plan also emphasized EPR as a legislative priority.

5. **Motion and Decision**: After deliberation, the subcommittee unanimously voted to recommend a **study committee** focused on RSA 149-M with an emphasis on EPR. This recommendation will be presented to the full Environment and Agriculture Committee.

The session concluded with appreciation for attendees and anticipation of further legislative action on EPR and solid waste management.
