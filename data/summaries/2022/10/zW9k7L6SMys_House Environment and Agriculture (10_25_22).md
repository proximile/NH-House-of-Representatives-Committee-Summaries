The New Hampshire House Environment and Agriculture Committee held its final executive session for the 2022 legislative year on October 25, 2022. The committee reviewed and made recommendations on seven bills. Here are the key outcomes:

1. **HB 366 (Defining Animal Hoarding)**: The committee voted 12-0 not to recommend the bill for future legislation. The prime sponsor and committee members agreed the issue was important but felt the bill did not offer a viable solution and could create more problems than it solved.

2. **HB 438 (Confidentiality of Animal Records Databases)**: The committee voted 12-0 not to recommend the bill for future legislation. The proposed security measures were already included in the state budget, making the bill redundant.

3. **HB 585 (Prepayment of Dog Licensing Fees)**: The committee voted 12-0 not to recommend the bill for future legislation. Concerns were raised about the practicality and increased workload for municipal clerks.

4. **HB 627 (Grant Matching Fund for Agricultural Producers)**: The committee voted 12-0 not to recommend the bill for future legislation. The sponsor acknowledged the bill’s flaws and suggested revisiting the concept in the future.

5. **HB 1111 (Extended Producer Responsibility Study)**: The committee voted 11-1 to recommend the bill for future legislation. A study committee will explore extended producer responsibility, focusing on RSA 149-m, to address waste management challenges.

6. **HB 1121 (New Solid Waste Sites)**: The committee voted 12-0 not to recommend the bill for future legislation. The proposed bond requirements for landfill construction were unclear and deemed ineffective.

7. **HB 1652 (Recycling of Beverage Containers)**: The committee voted 11-1 not to recommend the bill for future legislation. The bill, modeled after Rhode Island’s bottle bill, was considered too complex and better suited for broader extended producer responsibility discussions.

The chair, Representative Pearl, thanked the committee for its bipartisan collaboration and thoughtful work throughout the session. Several members praised the leadership and collegiality of the committee. Representative Pearl announced he would not seek re-election to the House but would run for the Senate, expressing gratitude for the relationships built during his tenure. The session concluded with the committee adjourning for the legislative term.
