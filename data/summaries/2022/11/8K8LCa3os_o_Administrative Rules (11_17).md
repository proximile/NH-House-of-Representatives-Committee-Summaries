The New Hampshire House of Representatives Administrative Rules meeting on November 17 centered on reviewing and discussing a wide array of administrative rules proposed by various state departments. The committee emphasized the importance of clarity, statutory authority, and addressing unresolved issues throughout the deliberations. Key topics and decisions from the meeting are summarized below:

### Departmental Rules Review:
1. **Department of Revenue**: The committee reviewed a proposal (2022-132) related to the communication services tax, focusing on unclear language and exceptions to gross charges. While the Department of Revenue acknowledged historical context, unresolved ambiguities led to a motion for preliminary objections due to concerns about statutory authority and clarity.

2. **Department of Safety**: A rule concerning sexual offender registration was discussed, with particular attention to circular statutory definitions. The committee ultimately approved the rule but recommended statutory clarification to address the identified issues.

3. **Alcohol and Drug Use Professionals Licensing**: Changes to licensing rules, including remote supervision via platforms like Zoom, were reviewed. The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification clarified definitions and agreed to address staff comments. The committee approved the conditional approval request with editorial changes.

4. **Pharmacy Board Rules**: The board submitted a draft conditional approval addressing technical issues and comments. The committee waived the submission deadline and accepted the draft with additional recommendations.

5. **Veterinarian Licensing Rules**: Rules for veterinarians were reviewed, with a focus on expired rules and fee collection issues. The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification explained efforts to issue refunds for improperly charged fees. The committee accepted the amended conditional approval.

6. **Prescription Drug Affordability Rules**: The committee reviewed organizational rules for the Prescription Drug Affordability Board, noting unresolved comments and a late submission from Representative Lang. Further review was deemed necessary before finalizing the rules.

### Broader Issues and Concerns:
1. **Rule Review and Comments**: The committee discussed a set of rules (the 300s) and received comments highlighting the need for further rulemaking to clarify data sets and spending targets. Concerns were also raised about the removal of provisions allowing the board to seek grants and contracts, despite their statutory basis.

2. **Constitutional Concerns**: Representative Lang raised constitutional issues regarding fees in the rules, referencing a 2013 document by scholar Marcus Hearn. The committee agreed to further analyze these concerns, with some members questioning the applicability of an eight-year-old objection to current practices.

3. **Approval Process**: The committee debated whether to approve a rule immediately or postpone for further review. They ultimately approved the rule but requested the agency conduct a cost-benefit analysis of their fees to ensure alignment with benefits provided to fee payers. If the analysis does not justify the fees, the committee could object and require adjustments.

4. **Radiation Safety Rules**: Amendments to licensing and radiation safety requirements for radiators and wireline service operators were discussed. Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact statement not addressing potential costs for compliance with new federal security requirements (Hep 4038). The agency clarified that these requirements have been in place since 2016, and the rule update merely cites existing federal regulations, resulting in no new fiscal impact. However, concerns persisted about the state adopting federal rules without legislative approval.

5. **Emergency Rule on Transaction Fees**: The committee reviewed an emergency rule from the Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, allowing providers to charge transaction fees for credit card payments by clients undergoing court-ordered counseling. This rule was implemented after providers argued that absorbing these fees strained their budgets. The rule requires providers to notify clients of the fee in advance.

### Closing Remarks:
The meeting concluded with a small celebration honoring the chair for his 12 years of service, including three terms as chair. Staff presented cupcakes and expressed appreciation for his leadership.

### Summary:
The November 17 Administrative Rules meeting covered a broad spectrum of topics, from departmental rule reviews to constitutional concerns and emergency rule implementations. The committee consistently prioritized clarity, statutory authority, and addressing unresolved issues, making decisions on conditional approvals, preliminary objections, and editorial changes as needed. Significant debate arose over the adoption of federal requirements and fee structures, underscoring the complexities of aligning state rules with federal mandates and constitutional principles.
