The NH House of Representatives meeting on November 17 focused on administrative rules, addressing a wide range of proposals and amendments across various departments. The session highlighted both substantive discussions and procedural acknowledgments, underscoring the committee’s commitment to refining administrative regulations while recognizing the contributions of its members and staff.

### Key Discussions and Decisions:
1. **Service Provider Notification Rule**: The committee discussed a provision requiring service providers to notify clients of fees in advance before charges are made. While the rulemaking authority for this provision was deemed broad and within their jurisdiction, no action was taken on the matter.

2. **Department of Revenue Proposal (2022-132)**: Conditional approval was filed, but unresolved substantive comments persisted, particularly regarding unclear language about gross charges and exceptions. The department referenced past approvals and statutory provisions, but the issue remained unresolved.

3. **Department of Safety Proposal (2022-262)**: Concerns were raised about circular statutory language related to sexual offender registration. The committee approved the rule with a recommendation for statutory clarification.

4. **Alcohol and Drug Use Professionals Licensing Rules**: Issues with remote supervision via platforms like Zoom were addressed. The department clarified that telephonic supervision is allowed, and amendments were proposed to align the rules with statute. The committee approved the conditional approval with corrections.

5. **Pharmacy Board Proposal**: Technical difficulties delayed the official submission of a conditional approval. Amendments were discussed to include certified pharmacy technicians and interns in vaccine administration rules. The committee approved the draft conditional approval with additional comments.

6. **Veterinarians Licensing Rules**: Rules expired in 2020, and concerns were raised about fee collection during the lapse. The department explained that refunds were being issued, and the committee approved the amended conditional approval.

7. **Prescription Drug Affordability Rules**: A late submission raised constitutional concerns about fees. The committee approved the rule but requested a cost-benefit analysis of fees.

8. **Radiation Safety Rules**: Amendments to licensing rules for radiators and wireline service operators were discussed. Concerns were raised about fiscal impacts and the adoption of federal rules without legislative approval. The committee postponed the decision for further discussion.

9. **Emergency Rule for Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention**: Providers were authorized to charge transaction fees for credit card payments, addressing budget concerns raised by providers.

### Meeting Conclusion and Acknowledgments:
The meeting concluded with a staff presentation, including a gesture of gratitude involving cupcakes to honor the chair for his 12 years of service (three terms as Vice Chair and three terms as Chair). A brief anecdote was shared about the only time the committee couldn’t meet in December, tied to Senator Reagan’s appointment in 2013. Former director Scott Eaton was present, and the chair expressed appreciation for the staff and encouraged continued collaboration with them. The meeting was adjourned, with Scott Eaton also taking the opportunity to say goodbye.

Overall, the session demonstrated the committee’s thorough review of administrative rules, addressing unresolved comments, fiscal impacts, and statutory alignments. Decisions included motions for conditional approvals, amendments, and postponements, reflecting a balanced approach to regulatory oversight.
