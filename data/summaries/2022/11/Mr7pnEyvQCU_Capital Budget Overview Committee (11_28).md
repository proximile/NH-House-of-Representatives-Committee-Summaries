The New Hampshire House of Representatives Capital Budget Overview Committee meeting on November 28 began with the approval of the minutes from the September 19, 2022, meeting. The committee had no old, new, or miscellaneous business to address. However, informational items were distributed, including details about a grant proposal for the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad. 

A representative from the railroad explained that New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont are jointly applying for a **Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI)** grant to upgrade the rail system. The goal is to increase the rail's weight capacity from 263 pounds to 286 pounds per foot, which is essential for modern freight transportation and economic development in the region. New Hampshire has seven miles of rail left to upgrade, requiring approximately $7 million, while Vermont and Maine need $3.6 million and $7.6 million, respectively. 

The committee was informed that matching funds from the state and the railroad would be used to secure federal grant money. The discussion emphasized the importance of freight rail improvements, particularly for attracting businesses to the North Country. 

The meeting concluded with the chair thanking committee members for their work over the past two years and adjourning the session. The next meeting is expected to be scheduled in February or March, pending new committee appointments by the Speaker of the House and Senate President.
