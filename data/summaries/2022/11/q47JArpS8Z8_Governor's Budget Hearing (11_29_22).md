The NH House of Representatives meeting on November 29, 2022, focused on the Governor's Budget Hearing for Fiscal Years 2024-2025, addressing a wide range of state priorities, challenges, and funding requests. The discussions spanned education, workforce development, infrastructure, energy, staffing, and community development, reflecting the state’s efforts to balance fiscal responsibility with addressing systemic needs. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key themes and proposals from the meeting:

---

### **Education and Workforce Development**
1. **Child Care and Early Education**:
   - A Child Care Workforce Initiative was proposed to expand access to child care education, reduce financial barriers, and retain workers through credentialing and professional growth opportunities. This aims to address workforce shortages and improve child care quality.
   
2. **Higher Education**:
   - **University System of New Hampshire (USNH)**: USNH emphasized its role in workforce development, partnering with over 2,000 employers and graduating about 2,000 students annually. Despite cost management efforts, including $50 million in operating expense reductions, USNH requested $17 million over two years to support initiatives like internships, the Granite Guarantee (free tuition for Pell-eligible students), and Cooperative Extension programs.
   - **Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH)**: CCSNH highlighted its affordability, with tuition remaining nearly flat for 12 years, and its focus on workforce credential programs and dual enrollment. The system requested continued tuition freezes and funding for renewable energy projects to reduce operational costs.

3. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**:
   - The EFA program, which allows eligible students to use state funds for alternative education options, has seen significant growth. Its budget is projected to increase to $30 million, with discussions on the potential impact of a recession on eligibility.

4. **Special Education and Building Aid**:
   - Increased funding was requested for special education and school building projects, including $50 million annually for building aid to address infrastructure needs.

### **Infrastructure and Transportation**
1. **Bridge and Road Maintenance**:
   - The Department of Transportation (DOT) highlighted challenges in bridge maintenance, with the "Red List" of deficient bridges reduced to 118 due to federal funds. However, workforce shortages and rising costs of materials like diesel and salt have hampered progress.
   - Vehicle acquisition delays due to manufacturing constraints have also impacted operations.

2. **Highway and Turnpike Funds**:
   - Concerns were raised about declining gas tax revenues and the long-term erosion of highway fund revenues due to electric vehicles and fuel efficiency.

### **Community Development and Conservation**
1. **Community Development Finance Authority (CDFA)**:
   - CDFA requested state match funding to leverage federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, which support housing, child care, small businesses, and local infrastructure. Examples include the Sunshine Soup Kitchen and Mid-State Health Center.
   
2. **Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP)**:
   - LCHIP sought $5 million in appropriation, funded by a $25 surcharge on deed recordings, to continue conserving land and rehabilitating historic buildings.

3. **Fish and Game Department**:
   - The department faces financial strain, with the Fish and Game Fund projected to deplete within two budget cycles. Requests included funding for additional conservation officers, search and rescue operations, and upgrades to database systems.

### **Energy and Environmental Sustainability**
1. **Energy Prices and Diversification**:
   - New England’s reliance on natural gas for electricity production has led to rising energy costs. Diversification efforts, such as offshore wind, were discussed as long-term solutions.
   
2. **Renewable Energy Projects**:
   - CCSNH is exploring solar energy projects to reduce utility costs, while the Department of Energy emphasized the need for weatherization assistance and regulatory support.

### **Staffing and Workforce Challenges**
1. **Retention and Recruitment**:
   - Multiple departments, including the DOT, Insurance Department, and Military Affairs, highlighted difficulties in hiring and retaining staff due to lower salaries compared to neighboring states. Retention bonuses and flexible hiring practices were proposed as solutions.
   
2. **Telework and Technology**:
   - The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) emphasized the need for strategic investments in cybersecurity, modernizing applications, and improving telework infrastructure to address workforce shortages and evolving threats.

### **Budgetary and Operational Efficiency**
1. **Debt Management**:
   - The Treasury Department is creating an Office of Investment and Debt Management to streamline operations, with general obligation debt declining and no variable rate debt or interest rate swaps.
   
2. **Public Employee Labor Relations Board (PELRB)**:
   - The PELRB requested funds to modernize its case management system and address challenges related to COVID-19 and technological issues.

3. **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**:
   - NHRS reported progress in reducing its unfunded liability, with a funded ratio of 65.6% in FY22. The system requested budget increases for technology upgrades and salaries.

### **Cultural and Recreational Resources**
1. **Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR)**:
   - DNCR highlighted significant growth in park attendance, camping, and retail sales, prompting requests for funding to address staffing shortages and expand campgrounds using ARPA funds.
   
2. **Support for the Arts**:
   - Efforts to revive the arts and cultural sector, which has not fully recovered from the pandemic, were emphasized, including support for New Hampshire Public Television (NHPBS) to produce local content.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**
- **Workforce Development**: Education and training programs are critical to addressing workforce shortages in high-demand fields like health care, technology, and skilled trades.
- **Affordability**: Efforts to keep tuition low and expand access to education, particularly for low-income and non-traditional students, were a recurring focus.
- **Infrastructure Maintenance**: Bridge and road maintenance, along with energy and utility costs, remain significant challenges due to rising expenses and workforce shortages.
