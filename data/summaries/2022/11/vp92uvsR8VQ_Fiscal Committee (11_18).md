The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Fiscal Committee meeting on November 18th covered a wide range of fiscal, administrative, and policy-related discussions, with a focus on program improvements, audits, funding requests, and urgent needs as winter approaches. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Program Operational Improvements and Financial Matters**
- **Program Glitch and Proration**: A minor glitch in a program was addressed, improving its functionality and enabling proration. However, concerns were raised about the program’s effectiveness in retaining participants through the winter, with the committee noting it was too early to declare success.
- **Financial Audits and Reports**: The committee accepted and released the day’s audits and additional FY 2022 annual financial reports.

- **OPLC’s Response**: Lindsey Courtney, OPLC’s executive director, acknowledged the audit findings and committed to addressing the issues, citing challenges from the agency’s rapid creation and cultural changes.
