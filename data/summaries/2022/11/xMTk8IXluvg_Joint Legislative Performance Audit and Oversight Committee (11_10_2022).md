The **Joint Legislative Performance Audit and Oversight Committee** meeting on November 10, 2022, focused on updates regarding ongoing audits and potential topics for future oversight. Key points included:

1. **Approval of Minutes**: The committee accepted the minutes from the May 10th meeting without any corrections.  
   
2. **Audit Updates**:  
   - **Retirement System Healthcare Subsidy**: A letter was issued on May 23rd, but no further action has been taken.  
   - **Dental Examiners Board**: Issues were outlined, and the legislature needs to provide clarity on statutes.  
   - **Board of General Examiners**: A finalized audit report (over 300 pages with 36 observations) will be sent to the fiscal committee, addressing internal workings of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).  
   - **Mental Health Workforce Audit**: Fieldwork is ongoing, with completion expected by mid-December. Delays may occur due to coordination with multiple boards and commissions.  
   - **Weatherization Assistance Program**: Progress is slow due to a federal audit, new funding, and staff turnover. A final report is expected by February or March 2023.  
   - **Special Education Dispute Resolution**: Fieldwork is ongoing, with challenges in obtaining email addresses from school districts for a survey.  
   - **Education Freedom Account Audit**: Scheduled for fall 2023 due to the new program’s limited activity.  

3. **Human Rights Commission**: Representatives discussed a bill (SB 296) to remove the respondent’s right to transfer cases to Superior Court. The interim study highlighted a significant backlog (300 cases) due to resource cuts and high turnover, with cases taking up to five years to resolve.  

4. **OPLC and Certification**: Concerns were raised about systemic issues across boards under OPLC, but further action was tabled pending the fiscal committee’s review of the Board of General Examiners audit.  

5. **National Recognition**: The committee submitted the Adult Parole Board audit report for a national award, recognizing its impact on legislative change.  

6. **Adjournment**: The meeting concluded with recognition of Senator Reagan’s service on the committee.  

Overall, the meeting highlighted progress on various audits, challenges with backlogs and resource constraints, and discussions on legislative changes to improve efficiency in state operations.
