The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on December 2, 2022, to discuss and vote on a key item related to broadband expansion in the state. The meeting focused on the allocation of federal funds to improve internet access, particularly in underserved and unserved areas. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Broadband Expansion Funding**: The committee discussed the allocation of $122 million in federal funds awarded to New Hampshire in 2021 for broadband infrastructure. This funding aims to address long-standing disparities in internet access, especially in rural areas.

2. **Programs and Initiatives**: 
   - **Broadband Connect Program**: A competitive $50 million program targeting unserved and underserved locations. Round one of this program is already underway, bringing service to 23,000 locations at a cost of $2,100 per location.
   - **Broadband Matching Grant Initiative (BMGI)**: A $25 million program designed to fill gaps not covered by the Broadband Connect Program, focusing on partnerships between providers and local communities.

3. **Round Two Funding**: The committee considered a request to allocate an additional $40 million for a second round of the Broadband Connect Program, aiming to bring service to 15,000 more locations.

4. **Future Funding**: The committee discussed the anticipated receipt of $40 million from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to further support broadband expansion efforts.

5. **Concerns and Questions**:
   - **Representative Leishman** raised concerns about certain communities, like Hancock, still relying on dial-up internet and questioned whether they would be prioritized in the next funding round.
   - **Senator Bradley** inquired about the timeline and certainty of the IIJA funds and the process for selecting which areas would receive funding.
   - **Representative Edward** questioned whether the current investments would support future broadband standards, such as the emerging 8-gigabit technology.

6. **Vote and Outcome**: The committee unanimously approved (10-0) the motion to accept and expend the replacement item for FIS 22-404, allowing the Broadband Connect Program and BMGI to proceed.

7. **Closing Remarks**: Committee members expressed gratitude for the work done by the Broadband Expansion Agency (BEA) and acknowledged the contributions of outgoing members, wishing everyone a happy holiday season.

The meeting highlighted the state’s commitment to addressing broadband disparities and ensuring that investments align with future technological advancements. The next Fiscal Committee meeting is scheduled for January.
