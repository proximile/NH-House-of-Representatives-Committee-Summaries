### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on House Rules (12/20/2022)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on December 20, 2022, to discuss and vote on several amendments to House rules, as well as to address requests for late drafting of bills. The meeting focused on refining procedural rules to enhance fairness, inclusivity, and efficiency in the legislative process. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

#### **Amendments to House Rules**

1. **Amendment to Increase Consent Threshold**  
   A proposal to require two additional members (totaling three) to agree to remove a bill from the consent calendar was introduced. This amendment aimed to prevent punitive actions by individuals and ensure broader consensus. After debate, the amendment passed with a 5-4 vote.

2. **Amendment to Change "Prayer" to "Invocation"**  
   A representative proposed changing the term "prayer" to "invocation" in House rules to make the opening of sessions more inclusive. The motion to reject this amendment passed 5-4, maintaining the current terminology.

3. **Amendment to Unanimous Consent Rules**  
   An amendment sought to require a two-thirds vote to challenge unanimous consent, aiming to reduce contentious speeches. The motion to not accept this amendment passed unanimously (9-0), with some members suggesting further discussion on related issues.

4. **Amendment to Update Camera Rules**  
   A representative proposed updating House rules to remove outdated references to flash bulbs in the context of banning cameras on the House floor. This amendment was unanimously accepted.

5. **House Deadlines Amendment**  
   Amendments to House deadlines were accepted, adjusting the timeline for reporting bills to second committee. This change provided more time for budget preparation.

6. **House Rule 20**  
   An amendment was introduced to prevent either caucus from overloading the legislative day with too many special orders, ensuring stability in the House schedule. The amendment passed unanimously.

7. **House Rule 43b**  
   An amendment proposed allowing executive sessions to be scheduled more flexibly, provided the chair and ranking member agree. This amendment also passed unanimously.

8. **House Rule 44**  
   An amendment adjusted the notice period for public hearings from four to three days for committees meeting on Mondays, allowing more flexibility in scheduling. This amendment passed unanimously.

9. **House Rule 22c**  
   A proposal to require the question to be placed to members twice if a roll call is sufficiently seconded was not accepted, as it was deemed unnecessary.

10. **House Rule 46**  
    An amendment aimed at changing the process for handling tied committee votes was withdrawn for further discussion due to concerns about fairness and tradition.

11. **House Rule 52**  
    A proposal to increase the threshold for removing a bill from the consent calendar from one member to three members was discussed, but the outcome was not detailed in the transcript.

#### **Late Drafting Requests**

Several representatives requested late drafting for bills that missed the November 22nd deadline. These requests were often due to misunderstandings or miscommunications about the deadline. The Rules Committee voted on each request individually, with some being allowed and others denied based on the circumstances and urgency of the bill.

#### **Discussions and Motions**

Throughout the meeting, the committee emphasized the importance of adhering to rules while considering the practicality and fairness of allowing late drafting and rule changes. There was a focus on maintaining stability and efficiency in the legislative process, especially given the potential for a high number of divided committee reports in the upcoming session.

#### **Conclusion**

The meeting concluded with reminders about submitting floor amendments and a motion to adjourn. The discussions and votes reflected a commitment to refining House rules to ensure a more inclusive, fair, and efficient legislative process, while addressing procedural challenges and the practical needs of representatives.
