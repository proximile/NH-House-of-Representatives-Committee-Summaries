The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Municipal and County Government Committee meeting on January 19, 2023, addressed a range of bills focused on municipal and county governance, with a significant emphasis on housing policy, local control, and modernization of municipal processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Housing and Zoning: House Bill 44**
**House Bill 44** was a central focus of the meeting, aiming to address the state’s housing shortage by allowing **fourplexes** (up to four units) in residential zones with **municipal water and sewer access**. Key points included:

#### **Support for HB 44:**
1. **Housing Crisis:** Proponents highlighted New Hampshire’s severe housing shortage, characterized by rising home prices, low rental vacancy rates, and homelessness. The bill is seen as a way to increase the supply of **workforce housing**, supporting local economies and workers.
2. **Property Rights:** Supporters argued the bill expands property rights by allowing homeowners to convert single-family homes into multi-family units without excessive government regulation. It provides flexibility without mandating changes.
3. **Economic and Community Benefits:** More housing would benefit local businesses, reduce commutes, and stabilize communities. Evidence suggests multi-family housing does not negatively impact adjacent single-family neighborhoods.
4. **Local Control:** The bill allows municipalities to maintain control over design standards, setbacks, parking, and other zoning regulations, ensuring development aligns with community character.

#### **Concerns About HB 44:**
1. **Neighborhood Character:** Opponents, including town planners, expressed concerns that fourplexes could lead to **ugly, vinyl-box developments** with excessive parking, harming the aesthetic and historic character of neighborhoods.
2. **Student Housing Issues:** In towns like Durham, where student housing is a concern, the bill could exacerbate problems by increasing density in single-family neighborhoods.
3. **Infrastructure Strain:** Some representatives raised concerns about the potential strain on water, sewer, and school systems, particularly in smaller communities.
4. **Incremental Approach:** Critics suggested the bill goes too far too fast and should be scaled back or implemented gradually to allow communities time to adapt.

#### **Additional Testimony:**
- **Workforce Housing Advocates:** Organizations like the Workforce Housing Coalition and Housing Action NH supported the bill, noting it aligns with efforts to increase housing supply without government subsidies.
- **Realtors’ Perspective:** The New Hampshire Association of Realtors backed the bill, citing it as a **private property rights issue** and a step toward addressing the housing crisis.
- **Municipal Opposition:** The Municipal Association opposed the bill, advocating for **local control** over zoning decisions rather than statewide mandates.

### **Other Key Bills Discussed:**
1. **HB 90 (Municipal Master Plans):** This bill proposes updating municipal master plans to include **renewable energy** and **EV charging infrastructure** as optional considerations. The bill aims to modernize planning processes without imposing mandates, allowing municipalities to incorporate 21st-century needs.
2. **HB 184 (Public Notice for Zoning Board Hearings):** This bill would allow municipalities to post public notices for Zoning Board of Adjustment hearings on town websites instead of in newspapers, aiming to save costs and streamline processes. Supporters argued it would reduce expenses, while opponents, including the New Hampshire Press Association, raised concerns about reduced public access and transparency.
3. **HB 197 (Property Tax Exemptions):** This bill seeks to prorate property tax exemptions for individuals with fractional ownership in property, ensuring equity across exemptions for the blind, disabled, deaf, severely hearing impaired, and elderly. Currently, only elderly exemptions are prorated, while others receive the full exemption regardless of ownership share.
4. **HB 36 (Consumer Price Index Clarification):** The committee adopted an amendment clarifying language regarding the Consumer Price Index, and the bill passed unanimously (20-0).
5. **HB 41 (Public Notice Requirements):** The committee considered an amendment to update public notice requirements for county meetings to include alternative methods like websites and electronic media. The amendment failed (11-9), and the bill was voted **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)** (18-2).
6. **HB 70 (Residency Requirements for Deputy Town Clerks):** An amendment failed (10-10), and the bill was retained for further study (19-1).
7. **HB 72 (Appointment of Public Librarians):** The committee adopted an amendment clarifying the appointment process, and the bill passed unanimously (19-0).
8. **HB 75 (Competitive Bidding Threshold for County Personal Property):** The bill passed unanimously (19-0).
9. **HB 80 (Tax-Exempt Status for Agricultural Leases):** An amendment passed (12-7), but the bill was ultimately voted **ITL** (18-2).
10. **HB 148 (Competitive Bidding Threshold for County Purchases):** Due to a lack of input from the prime sponsor and key witnesses, the bill was voted **ITL** (18-2).
