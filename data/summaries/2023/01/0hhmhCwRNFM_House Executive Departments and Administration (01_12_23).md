### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Executive Departments and Administration Meeting (01/12/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee met on January 12, 2023, to discuss several legislative proposals and issues related to retirement systems, law enforcement staffing, training requirements, and a constitutional amendment proposing the establishment of a lieutenant governor position. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Retirement System Adjustments**

#### **HB 30: Exempting County Chief Administrative Officers from the State Retirement System**
- **Purpose**: This bill allows county commissioners to exempt their chief administrative officers from compulsory membership in the state retirement system.
- **Background**: Similar bills were introduced in 2020 and 2021 but were tabled due to COVID-19. This bill aims to resolve the issue.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - Many county managers already have retirement plans elsewhere and should not be compelled to join the state system.
  - The financial impact on the state retirement system is negligible, affecting fewer than 10 members and less than 0.1% of payroll.
  - Municipalities already have similar exemptions, and this bill aligns county policies with municipal practices.
- **Concerns**: Some committee members raised concerns about potential slippery slopes for other exemptions and impacts on the retirement system’s unfunded liability.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 18-0 in favor of the bill, recommending it for the consent calendar.

#### **HB 183: Exempting Part-Time Firefighters from Pension System for Teaching at the Fire Academy**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to exempt retired firefighters from annual hour limitations when teaching at the fire academy, addressing staffing shortages.
- **Background**: A 2022 ad hoc committee on fire and EMS retention highlighted the need for more training opportunities and experienced instructors.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - Retired firefighters have valuable experience to share but are limited by current retirement system rules (e.g., 25-hour weekly cap).
  - Exempting teaching hours would allow retirees to contribute more without jeopardizing their pensions.
  - The fire academy relies heavily on part-time instructors, 25% of whom are retirees, to meet high demand for training.
  - Similar issues exist at the police academy, where retired officers could also benefit from such exemptions.
- **Concerns**: Some committee members questioned whether hiring full-time instructors would be a better solution and whether this exemption could set a precedent for other groups.
- **Outcome**: No vote was taken during this session, but the committee expressed interest in addressing staffing challenges at both the fire and police academies.

### **Law Enforcement Staffing and Training Challenges**

1. **Staffing Issues**:
   - New Hampshire faces a 20% vacancy rate in law enforcement positions, a trend mirrored nationwide.
   - Retention of experienced officers is a significant issue, with many leaving for the private sector due to perceived lack of community support and increased danger.

2. **Training Requirements**:
   - Police Standards and Training oversees over 4,000 certified officers.
   - New training requirements, including increased in-service training from 8 to 24 hours annually, were implemented based on recommendations from the Liac Commission and a governor's executive order.
   - A new Conduct Review Committee has been established to investigate police misconduct.

3. **Retention and Recruitment**:
   - Efforts are being made to retain experienced law enforcement executives to mentor and conduct reviews.
   - The part-time police academy struggles to attract participants, while the full-time academy has a waiting list.

4. **Retirement System Updates**:
   - The NH Retirement System (NHRS) discussed changes to how retirees can work post-retirement, including a 1,352-hour annual limit for those retiring after 2018.
   - Grandfathered retirees can work up to 1,664 hours annually if they remain with the same employer.
   - Exceptions include work during state emergencies or firefighting duties.

5. **Military Service Credit**:
   - Clarifications were made regarding military service credit for retirees, including free service credit for up to three years of active duty.
   - Conflicts with federal law regarding military pension eligibility were addressed.

### **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 1 (CACR1): Establishing a Lieutenant Governor Position**

#### **Purpose of the Bill**:
- The bill proposes creating a lieutenant governor role to ensure a clear and non-partisan line of succession if the governor is unable to serve. Currently, the state senate president assumes this role, creating a conflict between legislative and executive powers.
- Representative Mike Moffett emphasized the importance of addressing potential midterm vacancies and ensuring continuity in governance.

#### **Bipartisan Support**:
- The bill is framed as bipartisan and non-partisan, with co-sponsors from both parties. It seeks to prevent scenarios where a governor from one party is replaced by a senate president from another party.

#### **Proposed Structure**:
- The bill suggests a **citizen lieutenant governor** who would serve for a nominal salary of $125 per year, reflecting New Hampshire’s tradition of citizen legislators.
- The lieutenant governor would assist with ceremonial duties, attend events, and support the governor, enhancing the executive branch’s capacity to serve the public.

#### **Concerns and Counterarguments**:
- **Representative Dan McGuire** argued that the current system, while imperfect, has worked for over 250 years without significant issues. He suggested alternative solutions, such as having an executive council member serve as acting governor.
- **Representative Timothy Horrigan** expressed concerns about the lieutenant governor being underpaid and underutilized, suggesting a more substantial role and salary.
- Questions were raised about the potential costs of staffing, security, and logistics for the lieutenant governor.

#### **Future Steps**:
- The bill will likely be retained for further discussion over the summer, with potential revisions to address concerns about compensation, duties, and implementation.

### **Key Themes**:
- **Retirement System Adjustments**: Both HB 30 and HB 183 aim to address staffing and retention issues by adjusting retirement system rules, balancing the need for experienced personnel with concerns about financial impacts and potential precedents.
- **Law Enforcement Challenges**: The state faces significant staffing shortages and training demands, with efforts focused on retention, recruitment, and leveraging experienced retirees.
- **Lieutenant Governor Proposal**: CACR1 seeks to address succession and separation of powers issues, proposing a citizen lieutenant governor role to enhance governance while maintaining New Hampshire’s commitment to limited government and citizen involvement.
