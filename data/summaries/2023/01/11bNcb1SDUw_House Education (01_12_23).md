The transcript from the NH House of Representatives meeting on January 12, 2023, highlights the functioning of a committee that has been active for eight terms. The speaker notes that the committee generally works well together and finds the subject matter engaging, particularly the field trips. These trips include visits to prisons as part of their focus on criminal justice. The repetition in the transcript suggests the speaker may have been emphasizing these points or experiencing some technical or verbal hiccups.
