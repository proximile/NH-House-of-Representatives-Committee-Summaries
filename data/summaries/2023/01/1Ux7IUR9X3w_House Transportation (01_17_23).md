### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (01/17/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on January 17, 2023, covered a wide range of topics related to the state's transportation system, including vehicle safety, infrastructure maintenance, pedestrian safety, and emerging challenges such as electric vehicle (EV) adoption and distracted driving. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Overview of State Transportation Agencies**
The meeting began with presentations from key state agencies involved in transportation:

- **Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**: Director Marasco highlighted efforts to streamline the Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) process, including mobile testing units and modernization initiatives to address the nationwide truck driver shortage. The DMV also emphasized its role in driver education and fraud prevention.

- **Department of Safety**: Representatives from Troop G discussed their responsibilities, including commercial motor vehicle enforcement, dealer inspections, driver education oversight, and fraud investigations. Collaboration with federal agencies and industry leaders was emphasized to improve safety and compliance.

- **Department of Transportation (DOT)**: Commissioner Bill Cass provided an overview of the DOT’s mission, which includes maintaining state roads, bridges, and traffic signals, as well as overseeing aviation, rail, and public transit systems. Key challenges include staffing shortages, infrastructure maintenance, and the need for modernization. The DOT’s FY 2022 budget was approximately $600 million, with significant allocations for construction projects and municipal aid.

### **2. Infrastructure and Funding Challenges**
The DOT faces several critical challenges:
- **Highway Fund Sustainability**: The highway fund, primarily sourced from gas taxes, road tolls, and registration fees, supports not only the DOT but also other state agencies. Declining revenues due to increased fuel efficiency and the rise of EVs threaten its long-term viability.
- **Workforce Shortages**: The DOT is grappling with historically high vacancy rates (22-24%), particularly for snowplow operators. A $5,000 recruitment and retention bonus has helped stabilize the workforce but has not significantly increased new hires.
- **Asset Management**: The DOT employs a strategy to prioritize road maintenance, focusing on preserving good roads while addressing the backlog of poor-condition roads. This approach has improved pavement conditions and reduced the number of structurally deficient bridges.
- **Inflation and Supply Chain Issues**: Rising costs for materials like fuel and salt, coupled with inflationary pressures, pose additional challenges.

### **3. Key Legislative Discussions**
The committee reviewed several bills related to transportation and vehicle safety:

- **HB 54 (Antique Vehicle Inspections)**: This bill proposes changes to inspection requirements for antique vehicles, including moving the inspection month from April to May and introducing a 5,000-mile exemption over two years. Supporters argued that antique vehicles are often well-maintained and driven minimally, making frequent inspections unnecessary. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association, raised safety and enforcement concerns.

- **HB 132 (Tire Disclosure for Trailers)**: This bill would require trailer dealers to disclose the age and manufacture date of tires before sale to prevent the sale of trailers with dangerously old tires. Proponents cited safety concerns, while opponents, including the RV industry, argued that tire age alone does not determine safety and that the bill could create unnecessary paperwork and liability issues.

- **HB 153 (Pedestrian Signal Laws)**: This bill aims to update New Hampshire’s pedestrian signal laws to align with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and allow pedestrians to cross safely without waiting for a "walk" signal, provided they do not interfere with traffic. The bill seeks to prioritize pedestrian safety and reduce car-centric policies.

- **HB 260 (Prohibiting Animals on Drivers’ Laps)**: Introduced by Representative Jennifer Rhodes, this bill would prohibit drivers from having animals on their laps while operating a vehicle. Inspired by a near-accident involving a distracted driver with dogs on his lap, the bill aims to address a gap in current laws regarding distracted driving. Mixed reactions were noted, with some questioning its necessity and others supporting it as a safety measure.

### **4. Emerging Transportation Issues**
The committee also addressed emerging challenges and future priorities:

- **Electric Vehicle Infrastructure**: Representative Schultz shared her experience trying to install an EV charger in her rental complex, highlighting the lack of infrastructure for renters. HB 111 proposes a study committee to develop best practices for EV charging in residential rental properties. Concerns were raised about costs and potential mandates on landlords, but supporters emphasized the need to prepare for increasing EV adoption.

- **Distracted Driving**: Law enforcement officials discussed the broader issue of distracted driving, noting that current laws primarily address cell phone use. Other distractions, such as pets, eating, or drinking, are only enforceable if they lead to negligent driving. Suggestions were made for a broader distracted driving law to address these issues more effectively.

### **5. Marine Patrol and Boating Safety**
The Marine Patrol’s responsibilities were outlined, including enforcing boating laws, maintaining navigational aids, and conducting commercial vessel inspections. The Mooring section manages permits for boat moorings on eight lakes, ensuring they do not create navigational hazards or visual clutter. The state issues approximately 8,000 boater certificates annually, and there are about 5,000 moorings in the state, with 2,500 applications processed each year.

### **6. Turnpike System and Public Transit**
The turnpike system, self-funded through tolls, generated $123 million in revenue in FY 2022. The DOT also works with 11 local transit providers to improve public transit services, particularly for elderly and disabled individuals, through mobility managers and on-demand services.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the DOT’s efforts to maintain and improve New Hampshire’s transportation infrastructure while addressing funding challenges, workforce shortages, and evolving transportation needs. The committee reviewed several bills aimed at improving vehicle safety, pedestrian safety, and EV infrastructure, reflecting a mix of support and concern from various stakeholders. Collaboration between state agencies, industry leaders, and lawmakers was emphasized as essential to addressing these complex issues effectively.
