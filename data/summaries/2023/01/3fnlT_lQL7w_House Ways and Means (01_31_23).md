**Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Ways and Means (01/31/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 31, 2023, focused on several key legislative bills, primarily **House Bill 569**, **House Bill 486**, **House Bill 297**, and **House Bill 450**. These bills address a range of issues, including property tax reform, toll enforcement, dedicated funds, and business tax policy. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **House Bill 569: Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) and Tax Relief Programs**
1. **Overview**:
   - HB 569 builds on **HB 504** from the previous session and aims to reform the **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)** and expand **low and moderate income homeowner tax relief**.
   - It proposes a **study committee** to explore extending tax relief to **renters**.

2. **SWEPT Reform**:
   - The bill does not change the **tax rate** but requires all collected SWEPT funds to be remitted to the state, except for a **3% holdback** by municipalities for collection costs.
   - Currently, municipalities retain **excess SWEPT funds**, which some argue creates a **disproportionate tax burden** and raises **constitutional concerns** (e.g., Rand v. State of New Hampshire).
   - The reform aims to address legal challenges and ensure fairness in education funding.

3. **Taxpayer Relief Program**:
   - The bill expands the **low and moderate income homeowner tax relief program**, making it more generous by including **local education taxes** in the calculation of eligible refunds.
   - Refunds are based on a **sliding scale**, with low-income taxpayers receiving up to **100% relief**.
   - The program has faced challenges due to outdated income thresholds, complex application processes, and low incentives.

4. **Study Committee**:
   - A study committee is proposed to explore extending tax relief to **renters** and other potential improvements to the tax relief system.

5. **Fiscal Concerns**:
   - The bill includes a **$30 million cap** on payouts, which could lead to proportional reductions if applications exceed the cap.
   - There are logistical challenges in collecting and distributing funds, as municipalities currently handle property tax collection.

### **House Bill 486: Toll Enforcement and Reciprocity Agreements**
1. **Purpose**:
   - HB 486 seeks to prevent New Hampshire from suspending vehicle registrations for residents who owe tolls in other states.

2. **Current System Issues**:
   - Residents are unable to register their vehicles if they owe tolls in other states, even if they are unaware of the violations.
   - Resolving toll issues often requires significant time and effort, including traveling to other states and dealing with long wait times.
   - Reliance on the U.S. Postal Service for notifications is unreliable, leading to missed deadlines and additional fees.

3. **Arguments for the Bill**:
   - The bill aims to protect New Hampshire residents from disproportionate penalties, such as losing their ability to register vehicles, which can impact their ability to work and transport their families.
   - Sponsors argue that New Hampshire should not act as a toll collection agency for other states.

4. **Concerns and Counterarguments**:
   - Some representatives raised concerns about the potential unintended consequences, such as other states refusing to assist New Hampshire in collecting tolls from their residents.
   - Questions were raised about whether the bill should also address tolls owed within New Hampshire, not just those from other states.

5. **Reciprocity Agreements**:
   - The bill challenges the reciprocity agreements between states that allow toll violations in one state to affect vehicle registrations in another.
   - Representatives debated whether the penalties for unpaid tolls (e.g., $250 fines) are proportional to the offense.

6. **Fiscal Impact**:
   - The fiscal note indicates that the bill could have a revenue impact, but the exact number of affected vehicles is unclear.

### **House Bill 297: Dedicated Funds**
1. **Purpose**:
   - HB 297 addresses **dedicated funds** in the state, which are funds set aside for specific purposes and funded through fees, fines, or donations.

2. **Committee Role**:
   - The committee reviews these funds every five years, ensuring they are used appropriately. A spreadsheet is created annually to track these funds.

3. **Exemptions**:
   - Certain funds, like those for the **Lottery Commission**, **Liquor Commission**, and **University System**, are exempt from reporting requirements due to separate audits.

4. **Repeals**:
   - The bill repeals unused or redundant funds, such as a scholarship fund for children of deceased firefighters and police officers, which was already covered by the university system.

5. **Seabrook Fund**:
   - The **Seabrook decommissioning fund** is excluded from review due to its critical purpose and the significant costs associated with decommissioning the nuclear plant.

### **House Bill 450: Net Operating Loss (NOL) Deduction**
1. **Purpose**:
   - HB 450 seeks to remove the **80% cap** on the **Net Operating Loss (NOL) deduction** for businesses under the **Business Profits Tax (BPT)**.

2. **Background**:
   - Historically, businesses could deduct 100% of their NOLs to offset profits. However, in 2022, the legislature capped the deduction at 80% of taxable income, aligning with federal changes from the **2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act**.

3. **Impact on Businesses**:
   - The cap forces businesses to pay taxes even if they are not yet profitable over multiple years, which disproportionately affects **startups** and **cyclical industries**.

4. **Fiscal Note**:
   - The fiscal impact of removing the cap is uncertain, but it is primarily a **timing issue** rather than a permanent loss of revenue.

5. **Comparison to Other States**:
   - Many states have adopted the federal 80% cap, but some have decoupled from it. New Hampshire also has a **10-year carryforward limit** and a **$10 million cap** on NOLs, which are stricter than federal rules.

### **Key Takeaways**:
- **HB 569** focuses on reforming the **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)** and expanding **low and moderate income homeowner tax relief**, with a proposed study committee to explore extending relief to renters.
- **HB 486** addresses fairness and proportionality in toll enforcement, aiming to protect New Hampshire residents from disproportionate penalties for unpaid tolls in other states.
- **HB 297** streamlines the stateâ€™s dedicated funds, repealing unused or redundant funds and exempting certain entities from reporting requirements.
- **HB 450** supports businesses, especially startups and cyclical industries, by removing the 80% cap on NOL deductions, allowing them to fully offset losses against future profits.

The committee plans to hold a work session for further discussion on these bills.
