**Comprehensive Summary of New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting - Executive Departments and Administration Committee (01/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 19, 2023, focused on several bills under the Executive Departments and Administration Committee, addressing issues ranging from professional licensing to public meeting transparency and occupational therapy regulations. Here’s a detailed overview of the key discussions:

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **HB 266: Remote and Hybrid Meeting Rules**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Carol McGuire  
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies rules for remote and hybrid meetings without authorizing them. Ensures proper public notification and participation if such meetings are held.  
   - **Context**: Hybrid meetings are currently allowed if a physical quorum is present, but fully remote meetings are not authorized. The bill formalizes practices used during emergency rules in 2020-2021.  
   - **Outcome**: Discussion highlighted the need for clear guidelines, with no immediate action taken.

2. **HB 337: Transparency in Public Meetings**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Gary Merchant  
   - **Purpose**: Requires the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to provide 14 days' notice for public meetings and make relevant documents available seven days in advance.  
   - **Amendment**: A drafting error was identified, and Merchant proposed an amendment to correct it.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review.

3. **HB 109: Occupational Therapy Practice Act Update**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Carol McGuire  
   - **Purpose**: Updates the Occupational Therapy Practice Act, which hasn’t been revised in 22 years. Key changes include allowing occupational therapists to provide services without a referral (subject to regulatory and payer requirements) and updating terminology to align with national standards.  
   - **OPLC Suggestion**: Adding exemption language to clarify that other professions (e.g., recreational therapists) are not required to be licensed under this act.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was discussed but not finalized.

4. **HB 258: Animal Chiropractic Care Regulation**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Diane Kelly  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes an amendment to remove animal chiropractic care from the oversight of the New Hampshire Veterinary Board, allowing animal chiropractors to practice without requiring a referral from a veterinarian.  
   - **Rationale**: Aims to make animal chiropractic care more accessible and affordable for pet owners while addressing concerns about the current regulatory environment.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review.

5. **HB 409: Licensing for Out-of-State Beauty Professionals**  
   - **Purpose**: Streamlines the process for out-of-state licensed beauty professionals (barbers, cosmetologists, estheticians) to work in New Hampshire by recognizing their valid out-of-state licenses without additional requirements.  
   - **Current Issues**: New Hampshire’s licensing requirements (e.g., 1,500 hours for cosmetologists) are higher than neighboring states (e.g., 1,000 hours in Massachusetts and Vermont), creating barriers for professionals moving to the state.  
   - **Proposed Changes**:  
     - Removes the "substantially equivalent to or higher than" language in current law.  
     - Allows professionals with valid out-of-state licenses to work in New Hampshire without additional training or testing.  
   - **Arguments in Favor**:  
     - Addresses labor shortages in the beauty industry.  
     - Reduces bureaucratic hurdles, making New Hampshire more attractive to skilled professionals.  
     - Supports economic growth and worker mobility, particularly for low- to medium-income earners.  
   - **Concerns**:  
     - Potential risks of accepting licenses from states with lower standards.  
     - Clarification needed on whether the bill applies to territories like Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia.  
     - Questions about reciprocity with other states.  
   - **Expert Testimony**: Organizations like the Institute for Justice emphasized the benefits of reducing licensing barriers, citing research that shows licensing restricts worker mobility without necessarily improving quality or safety.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further discussion, with representatives seeking additional data on out-of-state licensure numbers and reciprocity agreements.

### **Public Testimonies and General Themes**  
- **Transparency and Public Access**: Several bills, including HB 266 and HB 337, emphasized the importance of transparency and public participation in government processes.  
- **Regulatory Updates**: Bills like HB 109 and HB 258 highlighted the need to modernize outdated regulations to reflect current practices and improve accessibility to services.  
- **Economic and Workforce Impact**: HB 409 and related discussions underscored the economic benefits of reducing licensing barriers, addressing labor shortages, and supporting worker mobility.  

### **Next Steps**  
Several bills, including HB 337, HB 258, and HB 409, were referred to subcommittees for further review and potential amendments. The committee will continue discussions to balance regulatory efficiency with maintaining professional standards and consumer protections.  

Overall, the meeting focused on modernizing regulations, improving transparency, and addressing workforce challenges, reflecting a commitment to fostering economic growth and public access in New Hampshire.
