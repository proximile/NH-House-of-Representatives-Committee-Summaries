The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on January 25, 2023, to discuss a range of bills addressing critical issues, including human trafficking, early childhood education, fire academy instructor shortages, and professional licensing reforms. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Human Trafficking and Massage Establishment Regulation (HB 341)**  
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 341**, which aims to regulate massage establishments to combat human trafficking, particularly in illicit massage businesses. Key points included:  
1. **Human Trafficking Overview**: Human trafficking involves force, fraud, or coercion to exploit individuals for labor or commercial sex acts. Victims in illicit massage businesses are often foreign nationals or newly naturalized U.S. citizens with limited English skills, making them vulnerable to exploitation.  
2. **Current Legal Gaps**: Existing laws, such as those against human trafficking (RSA 633:7) and prostitution (RSA 645:2), are insufficient for holding traffickers accountable. Prosecuting victims for prostitution is counterproductive, and penalties for facilitating prostitution are only misdemeanors.  
3. **Proposed Solutions**: HB 341 would establish **shop licensure** for massage businesses, enabling proactive inspections and regulation. This would help identify and shut down illicit operations while protecting legitimate massage therapists. The bill emphasizes a victim-centered approach, focusing on holding traffickers accountable and connecting victims with resources.  
4. **Support and Opposition**: Law enforcement, task force members, and advocacy groups testified in favor of the bill, citing the prevalence of illicit massage businesses in New Hampshire. Some representatives questioned the necessity of the bill, suggesting better enforcement of existing laws, while others raised concerns about overregulating legitimate businesses. The bill was sent to the licensing subcommittee for further review.

### **Fire Academy Instructor Shortages (HB 183)**  
The committee addressed **House Bill 183**, which seeks to tackle recruitment and retention challenges at the Fire Academy. Key points included:  
1. **Instructor Shortages**: The Fire Academy struggles to fill instructor positions, particularly as many instructors are retirees limited by a 1,600-hour annual cap on part-time work.  
2. **Proposed Solutions**: The committee considered exempting Fire Academy hours from the part-time limit or implementing a **sunset clause** to test the policy’s effectiveness over 3-5 years. Concerns were raised about the broader impact on the retirement system and the potential for other groups to seek similar exemptions.  
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Some members suggested increasing full-time instructor positions as a more sustainable solution. The committee decided to revisit the issue the following week to finalize their recommendation.

### **Professional Licensing and Funding (HB 445)**  
The committee discussed **House Bill 445**, which proposes transitioning the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) dedicated fund from a lapsing to a non-lapsing fund to ensure consistent funding for operations, including investigations and technology upgrades. Key points included:  
1. **Funding Challenges**: OPLC faces inconsistent revenue streams due to the timing of licensing renewals, leading to significant amounts of licensee dollars being returned to the general fund.  
2. **Concerns**: Some representatives raised concerns about potential misuse of funds and suggested capping the fund at $5 million to prevent excessive accumulation. The bill passed with a 15-1 vote in the executive session.

### **Early Childhood Education and Universal Pre-K (HB 105 and HB 620)**  
The committee explored two bills related to early childhood education:  
1. **House Bill 105**: This bill proposes creating a Department of Early Childhood Education and a three-year pilot program for high-quality, community-based pre-K education for three- and four-year-olds. Advocates highlighted the long-term benefits of early education, including improved academic outcomes and economic gains. Concerns were raised about the cost (estimated at $6-10 million) and the effectiveness of a three-year pilot.  
2. **House Bill 620**: This bill also proposes a Department of Early Childhood Education and a pilot program for universal pre-K. Discussions focused on funding mechanisms, state vs. local control, and the potential for compulsory education. Manchester’s existing pre-K program was cited as an example, though it lacks the resources for universal expansion.  

The committee voted to retain HB 105 for further work and discussed assembling a task force to study the feasibility and costs of early childhood education in New Hampshire.

### **Additional Discussions**  
1. **Physician Assistants (PAs)**: Concerns were raised about the exclusion of PAs from certain provisions in HB 105, prompting suggestions for amendments to include them.  
2. **Medical Aesthetics Regulation**: Testimony highlighted the need for stricter oversight in the medical aesthetics industry to protect consumers from unregulated practices.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
