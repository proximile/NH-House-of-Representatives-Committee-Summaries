The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 20, 2023, primarily focused on the review and approval of various administrative rules across multiple departments and boards. Here are the key points:

1. **Administrative Rules Review**: The committee addressed several administrative rules, including those related to radiation safety, pharmaceutical drug collection and disposal, education, insurance, and professional licensing.
   
2. **Radiation Safety Proposals**: Two radiation safety proposals (2022-99 and 2022-100) were discussed, which deal with licensing and safety requirements. The committee decided to postpone these proposals to allow for revised fiscal impact statements.

4. **Board of Education**: The committee reviewed a conditional approval request for the Board of Education, focusing on the clarity of criteria for evaluating innovation schools. The department agreed to remove the phrase "improving at a sufficient rate" for better clarity.

5. **Insurance Department**: The insurance department addressed issues with the use of "may" versus "shall" in their rules, agreeing to change "may" to "shall" for consistency. They also discussed the process for determining penalties and agreed to include references to their adjudicative process.

6. **Professional Licensing**: The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) discussed expired rules and fees, noting efforts to refund fees collected under expired rules and to establish internal controls to prevent future issues.

7. **Interim Rules for Court Reporters and Medical Imaging**: Interim rules were approved for court reporters and medical imaging, addressing the transition of boards to advisory roles under OPLC. Issues with statutory conflicts and retention policies were noted for future resolution.

8. **Meeting Logistics**: Due to weather conditions, an orientation meeting was canceled, and members were provided with orientation packets. The next meeting was scheduled for February 20th.

Overall, the meeting focused on clarifying and approving various administrative rules, addressing statutory conflicts, and ensuring proper procedures for rulemaking and enforcement.
