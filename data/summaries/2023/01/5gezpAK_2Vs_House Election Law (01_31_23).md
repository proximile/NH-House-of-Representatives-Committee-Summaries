**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Laws (01/31/23):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on January 31, 2023, to discuss several bills and issues related to election laws, focusing on election integrity, transparency, security, and voter confidence. The discussions spanned a wide range of topics, including chain of custody for ballots, absentee ballot security, campaign finance reform, forensic audits, provisional ballots, and voter education. Hereâ€™s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **Election Security and Transparency**
1. **Chain of Custody and Absentee Ballot Concerns**:
   - Participants raised concerns about the lack of secure storage and tracking for absentee ballots, particularly at printing companies. They emphasized the need for better reconciliation processes, such as adding line items to moderator worksheets to track photocopied and absentee ballots.
   - Proposals included certifying absentee ballots alongside general election ballots and implementing advanced security measures like DNA marking or invisible inks to prevent counterfeiting. However, concerns were raised about the cost and practicality of such measures.

2. **Ballot Technology and Business Controls**:
   - **House Bill 482 (HB 482)** aimed to strengthen election integrity by upgrading ballot technology (e.g., watermarks, magnetic inks) and tightening business controls. It also mandated strict tracking of absentee ballots and required proof of identity and residency for absentee ballot applications.
   - Testifiers highlighted gaps in ballot tracking and storage, emphasizing the need for third-party audits and secure ballot handling.

---

### **Campaign Finance Reform**
- **House Bill 324 (HB 324)** proposed a system to reduce out-of-state influence in elections for governor and executive council by providing registered voters with four $25 certificates to allocate to candidates. Candidates would need to demonstrate grassroots support through small donations.
- Critics noted that the bill did not entirely eliminate out-of-state influence and raised concerns about the cost and administrative burden. Supporters argued it would empower ordinary citizens to run viable campaigns without relying on large donors.

---

### **Forensic Audit and Voter Confidence**
- **House Bill 599 (HB 599)** proposed a forensic audit of the November 2022 elections to address concerns about voter confidence and election integrity. The audit would sample 15 towns with targeted races and use an impartial third party to identify gaps and vulnerabilities.
- Advocates cited discrepancies in voter turnout data, machine performance irregularities, and concerns about absentee ballots and voter rolls. Opponents questioned the necessity and cost of the audit, arguing that existing processes were sufficient.
- Examples from the 2020 election in Windham highlighted significant discrepancies, including mismatched voter and ballot counts, which underscored the need for greater oversight.

---

### **Provisional Ballots and Voter Access**
- **House Bill 502 (HB 502)** sought to repeal the provisional ballot system established by SB 418, which was criticized for complicating the voting process, particularly for same-day registrants and military voters overseas. Supporters argued that SB 418 created confusion and potential disenfranchisement, while opponents emphasized the need for ballot secrecy and compliance with federal law.

---

### **Voter Education and Civic Engagement**
- **House Bill 395 (HB 395)** proposed adding explanations of constitutional amendments to the ballot to improve voter understanding. Concerns were raised about ballot length and clarity, with suggestions for the Secretary of State to draft neutral explanations.
- **House Bill 259 (HB 259)** explored making poll work a civic duty, similar to jury duty, to increase voter confidence and engagement. While the Secretary of State supported the idea, he recommended it be voluntary rather than mandatory.

---

### **Challenges and Opposition**
- The Municipal Association opposed several bills due to the high costs and lack of funding for implementing proposed security measures, such as video surveillance for ballot storage.
- The Secretary of State acknowledged the need for improvements but opposed a broad audit of the 2022 election, citing resource intensity and cost. He highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance voter confidence, including post-election audits, poll worker training, and new ballot-counting technology.

---

### **Committee Actions**
- The committee moved into executive sessions to discuss and vote on several bills, including HB 324 and HB 508. Both bills resulted in tied votes (10-10), meaning they will proceed to the House calendar with no recommendation. 
- Discussions revealed bipartisan concerns about election integrity and the practical challenges of implementing reforms.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of improving election security, transparency, and voter confidence while balancing the financial and logistical challenges of implementing new measures. Key themes included the need for better ballot tracking, reducing out-of-state influence in campaign finance, addressing voter confidence through audits, simplifying the voting process, and enhancing voter education. The discussions highlighted the complexity of election reform and the ongoing efforts to ensure fair and secure elections in New Hampshire.
