### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (01/31/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on January 31, 2023, provided an in-depth examination of the state’s education funding mechanisms, focusing on both traditional district schools and charter schools, as well as Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. The discussions covered funding formulas, state and federal contributions, grant programs, and challenges in ensuring equitable and adequate funding for all students.

#### **1. Funding Mechanisms for Charter and District Schools**

The meeting began with a detailed discussion of the funding formulas for **charter schools** and **district schools**, both of which rely on **Average Daily Membership (ADM)** to calculate base adequacy aid. Key points included:

- **Charter School Funding**: Charter schools receive funding based on ADM, with the base adequacy amount set at $3,786.66 per student in fiscal year 2022. Additional funds are allocated based on student demographics, including eligibility for free and reduced-price meals (F&R), special education (SPED) services, and English Language Learner (ELL) status. Charter schools also benefit from federal **Charter School Program (CSP) grants**, which provide $46 million over the grant’s lifespan to support startup and expansion efforts.

- **District School Funding**: District schools use a similar ADM-based formula to calculate base adequacy aid and additional funds for F&R, SPED, and ELL students. The state ensures constitutional funding standards are met through **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)** and adequacy aid. In fiscal year 2022, SWEPT raised $363 million at a rate of $1.83 per thousand dollars of property value, though a one-time tax cut reduced this to $1.23 per thousand in fiscal year 2023, decreasing revenue to $263 million.

- **Federal Funding**: Federal COVID-19 stimulus funds significantly increased the federal share of school funding, rising from 4.8% in 2020 to 8.9% in fiscal year 2022.

#### **2. Special Programs and Grants**

The meeting also addressed several state-funded programs aimed at supporting education:

- **Lease Aid Program**: Provides grants to charter schools to cover 30% of annual lease payments, up to $50,000. The program, funded from the general fund, was increased from a $30,000 cap in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.

- **Safe Grants Program**: Funds school security projects, such as access control and surveillance systems, with $3.9 million in state funds and $10 million in federal ARPA funds. Grants are capped at $100,000 per school, with over 1,000 applications received.

- **Special Education Aid**: Reimburses districts for high-cost SPED services, with 80% of costs exceeding 3.5 times the estimated cost per pupil and 100% for costs exceeding 10 times the cap. The state has prorated reimbursements almost every year since 2008, except for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.

- **Early Intervention Programs**: Emphasis was placed on early intervention initiatives like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and targeted reading programs to reduce the need for long-term SPED services.

#### **3. Donor Towns and State Funding Adjustments**

The discussion highlighted the concept of **donor towns**, where municipalities raise more through the statewide property tax (SWEPT) than the cost of an adequate education. While excess funds were historically sent to the state, this policy was abolished a decade ago, and municipalities now retain all funds raised.

Key funding adjustments and grants include:

- **Relief Aid**: Additional grants based on F&R student percentages, with higher poverty rates receiving more aid.
- **Extraordinary Needs Grant**: Introduced in fiscal year 2023, this grant considers property value and F&R student counts.
- **Stabilization Grant**: Ensures districts do not receive less funding than they did in 2011, though there have been efforts to phase it out.
- **Swept Hold Harmless Grant**: Introduced in fiscal year 2023 to offset the SWEPT tax cut, ensuring districts did not lose funding.

Challenges with F&R data accuracy were noted, as many families did not fill out applications during the pandemic. Proposals to use Medicaid data for direct certification of F&R students are being considered.

#### **4. Career and Technical Education (CTE) Programs**

Dr. Jeff Beard, the state director for CTE, provided an overview of CTE programs, which include 30 regional centers and programs at seven community colleges. Key points included:

- **Funding Sources**: CTE programs are funded through federal Perkins grants ($6 million annually), state funds, and local contributions. Perkins funding supports equipment, professional development, and work-based learning.
- **Tuition and Transportation**: The state provides $9 million annually for tuition and transportation (TNT) for CTE students, reimbursing sending districts for transportation costs.
- **Accessibility and Outreach**: Efforts include translated materials and targeted social media ads to recruit students from diverse backgrounds.
- **Renovation and Construction**: The state covers up to 75% of renovation costs, with local districts responsible for the remaining 25%.
- **CTE After Dark**: A pilot program offering CTE courses to adult learners and high school students outside traditional hours.

Challenges include maintaining funding levels, addressing rising construction costs, and ensuring a steady pipeline of CTE teachers.

#### **5. Tax Rates and Future Discussions**

The meeting briefly touched on reviewing tax rates across towns, with a document available for comparison. Due to the complexity of the information, the committee deferred further discussion on a new topic to allow members time to digest the material. The session concluded with appreciation for the department representatives’ expertise and plans to reconvene the next day.

### **Key Takeaways**

The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s education funding system, highlighting the interplay between state, local, and federal funds. Key challenges include ensuring equitable funding for all districts, addressing declining enrollment and F&R data accuracy, and supporting innovative programs like CTE. The discussions emphasized the need for continued collaboration and strategic planning to meet the diverse needs of New Hampshire’s students.
