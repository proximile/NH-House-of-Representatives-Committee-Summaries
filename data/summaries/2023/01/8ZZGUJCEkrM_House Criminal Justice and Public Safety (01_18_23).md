**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (01/18/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 18, 2023, to discuss several key bills addressing public safety, harm reduction, and historical justice. The meeting featured detailed discussions on four primary pieces of legislation, each targeting distinct but interrelated issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the proceedings:

### **HB 107: Restrictions on Registered Sex Offenders**
The committee debated **HB 107**, a bill aimed at preventing registered sex offenders from holding positions that involve hiring, managing, or supervising minors. The bill seeks to close a loophole in existing law that allows offenders to work in roles with direct contact with minors, such as in landscaping, carnival ride operations, or supervisory roles.

- **Purpose**: The bill prioritizes child safety by restricting offenders from positions of authority over minors, while also protecting offenders from situations that could lead to reoffending.
- **Support**: The bill has bipartisan support and has passed the House twice before but stalled in the Senate. Proponents argue it aligns with existing child protection laws, such as background checks for school employees.
- **Concerns**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Department of Corrections (DOC) and State Police, warn that the bill’s language is too vague. Terms like "direct services to minors" could unintentionally restrict employment opportunities in industries like retail or food service, hindering offenders’ rehabilitation and reintegration.
- **Suggestions**: The DOC and State Police recommend refining the bill’s language to specify prohibited roles, such as school bus drivers or jobs at businesses primarily serving minors (e.g., arcades or trampoline parks).
- **Key Issues**: The bill raises questions about recidivism rates, the duration of registry requirements, and the lack of clarity in defining criminal background checks. The committee was urged to balance child safety with the need to support offenders’ successful reintegration into society.

### **HB 287: Legalizing Fentanyl Test Strips**
The committee discussed **HB 287**, which aims to remove testing and analyzing equipment, such as fentanyl test strips, from the definition of drug paraphernalia under the state’s Controlled Drug Act.

- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to eliminate legal barriers to the distribution and use of fentanyl test strips, which help users detect fentanyl contamination in illicit drugs, thereby reducing overdose deaths.
- **Harm Reduction**: Advocates, healthcare professionals, and lawmakers emphasized that these tools save lives by enabling safer drug use practices, such as reducing dosage or having naloxone on hand. They do not encourage drug use but provide critical harm reduction.
- **Current Ambiguity**: Under existing law, fentanyl test strips are classified as drug paraphernalia, creating legal risks for individuals and organizations distributing or possessing them. This ambiguity hinders their widespread adoption.
- **Broader Context**: Speakers highlighted the success of other harm reduction strategies, such as naloxone distribution, in reducing overdose deaths. They noted that 24 states, including neighboring Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts, have already legalized fentanyl test strips.
- **Personal Testimonies**: Individuals shared personal stories of loss and the urgent need for accessible drug-testing tools, reinforcing the bill’s importance.
- **Related Legislation**: The committee was also introduced to **HB 470**, a more comprehensive bill addressing drug checking and harm reduction. Some suggested HB 287 could serve as an immediate solution while HB 470 is further developed.
- **Support**: Organizations like the ACLU of New Hampshire and New Futures strongly supported the bill, citing evidence-based research and its alignment with public health goals.

### **HB 89: Posthumous Exonerations and Annulments**
The committee considered **HB 89**, which seeks to grant posthumous exonerations and annulments for individuals who were wrongfully convicted, addressing historical injustices.

- **Purpose**: The bill provides a mechanism for exoneration since the governor can only pardon living individuals. It aims to correct past wrongs and acknowledge historical errors.
- **Key Cases**:
  - **Eunice Goodicol**: Convicted of witchcraft in the 1650s based on societal hysteria, she was imprisoned for 25 years.
  - **Willard Uphaus**: A victim of the Red Scare in the 1950s, Uphaus was jailed for refusing to reveal the guest list of a spiritual organization.
- **Discussion**: Representative David Muse introduced the bill, emphasizing its importance in addressing historical injustices. The committee explored the legal authority and societal implications of such actions.

### **HB 97: Enhanced Penalties for Privacy Violations**
The committee reviewed **HB 97**, which aims to establish additional penalties for repeat offenders of privacy violations, particularly those involving non-consensual videoing or observation for sexual arousal or gratification.

- **Purpose**: The bill targets repeat offenders to prevent escalation to more serious crimes like sexual assault.
- **Testimony**:
  - Representative Jennifer Rhodes introduced the bill, highlighting its bipartisan nature and the need to address inconsistencies in the law.
  - Pamela Kilgore from the NH Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence supported the bill, noting its alignment with laws addressing sexual violence.
  - Dr. Scott Hampton, a specialist in domestic and sexual violence, emphasized the deterrent effect of the bill and the importance of addressing voyeurism before it escalates.
- **Discussion**: The committee explored the bill’s potential impact, including its ability to deter repeat offenders and prevent more severe crimes.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on balancing public safety with rehabilitation, harm reduction, and historical justice. Key themes included the need for precise legislative language, the importance of evidence-based harm reduction tools, and the correction of historical injustices. The committee was urged to refine and advance these bills to address pressing issues while minimizing unintended consequences.
