### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services (01/26/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 26, 2023, to discuss several key bills related to labor, industrial, and rehabilitative services. The meeting focused on workplace safety, collective bargaining, unemployment benefits, and youth employment regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **House Bill 232: OSHA Standards for Public Sector Employees**
**Purpose**: HB 232 aims to align public sector safety standards with OSHA’s **1910 standards**, which currently apply only to private sector workers. This would ensure state and municipal employees receive the same comprehensive safety protections.

**Key Points**:
- **Current Standards**: Public employees follow simplified state safety rules (RSA 277 and Lab 1400), which are less comprehensive than OSHA standards, leaving gaps in protections.
- **Support**: 
  - **Representative Brian Sullivan**, the prime sponsor, emphasized the need for consistent safety standards and highlighted gaps in electrical safety.
  - **Representative Maria Perez** argued the bill would save municipalities money by preventing workplace accidents.
- **Concerns**:
  - **Margaret Burns** (NH Municipal Association) and **Joyce Pittman** (Department of Administrative Services) raised concerns about the significant costs and logistical challenges of compliance, especially without a transition period.
- **Enforcement**: The NH Department of Labor would enforce the standards, with plans to hire additional inspectors.
- **Costs**: Municipalities and state agencies anticipate significant expenses for assessments, upgrades, and hiring consultants.
- **Broader Context**: Unlike Maine and Massachusetts, New Hampshire is not pursuing a state plan to adopt OSHA standards.

### **House Bill 182: Protections for Volunteer Firefighters and EMS**
**Purpose**: HB 182 seeks to protect volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel from workplace harassment when they leave work to respond to emergencies.

**Key Points**:
- **Sponsor**: **Representative Daniel Wolf** introduced the bill to improve recruitment and retention of volunteers, who are vital to many communities.
- **Support**: 
  - **Thomas Green** (NH State Firemen’s Association) highlighted the declining number of volunteers and the need for protections.
- **Openness to Sunset Clause**: Rep. Wolf expressed willingness to include a sunset clause (e.g., 3-4 years) to evaluate the bill’s effectiveness.

### **House Bill 190: Unemployment Benefits Reform**
**Purpose**: HB 190 proposes reducing the maximum weeks of unemployment benefits from 26 to 24, with further reductions tied to the state’s unemployment rate, to incentivize workforce re-entry and strengthen the unemployment trust fund.

**Key Points**:
- **Sponsor**: **Representative Glenn Turcotte** cited Florida’s success in reducing unemployment durations and improving trust fund solvency.
- **Opposition**: **Deputy Commissioner Richard Lavers** (NH Department of Employment Security) argued that New Hampshire already has one of the lowest average durations (10 weeks) and exhaustion rates (8.6%) for unemployment benefits in the country.
- **Concerns**: Reducing benefit weeks could undersize the program, making the state more dependent on federal assistance during downturns. Seasonal workers, particularly in construction, would be disproportionately affected.
- **Human Impact**: Some members emphasized the need for compassion and policies that support workers, particularly low-wage earners.

### **House Bill 150: Collective Bargaining for Small Public Safety Units**
**Purpose**: HB 150 aims to reduce the minimum number of employees required to form a collective bargaining unit from 10 to 5, benefiting small-town fire departments and other public safety workers.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: 
  - **John McAllister** (Professional Firefighters of NH) argued the bill would improve recruitment and retention by allowing smaller groups to negotiate fair wages and working conditions.
- **Concerns**: Some questioned the financial impact on municipalities, but proponents argued the long-term benefits of improved safety and reduced workers’ compensation claims outweigh the costs.
- **Historical Context**: The 10-employee threshold, established in 1975, is seen as arbitrary and was temporarily reduced in 2008.

### **House Bill 125: Youth Employment Regulations**
**Purpose**: HB 125 seeks to clarify and correct inconsistencies in youth labor laws, particularly regarding working hours for 16- and 17-year-olds during school weeks and non-school weeks.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: The bill’s sponsor emphasized protecting teenagers’ education and well-being by restricting work hours to 35 during school weeks and 48 during vacation weeks.
- **Concerns**: The hospitality industry opposed the reintroduction of a 9 PM cutoff time for school nights, arguing it creates administrative burdens.
- **Enforcement**: The Department of Labor clarified that violations can result in civil penalties up to $2,500 per violation, though they typically work with employers to resolve issues.

2. **Collective Bargaining**: HB 150 aims to empower small public safety units, addressing recruitment and retention challenges in fire and EMS services.

4. **Youth Employment**: HB 125 focuses on protecting teenagers’ education by clarifying work hour regulations, though industry concerns about administrative burdens persist.
5. **Volunteer Protections**: HB 182 addresses the need to protect volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel from workplace harassment, supporting recruitment and retention efforts.
