The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on **January 9, 2023**, for a comprehensive discussion on the state's energy policies, regulatory frameworks, and challenges. The meeting featured presentations from the **Department of Energy (DOE)**, the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**, and the **Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA)**, as well as organizational matters for the committee. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions:

---

### **1. Department of Energy Overview and Challenges**
- **Mission and Structure**: The DOE, led by State Energy Program Manager **Griffin Roberge**, focuses on ensuring affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for New Hampshire. Its divisions include regulatory support, policy and programs, enforcement, and administration.
- **Energy Challenges**: New England faces reliability and cost issues due to the retirement of traditional energy sources, reliance on natural gas, and global market volatility. The DOE emphasized market-driven solutions and opposed policies that shift costs to ratepayers.
- **Regulatory Role**: **Tom Frantz**, Director of Regulatory Support, outlined the DOE’s role in reviewing utility rate filings, ensuring prudent investments, and advocating for public interest at the PUC.
- **Future Planning**: The DOE is exploring energy storage, market mechanisms, and federal support to address future energy needs. Streamlining the siting process for new energy projects is a priority to diversify the state’s energy portfolio.

### **2. Rising Energy Costs and Utility Regulation**
- **Electricity Rate Increases**: Default energy service rates for Eversource customers tripled from 7 cents per kWh in March 2022 to over 25 cents by January 2023, driven by wholesale market fluctuations, natural gas prices, and global events like the Ukraine-Russia war.
- **Utility Oversight**: The PUC regulates utilities like Eversource, Unitil, and Liberty, ensuring fair rates and balancing customer and shareholder interests. The OCA represents residential ratepayers in these matters.
- **Net Metering**: Small customer generators (up to 100 kW) receive full credits for exported power, while larger systems have different tariffs. Group net metering allows renewable energy facilities to share benefits with other customers.
- **Community Power Programs**: These programs aim to lower rates through competitive suppliers, though consumer education is needed to address fears of switching providers.

---

### **3. Renewable Energy and Low-Income Assistance**
- **Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)**: Enacted in 2007, the RPS requires utilities to source a percentage of energy from renewables. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) fund programs like solar and wind rebates.
- **Low-Income Programs**: Federally funded programs like the **Fuel Assistance Program (FAP)** and **Weatherization Assistance Program** provide heating aid and energy efficiency improvements. The **Low and Moderate Income (LMI) Adder** supports community solar projects benefiting low-income residents.
- **Federal Funding**: The **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law** and **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)** provide significant funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and grid resilience projects. New Hampshire is set to receive millions for these initiatives.

---

### **4. Organizational Matters and Committee Procedures**
- **Introductions**: The committee, chaired by **Representative Michael Vose**, includes 13 returning and seven new members with diverse backgrounds in energy policy, engineering, and education.
- **Procedural Guidelines**: Rules include decorum during public hearings, restrictions on electronic devices, and submission of written testimony. Subcommittees are expected to act promptly and report back to the full committee.
- **Future Meetings**: The committee will meet weekly, with presentations from the DOE, PUC, ISO New England, and other stakeholders.

---

### **5. Energy Efficiency and Consumer Advocacy**
- **Smart Meters**: The OCA advocates for the adoption of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) to provide granular data on energy usage, helping consumers optimize consumption and reduce costs.
- **Energy Efficiency Programs**: **NH Saves**, a ratepayer-funded program, aims to reduce energy consumption. However, challenges include meeting electric savings requirements for weatherization programs.
- **Legislative Priorities**: Reforms to the **Least-Cost Integrated Resource Planning (LCIRP)** statute and the facility siting process are needed to improve energy infrastructure development.

---

### **6. Regional Energy Markets and Federal Jurisdiction**
- **ISO New England**: Manages the regional electricity grid and wholesale markets. The **New England Power Pool (NEPOOL)** advises ISO New England but has significant influence, raising concerns about transparency.
- **Electricity Prices**: Prices are determined through a complex bidding system, with spikes during periods of high demand or supply shortages. The role of generators like Mystic Station in grid reliability was questioned.
- **Federal vs. State Jurisdiction**: The **Federal Power Act** governs wholesale electricity and interstate transmission, while states regulate retail electricity and generation within their borders.

---

### **7. Fuel Assistance and Emergency Programs**
- **Application Delays**: Constituents raised concerns about delays in fuel assistance applications due to resource constraints and staffing shortages. The DOE is working to address these issues.
- **Emergency Assistance**: State programs provide one-time credits for fuel and electric bills for households that do not qualify for other low-income programs.

---

### **8. Legislative Priorities and Closing Remarks**
- **Community Power Aggregation**: Community power programs may finally deliver the benefits of restructuring to residential customers, potentially lowering energy costs.
- **Transactive Energy**: Exploring retail energy trading among consumers could promote innovation and savings.
- **Closing Remarks**: The committee emphasized the importance of clear, well-written legislation and bipartisan solutions to address New Hampshire’s energy challenges.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of New Hampshire’s energy landscape, including rising costs, regulatory oversight, and the transition to renewable energy. Key priorities include improving energy affordability, leveraging federal funding, and ensuring grid reliability. The committee committed to fostering bipartisan collaboration to address these challenges and support the state’s energy future.
