**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/25/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 25, 2023, to discuss a range of education-related bills and issues, focusing on charter school funding, special education, school meal programs, and the Education Freedom Account (EFA) program. The meeting highlighted the complexities of education funding, the need for equitable resource distribution, and the importance of streamlining administrative processes to better serve students and schools.

### **Charter School Funding and House Bill 272**
The committee discussed **House Bill 272**, which proposes increasing per-pupil funding for public charter schools from $5,141 to $6,655 per pupil. Currently, charter schools receive approximately $7,400 per pupil, significantly less than traditional public schools, which average around $19,500. The bill aims to address funding gaps that have not been adjusted since 2017, raising total per-pupil funding for charter schools to approximately $9,000.

- **Support for the Bill**: Proponents, including **Representative Maureen Mooney** and charter school leaders, argued that charter schools provide valuable educational options and face financial challenges, including rising costs for utilities, salaries, and benefits. They emphasized the importance of equitable funding to compete for teachers and resources.
- **Opposition to the Bill**: Opponents, including **Megan Tuttle** of NEA-New Hampshire, argued that traditional public schools are also underfunded and that the state should address broader education funding issues before increasing charter school funding. Critics noted that traditional schools still bear costs for special education and transportation even when students attend charter schools.

### **Special Education Funding and House Bill 577**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 577**, which seeks to reduce the liability threshold for school districts from 3.5 times to 1.5 times the state average cost for special education funding. This change would make more students eligible for state aid, easing the financial burden on districts, especially small ones. The bill also includes an additional $250,000 for special education funding in communities with fewer than 1,000 residents.

- **Key Points**: Testimony highlighted the growing costs of special education and the strain it places on small districts. The bill aims to address these challenges by lowering the threshold for state aid, though concerns were raised about the fiscal impact and the need for additional appropriations to fully support the change.

### **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) and House Bill 626**
The committee discussed **House Bill 626**, which proposes transferring the administration of the EFA program from a private contractor to the Department of Education. The EFA program, established in the current state budget, allows taxpayer funds to be used for private or home school tuition.

- **Accountability and Transparency**: Proponents argued that the Department of Education could increase accountability and transparency, potentially saving taxpayer money and improving efficiency. Critics expressed concerns about the lack of detailed reporting on how EFA funds are spent and the potential risks of government oversight.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal impact of both special education funding and the EFA program was a recurring theme, with concerns about unfunded mandates and the strain on local school budgets.

### **School Meal Programs and House Bill 601**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 601**, which proposes using Medicaid data for direct certification of students eligible for free and reduced-price school meals. The bill aims to streamline the process of identifying eligible students, reducing administrative burdens on schools and increasing access to meals for low-income students.

- **Benefits**: The bill could significantly increase the number of students identified as eligible for free and reduced meals, potentially adding 9,000 to 18,000 students to the program. This would result in millions of additional federal dollars for schools, reducing the burden on local taxpayers.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Representatives raised concerns about families being automatically enrolled without consent, with options for local or state-level opt-outs being discussed.

### **Extraordinary Needs Grants and House Bill 638**
The committee discussed **House Bill 638**, which addresses extraordinary needs grants for schools. The bill proposes setting a minimum threshold of $50,000 for schools to submit accountability plans, reducing the number of schools required to submit plans from 84 to 35. This change would alleviate unnecessary administrative work for schools receiving smaller grants while maintaining accountability for larger grants.

### **Relief Aid and House Bill 435**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 435**, which aims to adjust relief aid grant rates for school funding and eliminate the proration clause that currently caps the statewide total at $17.5 million. The bill introduces a biennial cost adjustment to account for inflation, allowing the aid to adjust based on actual free and reduced-price lunch data.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for a balanced approach to education funding, ensuring that both charter and traditional public schools have adequate resources to meet their mandates. The discussions highlighted the importance of streamlining administrative processes, increasing accountability and transparency, and addressing the financial challenges faced by schools, particularly in the areas of special education and school meal programs. The committee considered the fiscal implications of proposed changes and the need for additional appropriations to fully support these initiatives. Overall, the meeting emphasized the importance of providing diverse educational options and ensuring that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed.
