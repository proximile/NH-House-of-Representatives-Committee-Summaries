The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 4, 2023, for its first session of the year, marking the beginning of the legislative session with a series of formalities and substantive discussions. The meeting opened with traditional ceremonies, including a prayer led by Reverend Bob Stewart, the Pledge of Allegiance, and a rendition of the National Anthem performed by Lucas Nering. Following these formalities, the House addressed routine procedural matters such as leaves of absence, guest introductions, and communications, including the resignation of Representative Stacy Marie Lawton.

A significant portion of the session was dedicated to a Joint Convention with the Senate, called to order to canvass the votes for governor and executive council. Secretary of State David M. Scanlan presented the election results, confirming Christopher Sununu as governor and various executive council members. The Joint Convention adjourned after appointing a committee to review the votes, and the House session resumed.

The House paid tribute to the late Representatives Philip Straight and Henry Parkhurst with memorial remarks delivered by Representatives Notter and Rhodes, respectively. These heartfelt tributes honored their service and contributions, and the House unanimously approved a motion to include the remarks in the Permanent Journal.

The session then shifted to legislative business, beginning with the introduction of new bills and proposed amendments to House Rules. Key amendments debated included:

1. **House Rule 22 (Proxy Voting)**: Representative Wilhelm proposed allowing proxy voting for members unable to attend due to medical conditions or family illness. Supporters argued it ensured representation in a closely divided House, while opponents emphasized the importance of physical presence and the integrity of the voting process. The motion failed in a roll call vote.

2. **House Rule 31 (Remote Committee Meetings)**: Representative Ebel proposed allowing remote or hybrid committee meetings at the speaker’s discretion. Proponents highlighted the benefits for members with health or childcare challenges, while opponents stressed the importance of in-person interaction with constituents. The amendment also failed in a roll call vote.

3. **House Rule 46 (Committee Reporting)**: Representative Sweeney proposed allowing the committee chair or vice chair to make the first motion on bills reported without recommendation. Supporters argued it would streamline the process, while opponents felt it undermined the committee’s collective work. A motion to table the amendment failed, and the amendment was debated but ultimately not adopted.

Other notable amendments included changes to Rules 66, 20, 43(b), 44(a), 52, 64, and 58, with debates focusing on procedural fairness, bipartisanship, and efficiency. A significant discussion centered on an amendment to Rule 64, which sought to prohibit deadly weapons in the House chamber. Proponents argued for safety and tradition, while opponents emphasized constitutional rights and self-defense. The amendment ultimately failed. Another notable debate involved changing the term "prayer" to "invocation" in Rule 58, which also failed.

The session also included procedural motions, such as vacating the reference of House Bill 207 and printing debates in the Permanent Journal. The House adjourned early to reconvene the next day for the governor’s swearing-in ceremony.

Throughout the session, representatives emphasized the importance of fairness, bipartisanship, and adherence to tradition, while also addressing practical concerns about safety, efficiency, and procedural clarity. The meeting highlighted the House’s efforts to adapt to modern challenges while balancing tradition and efficiency in governance. The House recessed until January 5, 2023, at 11:15 am, marking the end of a productive and eventful first session of the year.
