**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (01/26/23):**

On January 26, 2023, the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened to discuss several bills aimed at addressing issues within the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS), particularly for Group 2 employees (firefighters, police officers, and corrections officers). The meeting focused on restoring fair retirement benefits, addressing recruitment and retention challenges, and mitigating the negative impacts of the 2011 changes to the retirement system. Below is a detailed summary of the key bills discussed and the outcomes of the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **House Bill 250**:
   - **Purpose**: Increase the death benefit for firefighters killed in the line of duty from 50% to 100% of their annual compensation.
   - **Testimony**: Proponents argued that it was unfair for families to receive only 50% if a firefighter dies in service, compared to 100% if they retire. The bill was supported by firefighters and retirement system representatives, with an estimated annual cost of $1.3 million.
   - **Outcome**: Referred to the Pension Subcommittee for further review.

2. **House Bill 449**:
   - **Purpose**: Restore the 2.5% annuity multiplier for the first 20 years of service for Group 2 members, with varying multipliers for additional years.
   - **Testimony**: A retired fire captain and former NHRS trustee supported the bill, highlighting the unfairness of the 2011 changes that increased retirement age, years of service, and reduced multipliers for Group 2 employees. The bill would cost $3.5 million for the state and $13.3 million for local subdivisions annually.
   - **Outcome**: Referred to the Pension Subcommittee.

3. **House Bill 525**:
   - **Purpose**: Adjust the minimum age, years of service, and annuity multipliers for Group 2 employees affected by the 2011 changes.
   - **Testimony**: Testimony emphasized the negative impact on recruitment and retention, with employees leaving for neighboring states offering better retirement benefits. The bill was deemed too similar to House Bill 436.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted to kill the bill (ITL) unanimously.

4. **House Bill 579**:
   - **Purpose**: Eliminate the 2011 transition provisions for Group 2 employees, restoring pre-2011 benefits for those hired before July 1, 2011.
   - **Testimony**: Proponents highlighted the loss of trust and the financial burden on employees, with significant costs to the state and municipalities if the bill passed.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted to kill the bill (ITL) due to its similarity to other bills under consideration.

5. **House Bill 571**:
   - **Purpose**: Provide cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to Group 2 retirees who have been retired for 10 or 20 years, with increases of 5% and 10%, respectively.
   - **Testimony**: Supporters highlighted that Group 2 retirees have seen minimal COLAs compared to inflation, with many living in financial hardship. The bill would cost $84.2 million if terminally funded.
   - **Outcome**: Referred to the Pension Subcommittee.

6. **House Bill 436**:
   - **Purpose**: Adjust retirement benefits for Group 2 members hired before 2012 but not vested by January 1, 2012, by reducing retirement age and increasing annuity multipliers.
   - **Testimony**: Proponents argued this would help retain experienced employees and address recruitment and retention crises. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, opposed the bill due to increased costs for municipalities.
   - **Outcome**: Referred to the Pension Subcommittee.

### **Key Themes and Concerns**:
- **Recruitment and Retention Crisis**: Testimonies highlighted a severe shortage of public safety employees, with many leaving for better benefits in neighboring states or private sectors.
- **Retroactive Changes**: Several speakers criticized the 2011 changes to the retirement system, which they argued were applied retroactively, violating trust and fairness.
- **Cost Concerns**: Opponents, particularly municipalities, raised concerns about the financial burden of increased benefits on local governments.
- **Morale and Trust**: Employees expressed frustration over broken promises regarding retirement benefits, which has negatively impacted morale and trust in the state.

### **Next Steps**:
All bills were referred to the Pension Subcommittee for further analysis and potential consolidation into a cohesive solution to address the recruitment and retention crisis in public safety. The committee encouraged public participation in upcoming subcommittee meetings, which are open to the public and will be scheduled for Thursday afternoon or sooner.

### **Overall Focus**:
The meeting underscored the urgent need to restore fair retirement benefits for Group 2 employees, address the recruitment and retention crisis, and rebuild trust in the state's retirement system. The committee continues to work on finding a balanced solution that considers both the needs of public safety employees and the financial implications for the state and municipalities.
