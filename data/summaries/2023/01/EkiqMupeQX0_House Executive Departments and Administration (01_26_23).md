The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 26, 2023, titled "House Executive Departments and Administration," focused on addressing critical issues within the state’s retirement system, particularly for Group 2 employees (police, firefighters, and corrections officers). The discussion centered on several bills aimed at rectifying the adverse effects of the 2011 changes to the retirement system, which have led to significant recruitment and retention challenges in public safety roles. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **Context and Concerns**
- **Impact of 2011 Changes**: The 2011 amendments to the retirement system reduced benefits for employees hired before July 1, 2011, but not yet vested. Changes included lowering annuity multipliers, increasing the retirement age, and altering service requirements. These adjustments have eroded trust in the system, exacerbated staffing shortages, and driven experienced personnel to seek employment in neighboring states with better benefits.
- **Recruitment and Retention Crisis**: Testimonies from representatives, union leaders, and affected employees highlighted severe staffing losses in key areas such as Manchester’s police department and the state prison system. The inadequacies of the retirement system have made it difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, raising safety concerns.

### **Key Bills Discussed**
1. **House Bill 436**: This bill seeks to restore pre-2011 retirement benefits for Group 2 employees hired before January 1, 2012, but not vested by that date. It proposes earlier retirement ages and higher annuity multipliers. The fiscal impact is estimated at $2.82 million for the state and $12.52 million for local subdivisions annually, with an additional $133.6 million added to the unfunded liability.
2. **House Bill 449**: This bill proposes restoring a 2.5% multiplier for the first 20 years of service for Group 2 members hired after July 1, 2011. It aims to address the disparities created by the 2011 changes and improve retirement benefits for newer hires.
3. **House Bill 525**: Similar to other bills, this proposal seeks to adjust retirement benefits for Group 2 employees. However, it was deemed inexpedient to legislate (ITL) due to its similarity to other bills under review.
4. **House Bill 579**: This bill aims to eliminate the 2011 transition provisions entirely, effectively restoring pre-2011 benefits. The fiscal impact is significant, with an estimated $226 million added to the unfunded liability. Administrative challenges, including IT reprogramming costs, were also noted.
5. **House Bill 250**: This bill proposes increasing the death benefit for firefighters killed in the line of duty from 50% to 100% of their annual earned compensation. The fiscal impact is estimated at $1.3 million, with minimal downstream effects on employer rates. The bill seeks to address fairness and support the families of fallen first responders.
6. **House Bill 571**: This bill seeks to provide a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Group 2 retirees who have been retired for 10 or 20 years. The proposed COLA would be 5% for those retired 10 years and 10% for those retired 20 years, applied to the first $50,000 of their pension. The fiscal note estimates a cost of $84.2 million, to be terminally funded from the general fund. Testimony highlighted the economic impact of retirees and the need to address the significant loss of purchasing power due to inflation.

### **Financial and Administrative Challenges**
- Mark Kavanaugh from the New Hampshire Retirement System noted that the proposed bills would significantly increase costs for the state and municipalities. For instance, House Bill 579 alone would add $226 million to the unfunded liability. Additionally, administrative challenges, including IT reprogramming costs, were highlighted as potential hurdles.

### **Subcommittee Review**
- The committee decided to send House Bills 436 and 449 to a subcommittee for further review, while House Bills 525 and 579 were deemed inexpedient to legislate (ITL) due to their similarity to the other bills. Public participation in the subcommittee meetings was encouraged.

### **Consensus and Next Steps**
- Throughout the meeting, there was a consensus on the urgent need for legislative action to improve retirement benefits for public safety workers. The ongoing recruitment and retention crisis underscores the importance of restoring trust in the retirement system to attract and retain qualified personnel. The bills were referred to the Pension Subcommittee for further analysis and discussion.

In summary, the meeting highlighted the critical need to address the flaws in the state’s retirement system to restore trust, improve retention, and ensure public safety. The proposed bills aim to rectify the adverse effects of the 2011 changes, but they come with significant financial and administrative challenges that require careful consideration.
