**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (January 27, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on January 27, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several key bills and amendments. The meeting focused on modernizing outdated statutes, clarifying professional scopes of practice, and addressing public safety, transparency, and licensing standards. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **House Bill 409: Cosmetology Licensing and Reciprocity**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses licensing requirements for cosmetologists, particularly focusing on reciprocity for individuals licensed in other states.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Public Safety Concerns**: Representatives raised alarms about the potential for fraudulent qualifications or disciplinary actions in other states to result in licensure in New Hampshire, citing a recent case in Florida involving fake nursing certifications.
  - **Reciprocity Standards**: Debate centered on whether New Hampshire should maintain "substantially equivalent" licensing standards for cosmetologists from other states, with skepticism expressed about relying on other states’ investigative processes.
  - **Definition of “Good Standing”**: The need to clearly define "good standing" in licensing rules was emphasized to prevent individuals with past disciplinary actions or failed inspections from obtaining licenses.
  - **Board of Cosmetology’s Role**: The board highlighted concerns about sanitary and hygiene standards, noting that most inspection failures relate to poor sanitary conditions.
  - **Director Courtney’s Amendment**: An amendment allowing individuals with suspended licenses in other states to obtain licenses in New Hampshire sparked concerns about maintaining professional standards.
  - **Business Owners’ Responsibility**: It was noted that business owners are responsible for enforcing hygiene and professional standards within their establishments.
- **Outcome**: The committee passed the amendment, though some members objected to the removal of the "substantially equivalent" language. The cosmetology board was scheduled to review the amendment further.

### **House Bill 109: Occupational Therapy Practice Act Update**
- **Purpose**: The bill updates the Occupational Therapy Practice Act, which had not been revised in 14–15 years, to modernize definitions and scope of practice without expanding the profession’s responsibilities.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removes outdated language requiring physician referrals for occupational therapy in schools, a process deemed unnecessary and burdensome.
- **Amendments**:
  - **Carol McGuire’s Amendment**: Adds language to include leisure, social activity, and similar services within the definition of occupational therapy.
  - **OPLC Amendment**: Clarifies that individuals licensed under other professions (e.g., recreational therapists) can continue performing similar services without needing an occupational therapy license.
- **Outcome**: Both amendments were adopted, and the bill moved forward with support from stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Occupational Therapy Association.

### **House Bill 337: Public Notice Requirements for Board Meetings**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses public notice requirements for board meetings and access to materials.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Requires public notice of meetings 14 days in advance.
  - Allows chairs to add agenda items within seven days if deemed in the public interest.
  - Exempts materials containing confidential information from public disclosure.
- **Amendment**: Proposed by OPLC to address concerns about flexibility in adding urgent agenda items and redacting sensitive information.
- **Outcome**: The amendment was adopted, and stakeholders expressed general support for the changes.

### **House Bill 258: Animal Chiropractic Services**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses the practice of animal chiropractic services and whether they fall under the jurisdiction of the veterinary board.
- **Key Issues**:
  - The veterinary board does not want to certify or discipline animal chiropractors, leaving current practitioners in a legal gray area.
  - Some practitioners have received cease-and-desist letters.
- **Proposed Amendment**: Allows individuals certified by a nationally recognized body to provide animal chiropractic services without requiring veterinary board licensure.
- **Concerns**:
  - Lack of oversight for animal chiropractors who may not have adequate training to identify health risks in animals.
  - Potential need for consumer protection measures.
- **Outcome**: The committee decided to postpone further action until the veterinary board could review the proposed language and provide feedback.

Amendments were proposed and adopted to address stakeholder concerns, with some bills postponed for further review and input from relevant boards and associations.
