**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Special Committee on Housing Meeting (01/30/2023)**

On January 30, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Special Committee on Housing convened its first meeting to address the state’s escalating housing crisis. Chaired by Representative Joe Alexander, the bipartisan committee focused on identifying solutions to the severe shortage of affordable housing, which is impacting residents, businesses, and communities across the state. The meeting highlighted the urgency of the issue and outlined key challenges, proposed solutions, and plans for stakeholder engagement.

### **Key Challenges Identified**
1. **Affordable Housing Shortage**: The lack of affordable housing is forcing young people, low-income families, and essential workers (e.g., bartenders, postal workers, and young professionals) to move out of state or live with family due to unaffordable rents and home prices. Many are outbid by out-of-state buyers or face financing hurdles due to strict FHA guidelines and state EPA laws.  
2. **Zoning and Planning Barriers**: Local zoning and planning boards were criticized for restrictive practices, such as exclusionary zoning laws that limit multi-family housing and require large lot sizes. “NIMBY” (Not In My Backyard) attitudes and personal biases of planning board members were also cited as obstacles to housing development.  
3. **Funding Complexity**: Affordable housing projects often require multiple funding sources, creating complex and time-consuming processes that hinder development.  
4. **Code Enforcement Issues**: Concerns were raised about discriminatory code enforcement, particularly against families with children.  

### **Proposed Solutions**
1. **Zoning Reform**: The committee emphasized the need to reform zoning laws to allow for higher density and more affordable housing options, such as accessory dwelling units (ADUs), tiny homes, and modular homes.  
2. **Incentives for Developers**: Members suggested providing incentives for developers to build affordable housing and exploring innovative technologies like 3D-printed homes.  
3. **Creative Housing Models**: Ideas included repurposing underutilized spaces, such as dying shopping malls, into mixed-use communities with housing, retail, and educational facilities.  
4. **Home Ownership Support**: Addressing barriers to home ownership, particularly for young people and first-time buyers, was identified as a priority.  
5. **Data-Driven Approaches**: The committee stressed the importance of gathering comprehensive data on housing trends, including the impact of migration, illegal immigration, and federal policies, to inform solutions.  

### **Stakeholder Engagement and Next Steps**
The committee plans to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including New Hampshire Housing, realtors, developers, legal assistance organizations, and other experts, to gather insights and data. A longer meeting was scheduled for February 17, 2023, to hear presentations from these stakeholders and further explore obstacles and potential solutions.  

### **Long-Term Vision**
Members underscored the importance of creating sustainable, high-quality housing solutions that address both immediate needs and long-term goals. The committee aims to develop actionable solutions and propose legislation by the next filing period, ensuring that New Hampshire remains an attractive place for residents and businesses.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of New Hampshire’s housing crisis and the need for a multifaceted approach involving zoning reform, innovative housing models, and collaboration with stakeholders. The committee’s work reflects a commitment to bipartisan solutions that will improve housing affordability, support economic growth, and enhance the quality of life for all residents.
