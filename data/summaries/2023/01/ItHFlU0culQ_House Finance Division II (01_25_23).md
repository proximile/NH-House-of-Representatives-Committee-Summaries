### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (01/25/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on January 25, 2023, addressed several critical issues related to education funding, school infrastructure, and legislative proposals. The discussions centered on three main topics: **school building aid**, **recodification of education laws (HB 468)**, and **funding for feminine hygiene products in schools (HB 129)**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. School Building Aid and Infrastructure Challenges**
The meeting extensively discussed the state’s **school building aid program**, which provides funding for school construction and renovation projects. Key points included:

- **Program Overview and History**:  
   - The program has existed since 1946 but faced a **moratorium from 2009 to 2019**, during which only one emergency project was funded.  
   - In 2013, the funding structure changed: instead of paying over the life of a bond (e.g., 20 years), the state now pays **80% upfront and 20% upon project completion**.  
   - A **$50 million annual cap** was introduced in 2013, leading to a competitive ranking system for projects based on criteria like overcrowding, ADA deficiencies, and safety.

- **Current Challenges**:  
   - The state is still paying off obligations from pre-2013 projects, which limits available funds for new projects.  
   - For the 2024-2025 biennium, **17 applications** totaling $564 million in project costs and $227 million in state aid requests have been submitted, but funding availability remains uncertain due to the cap and past obligations.  
   - Schools often exceed state square footage limits (140 sq. ft. per pupil) and include ineligible costs (e.g., swimming pools, preschool spaces), complicating funding allocations.  
   - Rising construction costs and market volatility have led to projects significantly exceeding initial estimates, emphasizing the need for sustainable funding and long-term planning.

- **Population and Enrollment Trends**:  
   - Declining student populations in many areas have led to school consolidations or smaller facilities, while some districts remain overcrowded despite fewer students.  
   - These trends impact infrastructure needs, with some schools requiring upgrades or new construction.

- **Funding Mechanisms and Proposals**:  
   - Ideas for improving the funding model included **amortizing costs over five years**, **refinancing existing bonds**, and using **ARPA funds** to support school construction.  
   - Representatives debated the **80-20 funding split**, with some arguing it saves communities money on interest.  
   - Multiple bills were discussed, including proposals to **increase funding for school building aid**, **adjust the funding formula**, and address the backlog of approved but unfunded projects.  

- **Local and State Responsibilities**:  
   - The discussion touched on the balance between state funding and local responsibility for school construction. Some argued that communities should bear more of the cost, while others stressed the importance of state support to ease the tax burden on residents.

### **2. HB 468: Recodification of Education Laws**
The committee discussed **HB 468**, which proposes recodifying the New Hampshire Department of Education’s manual, a process involving restructuring and updating the state’s education statutes. Key points included:

- **Overview and Challenges**:  
   - The education statutes span over **1,500 pages**, making recodification a monumental and time-consuming task.  
   - Past examples (e.g., the criminal code in 1967) took years to complete, raising concerns about the feasibility of completing this within two years and with a **$100,000 budget**.  

- **Process Suggestions**:  
   - Establishing a **commission or steering committee** with stakeholders, including the Department of Education, school boards, the Attorney General’s office, and practitioners.  
   - Hiring an **outside agency** to handle the recodification to ensure objectivity and efficiency.  

- **Outcome**:  
   - The committee unanimously voted to **retain the bill for further revision**, acknowledging the need for a more comprehensive approach and potentially more funding.

### **3. HB 129: Feminine Hygiene Products in Schools**
The committee also discussed **HB 129**, which addresses the state’s obligation to fund feminine hygiene products in schools, as mandated by a previous law. Key points included:

- **Overview and Concerns**:  
   - Some members questioned why feminine hygiene products were singled out, as schools already provide other essentials like toilet paper and soap without state mandates.  
   - Others argued that if the state mandates something, it must fund it, regardless of the cost.  

- **Cost Implications**:  
   - The **Manchester School District** reported spending **$150,000** to implement the mandate, including one-time costs like dispensers.  

- **Broader Implications**:  
   - There was debate about whether this could set a precedent for other unfunded mandates and the potential for schools to stop providing these products if state funding is withdrawn.  

- **Support for Funding**:  
   - The **New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA)** supported funding the mandate, emphasizing that state mandates should come with state funding.  

- **Outcome**:  
   - The committee did not take final action on this bill during the session, leaving the issue open for further discussion.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of **school building aid**, emphasizing the need for sustainable funding mechanisms to balance state and local responsibilities while addressing the needs of growing and shrinking school districts. The discussion on **HB 468** underscored the challenges of recodifying education laws and the importance of stakeholder involvement and adequate funding. Finally, the debate over **HB 129** revealed tensions between state mandates and funding obligations, with implications for future unfunded mandates. The committee retained both bills for further revision and discussion, reflecting the ongoing efforts to address these critical issues.
