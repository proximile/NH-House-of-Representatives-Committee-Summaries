### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (01/11/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 11, 2023, for a comprehensive discussion on various aspects of the state’s criminal justice system, including the court system, correctional facilities, domestic violence and sexual assault services, and related challenges. The meeting featured presentations from judicial branch representatives, the Department of Corrections (DOC), the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, and the New Hampshire Public Defenders. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and takeaways from the meeting:

---

### **1. Court System Overview and Challenges**  
Representatives from the judicial branch, including Richard Head, Judge Spath, and Terry McCafferty, provided an overview of New Hampshire’s court system and its operations:  
- **Structure**: The court system comprises Superior Courts (handling felonies) and Circuit Courts (handling misdemeanors, violations, and family/probate cases). Judges often oversee cases across multiple divisions.  
- **Case Management**: The system processes a high volume of cases, with video arraignments and WebEx hearings becoming standard, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
- **Challenges**: Staffing shortages and backlogs persist, particularly in civil cases and low-level offenses. Difficulty in recruiting public defenders exacerbates these issues.  
- **Fines and Homelessness**: Many defendants cannot pay fines, leading to incarceration, while homeless individuals often miss court notifications, resulting in warrants.  
- **Specialty Courts**: Concord has a mental health court, and Merrimack Superior Court operates a drug court, both aimed at diverting individuals with mental health or substance use issues from incarceration.  
- **Proposals for Improvement**: Suggestions included organizing field trips for legislators to observe court proceedings and recruiting staff from higher-paying state agencies to address staffing shortages.

### **2. Correctional System and Rehabilitation Efforts**  
Commissioner Helen Hanks of the Department of Corrections (DOC) presented on the state’s correctional system:  
- **Facilities and Population**: NH has facilities for men and women, including a transitional work center in Concord. The incarcerated population has declined by 26% since 2014, attributed to diversion programs like drug and mental health courts.  
- **Recidivism Reduction**: Programs such as re-entry care coordinators, the Second Chance Pell Grant, and housing stability initiatives aim to reduce recidivism.  
- **Staffing Shortages**: The DOC faces a nearly 50% vacancy rate among correctional officers, with efforts underway to increase wages and improve working conditions.  
- **Mental Health and Substance Use**: The DOC provides medically monitored detoxification, treatment for opioid use disorder, and supports mental health and drug courts.  
- **Contraband and Facility Management**: Challenges include managing contraband, such as fentanyl-laced paper, and ensuring consistent policies across facilities. The DOC collaborates with Postal Inspectors to address contraband in mail.  
- **Future Initiatives**: The DOC is implementing programs like the "Choose Love" curriculum and expanding educational opportunities through community college partnerships.

### **3. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Human Trafficking**  
The New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence highlighted their efforts to support victims and prevent abuse:  
- **Services**: The Coalition operates 12 crisis centers and 11 shelters, serving nearly 15,000 individuals annually with emergency shelter, legal aid, safety planning, and mental health resources.  
- **Prevention and Education**: Programs like Granite State Respect Week educate students on healthy relationships and abuse prevention, reaching over 19,000 students in 2022.  
- **SANE Program**: The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program provides trauma-informed care, with over 100 trained nurses across 26 hospitals.  
- **Human Trafficking Task Force**: The Coalition collaborates with a task force of over 100 members to improve the state’s response to human trafficking.  
- **Funding and Legal Challenges**: The Coalition relies on federal and state funding, advocating for increased resources and better access to protective orders for victims.

### **4. Public Defenders and Legislative Conduct**  
The New Hampshire Public Defenders discussed their budget requests and challenges:  
- **Recruitment and Retention**: Competitive salaries in the public sector make it difficult to attract and retain public defenders.

- **Committee Conduct**: The chair emphasized respectful and pertinent questioning during hearings, encouraging a non-partisan and collaborative atmosphere.

- **Mental Health and Substance Use**: Addressing mental health and substance use issues remains a priority, with efforts to divert individuals from incarceration through specialty courts and treatment programs.  
- **Rehabilitation and Recidivism**: Programs aimed at reducing recidivism, such as housing stability initiatives and educational opportunities, are critical for successful reintegration.  
- **Funding and Resources**: Continued funding is essential to maintain and expand critical services, including domestic violence support, correctional programming, and public defense.
