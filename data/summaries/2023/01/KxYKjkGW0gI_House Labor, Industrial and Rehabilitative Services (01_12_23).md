**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee Meeting (01/12/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on January 12, 2023, to discuss a wide range of labor-related issues, including workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, wage and hour laws, and workforce development. The meeting featured presentations from the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Employment Security, as well as discussions on the committee's legislative agenda and key labor challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **1. Department of Labor Overview**
The DOL operates independently of the General Fund, relying on two primary revenue sources: the administration fund (funded by assessments on workers' compensation carriers) and the restricted fund (comprising fines, fees, and licenses). Surpluses are returned to the General Fund. Key divisions within the DOL include:

- **Workers' Compensation Division**: Oversees mandatory coverage for employees, including part-time workers. The division handles over 40,000 reports of workplace injuries annually, with 1,200-1,800 hearings conducted to resolve disputes. The Second Injury Fund, governed by RSA 281-A:55, helps mitigate costs for employers when employees suffer second injuries.
  
- **Inspection Division**: Enforces wage and hour compliance, safety standards, and boiler and elevator inspections. The division is complaint-driven, typically issuing warnings before penalties, except in cases of non-payment.

---

### **2. Wage and Hour Laws**
New Hampshire’s wage and hour laws (RSA 275 and RSA 279) align with the federal minimum wage, though most wage issues involve tipped employees rather than minimum wage violations. Youth labor regulations (RSA 276-A) restrict hours and prohibit certain occupations for minors, requiring youth certificates or parental permission forms for employment.

### **3. Unemployment Insurance (UI) Trust Fund**
The UI trust fund has grown significantly, reaching $358 million, up from $300 million at the start of the pandemic. This growth has allowed for tax rate reductions for employers, with a half-point reduction already implemented and potential for further reductions. Employers pay an average of $198-$199 per employee annually in UI taxes, based on a 1.42% tax rate on $14,000 in wages. New Hampshire’s UI tax burden is lower than neighboring New England states.

- **Unemployment Benefits**: The average weekly benefit is $330, the lowest in New England, with a maximum of $427. Eligibility requires a minimum of $2,800 in earnings in the 15-18 months prior to job loss.
  
- **Fraud and Overpayments**: The department actively investigates UI fraud, particularly cases where individuals fail to report earnings while collecting benefits. Overpayments due to department errors are not required to be repaid, while those due to claimant misrepresentation must be repaid.

### **4. Job Market and Workforce Development**
New Hampshire’s private sector employment is 1.1% above pre-pandemic levels, with 6,500 more jobs than in November 2019. Unemployment claims have decreased by 30% compared to pre-pandemic levels, with 501 initial claims filed in the most recent week. Job postings are 30-40% higher than pre-pandemic levels, indicating a strong job market.

- **Workforce Development Programs**: The department operates initiatives like "Work Now," which provides training and support for individuals on Medicaid, TANF, or SNAP to re-enter the workforce. Virtual job fairs have connected over 11,000 participants with employers in 70 events last year.

### **5. Remote Work and Misclassification**
The rise of remote work has raised questions about workers' compensation claims and reporting pay requirements. Workers' compensation still applies to remote workers, though proving claims may be more challenging. Reporting pay (two hours of pay for employees who report to work) does not apply to remote workers, as the law was historically tied to commuting.

Misclassification of employees as independent contractors remains an issue, particularly in the construction industry. Employers are increasingly claiming workers are employees but not properly reporting them on payroll.

### **6. Legislative Process and Committee Work**
The committee reviewed 14 bills, including nine early bills with financial implications that must be addressed by the finance committee. Hearings were scheduled for January 19 and January 26. The chair emphasized the importance of understanding RSA citations and completing fiscal notes by February 16.

---

### **7. Committee Introductions and Tone**
Committee members introduced themselves, highlighting their backgrounds and commitment to addressing labor issues in a non-partisan, collaborative manner. The chair encouraged respectful discourse and data-driven discussions to ensure effective legislation.

---

### **8. Future Outlook**
The department is monitoring economic conditions, with economists predicting a potential downturn but no significant job losses anticipated. Efforts will focus on maintaining the solvency of the UI trust fund, supporting employers and workers, and addressing issues like fraud and overpayments.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the DOL’s critical role in enforcing labor laws, managing workers' compensation, and supporting workforce development. Committee members expressed a commitment to addressing labor challenges through informed, collaborative legislation, ensuring the well-being of both employers and workers in New Hampshire.
