**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (01/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on January 24, 2023, to discuss several bills addressing driver's licenses, motor vehicle records, license plates, and data collection related to law enforcement interactions. The meeting featured detailed testimony, debates, and discussions on the implications of the proposed legislation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills covered:

---

### **Driver's Licenses and Motor Vehicle Records**
1. **House Bill 374**:  
   - This bill aims to streamline the application process for driver's licenses and enhance privacy protections for motor vehicle records.  
   - **Prime Sponsor Representative George Sykes** emphasized its focus on public safety by ensuring all drivers, including undocumented immigrants, are properly vetted. Supporters argued that allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain licenses would increase road safety, reduce hit-and-run incidents, and expand insurance coverage.  
   - **Testimony in Support**: Advocates like Maggie Fogarty and Eva Castillo highlighted the economic, humanitarian, and public safety benefits of the bill, noting it would reduce fear of law enforcement and improve the well-being of immigrant families.  
   - **Testimony in Opposition**: Neil Kirk raised concerns about encouraging illegal immigration, privacy issues, and questioned the public safety benefits, suggesting the bill could make New Hampshire a sanctuary state.

2. **House Bill 375**:  
   - This bill proposes temporary driver's licenses for asylum seekers waiting for work permits.  
   - Representative Sykes explained that it addresses the gap between the 60-day requirement for a New Hampshire license and the 365-day wait for federal work authorization. Supporters argued it would increase independence and reduce transportation challenges for asylum seekers in rural areas.

3. **House Bill 597**:  
   - This bill mandates the inclusion of race and ethnicity data on driver's licenses and non-driver identification cards. It also requires law enforcement to collect gender, race, and ethnicity data during stops or arrests, with an opt-out provision for privacy concerns.  
   - **Representative Charlotte DiLorenzo** emphasized the importance of this data for addressing biases in law enforcement and ensuring transparency.

### **Driver's License Suspensions**
1. **House Bill 650**:  
   - This bill seeks to prohibit the suspension of driver's licenses for non-payment of fines or fees.  
   - **Supporters**, including the ACLU and community advocates, argued that such suspensions disproportionately affect low-income individuals, hinder their ability to work, and perpetuate poverty. They emphasized that driving is essential in New Hampshire, where public transportation is limited, and that license suspensions should be reserved for public safety concerns, not financial ones.  
   - **Concerns**: Major Joseph Ebert of the State Police questioned the accuracy of data collection, while Richard Head from the Judicial Branch noted that license suspensions are a tool to enforce court orders.  
   - **Fiscal Impact**: The DMV could lose $4 million annually in reinstatement fees, but proponents argued that enabling individuals to keep their licenses would boost economic productivity.

### **License Plate Requirements**
1. **House Bill 388 and House Bill 393**:  
   - These bills propose eliminating the requirement for front license plates on private passenger vehicles (HB 388) and all motor vehicles (HB 393).  
   - **Supporters** argued that many states only require rear plates, citing cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and avoiding vehicle damage. Representative Dan Hines proposed an amendment to ensure revenue neutrality.  
   - **Opposition**: Law enforcement representatives, including the New Hampshire Chiefs of Police Association and State Police, strongly opposed the bills, emphasizing the importance of front plates for identifying vehicles involved in crimes, hit-and-runs, and toll collection.  
   - **Toll Revenue Concerns**: The New Hampshire Department of Transportation estimated a $700,000 annual loss in toll revenue and additional costs to install rear cameras in toll lanes.  
   - **Privacy Concerns**: Supporters argued that eliminating front plates aligns with New Hampshire’s “Live Free or Die” ethos and addresses privacy concerns related to automated license plate readers.

### **Data Collection and Racial Profiling**
1. **House Bill 597 (Continued)**:  
   - The bill aims to improve data collection on racial and ethnic profiling during law enforcement interactions, particularly traffic stops.  
   - **Purpose**: To provide reliable data to identify and combat racial profiling, ensuring transparency and accountability in law enforcement.  
   - **Background**: Stemming from recommendations by the Governor’s Commission on Law Enforcement Accountability, Community, and Transparency (LEACT), the bill seeks to address previous failures to implement comprehensive data collection systems.  
   - **Testimony in Support**: Civil rights advocates, the ACLU, and law enforcement officials emphasized the importance of data for identifying biases and improving public trust.  
   - **Concerns**: Challenges include the optional nature of self-reporting race/ethnicity, costs of upgrading data systems, and technical difficulties in standardizing data collection across departments.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Public Safety vs. Privacy**: The debate over front license plates highlighted the tension between law enforcement’s need for vehicle identification and privacy concerns.  
- **Equity and Access**: Bills addressing driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers emphasized the importance of equitable access to transportation and the economic and humanitarian benefits of such policies.  
- **Data-Driven Accountability**: The push for data collection on racial profiling underscored the need for transparency and accountability in law enforcement, despite logistical and financial challenges.  
- **Fiscal Considerations**: Many discussions centered on the fiscal impact of proposed changes, including revenue losses from tolls and license reinstatement fees, balanced against potential economic and social benefits.
