### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (01/18/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on January 18, 2023, to discuss several bills addressing property tax relief, housing affordability, municipal governance, and transparency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

---

### **Property Tax Relief and Simplification**
1. **HB 98: Low and Moderate Income Homeowners Property Tax Relief Program**
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes changing the filing deadline from **May 1st to February 1st** to align with the federal tax season, making it easier for eligible homeowners to apply for relief.
   - **Rationale**: Many homeowners rely on tax preparers during the federal tax season, and the current deadline is inconvenient. The change could increase participation in the program.
   - **Concerns**: Potential financial impact on the state and administrative challenges for municipalities, as property tax calculations rely on equalization ratios typically available by May 1st.
   - **Support**: The bill is seen as a "do no harm" measure to simplify the process for low-to-moderate-income homeowners.

2. **HB 433: Property Tax Exemptions and Transfers**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that property tax exemptions (e.g., for veterans, elderly, or disabled individuals) do not transfer to new homeowners after a property sale.
   - **Rationale**: Current practices can lead to lost revenue for municipalities and unfair tax bills for new homeowners.
   - **Concerns**: Logistical challenges in implementing the change, including timing of property transfers and tax billing cycles.
   - **Support**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) supports the concept but is working on technical amendments.

### **Housing Affordability and Local Control**
1. **HB 95: Local Control Over Rent Regulations**
   - **Purpose**: Allows municipalities to enact rent control measures during housing emergencies, including rent stabilization and notification periods for rent hikes.
   - **Rationale**: Addresses the severe housing crisis in New Hampshire, with rising rents displacing residents, including essential workers, veterans, and retirees.
   - **Support**: Advocates argue that local control is essential to address unique community needs and prevent homelessness.
   - **Opposition**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, argue that rent control discourages new construction and could worsen the housing supply crisis.

2. **HB 422: Registry of Rents**
   - **Purpose**: Requires landlords to report rental amounts to the county registry of deeds, creating a transparent database of rental prices.
   - **Rationale**: Aims to combat predatory practices, such as landlords inflating rents to exploit rental assistance programs.
   - **Support**: Proponents believe the registry would provide data to inform housing policies and ensure fair rental prices.
   - **Opposition**: Concerns about enforceability, administrative burden on counties, and potential unintended consequences.

### **Municipal Governance and Transparency**
1. **HB 154: Public Health Ordinances**
   - **Purpose**: Amends RSA 147:1 to require public health ordinances proposed by town health officers to be approved by the legislative body (voters) rather than just the select board.
   - **Rationale**: Ensures robust local control and public deliberation over public health ordinances.
   - **Support**: Emphasizes transparency and public participation in decisions affecting the community.
   - **Opposition**: Concerns about potential contradictions with existing laws and the sufficiency of the current process.

2. **HB 295-FN: Recording and Broadcasting Public Meetings**
   - **Purpose**: Requires select boards and school boards to record and live stream their public meetings.
   - **Rationale**: Increases transparency and accessibility for residents, particularly those unable to attend in person.
   - **Support**: Highlighted as a way to make government more inclusive and accountable.
   - **Opposition**: Concerns about costs, technological limitations, and lack of broadband access in rural areas.

3. **HB 123: Budget Committee Membership**
   - **Purpose**: Prevents select board and school board members from voting on budget committee matters, limiting them to advisory roles.
   - **Rationale**: Ensures independence in budget decisions and prevents conflicts of interest.
   - **Support**: Budget committee members argue that the bill is necessary to control spending and maintain fiscal responsibility.
   - **Opposition**: Some stakeholders believe the current system allows for balanced decision-making.

2. **Local Control vs. Statewide Solutions**: Debates centered on whether municipalities should have the flexibility to address local issues or if statewide strategies are more effective.
3. **Transparency and Accountability**: Bills like HB 295-FN and HB 123 aim to make government more accessible and ensure fair decision-making processes.
