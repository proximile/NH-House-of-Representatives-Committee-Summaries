The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on **January 18, 2023**, focused on a range of bills addressing municipal and county government issues, with a particular emphasis on housing, property tax relief, public health ordinances, and government transparency. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Housing and Rent Control**
1. **House Bill 95 (HB 95)**:
   - **Purpose**: Enables municipalities to enact regulations on rental practices to address the state’s housing crisis, including rent stabilization, notification periods for rent increases, and other affordability measures.
   - **Support**: Advocates, including **Representative Reed** (the bill’s prime sponsor) and **Representative Staub**, highlighted the severe housing crisis, particularly in the Seacoast and Manchester regions, where rising rents are displacing essential workers, seniors, and vulnerable populations. **Kirsten Cornell** from New Hampshire Legal Assistance emphasized the need for local tools to address homelessness and welfare costs.
   - **Opposition**: **Joanne McIntyre** of the New Hampshire Association of Realtors argued that rent control could worsen the housing shortage by discouraging development and reducing housing quality and quantity.
   - **Discussion**: Questions were raised about the bill’s mechanisms, such as how rent limits would apply if properties are sold and the potential for unintended consequences like deferred maintenance or reduced tax revenue. Representative Reed clarified that the bill focuses on regulating rental practices rather than specific owners, allowing towns to adapt quickly to market changes.

2. **House Bill 422 (HB 422)**:
   - **Purpose**: Proposes creating a county-level registry of rents to increase transparency in rental pricing and identify predatory practices.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued it would ensure fair market rates and combat fraud.
   - **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about enforceability, the burden on landlords, and potential misuse of data.

### **Property Tax Relief and Rebates**
1. **House Bill 98 (HB 98)**:
   - **Purpose**: Changes the filing deadline for the Low and Moderate Income Homeowners Property Tax Relief Program from **May 1st to February 1st**, aligning it with federal tax preparation timelines.
   - **Support**: **Representative Charles Melvin** and volunteer tax preparer **Roger Hamel** argued that the change would simplify the process for eligible homeowners.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the Department of Revenue Administration’s (DRA) ability to process applications by February 1st, given the timing of property valuations and tax calculations.

2. **House Bill 99 (HB 99)**:
   - **Purpose**: Renames the property tax relief program to "property tax rebate" and requires municipalities to include program information on property tax bills to increase awareness and accessibility, especially for seniors.

3. **House Bill 433 (HB 433)**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that property tax exemptions granted prior to a home sale do not apply to new homeowners, addressing revenue losses in towns due to delays in identifying expired exemptions.
   - **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the process for municipalities to identify property transfers and adjust tax bills accordingly. **Dawn Griska**, a town administrator, highlighted the challenges towns face in recouping lost revenue.

### **Public Health Ordinances**
1. **House Bill 154 (HB 154)**:
   - **Purpose**: Requires public health ordinances to be approved by a majority of the legislative body at an annual or special meeting, rather than solely by health officers or select boards.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued this ensures robust local control and public input.
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Health Officers Association argued it adds unnecessary administrative burden and delays.

### **Government Transparency**
1. **House Bill 295-FN (HB 295-FN)**:
   - **Purpose**: Requires all public select board and school board meetings to be recorded and live-streamed to increase transparency, accountability, and public participation.
   - **Support**: **Representative Hope Damon** and resident **Edward Spiker** emphasized the benefits of accessibility, especially for elderly residents, parents, and individuals with physical limitations.
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) cited practical challenges, such as lack of broadband access in rural areas and implementation costs. Amendments were suggested to address technological limitations.

### **Budget Committee Governance**
1. **House Bill 123 (HB 123)**:
   - **Purpose**: Aims to restrict voting rights of select board and school board members on budget committees to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure budget committees remain independent and taxpayer-focused.
   - **Discussion**: Testimony from budget committee chairs in towns like Salem and Hudson highlighted how current dynamics undermine the committee’s ability to control spending. Representatives from Hudson shared their experience of being sued by the school board and select board after attempting to limit the voting rights of liaisons on the budget committee.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing the housing crisis, balancing local control with state oversight, and improving transparency and accessibility in government processes. Discussions underscored the need for careful consideration of unintended consequences, logistical feasibility, and stakeholder input. The committee planned to refine language in several bills and reconvene for further deliberation.
