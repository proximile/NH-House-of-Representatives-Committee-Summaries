### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (01/10/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 10, 2023, focused extensively on election law, addressing a range of issues from enforcement and provisional ballots to primary election integrity and ballot access.

#### **Election Law Enforcement and Administration**
1. **Election Law Unit**: Ann Edwards from the Attorney General's Office outlined the role of the election law unit in enforcing election laws, including handling violations, criminal cases, and civil litigation. She highlighted challenges with campaign filing systems and efforts to address violations from the 2020 and 2022 elections.
2. **Provisional Ballots**: Patty Lovejoy, Senior Deputy Secretary of State, introduced the new provisional ballot system, which will be implemented in upcoming elections. Voters without proper identification will receive a packet to return to the Secretary of State's office within a specified timeframe, or their votes will be invalidated.

#### **House Bill 101: Closed Primaries**
1. **Proposal**: Representative Moffett presented HB 101, which would require voters to register with a political party **four months before a primary election** to participate, effectively disenfranchising undeclared/independent voters.
2. **Supporters' Arguments**: Proponents argued that primaries are for party members to select their candidates and that undeclared voters should not influence party nominations. They cited historical examples where they believe one party influenced the other's primary outcomes.
3. **Opponents' Arguments**: Critics, including undeclared voter Charlotte Pogue, argued that the bill would disenfranchise independent voters, reduce turnout, and undermine New Hampshire’s tradition of open primaries. Concerns were also raised about increased polarization and potential violations of the **equal protection clause**.
4. **Impact on Youth Voters**: The bill could disproportionately affect young voters, who are less likely to register with a party far in advance.

#### **House Bill 116: Filing Fees and Petition Requirements**
1. **Proposal**: HB 116 proposed significant increases in **filing fees** and **petition requirements** for candidates running for governor, U.S. Senate, and Congress. For example, gubernatorial filing fees would rise from $200 to $25,000, and petition requirements would increase from 200 to 25,000 signatures.
2. **Supporters' Arguments**: Proponents argued that the changes would ensure candidates demonstrate a **serious commitment** to running, either through financial contributions or grassroots support. They also claimed it would reduce voter confusion by limiting frivolous candidates.
3. **Opponents' Arguments**: Critics argued that the bill would create barriers for lesser-known or modestly funded candidates, favor wealthy candidates, and discourage insurgent or third-party candidates. They emphasized the importance of maintaining an open and accessible election process.
4. **Downshifting Costs**: The bill eliminated the $2 filing fee for state representative candidates, shifting the cost to town clerks. While minimal, opponents argued this removed a small but important revenue stream for towns.

He also emphasized voter education and poll worker recruitment, particularly targeting veterans.
3. **Recounts and Audits**: The Secretary addressed the record number of recounts in 2022 and the implementation of post-election audits, which helped identify errors and ensure transparency.
4. **Challenges**: Scanlon expressed concerns about the increasing workload and scrutiny on local election officials, who are often volunteers. He stressed the need to support these officials to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.
