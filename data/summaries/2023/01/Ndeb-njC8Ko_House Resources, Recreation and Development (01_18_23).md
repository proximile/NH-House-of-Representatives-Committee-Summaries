The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Resources, Recreation, and Development convened on January 18, 2023, to discuss several legislative bills impacting the state’s natural resources, recreation, and development sectors. The meeting featured detailed discussions, expert testimony, and public input on key issues, including public monuments, drone use in state parks, timber harvesting, and dog regulations in recreational areas. Below is a cohesive summary of the session:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 194: Public Monuments List**  
   - This bill proposes compiling and maintaining a list of public monuments in New Hampshire for educational purposes.  
   - Representative Laura, the bill’s sponsor, emphasized the value of using monuments to engage students and the public in learning about state history.  
   - An amendment was introduced to shift responsibility for the list from the Division of Archives and Records to the Division of Historical Resources within the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. The amendment was supported, with no additional costs anticipated.

2. **House Bill 141: Dog Regulations in State Parks**  
   - The bill seeks to amend rules requiring dogs to be leashed at all times in state parks, arguing that this is unnecessary and unsafe on steep or rugged trails.  
   - Representative Harrington proposed allowing dogs off-leash on trails while requiring owners to carry a leash and use it in specific areas like campgrounds or picnic areas.  
   - The Division of Parks and Recreation testified that current rules already permit dogs off-leash in remote areas, making the bill somewhat redundant.

3. **House Bill 434: Drone Use in State Parks**  
   - Introduced by Representative Lisa Post, this bill aims to allow commercial and recreational drone use in state parks, with exceptions and limitations.  
   - Key provisions include pilot education requirements, a $25 fee for commercial use, and bans on drone use in sensitive areas like the Flume Gorge and Cannon Mountain during ski season.  
   - Concerns were raised about privacy, wildlife disturbance, and the recreational experience. The Audubon Society highlighted both the benefits and risks of drones for wildlife monitoring.  
   - Federal jurisdiction over airspace was noted, with state authority limited to regulating takeoff and landing on state lands.  

4. **House Bill 174: Timber Harvesting Process**  
   - This bill addresses delays in the **intent-to-cut** notification process, which loggers must file with towns to notify them of anticipated tax revenue from timber sales.  
   - Currently, loggers cannot proceed if towns fail to act within 15 calendar days. The bill proposes allowing operations to begin on day 16 if the town has not responded, with provisions to pause if issues are later identified.  
   - Supporters, including industry representatives, emphasized the financial and operational burdens caused by delays.  
   - The New Hampshire Municipal Association expressed concerns about local control and potential conflicts with other regulatory processes.  
   - A subcommittee was proposed to refine the bill further.

### **Committee Operations and Member Introductions**  
- Committee members introduced themselves, highlighting their diverse backgrounds in real estate law, education, forestry, and public health.  
- The chair emphasized bipartisan collaboration and efficient handling of bills, encouraging members to seek clarification and submit financial disclosure forms.  

### **Expert and Public Testimony**  
- **Jason Stock**, Executive Director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, provided an overview of the state’s forestry industry, noting its $1.6 billion annual economic impact and 83% forest cover.  
- **Trisha Lambert** from the NH Department of Transportation Bureau of Aeronautics discussed federal preemption in airspace regulation and raised concerns about jurisdictional conflicts in the drone bill.  
- Public testimony included support for drone use as a growing industry and concerns about balancing recreational enjoyment with technological advancements.  

### **Broader Themes and Outcomes**  
The meeting underscored the importance of balancing public access, safety, and the preservation of natural and historical resources. Key themes included:  
- Streamlining bureaucratic processes to support industries like timber harvesting.  
- Addressing emerging technologies like drones while mitigating their impact on wildlife, privacy, and recreational spaces.  
- Fostering collaboration between stakeholders and refining legislation to address diverse concerns.  

The committee indicated plans for further work sessions and subcommittee meetings to refine the bills and incorporate additional stakeholder input before advancing them.
