The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Election Law Committee convened on January 17, 2023, to discuss several bills related to election laws, with a particular focus on **ranked-choice voting (RCV)** and changes to primary election dates and processes. Here’s a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and points raised across the segments:

### Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) Discussions

1. **Mechanics and Benefits of RCV**:
   - RCV allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins a majority, the lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on voters' next choices. This ensures the winner has broad support.
   - Advocates argue RCV reduces polarization, encourages civility, and gives voters more choice and voice. It levels the playing field for third-party and independent candidates.
   - Examples from other states (e.g., Maine, Alaska) and countries (e.g., Australia, Ireland) show RCV has successfully decreased political unrest and increased voter confidence in election outcomes.

2. **Implementation and Logistical Concerns**:
   - Concerns were raised about the complexity of ballots in districts with many candidates, the time required for recounts, and the need for updated voting machines capable of handling RCV.
   - The Secretary of State's office expressed reservations about the feasibility of implementing RCV without disrupting existing election timelines. Full implementation in New Hampshire is targeted for September 2026, but many towns may not have upgraded their voting machines by then.

3. **Constitutional and Legal Considerations**:
   - The constitutionality of RCV was debated, particularly regarding New Hampshire’s plurality requirement. It was argued that RCV does not violate the state constitution because it does not require a candidate to win by a majority.
   - A suggestion was made to seek an advisory opinion from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, similar to what Maine did.

4. **Multi-Member Districts and Proportional Representation**:
   - RCV in multi-member districts can produce more proportional representation, preventing single-party sweeps and ensuring minority voices are represented.
   - A simulated election example showed that RCV could lead to more balanced representation in New Hampshire's House of Representatives.

5. **Support and Opposition**:
   - RCV has bipartisan support, with examples of its use by both Republican and Democratic parties in various states and organizations. It is seen as a nonpartisan reform that benefits all voters.
   - Critics argue RCV is complex and difficult to understand, though supporters counter that voter education can address this. Some also claim RCV can lead to unintended outcomes, though these are cited as exceptions rather than the rule.

### House Bill 345: Enabling RCV for State Primaries and Municipal Elections

1. **Purpose and Benefits**:
   - RCV ensures that winning candidates have majority support, eliminates the need for strategic voting, and reduces negative campaigning.
   - It increases voter turnout and engagement, saves municipalities money by eliminating runoff elections, and provides a clearer picture of voter preferences.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The bill allows municipalities and political parties to opt into RCV, making it a local choice. Counting would be centralized, with ballots processed by the Secretary of State’s office.
   - Costs are manageable, with initial implementation expenses estimated at $29,000 and ongoing costs at $79,000 per election in Maine.

3. **Examples of Success**:
   - Maine and Alaska have used RCV effectively, with high voter satisfaction and smooth implementation. RCV has also been used in other countries (e.g., Australia) and organizations (e.g., Academy Awards) for over a century.

### House Bill 115 and House Bill 333: Changes to Primary Election Dates and Processes

1. **HB 115**:
   - Sponsored by Representative Joseph Sweeney, this bill seeks to move the state primary election from September to the second Tuesday in June.
   - Supporters argue that June primaries would increase voter engagement and avoid summer vacation periods. Opponents argue that late primaries benefit incumbents and could impact student voters.

2. **HB 333**:
   - Also sponsored by Representative Sweeney, this bill proposes moving the primary to March (town meeting day) and introducing a runoff system if no candidate receives a majority (50%) of the vote.
   - The bill faces opposition from the Secretary of State's office, which raised concerns about the logistical challenges of holding runoffs and potential constitutional issues related to plurality voting.

### Additional Notes and Conclusion

- The Secretary of State's office opposed both HB 333 and RCV, citing constitutional concerns and logistical challenges.
- Representatives debated the impact of primary election timing on voter turnout, campaign dynamics, and the quality of candidates.
- The committee emphasized the need for further study and discussion on these issues, particularly regarding the constitutional implications of runoff elections and RCV.

Overall, the discussions highlighted the potential benefits of RCV for improving election outcomes and reducing polarization, while acknowledging the logistical and legal challenges of its implementation in New Hampshire. The committee concluded with plans to reconvene for further discussion on these bills and related election law matters.
