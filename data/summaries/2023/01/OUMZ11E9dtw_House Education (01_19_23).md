### **Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 19, 2023, focused on several key education-related topics, including the expansion of the **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)** program, school building aid, higher education affordability, and student loan debt. The discussions highlighted deep ideological divides and practical concerns about funding, accountability, and equity in education.

### **1. Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) Program Expansion**
The EFA program, which allows families to use state funds for alternative education options such as private schools or homeschooling, was the centerpiece of the meeting. Multiple bills were discussed to expand eligibility and funding for the program:

- **House Bill 464**: This bill aims to expand EFA eligibility to marginalized groups, including foster children, homeless students, military families, English language learners, bullied students, and those with disabilities, regardless of income. Proponents argued that these students face unique challenges and deserve access to tailored educational options. Critics raised concerns about the program’s cost (nearly $30 million annually), lack of accountability, and potential diversion of funds from public schools.

- **House Bill 367**: This bill seeks to raise the income cap for EFA eligibility from 300% to 500% of the federal poverty level, allowing more middle-income families to qualify. Supporters highlighted stories of families just above the income cap who struggle to afford private education. Opponents argued that the program undermines public schools and violates the state’s education trust fund.

#### **Key Debates:**
- **Support for Expansion**: Advocates emphasized parental choice, particularly for students with special needs, bullied students, and those in foster care. They shared success stories of students thriving in private or homeschooling environments.
- **Opposition to Expansion**: Critics raised concerns about the lack of oversight, potential discrimination by private schools, and the program’s growing cost. They argued that public funds should prioritize improving public schools rather than expanding voucher programs.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Questions were raised about the program’s lack of data on student outcomes, with calls for detailed reports on fund allocation and academic performance.

### **2. School Building Aid**
The committee discussed the urgent need for school building aid, as many New Hampshire schools are outdated, with 50% over 60 years old and 6% built before 1900. Key points included:

- **10-Year Plan**: A proposed 10-year plan aims to prioritize school renovations and construction, but the current $50 million biennial allocation is insufficient to meet the $500 million in requests.
- **Equity Concerns**: Poorer communities struggle to fund necessary improvements, exacerbating educational inequities.
- **Administrative Challenges**: The application process for building aid is lengthy and complex, requiring districts to secure local funding before state aid is approved. Representatives called for streamlined processes and extended timelines.

### **3. Higher Education Affordability and Student Loan Debt**
The committee addressed the high cost of higher education and the burden of student loan debt in New Hampshire:

- **Granite Guarantee Program**: While helpful, this program does not fully meet the financial needs of many students, particularly those just above the income threshold.
- **House Bill 45**: This bill proposes creating a study committee to investigate student loan debt and explore solutions such as loan forgiveness programs. Supporters argued that addressing these issues could help retain young people in New Hampshire and fill job vacancies.
- **Affordability Challenges**: New Hampshire’s state university system is the worst-funded in the country, leading many students to seek more affordable options out of state. Representatives emphasized the need for comprehensive studies to address tuition costs, predatory loans, and food insecurity.

### **4. Flexibility in Education Pathways**
The committee discussed bills aimed at providing more flexibility for students:

- **House Bill 306**: This bill proposes allowing students aged 13 or older to take a standardized test to demonstrate they have met high school graduation requirements, enabling them to earn a diploma early. Supporters argued that this would benefit motivated students who feel constrained by the traditional 12-year system. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of a single test and the impact on local school districts.

---

### **5. Non-Academic Surveys (House Bill 380)**
The committee debated HB 380, which proposes changing the parental consent system for non-academic surveys from opt-in to opt-out. Key points included:

- **Purpose**: The change aims to increase participation rates, which are critical for obtaining reliable data for federal grants and program funding.
- **Concerns**: Some survey questions, particularly those related to sensitive topics like sexual behavior and mental health, were deemed inappropriate for younger students. Testimony highlighted the need for better follow-up support for students affected by the content.
- **Federal Funding**: Surveys like the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) are essential for securing federal funding and informing public health interventions.

### **Key Takeaways:**
1. **EFA Program Expansion**: The debate highlighted a fundamental divide between those who view the EFA program as empowering families and providing educational options, and those who see it as undermining public education through lack of accountability and diversion of funds.
2. **School Building Aid**: There is a critical need for increased funding and streamlined processes to address outdated school infrastructure, particularly in poorer communities.
3. **Higher Education Affordability**: The high cost of education and student loan debt are significant barriers for New Hampshire students, with calls for comprehensive studies and potential solutions like loan forgiveness programs.
4. **Flexibility and Accountability**: Bills like HB 306 and HB 380 aim to provide more flexibility in education pathways and improve data collection, but concerns about oversight and student well-being remain.

The meeting underscored the complexity of education policy in New Hampshire, with passionate arguments on both sides of key issues. The committee’s decisions will likely hinge on balancing competing priorities of equity, accountability, and fiscal responsibility.
