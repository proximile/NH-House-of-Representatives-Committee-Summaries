### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (January 17, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 17, 2023, to discuss a wide range of topics related to energy, utilities, air quality, and environmental programs. The meeting featured presentations from utility companies, state agencies, and other stakeholders, with a focus on grid management, renewable energy, air quality, and emergency preparedness. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

#### **Utility Operations and Grid Management**
1. **Eversource Energy**:
   - **Grid Management**: Eversource highlighted the role of ISO New England in ensuring grid reliability and managing capacity to meet demand. They discussed the challenges of transmission costs, which account for about 7% of a customer’s bill, driven by the retirement of generation plants and the need for reliability investments.
   - **Smart Technology**: The use of smart switches and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) was emphasized for improving outage management, reducing restoration times, and enhancing customer communication.
   - **Vegetation Management**: Eversource outlined their tree trimming and hazardous tree removal programs to prevent outages.
   - **Carbon Neutrality**: The company shared its internal goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, focusing on operational emissions rather than the carbon content of the power they procure.
   - **Emergency Response**: Eversource’s storm response strategies, including pre-storm forecasting, real-time updates, and post-storm feedback, were discussed. They also addressed preparations for potential rolling blackouts in coordination with ISO New England.

2. **Liberty Utilities**:
   - **Gas and Electric Systems**: Liberty discussed its gas system vulnerabilities, including reliance on the Kinder Morgan pipeline, and efforts to replace leak-prone pipes. They also highlighted investments in infrastructure like the Rockingham substation.
   - **Renewable Energy**: Liberty is piloting hydrogen blending projects and aims to transition Keene’s propane-air system to 100% hydrogen within 5–10 years. They are also exploring renewable natural gas (RNG) and hydrogen as part of their sustainability efforts.

3. **New Hampshire Electric Cooperative (NHEC)**:
   - **Non-Profit Model**: NHEC highlighted its member-owned, non-profit structure and the lowest power supply rate among NH utilities. They also discussed their Broadband subsidiary serving rural areas.
   - **Smart Meters**: NHEC has 100% smart meter penetration, enabling real-time data collection and system planning. They are exploring renewable energy projects, battery storage, and transactive energy rates to manage price volatility.

4. **Unitil**:
   - **Energy Efficiency**: Unitil administers statewide energy efficiency programs under New Hampshire Saves, offering home energy assessments, weatherization, and incentives for efficient appliances.
   - **Electric Vehicles**: Unitil addressed the impact of EV adoption on the grid, noting that their distribution planning includes projections for EV charging demand.

#### **Air Quality and Environmental Programs**
1. **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**:
   - **Air Quality Monitoring**: DES monitors air quality across the state, with significant reductions in pollutants like sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides attributed to the Clean Air Act and state legislation.
   - **Emerging Contaminants**: DES highlighted efforts to address PFAS emissions, particularly from the Saint-Gobain facility, and the importance of federal funding from ARPA and the Infrastructure Act for water and wastewater projects.
   - **Regional Haze Program**: The program aims to improve visibility in Class I areas, such as the White Mountains, with a goal of returning visibility to natural conditions by 2064.

2. **Volkswagen Settlement Funds**:
   - New Hampshire received $31 million from the Volkswagen emissions scandal settlement, which is being used for environmental mitigation, including EV charging infrastructure. Delays in spending these funds were noted, but progress is now being made with contracts for EV charging stations.

3. **Climate Change and Environmental Justice**:
   - The EPA has identified climate change and environmental justice as top priorities. New Hampshire is working on implementing these priorities, though there is a need for more federal guidance and funding.

#### **Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy**
1. **New Hampshire Saves**:
   - This statewide energy efficiency program, administered by utilities like Unitil, has saved billions of kilowatt hours and therms of natural gas, saving customers an estimated $3.9 billion. However, some programs face budget constraints and cannot meet all demand.

2. **Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and RGGI**:
   - The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) was discussed, with an emphasis on its role in reducing CO2 emissions from power plants. New Hampshire’s participation in RGGI has generated significant revenue, primarily directed toward energy efficiency programs. Contingent repeal provisions were noted, which would only take effect if other states leave the program.

---

#### **Legislative and Procedural Updates**
1. **Bill Hearings and Executive Sessions**:
   - The committee discussed the start of bill hearings for the session, with an emphasis on moving bills through the process more efficiently to ensure timely floor debates. Executive sessions were planned early to address five early bills due by February 16th.

2. **Future Presentations**:
   - Upcoming presentations include those from ISO New England, the New England Power Generators Association, and the Public Utilities Commission.

#### **Key Takeaways**
- **Grid Reliability and Modernization**: Utilities are investing in smart technology, renewable energy, and infrastructure upgrades to improve grid reliability and manage costs.
- **Air Quality and Environmental Health**: DES is focused on maintaining compliance with federal air quality standards, addressing emerging contaminants like PFAS, and improving visibility in Class I areas.
- **Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy**: Programs like New Hampshire Saves and RGGI are critical for reducing energy use, lowering costs, and promoting renewable energy adoption.
- **Climate Change and Environmental Justice**: New Hampshire is working to align with federal priorities on climate change and environmental justice, though additional funding and guidance are needed.
- **Legislative Process**: The committee is focused on efficiently moving bills through the legislative process to ensure timely debates and decisions.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to continued collaboration among utilities, state agencies, and legislators to address New Hampshire’s energy, environmental, and public health challenges.
