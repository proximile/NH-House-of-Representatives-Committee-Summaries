**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (01/25/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on January 25, 2023, to discuss the state's revenue streams, budget planning, and the operational challenges faced by various state agencies. The meeting featured presentations from multiple departments, including the Insurance Department, Lottery Commission, Department of Safety, Liquor Commission, and others, with a focus on revenue projections, economic factors, and future plans.

### **Revenue Overview and Economic Factors**
The committee began with an overview of the state's revenue landscape, emphasizing the complexities of forecasting due to economic uncertainties, market cycles, and external pressures. Key points included:

1. **Revenue Fluctuations**: The state experienced a $28 million revenue from fees in the past fiscal year, but this is not expected to continue. Factors influencing revenue include insurance market cycles (hard and soft markets), tax base changes, retaliatory premium tax rates, tax credits, and enforcement penalties.
   
2. **Insurance Market Dynamics**: The insurance market significantly impacts revenue, with companies re-domesticating to other states and licensing volume affecting collections. The retaliatory provision ensures out-of-state companies are taxed similarly to how New Hampshire companies are taxed in their home states.

3. **Health Insurance Trends**: The alarming escalation of health insurance premiums was discussed, with the state managing this through measures like the 1332 waiver, which uses federal funds to provide reinsurance and moderate individual market rates.

4. **Economic Pressures**: High grocery and oil prices, the lingering effects of the pandemic, and the increase in remote work have impacted revenue. Reduced vehicle use has led to lower motor vehicle fines, while economic pressures have affected court activity and related revenues.

### **Departmental Presentations**

1. **Lottery Commission**:
   - **Revenue Streams**: The Commission generates significant profits through instant games (scratch tickets), multi-state games (Powerball, Mega Millions), Keno, iLottery, and sports betting via DraftKings. Sports betting alone brought in $23 million last year.
   - **Efficiency and Growth**: Administrative costs have remained flat while revenues have grown. New Hampshire ranks highly in per capita lottery sales nationally.
   - **Future Plans**: The Commission is preparing to bid for new technology to modernize its operations as current systems near the end of their life cycle.

2. **Department of Safety**:
   - **Highway Fund Revenue**: The Department oversees the collection of highway fund revenues, primarily from motor vehicle registrations, titles, and inspections. Projections for FY 2023-2025 show modest increases in registration fees and title revenues.
   - **Turnpike Revenue**: Turnpike toll revenues are projected to increase to $125 million in FY 2024 and $144 million in FY 2025.

3. **Liquor Commission**:
   - **Revenue and Operations**: The Commission is self-funded and generates significant revenue through liquor and wine sales, licensing fees, and taxes. Curbside pickup, initiated during the pandemic, has generated $7.6 million in sales since September 2020.
   - **Competition and Market Dynamics**: Total Wine & More is the biggest competitor, with 50% of the Commission's business coming from out-of-state customers. New competition includes Market Basket, Costco, and BJ's.
   - **Employee Challenges**: The Commission faces staffing shortages due to low wages ($12.38/hour starting pay) and high vacancy rates. A proposed incentive program aims to provide additional income to retail employees based on sales growth.
   - **Future Plans**: The Commission is expanding and renovating stores, with new locations in Ring, Concord, Manchester, Nashua, and Derry. Direct shipping and a new POS system are expected to drive future growth.

4. **Insurance Department**:
   - **Revenue and Operations**: 80% of revenue comes from premium taxes, with the remaining 20% from fees and penalties. The department regulates nearly 1,300 insurance companies and 200,000 licensees in the state.
   - **Challenges**: The department faces challenges with the high number of licensees, many of whom are not actively doing business in New Hampshire. The department focuses on consumer protection and ensuring companies pay claims fairly and promptly.

5. **Judicial Branch**:
   - **Revenue Sources**: The branch generates revenue through fines (motor vehicle and criminal), entry fees, and record research fees. Record research fees have generated approximately $36 million since 2015.
   - **Pandemic Impact**: The pandemic reduced court activity and revenue, with a rebound in FY 2022 followed by a drop in FY 2023 due to economic pressures.

### **Revenue Estimation and Budget Process**
The committee discussed the importance of accurate revenue estimates for budget planning. Key points included:

1. **Revenue Estimates**: Chris Shea, deputy legislative budget assistant, explained how revenue estimates are developed, with input from various agencies and the legislative budget assistance office.
   
2. **Tax Rates and Revenue Splits**: The committee reviewed current tax rates and how revenues are split between the general fund, education trust fund, highway fund, and fish and game fund. Specific attention was given to the business profits tax (BPT) and business enterprise tax (BET).

3. **Surplus Statement**: The surplus statement tracks adjustments to revenue estimates based on legislative changes and agency projections. This document is updated throughout the budget process to reflect the House, Senate, and committee of conference positions.

4. **Monthly Revenue Plan**: The Department of Administrative Services works with agencies to develop a monthly revenue plan, which estimates collections for various taxes. The monthly revenue focus report provides updates on actual collections compared to the plan.

5. **Medicaid and Liquor Transfers**: The potential end of the public health emergency could affect Medicaid rolls and related financial transfers, particularly the need for transfers from the Liquor Commission to cover costs.

### **Legislative Process and Future Plans**
The committee discussed the legislative process for developing a house resolution to present revenue estimates to the full House. This resolution is typically tabled after discussion, and the committee’s estimates are incorporated into House Bill 1, the operating budget. Future meetings were scheduled to hear presentations from agencies such as the Department of Revenue Administration, Department of Administrative Services, Treasury Department, Health and Human Services, and Fish and Game.
