**Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting – January 11, 2023**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on January 11, 2023, for an introductory session and procedural discussion, led by Chair Bob Lynn. The meeting focused on setting expectations, organizing workflows, and fostering collaboration among committee members. Key topics addressed included bill hearings, committee operations, and logistical matters, as well as broader priorities for the legislative session.

### **Committee Introduction and Priorities**
Chair Lynn welcomed newly elected members, congratulated them on their roles, and emphasized the importance of collaboration across party lines. Committee members introduced themselves, sharing their backgrounds, legislative experience, and priorities for the session. Key areas of interest included judicial reform, bail and detention reform, family court improvements, gun safety, abortion rights, landlord-tenant issues, and the right to know laws.

### **Bill Hearings and Collaboration**
Members discussed the importance of consulting with special committees or experts for complex bills, particularly those involving land review or DACA. Joint committees were suggested for undecided or intensive bills to ensure thorough analysis. The committee also planned to group similar bills for public hearings to streamline the process and improve efficiency.

### **Testimony and Procedures**
The committee outlined the process for handling testimony, emphasizing the need for written submissions in addition to oral presentations. Members were encouraged to treat witnesses with respect, avoid debates during hearings, and reserve contentious discussions for executive sessions. Witnesses were advised to speak clearly into microphones to ensure recordings are audible for public review. Members were also reminded to be patient with nervous or disabled witnesses, though lengthy verbatim readings were discouraged.

### **Committee Schedule and Logistics**
The committee typically meets on Wednesdays and Thursdays, with full-day sessions scheduled as needed to handle the workload. Members were reminded to be punctual and notify the chair if they needed to be excused. Public notice for hearings was emphasized, and members were encouraged to use the legislative portal for submitting testimony.

### **Resources and Research**
Members were advised to utilize legislative researchers and the Office of Legislative Services for assistance with bill analysis and questions. Richard Head, the Judicial Branch’s Government Affairs Coordinator, introduced himself and explained his role in providing information on how proposed legislation impacts the judicial system. While the judicial branch typically refrains from taking policy positions, it highlights operational and fiscal impacts of bills.

### **Substitute Members and Quorum**
In cases of absence, members were instructed to notify the chair or ranking member to arrange for substitutes, particularly during executive sessions where a quorum is required.

### **Committee Dynamics and Culture**
Chair Lynn encouraged active participation and respectful discourse among members, emphasizing fairness and inclusion. Members were reminded to avoid nonverbal cues that might discourage witnesses and to maintain collegial relationships despite political differences. Personal anecdotes about friendships across party lines were shared to underscore the importance of unity.

### **Bill Reports and Voting**
Responsibility for writing reports on bills will be distributed evenly among committee members. The chair anticipated that most bills would receive unanimous or nearly unanimous support, though some contentious issues might lead to divided votes.

### **Public Testimony and Accessibility**
Witnesses were encouraged to submit written testimony in addition to oral presentations. Remote sign-ins for public testimony were discussed to ensure accessibility, particularly for housing bills, which may overlap with a special housing committee.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which was unanimously approved. Overall, the session focused on setting expectations, organizing workflows, and fostering collaboration among committee members to address the diverse and complex issues before the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee.
