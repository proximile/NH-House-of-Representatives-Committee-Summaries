The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee met on January 31, 2023, to discuss several bills related to renewable energy, net metering, and energy policy. The meeting highlighted a range of issues, from expanding renewable energy access to addressing consumer concerns in the propane industry. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **House Bill 161: Group Net Metering for Customer Generators**
The committee began with **House Bill 161**, which aims to allow individuals or businesses who generate their own energy (e.g., through solar panels) to participate in group net metering arrangements. Previously, these arrangements were restricted to those without self-generation capabilities.

- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill seeks to expand renewable energy adoption by removing the exclusion for customer generators, potentially reducing energy costs and encouraging investment in renewables.
- **Concerns About Double Dipping**: Critics, including the Department of Energy (DOE), raised concerns about "double dipping," where customer generators might benefit twice from net metering. Supporters countered that utilities now have the tools to prevent such scenarios.
- **Economic Benefits**: Proponents argued that the bill would promote competition and reduce energy costs, particularly for businesses and individuals with partial solar generation.
- **DOE Opposition**: The DOE opposed the bill, suggesting it alters the original intent of group net metering and recommended waiting for the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to complete its review of net metering policies.

### **House Bill 234: Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and REC Sweeping**
Next, the committee discussed **House Bill 234**, which addresses the practice of "REC sweeping," where utilities claim unregistered RECs from renewable energy systems without compensating the owners.

- **Prime Sponsor Representative Rebecca McWilliams** argued that REC sweeping undermines the renewable portfolio standard (RPS), depresses REC prices, and violates property rights.
- **Testimony and Debate**: Concerns were raised about the potential increase in electricity costs for ratepayers if REC sweeping is eliminated. McWilliams countered that long-term benefits include diversifying energy sources and reducing reliance on natural gas.
- **DOE Testimony**: Griffin Roberge from the DOE provided neutral testimony, noting that eliminating REC sweeping could increase RPS compliance costs but might also promote a healthier REC market.

### **House Bill 246: Changes to the Renewable Energy Fund (REF)**
The committee then turned to **House Bill 246**, which proposes repurposing the Renewable Energy Fund (REF) to rebate funds directly to ratepayers, rather than using it for renewable energy grants and rebates.

- **Support for the Bill**: Proponents, including Americans for Prosperity, argued that the bill would provide immediate ratepayer relief during a time of high electricity costs.
- **Opposition to the Bill**: Opponents highlighted the REF’s economic benefits, noting that it has generated $177 million in economic activity and created jobs by supporting renewable energy projects.
- **Debate on Ratepayer Relief**: The bill’s mechanism for providing rebates was debated, with concerns raised about the minimal relief (approximately $6.25 per customer annually) and the loss of renewable energy investments.

### **House Bill 166: Changes to the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 166**, which proposes significant changes to the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), including eliminating useful thermal energy from renewable energy classes and capping RPS obligations.

- **Purpose of the Bill**: Representative Michael Harrington, the bill’s sponsor, emphasized transparency and reducing hidden subsidies on electric bills. He argued that ratepayers should not subsidize renewable energy projects, especially with federal funding available.
- **Impact on Renewable Energy**: The DOE testified that the bill would likely reduce RPS compliance costs but also decrease renewable energy funding for rebates and grants. The removal of biomass from Class 3 could impact low-grade wood markets.
- **Biomass Industry Concerns**: Representatives from the biomass industry argued that reducing RPS obligations would harm rural economies, forestry jobs, and energy diversity. They emphasized that biomass plants provide clean energy, local jobs, and a market for low-grade wood.

### **House Bill 81: Propane Industry Study Committee**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 81**, which proposes a study committee to examine ancillary charges for propane gas sales, following complaints from constituents about unfair practices.

- **Consumer Protection**: Testifiers shared personal and constituent experiences with propane companies, highlighting challenges in switching providers and disputes over tank ownership and fees.
- **Industry Response**: Bob Scully, representing the Propane Gas Association of New England, opposed the study committee, arguing that the industry can resolve consumer complaints internally.
- **Subcommittee Formation**: The committee decided to form a subcommittee to further study HB 81, with Representative Doug Thomas appointed as chair. The subcommittee will explore whether a study commission is necessary and consider proposing additional legislation.

### **Committee Scheduling and Voting**
Earlier in the meeting, the committee discussed experimenting with shorter public hearing durations (30 minutes instead of an hour) and rescheduling executive sessions to 1:00 PM to avoid late evenings. The committee also voted to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** **House Bill 165**, which addressed renewable portfolio standards for biomass, as it was deemed unnecessary due to administrative adjustments by the DOE.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing immediate ratepayer relief with long-term renewable energy investments. Key debates centered on the economic and environmental impacts of reducing RPS obligations, the fairness of REC sweeping, and the need for greater oversight in the propane industry. The committee will continue to deliberate on these bills and explore potential legislative solutions in future meetings.
