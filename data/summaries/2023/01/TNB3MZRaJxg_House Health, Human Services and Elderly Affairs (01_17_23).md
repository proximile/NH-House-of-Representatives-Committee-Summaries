#### **Key Presentations and Discussions**

1. **Behavioral Health and Mental Health Services**
   - **Community Behavioral Health Association (CBHA)**: Maggie Pritchett, CEO of CBHA, highlighted challenges faced by community mental health centers, including workforce shortages, wage gaps, and the need for increased Medicaid reimbursement rates. She advocated for Medicaid expansion reauthorization and expanded telehealth services.
   - **New Hampshire Hospital**: Ellen, the hospital’s CEO, discussed capacity issues, workforce challenges, and efforts to increase community-based services for patients with severe mental illness. The hospital is also involved in constructing a new forensic hospital.
   - **Behavioral Health Division**: Efforts to implement a 10-year mental health plan and a rapid response system for mobile crisis intervention were emphasized. The division is working to divert individuals from acute care settings through community-based services.

2. **Hospital Capacity and Financial Challenges**
   - **New Hampshire Hospital Association**: Reported 179 emergency department (ED) holds, including 53 behavioral health cases and 21 pediatric behavioral holds. Hospitals face significant barriers to discharging patients due to a lack of available beds.
   - **Financial Struggles**: Hospitals are operating at thin margins (around 1%) due to staffing shortages, delayed reimbursements, and discharge challenges. While no hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, some are in dire financial straits.
   - **Staffing Shortages**: Hospitals are heavily reliant on staffing agencies to fill gaps, particularly in nursing, which has driven up labor costs. Some hospitals have had to shut down wings due to staffing shortages.

3. **Medicaid and Healthcare Services**
   - **Medicaid Expansion**: Strong support was expressed for Medicaid expansion and permanent reauthorization of Medicaid funding. The state is advocating for Medicaid rate increases to support long-term care services, including nursing homes and community-based services.
   - **Medicaid Redeterminations**: Starting April 1, 2023, the state will begin the “unwind” of continuous Medicaid coverage, which could affect thousands of beneficiaries. Outreach efforts are underway to ensure individuals complete their eligibility redeterminations.
   - **Guardianship and Discharge Barriers**: Issues with guardianship and access to Medicaid for long-term services are critical barriers to discharging patients. An interagency working group has been established to address these challenges.

4. **Public Health and Social Services**
   - **Public Health Division**: Patricia Tilly, Director of Public Health, outlined the division’s focus on infectious diseases, data governance, emergency preparedness, maternal health, and vaccinations. Early childhood services and addressing maternal mortality were highlighted as key priorities.
   - **Bureau of Family Assistance**: Administrators discussed programs like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families). Strategies to mitigate the “cliff effect” (where individuals lose benefits as income increases) were explored, including pilot programs to disregard new income temporarily.
   - **Bureau of Housing Supports**: This bureau assists individuals and families facing housing instability or homelessness, providing rental assistance and support services.

5. **Long-Term Supports and Services**
   - **Division of Long-Term Supports and Services**: Programs aimed at keeping individuals in their communities rather than in nursing homes were discussed. Efforts include updating Medicaid rates and improving IT systems.
   - **State Commission on Aging**: Rebecca Sky, Executive Director, highlighted the commission’s focus on strengthening long-term care systems, growing the direct care workforce, and advancing age-friendly policies.

6. **Information Services and Data Governance**
   - **Information Services Division**: David Weeders, Director, discussed the department’s IT infrastructure, data governance, and security efforts to support DHHS programs.
