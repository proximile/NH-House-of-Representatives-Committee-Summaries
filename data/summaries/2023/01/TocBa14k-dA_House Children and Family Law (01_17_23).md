The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee convened on January 17, 2023, to address a range of legislative bills and issues related to child support, family law, the judicial system, and the rights of unmarried cohabitants. The meeting featured detailed discussions, public testimonies, and committee deliberations, with a focus on improving fairness, accountability, and legal protections for families and children.

### Key Discussions and Bills:

1. **Child Support and Family Law**:
   - **HB 126 - Child Support Payment Dates**: This bill proposes allowing child support payers to choose between the 1st or 15th of the month as their payment due date, offering flexibility to align with their financial schedules. Concerns were raised about consistency in payments, especially for self-employed individuals, and potential conflicts with wage garnishment laws. The committee suggested revisiting the bill's placement in the statute to avoid confusion.
   - **HB 108 - Penalties for False Claims to DCYF**: This bill aims to penalize individuals who make false claims to the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) with malicious intent. The sponsor emphasized that the bar for prosecution is high, targeting only those who repeatedly make false reports with intent to harm, not well-meaning but mistaken callers. The bill was reintroduced after stalling in the Senate the previous term.

2. **Judicial System and Family Division**:
   - **Circuit Court and Family Division Overview**: Judges Susan Ashley and Michael Garner provided an overview of the Circuit Court, which includes Family, District, and Probate divisions. Judge Garner focused on the Family Division, which handles cases like divorce, parenting, child support, domestic violence petitions, juvenile cases, and guardianship. He emphasized the high volume of cases and the challenges of managing them, including emergency motions and complex hearings.
   - **Parenting Plans and Mediation**: The judges discussed the importance of parenting plans in family cases, which are designed to help parents create agreements about their children's care. Mediation is mandatory in many cases, and the judges highlighted its success in resolving disputes without litigation.

3. **House Bill 218 - Court Rules, Transcripts, and Recordings**:
   - **Issues with Court Rules and Waivers**: The bill aims to address the Family Courtâ€™s ability to waive rules of evidence and courtroom conduct (Rules 1.2 and 2.2), which can lead to unfair proceedings and lack of due process.
   - **Problems with Transcripts and Recordings**: Testimony highlighted issues with court transcripts being incomplete or altered, with recordings being stopped and started during proceedings, leading to missing testimony and judicial misconduct going unrecorded. The high cost of obtaining transcripts ($1,700 for two days of testimony) was also noted as a barrier for litigants.
   - **Proposed Solutions**: The bill would allow parties to make their own recordings and transcripts, ensuring a more accurate record of court proceedings. It also seeks to prevent judicial misconduct by holding judges accountable for accurate recordings.

4. **House Bill 151 - Study Committee on Unmarried Cohabitants, Domestic Partnerships, and Common Law Marriage**:
   - **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill proposes a committee to examine the rights and responsibilities of unmarried cohabitants, domestic partners, and common law spouses. It highlights the need to address legal gaps that leave individuals vulnerable in situations like estate disputes or the disposition of a deceased partner's body.
   - **Legal Context**: New Hampshire recognizes common law marriage under specific conditions (e.g., cohabitation for three years and mutual acknowledgment as spouses). However, there are significant legal gaps, especially for unmarried couples who do not formalize their relationships through wills or contracts.
   - **Support and Opposition**: Advocates argue that the study is necessary to protect individuals in committed relationships, particularly when legal protections are absent or unclear. Some fear that criminalizing false reports of child abuse (discussed earlier in the meeting) might deter people from reporting legitimate concerns, potentially harming children.

### Public Testimony and Concerns:
Multiple representatives and stakeholders provided testimony, discussing the practical implications of the bills. Concerns were raised about the impact on families, the consistency of payments, and the potential for unintended consequences, such as passport or driver's license denials due to perceived delinquency in child support payments. Personal stories highlighted the emotional and financial toll of repeated false accusations of child abuse and gaps in the law for unmarried couples.

### Committee Deliberation and Future Plans:
The committee expressed the need for further legal review and potential amendments to ensure the bills align with existing statutes and address the intended issues without creating new complications. The hearing was adjourned with plans to revisit the bills after additional legal consultation. The committee outlined plans for upcoming sessions and coordination with the Senate on certain bills, such as funding for the Sununu Center's closure (House Bill 120). The importance of staying in sync with the Senate to avoid committee of conference delays was emphasized.

### Conclusion:
The meeting highlighted the complexities of ensuring accountability and fairness in family court proceedings while addressing concerns about privacy, judicial discretion, and the integrity of court records. The committee's focus remains on balancing the need to protect children from abuse while ensuring that good-faith reporters are not penalized, and addressing legal gaps for unmarried couples. The comprehensive discussions and testimonies underscored the importance of legislative efforts to improve the legal framework for families and children in New Hampshire.
