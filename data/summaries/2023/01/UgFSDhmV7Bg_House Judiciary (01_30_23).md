**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting (01/30/23)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on January 30, 2023, to discuss and vote on several bills and amendments, addressing a range of issues including **public facility usage**, **marriage rights**, **judicial retirement age**, **zoning laws**, **guardianship termination**, and **procedural updates**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **Public Facility Usage (HB 256)**
- **Amendment Discussion**: The committee debated an amendment to HB 256, which aimed to prevent municipalities from discriminating against individuals or groups using public facilities for lawful, non-commercial purposes. Concerns were raised about past misuse of facilities by certain groups, prompting debate on whether municipalities should retain discretion to deny access based on previous behavior.
- **First Amendment and Local Control**: The discussion touched on First Amendment rights, with references to the Skokie case involving Nazis marching through a town. Representatives debated whether distasteful or offensive speech should still be protected under the law. Several members argued that the issue should be resolved at the local level rather than through statewide legislation, emphasizing the differences between communities and the potential for overreach.
- **Commercial Use**: There was debate over whether public facilities should be allowed for commercial purposes, such as weddings or events, with some arguing it could generate revenue for towns.
- **Voting Outcome**: The amendment passed 15-5, but the main bill failed 7-13 after being amended. The committee ultimately voted 16-4 to indefinitely postpone the bill (ITL motion), effectively killing it.

#### **Marriage Rights (CACR5)**
- **Proposal**: The committee discussed a constitutional amendment (CACR5) to define marriage as a fundamental right for any two natural persons aged 18+ and outside one degree of consanguinity (second cousin or further).
- **Debate**: Concerns were raised about potential unintended consequences, such as legalizing polygamy, child marriage, or incest, though proponents argued the amendment clarified existing laws. Further discussion highlighted concerns about consent and the necessity of codifying a right already protected by law.
- **Voting Outcome**: The amendment passed 19-0 in committee, but the committee ultimately voted unanimously (20-0) to recommend "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), citing concerns about unintended consequences and the adequacy of existing protections.

#### **Judicial Retirement Age (CACR6)**
- **Proposal**: The committee debated a proposal to increase the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.
- **Debate**: Supporters argued it would retain experienced judges, while opponents questioned the need.
- **Voting Outcome**: The motion to pass the bill succeeded 18-2.

#### **Zoning and Religious Facilities (HB 663)**
- **Proposal**: The bill aimed to prevent municipalities from using zoning laws to restrict religious organizations from providing housing for the unhoused.
- **Debate**: Concerns were raised about vague language, potential conflicts with church-state separation, and litigation risks.
- **Voting Outcome**: The motion to retain the bill for further study failed 10-10, and the bill will proceed to the floor with no recommendation.

#### **Guardianship Termination (HB 162 and HB 169)**
- **HB 162**: The committee unanimously voted "Ought to Pass with Amendment" (20-0) on a bill related to termination of guardianship. The amendment adjusted the burden of proof in certain cases to "clear and convincing evidence."
- **HB 169**: Discussion on a similar bill was deferred to a subcommittee for further review. Concerns were raised about varying evidentiary standards and potential constitutional issues. A subcommittee was formed, with members Macbeth, Manos, and Turner appointed to report back by the next meeting.

#### **Other Bills Discussed and Voted On**
- **HB 67**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to recommend "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) on a bill allowing the right to review software source code in criminal cases, deeming it unnecessary and problematic.
- **HB 290**: The committee unanimously voted ITL (20-0) on a bill allowing constables to serve process for writs exceeding $75, citing concerns about inadvertently involving police officers in civil process serving.
- **HB 187**: Another unanimous ITL vote (20-0) on a bill permitting police chiefs to serve process, with members arguing it would burden law enforcement and detract from public safety.
- **HB 164**: The committee voted unanimously ITL (20-0) on a bill prohibiting towns from criminalizing peaceful assembly, citing existing Supreme Court rulings upholding such ordinances under specific conditions.

#### **Procedural Updates**
- The chair opened the meeting with procedural updates, including revised executive session schedules for the following week. Committee procedures were reviewed, emphasizing full debate on bills and the handling of amendments and motions.
- The committee also addressed other pending bills, including House Bill 240, for which a Minority Report was being prepared.
