Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and actions taken during the meeting:

---

#### **1. Infrastructure Funding and Development**
**House Bill 311: Wastewater Infrastructure Funding**  
- **Purpose:** This bill appropriates $15 million over two years to ensure timely state payments to municipalities for wastewater treatment projects, addressing past delays in funding.  
- **Sponsor Testimony:** Representative Tracy Emrick described the bill as a "belt and suspenders" approach to guarantee payments, which have been problematic in the past.  
- **Supporting Testimony:** Stakeholders like the New Hampshire Water Works Association and the New Hampshire Municipal Association emphasized the importance of reliable funding for infrastructure maintenance, housing expansion, and economic development. Concerns were raised about the additional costs of addressing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in water treatment, given evolving EPA standards.  
- **Committee Action:** The bill was referred to Division One for further review.  

**House Bill 384: State Parking Garage Construction**  
- **Purpose:** The bill proposes $25 million to construct a new parking garage with 375-450 spaces near the State House, replacing the deteriorating Storrs Street garage.  
- **Sponsor Testimony:** Representative Emrick outlined a two-year timeline for permitting, engineering, and construction.  
- **Supporting Testimony:** Speaker Sherman Packard stressed the urgent need for the garage, citing safety risks and insufficient parking for legislators and staff.  
- **Administrative Services Testimony:** Commissioner Charlie Arlinghaus and Public Works Director Ted Kupper provided details on the project, including accessible spaces and charging stations.  
- **Historical Context:** Representative Petrie noted past delays in replacing the garage, dating back to the 1990s.  
- **Committee Action:** No immediate action was taken, but the committee discussed the project’s necessity and design considerations.  

**Rail Trail Box Tunnel Construction Project**  
- **Discussion:** The committee considered cost savings and fiscal impacts related to eliminating a shared-use crossing and constructing a box culvert. Savings of $375,000 were highlighted, but concerns were raised about additional design and construction costs, potentially delaying the project by six months.  
- **Key Points:** The project aims to balance cost, safety, and usability, with stakeholders debating the merits of a direct tunnel versus a scenic route.

#### **2. State Retirement System and Pension Funding**
**House Bill 50: State Contribution to Retirement System**  
- **Purpose:** The bill seeks to reinstate the state’s contribution to the retirement system for teachers, police, and firefighters at 7.5%, reversing a previous reduction that shifted the burden to municipalities.  
- **Sponsor Testimony:** Representative Mike Edgar argued this would provide property tax relief and honor the state’s original promise.  
- **Supporting Testimony:** Organizations like the New Hampshire Municipal Association and Old Granite State Matters emphasized the financial benefits for municipalities and taxpayers.  

**House Bill 555: Paying Down Unfunded Liability**  
- **Purpose:** The bill proposes allocating 75% of surplus funds (above the rainy day fund threshold) to reduce the New Hampshire Retirement System’s (NHRS) unfunded liability, currently at $5.7 billion.  
- **Sponsor Testimony:** Representative Jeff Goley likened the approach to paying down a mortgage early to reduce future payments.  
- **Supporting Testimony:** The NHRS and New Hampshire Municipal Association supported the bill, highlighting its potential to lower future employer contributions and provide long-term financial stability.  
- **Concerns:** Questions were raised about the state’s flexibility to fund other projects during economic crises and the need for a sunset provision once the liability is paid off.  

**Historical Context and Broader Debate**  
- Representatives reviewed the state’s historical underfunding of the retirement system and the challenges posed by economic and actuarial uncertainties.  
- There was debate over shifting from a defined benefit plan to a 401k-style defined contribution plan, with arguments about employee retention versus long-term financial sustainability.
