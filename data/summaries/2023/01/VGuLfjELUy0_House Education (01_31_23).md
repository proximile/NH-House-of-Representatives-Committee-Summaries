**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/31/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 31, 2023, to discuss a wide range of education-related bills. The meeting focused on key issues such as special education funding, literacy and dyslexia screening, school infrastructure, civil rights education, and support for Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

---

### **Special Education Funding and Policy**
- **Concerns and Debates**: Representatives highlighted the lack of data on the costs and eligibility criteria for special education funding. There was significant discussion about the financial strain on smaller districts with high-cost special education students. The committee acknowledged the need for more time to refine the funding formula and policy to better support qualifying students.
- **HB 521 (Department of Education Payment for Placement for Treatment)**: This bill seeks to shift the financial burden of voluntary placements of students in mental health treatment facilities from local taxpayers to the state. The committee emphasized the importance of supporting students in crisis without overburdening local districts.
- **HB 577 (State Aid for Special Education Pupils)**: The committee discussed adjusting the catastrophic aid formula to reduce the threshold for state aid, making it more equitable for smaller districts. Further fiscal analysis is needed before taking action.

### **Literacy and Dyslexia Screening**
- **HB 377 (Literacy and Dyslexia Screening)**: The bill proposes literacy and dyslexia screening for students in kindergarten through third grade. Concerns were raised about the frequency of testing, accuracy of screening tools, and the practicality of implementation in smaller districts with limited resources. The committee debated timelines for testing and interventions, with some questioning whether the proposed deadlines (e.g., 30 or 60 days) are feasible.
- **HB 437 (Universal Dyslexia Screening and Reading Improvement Grants)**: This broader literacy initiative includes provisions for universal dyslexia screening and reading improvement grants. An amendment was proposed to expand the grant program to include second and third graders and to contract with a statewide literacy screening product. The committee discussed integrating HB 377 into HB 437 to create a more comprehensive approach.
- **Reading Specialist Program**: The committee reviewed the state’s underfunded reading specialist program, noting that while an in-house specialist is now available, funding remains a constraint.

### **School Infrastructure and Funding**
- **HB 365 (Statewide Facility Condition Assessment)**: This bill aims to improve the state’s school building aid program by encouraging districts to submit 10-year capital plans. Representatives highlighted the poor condition of many school buildings, some over 50 years old, and stressed the need for better planning and funding. The bill passed unanimously.
- **HB 334 (State Adequate Education Funding)**: The bill proposes adjusting the base adequacy grant for education funding to address disparities across districts. The committee agreed to further discuss the bill in a full work session.
- **HB 272 (Charter School Per-Pupil Funding)**: The committee deferred action on this bill, which seeks to increase per-pupil funding for charter public schools, pending further discussion on related funding issues.

### **Advisory Committee on Education of Students with Disabilities (HB 147)**
- The committee discussed restructuring the advisory committee to make it more functional. Proposed amendments included reducing the committee size, ensuring a majority of parents, and adding a healthcare provider specializing in pediatric learning disorders. There was debate about removing representatives from the Disabilities Rights Center and the Parent Information Center, with some arguing they provide valuable input. Ultimately, the amendments and bill were voted down.

### **Civil Rights Education (HB 309)**
- The bill aimed to mandate civil rights education in public schools. Concerns were raised about curriculum being a local issue and whether statutory changes would impact classroom instruction. The bill was voted down.

---

### **Math Learning Communities Program (HB 419)**
- This bill reinstates the Math Learning Communities program to improve math education and prepare students for college and careers. The program, which previously existed, helps high school students transition to college-level math and provides alternative tracks for students struggling with algebra. The bill includes an appropriation of $200,000 for teacher training and materials and passed unanimously.

---

### **Transportation for CTE Students (HB 364)**
- The bill revises the transportation reimbursement formula for students attending CTE centers. The current reimbursement rate of 10 cents per mile per pupil is insufficient, especially for smaller districts. The proposed formula is based on vehicle type, mileage, and the number of trips. The committee supported the bill, recognizing the need to reduce the financial burden on districts and encourage more students to attend CTE programs.

---

### **Data-Driven Decision-Making (HB 542)**
- This bill establishes a data analyst position in the Department of Education to improve data interpretation and support school districts. The committee emphasized the importance of using data to identify weaknesses in programs and make targeted improvements. The bill passed unanimously.
