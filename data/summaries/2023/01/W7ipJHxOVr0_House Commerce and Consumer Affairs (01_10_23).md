### **Insurance Department Overview**
The New Hampshire Insurance Department, represented by Commissioner Christopher Nicolopoulos and Deputy Commissioner DJ Bettencourt, provided an overview of its mission to promote a safe and competitive insurance marketplace. The department oversees nearly 200,000 insurance licensees, conducts financial and market conduct examinations, and investigates consumer complaints, recovering $4.1 million for consumers in 2022. Key points included:

### **Banking Department and Consumer Protection**
The Banking Department, described as primarily a consumer protection agency, supervises financial institutions, handles consumer complaints, and monitors licensed entities. The department is self-funded, with revenues from examination fees and fines. Key discussions included:
- **Cryptocurrency Regulation**: The department clarified its limited role in regulating crypto-to-crypto transactions, focusing instead on entities converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency.
- **Consumer Education**: Efforts to improve public access to information, including a potential consumer guide to insurance, were highlighted.

### **Cryptocurrency and Emerging Challenges**
Stakeholders discussed the challenges of regulating cryptocurrency under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and the need for clarity in state laws. The New Hampshire Bankers Association noted the cautious approach of banks toward cryptocurrency due to unclear regulatory frameworks.

### **New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC)**
The NHLC, one of 17 control states in the U.S., manages wholesale and retail liquor sales, generating $771 million in gross sales in FY22. Key points included:

- **Competition**: The NHLC faces significant competition from Total Wine, necessitating robust marketing and retail strategies.

### **Consumer Protection and Antitrust Efforts**
The Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau, part of the Attorney General’s Office, enforces the Consumer Protection Act (RSA 358-A) to address unfair or deceptive practices. The bureau handles thousands of complaints annually, using tools like subpoenas, investigations, and enforcement actions. Key initiatives included:
- **Elder Abuse Unit**: Focused on investigating and prosecuting financial exploitation and neglect of elders.
- **Charitable Trust Unit**: Oversees charitable organizations, ensuring they operate in the public interest and monitoring healthcare transactions.

### **Bureau of Securities**
The Bureau of Securities, under the Secretary of State’s Office, protects investors by enforcing securities laws, promoting responsible capital formation, and providing investor education. The bureau licenses securities representatives and products, conducts audits, and enforces regulations.

### **Retail Challenges and Consumer Experience**
The NHLC discussed retail challenges, including theft ("shrink") and staffing shortages, with ongoing efforts to improve pay scales and introduce incentive programs. Customer experience initiatives, such as curbside pickup and Google reviews, were highlighted, with 91% of reviews being four or five stars.

### **Legislative and Regulatory Priorities**
Throughout the meeting, stakeholders emphasized the need for additional resources to manage growing workloads and address emerging challenges like cryptocurrency and elder financial exploitation. Upcoming legislative efforts included modernizing money transmitter laws and addressing technical fixes to escrow account interest rates.

Committee members were encouraged to reach out to relevant departments for assistance with constituent concerns or legislative inquiries. The tone throughout the meeting was collaborative, with a strong focus on serving the needs of New Hampshire residents.
