**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting (January 18, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on January 18, 2023, for an organizational meeting and detailed discussion on the state’s budget process, financial status, and key fiscal priorities. The meeting highlighted the committee’s role in budget development, the state’s revenue and expenditure trends, and the challenges and opportunities facing New Hampshire’s financial management. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed across the three segments:

---

### **1. Budget Process Overview**
The Finance Committee plays a central role in reviewing and approving the state budget, which consists of two main components:
- **House Bill 1 (HB1)**: The primary budget bill containing appropriations for state agencies and programs. It includes footnotes that modify fund usage without requiring statutory changes.
- **House Bill 2 (HB2)**: The "trailer bill" detailing policy changes, tax adjustments, and other provisions necessary to implement the budget. It can suspend statutory requirements (e.g., rainy day fund rules) using "notwithstanding" language.

The committee faces a tight timeline, with six weeks to develop the budget after the governor presents it on February 15, 2023. Key deadlines include March 30 for reporting all House bills and early March for divisions to present recommendations to the full committee. The Senate has a longer timeline, benefiting from major revenue collection months (March and April).

### **2. State Financial Status**
- **Federal Funds**: New Hampshire has received nearly $2 billion in federal funds, including $1.25 billion from the CARES Act and additional COVID-19 relief through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). These funds are not part of the operating budget and will expire.
- **General Funds**: The state ended fiscal year 2022 with a surplus, with revenues exceeding legislative estimates by nearly $400 million. The undesignated fund balance was $361.3 million, which will carry over to the next fiscal year.
- **Education Trust Fund**: Supported by statewide education property tax and business taxes, this fund has seen sufficient revenue in recent years, reducing the need for transfers from the general fund.
- **Highway Fund**: Revenue has declined over the past decade due to increased vehicle efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles, necessitating additional support from the general fund.
- **Fish and Game Fund**: Increased revenues and general fund support have resulted in a healthy balance.

---

### **3. Budget Development and Oversight**
- **Revenue Estimates**: The House Ways and Means Committee provides critical revenue estimates, which guide budget development. The Senate benefits from more accurate estimates due to major revenue collection months occurring after the House budget is developed.
- **Lapsing vs. Non-Lapsing Funds**: Recent trends show a shift toward converting more budget items to non-lapsing funds, particularly in Health and Human Services (HHS). Lapsing funds (unspent money) can be reallocated or reprogrammed through HB2 or legislative specials.
- **Fiscal Committee Role**: The committee oversees post-budget adjustments, fund transfers, and expenditure approvals. It also manages federal funds, including significant inflows from COVID-19 relief.

---

### **4. Key Challenges and Trends**
- **Tight Timelines**: The House Finance Committee faces a compressed schedule to draft and finalize the budget.
- **Revenue Uncertainty**: Estimating revenues is challenging, particularly with major collection months occurring after the House budget is developed.
- **Federal Funds Management**: Managing large inflows of federal COVID-19 relief funds has added complexity to the budget process.
- **Double Counting**: Agencies like the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) charge other agencies for services, resulting in the same funds appearing in multiple budgets. Recent changes have improved transparency by removing double counts from totals.

---

### **5. Budget Categories and Divisions**
The budget is divided into six categories, each handled by specific divisions of the Finance Committee:
1. **General Government**
2. **Justice & Public Protection**
3. **Resources & Protection**
4. **Transportation**
5. **Health & Human Services**
6. **Education**

---

### **6. Fiscal Oversight and Transparency**
- **Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR)**: The ACFR, an audited financial report of the state’s expenditures and revenues, will be presented to the fiscal committee on January 27, 2023.
- **Compare Documents**: These track changes between the governor’s, House, and Senate budgets, ensuring transparency.
- **Visualizations**: Pie charts and bar charts are used to illustrate budget categories and funding sources, emphasizing the dominance of federal funds, the general fund, and the education trust fund.

---

### **7. Future Considerations**
- **Potential Outcomes**: If the budget is vetoed, a continuing resolution can maintain government funding at agreed levels until a final budget is passed. Historically, such resolutions have prevented government shutdowns.
- **Transparency Improvements**: The Finance Committee plans to provide detailed division breakdowns on the House website to improve transparency for new members.

---

### **8. Committee Structure and Expertise**
Committee members introduced themselves, highlighting their diverse expertise in finance, education, healthcare, and public service. Many have extensive legislative experience and have served multiple terms on the committee. The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) staff, led by Michael Kane, supports the committee in budget analysis and oversight.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s budget process, the importance of accurate revenue estimates, and the significant role of federal funds in recent budgets. The Finance Committee is committed to ensuring fiscal responsibility, balancing the budget, and addressing state priorities while navigating tight timelines and revenue uncertainties. Detailed discussions on specific budget items will continue in division meetings, with a focus on transparency and accountability.
