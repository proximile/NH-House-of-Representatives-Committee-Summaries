1. **House Bill 83**: The bill, which pertains to County Commissioners' authority over county buildings, was amended to increase the threshold for disposing of county property from $5,000 to $25,000. The amendment passed 18-1, and the bill itself was passed as amended with the same vote.

7. **House Bill 416**: This bill, which pertained to restrictions on local land use boards, was voted inexpedient to legislate due to lack of input and testimony, passing 19-0.

9. **House Bill 184**: This bill, relative to public notice requirements for Zoning Board of Adjustment hearings, was voted inexpedient to legislate due to concerns about internet access and the need for traditional newspaper notices. It passed 18-1.

10. **House Bill 197**: This bill, which aimed to prorate property tax exemptions, was amended to avoid requiring communities to re-adopt provisions under the RSA. Both the amendment and the bill passed unanimously.
