The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on January 27, 2023, covered a wide range of financial, operational, and policy issues across state agencies and programs. The meeting began with organizational matters, including the appointment of Senator Gray as vice chair and Michael Kane as legislative budget assistant, and the adoption of committee rules and procedures.

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

1. **Financial Oversight and Audits**:
   - **Audit Frequency**: A representative raised the possibility of increasing audit frequency to annual audits to enhance accountability and financial oversight.
   - **Statewide Audit Report**: KPMG presented the state’s financial audit, issuing a clean opinion with no material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Minor misstatements were noted, but the state’s internal controls and financial reporting processes were praised.
   - **Agency-Specific Audits**: The New Hampshire Turnpike System, Lottery Commission, and Liquor Commission all received clean audit opinions. The Liquor Commission’s audit noted an uncorrected misstatement related to post-employment benefits, while the Turnpike System corrected a significant deficiency related to lease accounting standards (GASB 87).

2. **Revenue and Cash Flow**:
   - **Liquor Sales Decline**: A $31 million decline in liquor revenue was discussed, with specific concerns about drops in Peterborough and Nashua. Sales, which peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased at-home consumption, have since declined but remain above pre-pandemic levels. The agency was commended for opening new stores to recapture revenue.
   - **Cash Flow Timing**: A representative inquired about $8 million in payments to other state agencies, a significant increase from the previous year’s $623,000. The discrepancy was attributed to cash flow timing issues at the end of the fiscal year.

3. **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**:
   - **Caseloads and Staffing**: Questions were raised about caseloads not returning to pre-pandemic levels and delays in residential treatment contract approvals, attributed to staffing shortages.
   - **WIC Program**: Funding was approved for a contractor to help WIC participants better utilize their benefits, which declined during the pandemic.
   - **Medicaid Managed Care**: The committee discussed penalties imposed on managed care organizations for failing to meet performance standards.
   - **Tablets for Correctional Facilities**: DHHS requested funds for tablets to provide infectious disease training in prisons, with questions raised about long-term maintenance.
   - **ARPA Funding**: The committee discussed the use of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for homeless health care, workforce retention bonuses, and other programs, with concerns about sustainability after ARPA funding ends.
   - **Presumptive Eligibility**: DHHS shifted from presumptive eligibility to a diversion program focusing on community-based support services.

4. **Other Agency Approvals and Discussions**:
   - **New Hampshire Fish and Game Department**: Questions were raised about the implementation timeline for online renewals and new registrations for off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs).
   - **Emergency Rental Assistance**: Concerns were expressed about the tight housing market and potential inflationary effects of rental assistance programs under ARPA.
   - **Department of Education**: The committee discussed the use of funds allocated for lead abatement in schools, with only a portion of the funds used due to low lead levels. Additional testing may require future expenditures.

5. **Performance Audit**: The committee approved a performance audit for the Commission for Human Rights with an 8-2 vote, despite some dissent.

6. **Public Messaging and Transparency**: Committee members emphasized the need for clear public messaging, particularly regarding the implementation of online registration systems for OHRVs and the impact of rental assistance programs on the housing market. Updates to the DHHS dashboard were also discussed to provide more accurate and visual data.

7. **Consent Calendar**: Several items were approved via the consent calendar, including funding requests from the Department of Military Affairs, Veterans Services, and Environmental Services. Some items were removed for further discussion.

8. **Scheduling and Adjournment**: The committee agreed to hold its next meeting on February 17, 2023, at 10:00 AM, with adjustments made to accommodate members’ schedules. The meeting concluded with a unanimous motion to adjourn.

### Overall Themes:
The meeting emphasized financial accountability, transparency, and efficient use of state and federal funds. Discussions highlighted challenges related to revenue declines, staffing shortages, and the long-term sustainability of pandemic-related programs. The committee also focused on improving operational efficiency and public communication across state agencies.
