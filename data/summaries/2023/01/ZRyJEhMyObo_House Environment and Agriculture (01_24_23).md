**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (01/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 24, 2023, to discuss several key bills and issues related to environmental protection, agricultural practices, and waste management. The meeting featured extensive testimony from legislators, stakeholders, and experts, focusing on food waste reduction, fertilizer fee allocation, rodenticide regulation, and solid waste management. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Food Waste Reduction and Solid Waste Management**
1. **House Bill 300 (HB 300)**:  
   - This bill aims to **prohibit the disposal of certain food waste** in landfills or incinerators for businesses generating **one ton or more of food waste per week**, provided there is an alternative facility within **50 miles** to process the waste.  
   - The bill prioritizes diverting food waste to **food banks, farms, composting facilities, or anaerobic digesters**, following the **food recovery hierarchy** (feeding humans first, then animals, composting, etc.).  
   - **Key Benefits**: Reducing food waste in landfills would cut **methane emissions**, a potent greenhouse gas, and align with New Hampshire’s **Solid Waste Management Plan** goals (25% diversion by 2030, 45% by 2050).  
   - **Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the availability of composting and anaerobic digestion facilities, logistical hurdles for businesses, and the need for **additional state resources** to enforce the bill.  

2. **House Bill 462 (HB 462)**:  
   - This bill proposes amendments to the **Solid Waste Management Fund** to prioritize food and organic waste reduction and diversion, allocating **50% of the fund** to such projects until June 2027.  
   - It expands funding sources to include gifts, donations, legislative appropriations, and federal grants.  
   - **Support**: Stakeholders, including **New Hampshire Audubon**, **Conservation Law Foundation**, and **DES**, emphasized the financial and environmental benefits of diverting food waste, which constitutes **24% of municipal solid waste**.  

3. **Regional Collaboration and Pilot Programs**:  
   - Testimonies highlighted the success of **regional collaboration** and pilot programs in towns like **Hollis**, **Amherst**, and **New London**, which have effectively implemented composting and food waste diversion initiatives.  
   - **Educational Programs**: Initiatives in **Hollis Elementary Schools** and **Great Bay Community College** demonstrated how tracking food waste can lead to sustainable practices and cost savings.  

### **Fertilizer Fee Allocation (HB 494)**
- **Representative Peter Bixby** introduced a bill to redirect fees from fertilizer registrations and tonnage fees into a dedicated fund for administering the fertilizer program.  
- **Purpose**: Currently, these fees go into the general fund, with no guarantee they will be used for agricultural purposes. The bill ensures these fees are used specifically for fertilizer quality oversight and related agricultural needs.  
- **Benefits**: Provides stability for the fertilizer program and prevents budget cuts from affecting its operations.  

### **Second-Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides (HB 326)**
1. **Support for the Ban**:  
   - Wildlife advocates, including **New Hampshire Audubon** and wildlife rehabilitators, testified that **second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs)** are causing significant harm to **raptors (e.g., hawks, owls, eagles)**, foxes, and other predators. Poisoned rodents are consumed by predators, leading to **secondary poisoning**.  
   - Studies, including one from **Tufts University**, found that over **80% of raptors tested positive for anticoagulant rodenticides**.  
   - **Alternatives**: Supporters advocated for non-chemical methods like **snap traps**, **exclusion**, and **integrated pest management (IPM)**.  

2. **Opposition to the Ban**:  
   - Pest control professionals argued that SGARs are essential for controlling rodent populations, especially in **commercial settings** like restaurants and food processing plants.  
   - They warned that banning SGARs could increase costs for businesses and homeowners, leading to DIY solutions that may result in improper use and label violations.  
   - **Economic Impact**: Opponents highlighted potential negative effects on **New Hampshire’s tourism industry** if rodent infestations in hotels or restaurants lead to poor reviews and business losses.  

3. **Proposed Solutions**:  
   - **Working Group**: Some suggested forming a working group, including wildlife rehabilitators and pest control professionals, to study the issue and propose solutions.  
   - **Restricted Use**: Others proposed making SGARs **restricted-use pesticides**, limiting access to licensed professionals to reduce misuse.  

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**
1. **Balancing Environmental and Economic Needs**: The discussions underscored the need to balance environmental protection with practical agricultural and pest control needs.  
2. **Funding and Infrastructure**: Many bills highlighted the importance of **state funding** and **regional collaboration** to develop infrastructure for waste diversion and composting.  
3. **Scientific Evidence and Regulation**: Several speakers emphasized the need for **scientific research** and alignment with **federal regulations** (e.g., EPA guidelines) to inform state policies.  
4. **Next Steps**: Bills like HB 300 and HB 326 will likely move to the **finance committee** to address fiscal implications, while others may involve further study and collaboration among stakeholders.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s commitment to addressing critical environmental and agricultural issues, from food waste reduction to wildlife protection. While there is strong bipartisan support for many initiatives, the success of these efforts will depend on **adequate funding**, **infrastructure development**, and **collaborative solutions** that balance diverse stakeholder interests.
