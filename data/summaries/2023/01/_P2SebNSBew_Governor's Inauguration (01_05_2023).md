The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 5, 2023, for the inauguration of Governor Chris Sununu. The session began with procedural matters, including adjourning the previous session, granting leaves of absence, and introducing guests. A joint convention with the Senate was formed to hear the report of the Joint Committee on vote counts for the governor and executive council, followed by the inauguration ceremony.

Key highlights of the ceremony included:

1. **Inauguration of Governor Sununu**: Governor Chris Sununu was sworn in for his fourth term by Chief Justice Gordon J. MacDonald. In his inaugural address, Sununu emphasized New Hampshire’s successes, including its strong economy, low taxes, and commitment to individual freedom. He highlighted the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its investment in education, and its efforts to address the opioid crisis. Sununu also stressed the importance of bipartisanship, especially in addressing the looming energy crisis and ensuring affordable energy for residents.

2. **Executive Council Oaths**: The executive councilors were also sworn in, with Sununu congratulating them on their roles.

3. **Focus on Energy Crisis**: Sununu addressed the energy crisis, calling for bipartisan solutions to reduce costs for families and businesses. He emphasized the need to explore renewable energy options like offshore wind and hydropower while rejecting policies that would impose additional costs on residents.

4. **Defense of New Hampshire’s Primary**: Sununu strongly defended New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary, criticizing attempts by national Democrats to replace it with South Carolina’s primary. He vowed to protect New Hampshire’s tradition of giving all candidates a fair shot, regardless of their name recognition or funding.

5. **Commitment to Bipartisanship**: Sununu acknowledged the narrowly divided legislature and called for cooperation across party lines to address challenges. He emphasized the importance of putting constituents first and delivering results rather than engaging in political extremism.

6. **Local Control and Individual Freedom**: Sununu reiterated New Hampshire’s commitment to local control, individual responsibility, and limited government. He criticized policies that impose mandates or restrict freedoms, emphasizing the state’s "Live Free or Die" ethos.

7. **Civic Engagement**: Sununu highlighted the importance of civic engagement and education, praising programs like New Hampshire Civics and the Kid Governor initiative. He encouraged lawmakers to set an example for young people by working together and focusing on solutions.

The ceremony concluded with a benediction by Pastor Michael Worsley, who prayed for the state’s leaders and thanked those who participated in the event. The joint convention adjourned, and the House session continued with procedural motions before recessing to the call of the chair.
