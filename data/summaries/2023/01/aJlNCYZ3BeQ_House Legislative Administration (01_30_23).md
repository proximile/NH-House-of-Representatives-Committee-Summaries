The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 30, 2023, chaired by Representative Greg Hill, focused on legislative administration and addressed several key bills and proposals. The meeting emphasized professionalism, public engagement, and ethical considerations while tackling a range of legislative issues, from conflicts of interest and constitutional amendments to legislative compensation and monetary policy.

### Key Discussions and Bills:

#### **House Bill 301: Conflicts of Interest and Ethics**
The committee discussed **House Bill 301**, which aims to establish clearer guidelines for legislators to recuse themselves in cases of conflicts of interest. The bill defines conflicts of interest as financial or personal interests that could influence a legislator’s performance, including fiduciary responsibilities. Key points included:
- **Federal Reserve Act Context**: A representative explained Section 16, Part 15 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, highlighting the process of monetizing Federal Reserve notes and referencing historical audits and Fort Knox.
- **Ethics and Recusal**: The bill seeks to simplify and clarify existing ethics rules, particularly around financial and non-financial interests, to help legislators, especially new ones, understand when to recuse themselves.
- **Constitutional Concerns**: House Clerk Paul Smith raised potential constitutional issues, noting the bill might exceed compensation limits set by the state constitution.
- **Future Work**: The committee plans additional work sessions to refine the bill, possibly incorporating input from the Ethics Committee, with a focus on bipartisan balance.

#### **CACR3: Recall Procedures for Elected Officials**
Representative Moffatt introduced **CACR3**, a constitutional amendment to enable the legislature to create a recall procedure for elected officials, particularly for local boards and counties with longer-term positions. Key points included:
- **Need for Recall Mechanism**: Moffatt argued that the lack of a recall procedure allows problematic officials to remain in office for extended periods, citing examples of rogue board members causing issues in municipalities.
- **Scope and Criteria**: The amendment would allow the legislature to discuss and create a recall mechanism but would not define specific criteria. Committee members inquired about its applicability to county and municipal levels.

#### **CACR4 and House Bill 245: Legislative Compensation and Monetary Policy**
The committee also debated two proposals related to legislative compensation and the use of gold and silver as legal tender:
- **CACR4**: Representative Walt Stapleton proposed amending the state constitution to update legislative compensation, which has remained unchanged since 1889. The amendment aims to adjust salaries to contemporary values, addressing financial inequities that exclude many qualified citizens from serving. The proposal would take effect in 2024, subject to voter approval.
- **House Bill 245**: Representative Santana Estacio presented a bill requiring the state to pay legislators in silver coins, citing Article 1, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution, which mandates the use of gold and silver for debt payments. Estacio argued this would provide a permanent solution to inflation and align with constitutional principles.
  - **Opposition**: Stapleton opposed the bill, arguing that reintroducing silver coins would create unnecessary costs and complications, as the U.S. dollar is the current standard of exchange.
  - **Support**: Estacio defended the bill, emphasizing the global recognition, inflation resistance, and constitutional mandate of silver coins. Joseph Haas, co-founder of VOCALS, also testified, suggesting the state should redeem Federal Reserve notes for gold and silver coins rather than purchasing new ones.

### Committee Procedures and Public Engagement
The chairman emphasized the importance of professionalism, punctuality, and respectful engagement during public hearings. He outlined the committee’s operating procedures, including handling public testimony, maintaining decorum, and collaborating efficiently. Members were reminded to attend active shooter training and notify the chair of absences. The committee’s researcher, Jennifer, was praised for her work in providing background information on bills.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to refining legislation on conflicts of interest, recall procedures, and legislative compensation while addressing constitutional and ethical concerns. The discussions underscored the importance of bipartisan collaboration, public trust, and adherence to constitutional principles. Future work sessions were planned to further refine the bills and incorporate additional input.
