### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (January 25, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Consumer Affairs convened on January 25, 2023, to discuss several key bills, focusing on consumer protection, cannabis legalization, alcohol regulation, and public health. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

### **Consumer Protection and Banking Oversight**
**House Bill 459** aimed to amend the state’s Consumer Protection Act by eliminating exemptions for regulated industries such as banks, insurance companies, and car dealerships. The bill sought to restore enforcement powers to the Attorney General’s office and allow private citizens to sue these entities for unfair or deceptive practices.  
- **Support**: The Attorney General’s office, represented by **Brandon Garod**, argued that the current exemption weakens consumer protections and hampers enforcement efforts.  
- **Opposition**: Industry representatives, including the New Hampshire Insurance Department and the New Hampshire Bankers Association, contended that their sectors are already heavily regulated, and the bill could increase costs without improving protections.  
- **Outcome**: A subcommittee will review the bill, with potential amendments to balance consumer protections and regulatory efficiency.

### **Wine Industry Regulation**
**House Bill 612** proposed changes to the wine industry, including allowing wine manufacturers to provide samples, adjusting the tax structure, and exempting a certain volume of wine from taxes for home use.  
- **Key Issues**: The current tax structure imposes a 13.5% tax on wine, which is seen as unsustainable and unfair compared to the beer industry.  
- **Economic Impact**: The wine industry struggles with high taxation, deterring new entrants, while the beer industry thrives.  
- **Environmental and Agricultural Benefits**: Wineries support local farming, tourism, and sustainable practices.  
- **Legislative Requests**: Testimony called for renaming "wine manufacturer" to "winery," eliminating double taxation, and reducing excise taxes to foster industry growth.

### **Tobacco and Alcohol Regulation**
**House Bill 531** proposed changes to tobacco taxation and the use of tobacco settlement funds, allowing the administration to adjust tax rates based on market conditions.  
- **Support**: The American Heart Association highlighted public health benefits, including reduced youth smoking.  
- **Opposition**: Vaping store owners and the New Hampshire Vapors Association argued that tax increases would harm small businesses and stimulate black-market activity.  

**House Bill 279 (Elizabeth Croak Law)** increased penalties for establishments that over-serve alcohol, raising fines and license suspension periods.  
- **Rationale**: The bill honors Elizabeth Croak, who died due to an intoxicated driver, and aims to deter over-serving and increase accountability.  
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the subjective nature of determining intoxication and the potential impact on businesses.

### **PFAS in Carpets and Rugs**
**House Bill 465** sought to ban the sale of carpets and rugs with intentionally added PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) by July 1, 2025.  
- **Rationale**: PFAS contamination poses significant public health and environmental risks.  
- **Support**: The bill aligns with regional efforts in Maine and Vermont.  
- **Concerns**: The Department of Environmental Services raised resource constraints for effective regulation.

### **Cannabis Legalization**
**House Bill 639** proposed the legalization and regulation of adult-use recreational cannabis, sparking extensive debate.  
- **Support**: Proponents argued that legalization would align New Hampshire with neighboring states, generate revenue, reduce the black market, and address racial disparities in cannabis arrests.  
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including law enforcement and public health advocates, warned of adverse health impacts, increased youth use, and the persistence of the black market.  
- **Key Provisions**: The bill proposed a **Cannabis Advisory Board**, regulated sales, and protections for Second Amendment rights.  
- **Public Opinion**: Polling showed **74% of Granite Staters** in favor of legalization.  

**House Bill 544**, which proposed state-run cannabis dispensaries, faced criticism for lacking regulatory safeguards and competing with existing alternative treatment centers.

3. **Public Health and Safety**: Bills addressing alcohol over-serving, PFAS, and cannabis legalization emphasized the importance of protecting public health and safety.  
4. **Social Justice**: Cannabis legalization discussions underscored the need to address racial disparities and expunge past criminal records.  
5. **Stakeholder Perspectives**: Industry representatives, public health advocates, and law enforcement provided diverse viewpoints, reflecting the complexity of the issues.  

The committee will continue to review and refine these bills, considering amendments to address concerns and ensure balanced, effective legislation.
