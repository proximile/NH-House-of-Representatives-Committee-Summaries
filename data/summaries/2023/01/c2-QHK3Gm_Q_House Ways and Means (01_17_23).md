### **Legislative Discussions**

#### **House Bill 60: Camping Fees for Non-Residents**
- **Prime Sponsor:** Representative Petrucic introduced the bill, which proposes increasing camping fees for out-of-state residents in New Hampshire. The bill was inspired by a constituent who noted that other states (e.g., Massachusetts) charge higher fees for non-residents, while New Hampshire does not.
- **Key Points:**
  - The bill aims to generate additional revenue for the state and prioritize New Hampshire residents for camping reservations.
  - Concerns were raised about the potential financial impact on the state park system, as 65% of campers are out-of-state visitors.
  - Brian Wilson, Director of the Division of Parks and Recreation, testified that the department already has authority to set fees but cautioned against alienating out-of-state campers, which could negatively impact revenue.
  - The committee discussed the constitutionality of prioritizing residents and the need for further analysis of revenue implications.

#### **House Bill 121: Worldwide Combined Reporting for Unitary Businesses**
- **Prime Sponsor:** Representative Schamberg presented the bill, which seeks to repeal the "water’s edge" method of taxation for multinational corporations, replacing it with worldwide combined reporting. This would require multinationals to pay taxes on their global income, not just U.S.-based income.
- **Key Points:**
  - The bill aims to level the playing field for New Hampshire businesses and domestic companies, which currently compete with multinationals that can shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions.
  - The Coalition for a Prosperous America supported the bill, emphasizing that it would benefit small businesses and workers in the state.
  - Representative Spilsbury, chair of a commission studying the issue, recommended retaining the bill for further study, as the commission’s work is ongoing and the topic is complex.
  - Concerns were raised about the potential impact on large employers in New Hampshire and the need for input from affected industries.

### **Economic and Labor Market Overview**

1. **Economic Outlook**:
   - The speaker expressed optimism about avoiding a recession, citing stable household finances (particularly middle and upper-income households), moderating inflation, and slowing job growth as positive indicators.
   - Lower-income households are struggling, and inflation remains a concern, though it is easing.
   - While a majority of economists predict a U.S. recession, the speaker believes it will likely be mild, and New Hampshire is well-positioned to weather economic challenges.

2. **Labor Market**:
   - Job growth is slowing, which is viewed positively by the Federal Reserve as it helps moderate wage inflation. Employers are reluctant to lay off workers due to past hiring difficulties, which could mitigate the severity of a potential recession.
   - Labor force participation remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly among younger workers, partly due to child care disruptions and costs.
   - Long-term demographic trends, such as an aging population, are expected to constrain labor force growth.
   - Approximately 120,000 New Hampshire residents commute out of state for work, primarily to Massachusetts, while 80,000 workers commute into New Hampshire.

3. **Sector-Specific Employment**:
   - Retail, hospitals, nursing facilities, and restaurants have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic employment levels. Child care establishments and employment in that sector are down by 6% and 11%, respectively.
   - Job postings have increased, indicating demand for workers, but labor shortages persist.

### **State Revenues and Tax Policies**

1. **Federal Funds and State Revenue**:
   - The meeting highlighted the significant impact of federal grants, particularly COVID-19 relief funds, on state revenues and the economy. Over $17 billion in federal aid has been infused into New Hampshire since March 2020, which is larger than the state's two-year budget.

2. **State Tax Revenue Sources**:
   - The primary state tax revenue sources include the Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET), which together account for a significant portion of general and education trust fund revenues. Other notable sources include the meals and rentals tax, real estate transfer tax, and interest and dividends tax.

3. **Revenue Trends**:
   - The discussion covered recent revenue trends, noting a significant increase in business tax revenues since 2021, driven by economic recovery and federal tax policy changes. However, other revenue sources, like the tobacco tax, are expected to decline.
   - The BPT has become increasingly significant as a state revenue source, with a shift from a 60-40 split with the BET to a 70-30 split in recent years.
   - Interest and dividends tax revenues have surged but are set to phase out starting in 2023.
   - Meals and rentals tax revenues have rebounded post-pandemic, though growth may slow as inflation eases.
   - Real estate transfer tax revenues have risen due to housing demand and price increases, but supply constraints and higher interest rates may slow growth.

4. **Upcoming Bills and Hearings**:
   - The meeting outlined upcoming bills related to tax cuts, including reductions in the Business Enterprise Tax and the elimination of the communications services tax. The committee also planned to hold hearings on these bills and continue discussions on revenue estimates.

### **Challenges and Opportunities**

1. **Housing and Inflation**:
   - Rental increases and housing sales prices are slowing, which is encouraging as shelter costs make up a significant portion of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Gasoline prices have also eased.
   - Housing availability remains a constraint, particularly for younger residents moving into the state due to remote work opportunities.

2. **Remote Work**:
   - Remote and hybrid work arrangements are likely here to stay, with 15-20% fewer workplace trips compared to pre-pandemic levels. This trend is supported by Google Mobility data.

3. **Consumer Spending**:
   - Consumer spending is slowing but remains positive year-over-year, supported by stable incomes and limited layoffs. Dining out in New Hampshire, for example, has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, indicating a resilient economy.

4. **Child Care and Workforce Growth**:
   - Child care access, housing affordability, and education are critical to supporting workforce growth and economic stability. Lower-income households face increasing financial pressures, with a significant portion struggling to cover basic expenses.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the importance of balancing revenue generation, economic competitiveness, and fairness in legislative decisions. The committee emphasized the need for further analysis and stakeholder input on proposed bills, particularly those affecting state revenues and the economy. The discussions also underscored the challenges posed by inflation, housing affordability, and labor force constraints, while noting the opportunities presented by remote work and demographic shifts. Overall, New Hampshire is well-positioned to navigate economic uncertainties, but careful planning and policy adjustments will be essential to ensure long-term stability and growth.
