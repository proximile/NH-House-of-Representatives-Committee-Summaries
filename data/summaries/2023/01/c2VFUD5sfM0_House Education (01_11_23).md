**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/11/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 11, 2023, to address a wide range of education-related topics, including special education, curriculum standards, school board qualifications, and specific legislative proposals. The meeting featured detailed discussions, testimonies, and debates on various bills and issues, emphasizing the balance between state mandates and local control in education.

### **Key Discussions and Bills**

1. **Special Education and Correctional Facilities**  
   The committee examined the representation and educational services for students with disabilities in correctional facilities. It clarified that state and county correctional facilities have distinct responsibilities: state facilities provide education through Granite State High School, while county facilities collaborate with local education agencies (LEAs). A debate arose over whether removing a county representative from a committee would affect support for incarcerated students with disabilities. The Department of Education (DOE) assured that LEAs would continue to ensure students receive necessary services.

2. **HB 102: Teaching Communism in Schools**  
   Representative Mike Moffett introduced HB 102, which requires high schools to dedicate one hour to teaching the history and nature of communism. Moffett argued that many students lack awareness of communism's global impact, and the bill aims to address this gap while allowing flexibility for local implementation. Opponents, including the New Hampshire School Administrators Association and the New Hampshire School Boards Association, argued that curriculum decisions should remain local, as many districts already cover these topics. Concerns about unfunded mandates and lack of accountability were also raised.

3. **Minimum Standards for Public School Approval (HB 306s)**  
   The committee discussed significant revisions to the minimum standards for public school approval, with a focus on curriculum aspects and local school board decision-making. Social studies standards were noted as stalled and in need of broader community input.

4. **School Board Member Qualifications (HB 103)**  
   This bill addresses the prohibition of educators running for school boards in districts other than where they are employed within the same School Administrative Unit (SAU). Testimony highlighted the need to revise the RSA to allow such candidacies, with recusal requirements for conflicts of interest.

5. **Surety Bonds for Career Schools (HB 168)**  
   The bill aims to adjust surety bond requirements for post-secondary career schools, making it more feasible for new schools to start while protecting students' tuition. Testimony emphasized the financial burden of current bond requirements and the need for balance between student protection and school startups.

6. **Division of Educator Support and Surety Indemnification (HB 155)**  
   This bill modifies statutory language related to the Division of Educator Support in Higher Education and surety indemnification for private post-secondary career schools. Changes include removing certain commission appointment requirements and clarifying bond and indemnification language.

7. **HB 71: Repealing Redundant DOE Report on Charter School Funding**  
   Representative Maureen Mooney introduced HB 71 to repeal a redundant DOE report on charter public school funding, which became moot after a 2016 law change. The DOE supports the bill, as the information is already publicly available.

8. **HB 147: Adjusting Advisory Committee on Students with Disabilities**  
   Representative Caitlin Kutabâ€™s bill proposes removing a county correctional facility representative from the advisory committee and adding a health care provider specializing in children. The bill aims to streamline the committee and enhance its effectiveness.

9. **Cursive Writing and Multiplication Tables (RSA 189:11-c)**  
   Representative Deb Hobson presented a bill to change the term "encourage" to "require" in RSA 189:11-c, mandating the teaching of cursive writing and multiplication tables. Supporters highlighted cognitive benefits, particularly for students with learning disabilities like dyslexia. Opponents, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association, advocated for local control and suggested incorporating such requirements during the revision of state standards (Ed 306).

10. **Higher Education Commission Changes**  
    Steve Appley, Director of Educator Support and Higher Education, discussed a bill to clean up the membership of the Higher Education Commission, addressing quorum challenges and outdated representation, such as the absence of for-profit colleges in the state.

### **Administrative and Procedural Matters**
- The committee discussed scheduling for upcoming sessions, including a DOE presentation on January 17 at Granite State College, which will be streamed for public access.  
- Emphasis was placed on addressing bills with fiscal notes (FN) by February 16.  
- The committee reviewed new bills, distributed materials, and coordinated logistics for upcoming discussions.  

### **Themes and Takeaways**
- **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: A recurring theme was the tension between state-imposed educational requirements and the desire for local control over curriculum and school policies.  
- **Special Education and Equity**: Ensuring equitable educational services for students with disabilities, particularly in correctional facilities, was a priority.  
- **Curriculum Modernization**: Discussions highlighted the need to adapt educational standards to prepare students for the modern world, including debates on teaching cursive writing, multiplication tables, and the history of communism.  
- **Regulatory Balance**: The committee sought to balance regulatory requirements with the practical needs of educational institutions, as seen in discussions on surety bonds and career schools.  

The meeting concluded with plans to continue detailed discussions on specific bills, schedule hearings, and prepare for upcoming presentations, ensuring that legislative actions align with the best interests of students and the educational community.
