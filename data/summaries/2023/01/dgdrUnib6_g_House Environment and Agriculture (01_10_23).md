### **2. Department of Agriculture and Environmental Programs**
- **Certification and Licensing**: The certification coordinator ensures proper licensing and timely renewals, while the Environmental Protection Program manager oversees inspections. Inspectors hold dual state and federal credentials for pesticide inspections.
- **Staffing and Challenges**: The division faces staffing shortages, outdated IT systems, and the need for legislative updates to accommodate new technologies. Efforts are underway to fill vacancies and improve efficiency through IT upgrades.
- **Legislative and Regulatory Issues**: A proposed bill to ban a certain class of rodenticides was discussed, with the division opposing it due to concerns about rodent control. The division supports integrated pest management and collaborates with the University of New Hampshire and other organizations for training and outreach.
- **Public Health and Safety**: The division collaborates with the Department of Public Health and Human Services on mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., West Nile Virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis) and tick-related issues (e.g., Lyme disease). They also work on worker protection standards for agricultural workers.
- **Federal Partnerships**: The division receives federal funding from the Environmental Protection Agency and collaborates with the USDA on programs like organic certification and seal quality for agricultural products.
- **Educational Outreach**: The division conducts training and outreach to educate the public and regulated communities about regulations and best practices, participating in events like the New Hampshire Farm, Forest, and Garden Expo.
- **Metrology Lab**: Efforts are ongoing to fully operationalize the Metrology lab, which is crucial for maintaining state standards and ensuring accurate measurements.

### **3. Agriculture and Food Safety**
- **Dairy Industry**: The Dairy Sanitation Program ensures consistent regulation of milk and milk products across state lines. New Hampshire has 89 active dairy farms and 64 processing plants, with over a thousand water and milk samples tested annually.
- **Bottled Water and Beverages**: The state requires additional testing documentation for bottled water beyond federal regulations. Recent regulatory changes require bottled water manufacturers to adhere to the same drinking water standards as public water systems, including PFAS limits.
- **Shellfish and Aquaculture**: The Shellfish Program regulates molluscan shellfish dealers and harvesters, with the aquaculture industry growing significantly in recent years. Seaweed and kelp harvesting for food are not currently regulated, though there is interest in other applications like cosmetics and brewing.
- **Mushroom Harvesting**: A class for mushroom harvesters, mandated by recent legislation, is a priority for the spring season, with efforts underway to establish the course.
- **Foodborne Illness and Emergencies**: The department responds to food emergencies, monitors FDA and USDA recalls, and investigates foodborne outbreaks with support from local self-inspecting cities and state infectious disease control teams.

### **4. Environmental Protection and Waste Management**
- **Oil and Hazardous Waste Remediation**: The Waste Management Division manages petroleum storage, responds to spills, and oversees the cleanup of contaminated sites. The Oil Discharge and Disposal Cleanup Fund provides financial assistance for spill cleanups.
- **Hazardous Waste Sites**: The Hazardous Waste Remediation Bureau oversees the investigation and cleanup of hazardous waste sites, including Superfund and Department of Defense sites. Emerging contaminants like PFAS are a focus, with ongoing studies to understand their impact on soil and groundwater.
- **Solid Waste Management**: The Solid Waste Management Bureau ensures proper management of solid waste through training, technical assistance, compliance assurance, and permitting.
- **PFAS Contamination**: PFAS were detected in all 100 randomly selected sites across the state, with concentrations generally below 1 part per billion. The state is working with the USGS to study PFAS occurrence and leaching, with results expected soon.
- **Funding and Projects**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) has significant funding from ARPA and the Infrastructure Bill for water, wastewater, and dam projects. DES is managing unprecedented amounts of work and funding to support local communities.

### **5. Animal Industry and Disease Control**
