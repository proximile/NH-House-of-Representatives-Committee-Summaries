### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Criminal Justice and Public Safety (01/20/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 20, 2023, convened by the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, addressed a wide range of issues, including access to feminine hygiene products for incarcerated women, the exemption of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from the Controlled Drug Act, police training on constitutional law, gun rights for non-violent felons, and the legality of certain self-defense tools. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and legislative proposals from the meeting:

---

### **1. Feminine Hygiene Products for Incarcerated Women**
- **Issue**: Formerly incarcerated women testified about inadequate access to feminine hygiene products (e.g., tampons, pads) and clean underwear while in correctional facilities. They described health risks, such as infections and toxic shock syndrome, due to insufficient supplies.
- **Current Practices**: The NH Department of Corrections stated that state facilities provide unlimited hygiene products and new underwear, but practices vary in county jails.
- **Proposed Legislation**: **HB 421** aims to codify access to menstrual hygiene products for incarcerated women, aligning with similar laws in 15 other states. Some representatives suggested expanding the bill to include clean underwear and sheets.
- **Funding Concerns**: There was debate about whether the bill would impose unfunded mandates on counties, potentially violating the state constitution’s Article 28a.

### **2. Exemption of DMT from the Controlled Drug Act**
- **Issue**: **HB 216** seeks to exempt DMT, a naturally occurring psychedelic substance, from the Controlled Drug Act. Advocates argued that DMT has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual practices and that its restriction violates religious freedom.
- **Religious Use**: Testimonies from members of Ayahuasca churches and the Shire Free Church highlighted DMT’s role in spiritual healing and self-reflection. They emphasized its non-addictive nature and therapeutic potential for mental health issues like PTSD and addiction.
- **Medical Research**: Speakers referenced ongoing studies at institutions like Johns Hopkins University, which explore DMT’s potential to treat depression and addiction.
- **Safety Concerns**: Law enforcement officials raised concerns about impaired driving, accessibility to children, and the lack of a specific test for DMT impairment.
- **Legal and Constitutional Issues**: The discussion centered on the New Hampshire Constitution’s protection of religious freedom and alignment with U.S. Supreme Court decisions recognizing the use of psychedelics in religious practices.

### **3. Police Training on Constitutional Law**
- **Issue**: **HB 302** proposes increased constitutional training for police officers to ensure they understand and uphold constitutional rights.
- **Current Training**: John Skippa, Director of NH Police Standards and Training, testified that recruits receive a 12-hour course on constitutional law, including scenario-based training. Plans for annual in-service legal updates were also discussed.
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to address concerns about qualified immunity and improve officers’ ability to navigate complex situations, such as interactions with individuals openly carrying firearms.

---

### **4. Gun Rights for Non-Violent Felons**
- **Issue**: The committee debated restoring gun rights to individuals with non-violent felony convictions who have completed their sentences.
- **Opposition**: Critics argued that the current annulment process is costly and cumbersome but necessary to ensure public safety.
- **Support**: Proponents contended that non-violent felons should retain their Second Amendment rights for self-defense and family protection, advocating for state sovereignty over federal prohibitions.

---

### **5. Repeal of Prohibitions on Self-Defense Tools**
- **Issue**: **HB 144FN** proposes repealing RSA 159:16 and 159:17, which prohibit the possession and sale of blackjacks, slung shots, and brass knuckles.
- **Arguments for Repeal**: Advocates argued that these tools are non-lethal and historically used for self-defense, especially by women. They criticized the laws as outdated and rarely enforced except as secondary charges.
- **Redundancy**: Some representatives noted that existing assault laws already cover the use of any object as a weapon, making specific prohibitions unnecessary.
- **Accessibility**: The discussion highlighted the disparity in access to self-defense tools, with firearms being expensive and potentially out of reach for some individuals.

---

### **6. Criminal Penalty for Theft by Public Servants**
- **Issue**: **HB 292** aims to establish criminal penalties for public officials who make decisions or authorize expenditures in illegal, secret meetings.
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to enhance transparency and accountability in local government by holding officials responsible for actions taken outside legal meetings.
- **Penalties**: Proposed penalties include fines or felony charges for unauthorized expenditures over certain amounts, with the goal of incentivizing transparency without excessively punishing volunteers.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Feminine Hygiene Products**: The meeting highlighted systemic issues in correctional facilities and the need for consistent access to essential hygiene products for incarcerated women.
- **DMT Exemption**: The discussion on DMT centered on balancing religious freedom and therapeutic potential with public safety concerns.
- **Police Training**: Increased constitutional training for police officers was proposed to improve their understanding of constitutional rights and reduce potential violations.
- **Gun Rights and Self-Defense Tools**: The committee debated the restoration of gun rights for non-violent felons and the repeal of outdated prohibitions on self-defense tools, emphasizing individual rights and public safety.
- **Government Accountability**: The proposed criminal penalties for public officials aim to enhance transparency and accountability in local government.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of addressing systemic issues, protecting constitutional rights, and balancing individual freedoms with public safety. The discussions reflected a commitment to improving policies affecting vulnerable populations, law enforcement practices, and government transparency.
