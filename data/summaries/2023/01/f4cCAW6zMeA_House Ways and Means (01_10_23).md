### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 10, 2023)

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on January 10, 2023, to discuss a wide range of topics related to state revenue, taxation, and committee operations. The meeting was divided into three segments, focusing on tax policy, committee procedures, and revenue forecasting. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Tax Policy and Business Taxation**
The committee delved into several tax-related issues, with a particular focus on business taxes and credits:
- **Business Enterprise Tax (BET) and Business Profits Tax (BPT):**  
  - The BET and BPT are parallel tax systems in New Hampshire. BET credits can be applied against BPT liabilities, and unused credits can be carried forward for up to 10 years.  
  - An example illustrated how BET credits reduce BPT liabilities and the mechanics of carryforwards.  
- **Tax Credits:**  
  - The **Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit** was highlighted, with a $7 million pool distributed proportionally among applicants.  
  - Other credits discussed included the Coos County Credit, ERZ Credit, CDFA Credit, Education Tax Credit, Insurance Premium Tax Credit, and CTE Centers Tax Credit.  
- **Multi-State Taxation and Nexus:**  
  - **Nexus** was defined as the connection between a taxpayer and a state, with New Hampshire adopting **economic nexus** (based on business activity) alongside traditional physical presence.  
  - **Public Law 86-272** protects out-of-state businesses from income tax if their activities are limited to soliciting orders.  
  - **Apportionment** now uses a **single sales factor**, focusing solely on sales rather than property, payroll, and sales.  
- **Unitary Filing:**  
  - New Hampshire requires businesses with common ownership or control to file combined tax returns to prevent income shifting. This applies only to U.S.-based entities (water’s edge).  
- **Foreign Entities and Global Taxation:**  
  - The **Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)** provision requires U.S. companies to report certain foreign income, with New Hampshire taxing 50% of GILTI on BPT returns.  
  - A committee is investigating a potential move to **worldwide reporting**, which would include foreign entities in New Hampshire tax filings.  
- **Interest and Dividends Tax (IND):**  
  - The IND tax applies to residents with gross interest and dividend income exceeding $2,400 (single filers) or $4,800 (joint filers). Exemptions are available for seniors, blind individuals, and disabled persons under 65.  
  - The IND tax is being phased out, decreasing annually from 5% in 2022 to 0% by 2027.  
- **Distributions and Entity Taxation:**  
  - Distributions from S-corporations are taxable under the IND tax, while distributions from LLCs with non-transferable shares are not. Retirement plan distributions (e.g., RMDs) are exempt.

### **2. Committee Procedures and Planning**
The meeting also focused on committee operations and planning for the legislative session:
- **Welcome and Introductions:**  
  Chair Lori Sanborn welcomed members and emphasized teamwork and collaboration. Committee members introduced themselves, sharing their expertise in tax policy, budgeting, education, and public service.  
- **Committee Processes:**  
  - The Chair outlined procedures for public hearings, executive sessions, and the use of "pink cards" for testifiers.  
  - Members were reminded to ask clarifying questions through the Chair during hearings and to avoid debating or arguing with presenters.  
- **Scheduling and Deadlines:**  
  - The committee plans to meet Monday through Wednesday, sharing the room with the Criminal Justice Committee.  
  - Initial focus will be on revenue estimates, agency presentations, and bill hearings. Revenue estimating typically begins in February.  
- **Decorum and Collaboration:**  
  - Members were reminded to limit distractions (e.g., phone use) during hearings and maintain a respectful, orderly, and fair process.  
  - The Chair highlighted the committee’s history of bipartisan cooperation and collegiality.

### **3. Revenue Forecasting and Operational Issues**
The committee discussed revenue forecasting, dedicated funds, and operational challenges:
- **Revenue Estimates and Budget Process:**  
  - The committee provides revenue estimates to the Finance Committee for crafting the state budget.  
  - Revenue estimates are based on current data but may need revisions, especially regarding business tax receipts in April.  
- **Tax Cuts and Revenue Impact:**  
  - Evaluating tax cuts is challenging without fully understanding their impact on revenue. Fiscal impact statements and input from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and industry stakeholders are used to assess these impacts.  
- **Static Analysis and Revenue Forecasting:**  
  - The committee uses static analysis for revenue forecasting, which relies on historical data. Members expressed interest in exploring non-static analysis methods for more accurate forecasting.  
- **Dedicated Funds:**  
  - The committee reviewed its role in overseeing dedicated funds, ensuring they are used effectively and not left idle.  
- **Gambling and Revenue:**  
  - The committee has jurisdiction over gambling-related revenue and policy issues, which can be complex and time-consuming.  
- **Training and Email Management:**  
  - Members suggested training on managing legislative emails, which are subject to public records requests.  
- **Field Trip Proposal:**  
  - The committee considered a field trip to a tobacco distribution facility to better understand tobacco tax collection and the supply chain process.

### **4. CPA Society Presentation**
The New Hampshire Society of CPAs provided an overview of the state’s business taxes:
- **Business Profits Tax (BPT):**  
  - A net income tax on business activity in New Hampshire, with a rate of 7.6% for 2022 and 7.5% for 2023.  
- **Business Enterprise Tax (BET):**  
  - A 0.55% tax on dividends, compensation, and interest expense paid by businesses.  
- **Adjustments to Federal Taxable Income:**  
  - Necessary for New Hampshire tax purposes, such as differences in Section 179 expense and bonus depreciation.  
- **Reasonable Compensation Deduction:**  
  - Allows certain businesses to deduct owner compensation, with a safe harbor of $75,000.  
- **Net Operating Losses (NOLs):**  
  - Can be carried forward for 10 years, with a limit of $10 million.

### **Next Steps**
The committee plans to revisit these topics in more detail, especially as they relate to specific legislation and revenue impacts. Presenters offered to share their notes with the committee for further reference. The meeting concluded with a reminder to reconvene after lunch for additional discussions, including a presentation from the CPA Society.  

Overall, the meeting set the stage for a collaborative and focused legislative session, emphasizing education, teamwork, and effective decision-making on tax and revenue issues.
