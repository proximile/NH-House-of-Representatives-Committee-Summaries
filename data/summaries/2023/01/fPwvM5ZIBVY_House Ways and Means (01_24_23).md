The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on January 24, 2023, to discuss several tax-related bills, focusing on their economic impact, revenue implications, and alignment with the state’s fiscal priorities. The meeting highlighted the ongoing tension between providing tax relief to businesses and individuals and maintaining sufficient revenue to fund essential state services. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **House Bill 15: Reducing the Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes reducing the BET rate from 0.55% to 0.5%, fulfilling a promise made in the 2017 state budget to provide tax relief to businesses.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - Supporters, including Dennis Hall of Americans for Tax Reform and Simon Thompson of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), emphasized the importance of honoring commitments to the business community and reducing the tax burden on small businesses.
  - Proponents argued that the reduction would stimulate economic growth, encourage investment, and enhance New Hampshire’s reputation as a business-friendly state.
- **Arguments Against**:
  - Opponents, including Representative Timothy Horrigan and small business owner David Trumbull, expressed concerns about fiscal responsibility, particularly given the state’s reliance on one-time federal pandemic funds.
  - Critics argued that the reduction would have a minimal economic impact while potentially jeopardizing funding for critical services like education and infrastructure.
- **Revenue Impact**: The fiscal note estimates a revenue loss of $28.3 million, representing approximately 1.3% of the state’s FY 2022 tax collections.

### **House Bill 133: Repealing the Communications Services Tax**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to eliminate the communications services tax, which includes taxes on wireless services.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - Testimony highlighted the regressive nature of the tax, which disproportionately affects lower-income individuals, and argued for simplifying the tax code to align with New Hampshire’s “no sales tax” identity.
- **Arguments Against**:
  - Some representatives questioned the tax’s historical context and its impact on state revenue, particularly as it applies to modern communication services like Zoom and VoIP.
- **General Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the state’s reliance on volatile revenue sources and the potential for future revenue shortfalls.

### **House Bill 192 and House Bill 100: Interest and Dividends (IND) Tax**
- **House Bill 192**: This bill proposes reviving the IND tax at its long-standing rate of 5% and updating exemptions, which have been frozen since 1977. Supporters argued it provides a stable revenue source, particularly as federal stimulus programs wind down, while critics claimed it discourages wealthy individuals and businesses from relocating to New Hampshire.
- **House Bill 100**: The bill aims to accelerate the phase-out of the IND tax from January 1, 2027, to January 1, 2024. Proponents argued this would make New Hampshire more competitive in attracting wealthy residents and businesses, while opponents warned of potential revenue losses and the disproportionate benefit to high-income individuals.
- **Revenue and Economic Impact**: The debate centered on balancing the potential economic benefits of tax cuts against the need for stable revenue, particularly during economic downturns.

### **Revenue Trends and Economic Resilience**
- Representatives discussed New Hampshire’s historical revenue trends, noting the state’s delayed recovery from recessions, particularly the Great Recession of 2008.
- There was interest in comparing New Hampshire’s tax revenues with those of other New England states, though data limitations were acknowledged.
- A planned presentation on a 10-year revenue trend (starting from 2012) was discussed, with some suggesting extending the analysis to include the Great Recession for better context.

### **General Themes and Concerns**
- **Volatility of Business Taxes**: Concerns were raised about the state’s reliance on volatile business taxes, which could lead to revenue shortfalls during economic downturns.
- **Balancing Tax Cuts and Services**: Representatives debated the need to balance tax relief with investments in critical areas like housing, infrastructure, and social services.
- **Long-Term Fiscal Stability**: The discussions underscored the importance of maintaining a stable tax base to ensure the state’s resilience in uncertain economic times.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of tax policy decisions, with lawmakers grappling with the trade-offs between providing tax relief and ensuring adequate funding for state services. The discussions emphasized the need for careful consideration of revenue projections, economic impacts, and long-term fiscal stability as the committee evaluates these bills.
