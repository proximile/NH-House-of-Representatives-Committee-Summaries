### **Key Issues and Bills Discussed**

#### **1. Water Quality and Cyanobacteria Management**
- **Phosphorus and Cyanobacteria Blooms**: Rising water temperatures and phosphorus loading in freshwater bodies have led to an increase in harmful cyanobacteria blooms, which pose significant ecological and public health risks. These blooms impact recreational activities, drinking water supplies, and local economies, particularly in areas like Lake Winnipesaukee.
- **House Bill 276**: This bill proposes the creation of a **Cyanobacteria Mitigation Loan Fund** to provide financial assistance for projects aimed at reducing nutrient pollution, upgrading septic systems, and restoring wetlands. The fund would support watershed management plans, technical investigations, and community education efforts.
- **House Bill 727276**: A similar bill, it seeks to establish a **$25 million loan fund** to address cyanobacterial blooms, with a focus on mitigation, investigation, and management. The fund would offer loans, grants, and loan forgiveness, with an emphasis on collaboration between municipalities, lake associations, and private property owners.
- **Economic and Recreational Impact**: Clean lakes are vital for tourism, property values, and local tax bases. Cyanobacteria blooms have been shown to deter visitors, reduce property values, and harm local economies.

#### **2. PFAS Contamination**
- **House Bill 212**: This bill aims to expand the **PFAS Remediation Loan Fund**, renaming it the **PFAS Response Fund**, and allocating $2 million for testing, scientific investigation, and managing EPA drinking water standards. It includes provisions for loan forgiveness for individuals affected by well contamination.
- **Statewide Impact**: PFAS contamination is a significant issue in New Hampshire, particularly in Southern New Hampshire, where industrial discharges have contaminated drinking water, soil, and wildlife. Testimonies from the **Loon Preservation Committee** and **New Hampshire Audubon** highlighted the need for PFAS testing in wildlife, especially loons, due to bioaccumulation risks.

#### **3. Septic System Challenges**
- **Aging Infrastructure**: Many older and non-conforming septic systems near lakes are failing, contributing to water pollution. Funding and incentives were proposed to help homeowners upgrade or replace these systems.
- **House Bill 247**: This bill streamlines regulations around protective well radii and septic systems, eliminating redundant reporting requirements and simplifying the process for homeowners and contractors. It is supported by the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** and industry stakeholders.

#### **4. Natural Disaster Recovery and Water Assistance**
- **House Bill 534**: This bill codifies an existing program under the **Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund** to assist low-income homeowners in repairing or replacing private wells damaged by natural disasters, particularly droughts. The program has already aided 147 homeowners since 2021.
- **Drought Context**: New Hampshire has faced severe droughts, especially in the southern tier, where federal disaster assistance is often unavailable. The bill provides state-level aid to ensure access to clean water for vulnerable populations.
- **Economic and Housing Impact**: The program helps families stay in their homes and avoid the financial burden of relocating due to water shortages, addressing both the housing crisis and water access issues.

### **Funding and Collaboration**
- **Funding Needs**: A recurring theme throughout the meeting was the need for increased funding to address these environmental challenges. While federal funding is available for certain issues, such as emerging contaminants in drinking water, it often falls short of covering broader lake management and recreational impacts. State-level funding is essential to fill these gaps.
- **Collaborative Efforts**: The bills emphasize collaboration between state agencies, municipalities, lake associations, and private property owners. Programs like **Lake Smart Lake Friendly Living** and **Lake Congress** were highlighted as effective initiatives for educating residents on best practices for lakefront living and reducing pollution.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Urgency of Action**: The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing water quality issues in New Hampshire, particularly in light of climate change, development pressures, and aging infrastructure.
- **Economic and Ecological Impact**: Clean water is vital for the state’s economy, public health, and ecological well-being. Polluted water bodies negatively impact tourism, property values, and local economies.
- **Legislative Support**: The bills discussed aim to provide financial assistance, streamline regulations, and promote collaborative efforts to protect New Hampshire’s water resources. Strong bipartisan support was evident for measures addressing PFAS contamination, cyanobacteria blooms, septic system failures, and drought recovery.
- **Future Steps**: The meeting highlighted the importance of continued funding, scientific investigation, and community engagement to effectively tackle these challenges and ensure the long-term health of New Hampshire’s water resources.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting emphasized the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and public health issues related to water quality in New Hampshire. The proposed bills reflect a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges, focusing on funding, collaboration, and legislative support to protect the state’s water resources and ensure a sustainable future.
