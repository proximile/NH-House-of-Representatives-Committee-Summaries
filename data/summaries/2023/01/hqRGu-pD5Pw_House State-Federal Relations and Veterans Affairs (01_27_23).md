**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 27, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee meeting on January 27, 2023, addressed several key issues, including gun violence prevention, Puerto Rico's political status, and the potential for a Convention of States under Article V of the U.S. Constitution. The meeting featured extensive debates, testimonies, and discussions on these topics, reflecting a range of perspectives and concerns.

### **1. Gun Violence Prevention (HR8)**
The committee focused on **House Resolution 8 (HR8)**, which urges Congress to enact federal legislation regulating and banning certain semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. Key points from the discussion included:
- **HR8 Overview**: The resolution argues that the lack of federal regulations on semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines poses a significant risk to public safety, necessitating uniform nationwide laws.
- **Feinstein Bill**: Representative Ames referenced a Senate bill introduced by Senator Feinstein, which seeks to ban 205 military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, with exemptions for law enforcement and military personnel.
- **Opposition to HR8**: Representative Hole, speaking for the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition, argued that HR8 would only impact law-abiding citizens and criticized the characterization of modern rifles as "assault weapons."
- **Support for HR8**: Representative Selig and others testified in favor of the resolution, emphasizing the military design of weapons like the AR-15 and their role in mass shootings.
- **Second Amendment Debate**: The discussion included a broader debate on the Second Amendment, with opponents arguing that HR8 infringes on the right to bear arms, while supporters contended that military-style weapons should not be protected.
- **Statistics and Data**: Both sides presented data on gun violence, with supporters citing reductions in mass shootings during the 1994 federal assault weapons ban and opponents highlighting New Hampshire's low gun violence rates.
- **Public Safety Concerns**: Supporters stressed the need to protect children and communities, while opponents argued that more laws would not prevent criminals from obtaining weapons and could harm the state's gun manufacturing industry.

### **2. Puerto Rico's Political Status**
The committee also discussed Puerto Rico's political status and the broader issue of statehood. Key points included:
- **Puerto Rico's Status**: Puerto Rico is currently a U.S. territory, often referred to as a colony, and does not pay federal taxes. The discussion explored the implications of Puerto Rico becoming a state, including potential tax obligations.
- **Democratic System**: The need for a legally binding referendum to determine Puerto Rico's status was emphasized, with speakers arguing that the current system is not truly democratic.
- **Cultural and Economic Considerations**: Concerns were raised about the potential loss of cultural identity and indigenous language if Puerto Rico became a state.
- **Bipartisan Support**: The resolution regarding Puerto Rico's status was described as non-partisan, with support from both Democrats and Republicans.
- **Historical Context**: Past referendums in Puerto Rico and the varying opinions among Puerto Ricans regarding statehood, independence, and other forms of political status were discussed.
- **Testimonies and Support**: Various representatives and individuals provided testimonies in support of the resolution, emphasizing the importance of self-determination for Puerto Ricans.

### **3. Convention of States (HCR1)**
The committee debated **HCR1**, a resolution calling for a Convention of States under Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose amendments addressing federal overreach, fiscal responsibility, and term limits. Key points included:
- **Purpose of the Convention**: Supporters argued that the convention is necessary to rein in federal overreach, reduce the national debt, and impose term limits on Congress.
- **Runaway Convention Concerns**: Opponents expressed fears that the convention could deviate from its intended scope, leading to unintended amendments. Proponents countered that multiple safeguards are in place to prevent this.
- **Historical Context**: Speakers referenced historical precedents, including the 1787 Constitutional Convention, to argue that multi-state conventions have historically stayed within their mandates.
- **Delegate Control**: States have the authority to appoint and control delegates, ensuring they adhere to the convention's scope.
- **Federal Debt and Overreach**: Supporters highlighted the $32 trillion federal debt and the need for fiscal responsibility as key reasons for the convention.
- **Opposition Views**: Critics argued that the federal government is not out of control and that an Article V convention is unnecessary.
- **Nonpartisan Appeal**: Supporters stressed that the Convention of States movement is nonpartisan, appealing to both Democrats and Republicans.
- **Call to Action**: Speakers urged the committee to pass HCR1 unanimously and send it to the full House for debate, emphasizing the urgency of addressing federal overreach and fiscal irresponsibility.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Gun Violence Prevention**: The discussion underscored the need for comprehensive solutions to gun violence, beyond just mental health care and minor security measures.
- **Puerto Rico's Self-Determination**: The resolution reflects a broader call for Puerto Rico to have the right to determine its political status, with a focus on addressing historical injustices and economic challenges.
- **Convention of States**: The debate highlighted deep divisions over the potential risks and rewards of the Convention of States, with both sides invoking constitutional principles and historical precedents to support their positions.

The meeting concluded with plans for further deliberation on the resolutions, reflecting the complexity and importance of the issues discussed.
