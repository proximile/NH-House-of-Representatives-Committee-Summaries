The transcript from the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on January 18, 2023, primarily focuses on the budget process, roles of budget analysts, and procedural details for handling amendments and fiscal notes. Key points include:

1. **Budget Analysts' Role**: The budget analysts assist divisions by preparing amendments, managing fiscal notes, and ensuring logistical details for public hearings and work sessions. They also track bills with fiscal impacts and flag appropriations or revenue-related amendments.

2. **Division Responsibilities**: Division I handles a significant portion of fiscal notes and budget-related work. The division prepares amendments for House Bills 1 and 2 and supports committee members in proposing amendments.

3. **Budget Process Overview**: The process involves agency budget submissions, governor's budget hearings, and legislative review. Agencies submit budget requests, which are reviewed by the governor and then presented to the House Finance Committee. The committee works on amendments, prepares briefing documents, and presents highlights to the full House before voting.

4. **Efficiency vs. Prioritized Needs**: The budget includes an "efficiency budget" (maintaining current programs with inflation adjustments) and "prioritized needs" (new or expanded programs ranked by priority). Agencies often discuss why certain items were included or excluded from the governor’s budget.

5. **Deadlines and Schedule**: Key deadlines include the final data report by March 30th, with divisions presenting their work to the full committee in late March. The Senate has a longer review period, from April to June.

6. **Collaboration with Ways and Means**: The Finance Committee coordinates with the Ways and Means Committee to align budget estimates and revenue projections.

7. **Performance Audits**: Members emphasized the importance of reviewing performance audits to identify recurring issues in agencies, such as Corrections and Liquor Commission, and hold them accountable.

8. **Debt Service and Treasury**: The Treasury’s large budget numbers are primarily for debt service, which is a fixed cost and not subject to significant adjustments.

9. **Documentation and Resources**: Analysts provide detailed budget documents, including historical data and position counts, to assist committee members in their review.

The meeting concluded with discussions on improving transparency and accountability in agency operations, particularly in light of recent audits and budget challenges.
