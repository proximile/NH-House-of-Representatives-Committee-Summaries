**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (January 18, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 18, 2023, to discuss several bills addressing issues in commerce, consumer affairs, healthcare, and housing. The meeting featured extensive debates, stakeholder testimonies, and legislative proposals aimed at improving transparency, accountability, and fairness in various sectors. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting.

---

### **1. Audit Transparency and Homeowners Association (HOA) Protections**
- **Audit Transparency**: Concerns were raised about the lack of independence and transparency in audits conducted by property managers and boards of directors. Representatives suggested involving non-board members in the audit process to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure accountability, particularly in cases of potential fraud or embezzlement.
- **HOA Protections**: Representative Davis introduced a bill to prevent a single corporate entity or individual from purchasing a majority of units in an HOA, which could lead to dissolution and shift infrastructure costs to municipalities. The bill proposes amending the voluntary associations chapter of New Hampshire law to require a planning board hearing before an HOA can be dissolved. The New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed this requirement in all cases, suggesting it should only apply when the HOA was a condition of approval for the development. Representative Davis proposed an amendment to address this concern.

### **2. Condominium Associations and Financial Transparency**
- **Condominium Liens and Foreclosures**: The committee discussed **House Bill 178**, which aims to allow condominium associations to foreclose on abandoned units when financial institutions fail to act. This would enable associations to recover unpaid fees and prevent financial burdens on other unit owners. The New Hampshire Bankers Association opposed the bill, citing potential risks for lenders and the condominium market. Supporters argued that the bill would address unfair financial burdens on associations, with safeguards to protect owners facing hardships.
- **Financial Transparency**: Legislators emphasized the need for greater financial transparency in condominium associations, including independent audits and access to financial records for unit owners. The proposed bill would require associations to provide financial information and allow unit owners to conduct their own audits at their expense.

### **3. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and Drug Pricing**
- **House Bill 383**: This bill seeks to modernize laws related to PBMs, particularly around Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) pricing. Pharmacists highlighted challenges with being reimbursed below cost for drugs, impacting their ability to provide care and maintain inventory. The bill would require PBMs to provide pharmacies with information on where to obtain drugs at or below the MAC price and notify pharmacies when MAC prices are below acquisition costs. PBMs opposed the bill, arguing it would create operational burdens and disrupt cost-saving measures.
- **Pharmacist in Charge (PIC) Regulations**: **House Bill 426** proposes shifting accountability from the PIC to the permit holder (pharmacy owner or corporation) for operational decisions. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy, supported the bill as a necessary update to align accountability with authority in modern pharmacy structures.

### **4. Insurance Coverage for Pain Management Services**
- **House Bill 303**: This bill aims to expand insurance coverage for non-opioid pain management services, including acupuncture, chiropractic care, physical therapy, and mindfulness. Representative Nagel, a physician, emphasized the societal and economic costs of chronic pain and the need for a multimodal approach to reduce opioid reliance. The bill received support from organizations like the New Hampshire Pharmacist Association and the Alliance to Advance Comprehensive Integrative Pain Management but faced opposition from insurers concerned about increased premiums and the inclusion of unlicensed practices like yoga and Tai Chi.
- **Therapeutic Cannabis**: Advocates urged the inclusion of therapeutic cannabis in the bill, noting its effectiveness in managing chronic pain and its exclusion from insurance coverage. They argued that this perpetuates stigma and financial barriers for patients.

### **5. Therapeutic Cannabis and Alternative Treatments**
- **Affordability and Access**: Speakers highlighted the financial challenges patients face in accessing therapeutic cannabis and alternative treatments like acupuncture. They emphasized the need for greater insurance coverage to reduce reliance on opioids and improve patient outcomes.
- **Evidence-Based Medicine**: Concerns were raised about the inconsistent application of evidence-based medicine in healthcare decisions. Representatives advocated for a level playing field in evaluating treatments, citing the lack of evidence supporting certain common medical practices while alternative therapies face limited coverage despite their efficacy.

---

### **6. Chiropractic Care and Multimodal Pain Management**
- **Chiropractic Care**: Chiropractors testified in favor of increasing insurance coverage for chiropractic care, noting the decline in benefits and the cost-effectiveness of their services. The bill proposes increasing annual visit coverage from 12 to 20 visits.
- **Multimodal Approach**: Supporters of the bill, including pain management specialists, advocated for a multimodal approach to pain management that includes behavioral, physical, and interventional therapies. They argued that this would reduce opioid reliance and improve quality of life.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Across sectors—HOAs, condominium associations, PBMs, and healthcare—the meeting emphasized the need for greater transparency and accountability to protect consumers and ensure fair practices.
- **Legislative Amendments**: Many bills, including those addressing HOA protections, condominium foreclosures, and pain management coverage, will undergo further refinement through amendments and subcommittee work to address stakeholder concerns.
- **Balancing Costs and Benefits**: The discussions highlighted the tension between expanding access to essential services and managing costs for insurers, businesses, and consumers. Legislators sought to strike a balance that promotes fairness and affordability.
