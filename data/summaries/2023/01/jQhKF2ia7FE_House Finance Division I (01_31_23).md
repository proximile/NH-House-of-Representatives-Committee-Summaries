**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (01/31/23)**

The January 31, 2023, meeting of the New Hampshire House Finance Division I covered a wide range of topics, including transportation infrastructure, retirement system reforms, wastewater funding, and public facility access. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Rail Trail and Tunnel Project in Derry (Segments 1, 4, 5)**  
The meeting centered on the contentious **Derry rail trail project**, particularly the proposed tunnel under the Exit 4A highway project. Key issues included:  
- **Safety and Design Concerns**: The current plan, which avoids a tunnel and instead routes the trail across six lanes of traffic, was criticized as unsafe for cyclists, pedestrians, and individuals with disabilities. Proponents argued that the original tunnel design, approved by the federal government, is safer and more practical.  
- **Cost and Delays**: The project’s cost has ballooned from $50 million to over $130 million, with an additional $750,000 needed for the tunnel. Opponents questioned the expense, while supporters emphasized the long-term safety and economic benefits.  
- **Federal and State Compliance**: The tunnel was initially part of the federal contract, but changes post-contract led to disputes. The project also faces scrutiny for potentially violating state laws (RSA 288) protecting historic railroad corridors.  
- **Public Input and Transparency**: Stakeholders, including the Derry Rail Trail Alliance, criticized the Department of Transportation (DOT) for making unilateral decisions without sufficient public input. Concerns were raised about the lack of review by the DOT’s safety department.  
- **Economic Impact**: Rail trails are significant economic drivers, with the Derry-Windham-Londonderry section generating $7.5 million annually. The project is seen as a critical link in the broader Granite State Rail Trail initiative.  
- **Legal and Oversight Concerns**: Questions were raised about potential lawsuits to enforce contract provisions and the need for greater oversight.

### **2. Retirement System Reforms (Segment 2)**  
The committee discussed two bills related to the state’s retirement system:  
- **House Bill 50**: Proposes reinstating the state’s payment of 7.5% of local employer contributions for teachers, police, and fire members to the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS). Concerns were raised about the financial impact on municipalities and the need for further data.  
- **House Bill 555**: Suggests using state general fund surpluses to pay down the retirement system’s $5.69 billion unfunded liability. Sponsors likened the approach to paying off a mortgage early to reduce long-term costs. Questions arose about how funds should be allocated across employee groups.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned an orientation session on the retirement system and scheduled further work sessions to gather additional data and analysis.

### **3. Wastewater Infrastructure Funding (Segment 4)**  
The committee addressed **House Bill 311**, which seeks to level-fund the **State Aid Grant Program** for wastewater infrastructure. Key points included:  
- **Aging Infrastructure**: Many wastewater treatment facilities are over 50 years old and face increasing regulatory demands, such as PFAS monitoring.  
- **Consistent Funding**: The bill aims to make funding non-lapsing to ensure municipalities can complete long-term projects without submitting project lists every two years.

### **4. Public Facility Access and Parking (Segments 3, 5)**  
The meeting briefly touched on public access to state facilities and parking spaces:  
- **Parking Space Allocation**: Discussions centered on making parking spaces around the state house and other buildings more available to the public, particularly during events like street fairs.  
- **Legislative Parking Garage**: Concerns were raised about the aging structure, with calls for funding to replace it and improve accessibility.

### **5. Procedural Matters (Segments 3, 5)**  
The committee also addressed logistical and procedural issues:  
- **Recess and Agenda Setting**: The meeting was recessed to the following week, with plans to prioritize bill hearings.  
- **Collaborative Work**: Representatives were encouraged to refine legislative language in collaboration with stakeholders.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**  
The meeting highlighted several recurring themes, including the need for **long-term infrastructure investment**, **public safety**, **transparency in decision-making**, and **economic development**. The committee planned further work sessions and orientation meetings to address complex issues like the retirement system and transportation projects.  

Overall, the discussions underscored the importance of balancing fiscal responsibility with the need to invest in critical infrastructure and public services.
