**Summary of the NH House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (01/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 19, 2023, to discuss several bills addressing a range of issues, from driving without a license to domestic violence protections and public toplessness regulations. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **HB 201: Driving Without a License**
- **Proposal**: The bill seeks to reduce the initial penalty for driving without a license from a Class B misdemeanor to a violation, reverting to pre-2015 law. Repeat offenses would remain misdemeanors.
- **Support**: Advocates argued that the current law disproportionately impacts low-income and immigrant residents, many of whom face systemic barriers to obtaining licenses, such as immigration processing backlogs. They also highlighted the long-term consequences of misdemeanor charges for minor offenses.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised public safety issues, particularly the risk of unlicensed drivers causing accidents and the potential for insurance companies to deny coverage, leaving victims financially vulnerable.
- **Status**: The committee acknowledged the need for a more compassionate approach but continued discussions to balance fairness with public safety.

### **HB 291: False Complaints Against Businesses**
- **Proposal**: The bill aims to penalize individuals who knowingly file false complaints with state departments (e.g., Labor or Liquor Commission) to harass or damage a business owner’s reputation. It proposes making such actions a Class A misdemeanor.
- **Testimony**: A business owner shared his experience with multiple baseless audits and investigations during a contentious divorce, which wasted significant time and resources for both him and state employees.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about how intent would be proven, whether the bill unfairly targets specific groups, and whether similar protections should extend to other departments, such as the Department of Children and Family Services.
- **Status**: The hearing was recessed to allow the bill’s sponsor to testify at a later date, with further discussions planned.

### **HB 143: Wiretapping and Domestic Violence**
- **Proposal**: Introduced by Rep. Jennifer Rhodes, the bill would allow recording without consent in domestic violence cases to aid victims in gathering evidence.
- **Support and Concerns**: Pamela Kylig from the NH Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence supported the intent but expressed concerns about potential misuse by abusers and conflicts with privacy laws.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 18-1 to kill the bill, pending further review by the Governor’s Commission on Domestic Violence.

### **HB 160: Topless Regulations**
- **Proposal**: Sponsored by Rep. Dan Hines, the bill seeks to codify state law allowing toplessness in public, preventing towns from enforcing sex-based bans.
- **Support**: Jeffrey Eunice from the NH Body Freedom Action Network testified in favor, emphasizing constitutional rights, body positivity, and equity issues, particularly in towns like Laconia that enforce discriminatory ordinances.
- **Status**: The committee closed the public hearing without further action.

### **Additional Proceedings**
The meeting included procedural motions, recesses, and a brief address from former committee member Don Gorman, who shared insights on criminal justice policy. The committee’s work was scheduled to continue the following day, contingent on weather conditions.

### **Key Outcomes**
- **HB 143** was killed by an 18-1 vote, pending further review.
- **HB 291** was recessed for additional testimony.
- **HB 160** and **HB 201** remained under discussion, with the committee weighing public safety, equity, and fairness concerns.

The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance enforcement with compassion and address systemic issues while considering the broader implications of proposed legislation.
