The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on January 24, 2023, focused on several key education-related bills, with particular emphasis on school building aid, the recodification of education statutes, and other education funding initiatives. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing state responsibility, local control, and efficient resource allocation. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **School Building Aid and Related Financial Policies**
1. **State School Building Aid**:
   - The meeting extensively discussed the state’s role in providing school building aid, which helps local communities fund construction, renovation, and modernization of school facilities. Many of New Hampshire’s school buildings are over 60 years old, with some predating 1900, posing challenges related to safety, accessibility, and educational needs.
   - The stabilization fund, which receives proceeds from the sale of buildings rented by organizations like the Boys and Girls Club or Head Start, was highlighted as a tool to offset the financial impacts of school building projects.
   - The Department of Education (DOE) accepts applications for building aid every other year, ranking projects based on scoring criteria. However, only a fraction of pending projects receive funding due to the $50 million annual cap, which is largely consumed by debt service.

2. **House Bill 332**:
   - Proposed by Rep. Michael Cahill, this bill seeks to increase the annual maximum school building aid from $50 million to $60 million. Of the additional $10 million, $5 million would address pending projects, while the rest would provide retroactive funding for communities that financed school projects during a moratorium on state aid.
   - Supporters, including Rep. John Cloutier, emphasized the financial burden on communities like Claremont, which renovated Stevens High School without state aid, leading to high property taxes.

3. **House Bill 541**:
   - Sponsored by Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, this bill proposes a one-time appropriation of $100 million for school building aid in fiscal years 2024 and 2025. Over half of the current $50 million is used for debt service, leaving only $25 million for actual projects. The bill aims to address urgent facility needs without creating long-term financial obligations.
   - Public testimony from Kathleen Murphy, Superintendent of Concord School District, and Jack Dunn, Concord’s Business Administrator, highlighted the economic benefits of school building aid, including attracting businesses, families, and teachers, as well as supporting local construction jobs.

4. **Debate on State vs. Local Responsibility**:
   - Some representatives, such as Rep. McGuire, argued against school building aid, stating it incentivizes higher spending and taxes. Others emphasized the state’s responsibility to support poorer communities with limited fiscal capacity.
   - Rep. Ladd proposed allocating $50 million annually for new construction and renovation projects, separate from debt payments, and integrating building aid into the state’s adequacy formula.

### **Recodification of Education Statutes (House Bill 468)**
1. **Need for Recodification**:
   - The meeting highlighted the urgent need to review and update New Hampshire’s outdated and inconsistent education statutes. Examples included conflicting laws on building aid for charter schools and a 1985 statute on missing children education that is no longer actively used.
   - The goal is to streamline and clarify education laws to improve functionality and avoid confusion.

2. **Funding and Expertise**:
   - A $100,000 budget was proposed for the recodification project, though concerns were raised about whether this amount is sufficient given the complexity and scope of the task.
   - The DOE suggested hiring external legal experts through an RFP (Request for Proposal) to conduct the review, as internal staff lack the capacity for such a comprehensive project.

3. **Legislative Oversight**:
   - While the findings and recommendations from the review would initially go to the Commissioner of Education, any changes to statutes would require legislative approval, ensuring transparency and public accountability.

### **Other Education-Related Bills**
1. **House Bill 207 (Unanticipated Funds)**:
   - This bill aimed to streamline the process for school districts to accept unanticipated revenues by raising the threshold for requiring a separate meeting from $5,000 to $20,000. Proponents argued that the change would reduce administrative burdens and costs without compromising transparency.

2. **House Bill 129 (Menstrual Products in Schools)**:
   - Introduced by Rep. Jess Edwards, this bill addressed the state’s constitutional obligation (Article 28a) to fund mandates it imposes on schools. It proposed reimbursing schools $15 per female student aged 12 or older for menstrual products. Testimony highlighted operational challenges, such as vandalism and increased costs, but also emphasized the importance of providing these products to students in need.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **School Building Aid Shortage**: Both House Bill 332 and House Bill 541 addressed the inadequacy of the current $50 million annual cap for school building aid, which only funds a fraction of pending projects.
- **Retroactive Funding**: There was significant discussion about retroactively reimbursing communities that funded school projects during the moratorium on state aid.
- **Economic Impact**: Testifiers highlighted the broader economic benefits of school building aid, including attracting businesses, reducing property taxes, and supporting local construction jobs.
- **Recodification of Education Statutes**: The meeting underscored the urgent need to update and clarify New Hampshire’s education laws, with a focus on external expertise and legislative oversight.
- **Balancing State and Local Responsibility**: The discussions reflected differing perspectives on the state’s role in funding education, with some advocating for greater state support and others emphasizing local responsibility and reduced state intervention.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities of education funding in New Hampshire and the need for strategic planning, legislative action, and collaboration between state and local stakeholders to address these challenges effectively.
