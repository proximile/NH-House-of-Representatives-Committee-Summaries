### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Children and Family Law (01/24/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 24, 2023, focused on various aspects of children and family law, including child support services, mental health care, family court procedures, and the replacement of the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC). Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and legislative efforts:

---

### **1. Child Support and Behavioral Health Services**
- **Bureau of Child Support Services**: Matthew K. English Powers provided an overview of the bureau’s mission, which includes establishing paternity, enforcing child support orders, and ensuring medical support for children. In FY 2021, the bureau served approximately 33,650 children and families. Challenges include parents unwilling or unable to pay, with enforcement tools like wage garnishment and license revocation being utilized. New Hampshire’s program collects $3.15 for every dollar spent, below the national average of $5.27, attributed to various factors.
- **Bureau for Children’s Behavioral Health**: Rebecca Ross discussed the state’s system of care, which integrates services across multiple agencies. Programs like High-Fidelity Wraparound (Fast Forward) and Transitional Residential Enhanced Care Coordination (TREK) have expanded since 2016, reducing the need for residential placements. The system faces challenges with workforce capacity and waitlists, necessitating ongoing legislative support.

### **2. Legislative Bills and Family Court Procedures**
- **House Bill 31 (Raising the Age of Marriage to 18)**: The committee debated an amendment to prevent new marriages involving minors while grandfathering existing ones. Proponents argued it would protect minors from exploitation and domestic violence, while opponents felt the current court approval process was sufficient. The amendment passed, but the bill ultimately failed.
- **House Bill 200 (Choice of Counselor in Family Court)**: Amended to address insurance concerns, the bill allows parents in custody cases to choose a counselor for their child, except in cases of abuse. It passed unanimously.
- **House Bill 471 (Divorce Proceedings)**: This bill aims to expedite divorce cases by requiring courts to schedule a final hearing when issuing temporary orders. Supporters argued it would reduce delays, while the judicial branch expressed concerns about scheduling challenges.
- **Support Persons in Court**: A bill was introduced to allow individuals, particularly children, to have a support person present during court proceedings. Concerns were raised about potential disruptions, with suggestions to grant judges discretion in allowing support persons.

### **3. Representation for Children and Access to Records**
- **House Bill 535 (Representation for Children in Court)**: This bill seeks to appoint attorneys to represent children in abuse and neglect cases. Testimony highlighted the importance of children’s voices in court, but concerns were raised about costs and potential conflicts with parents’ attorneys. Refinements were suggested to clarify language and address these issues.
- **Access to Child Welfare Records**: A bill proposed independent judicial oversight when the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) withholds records. Advocates emphasized the need for transparency and accountability, while balancing child protection.

### **4. Sununu Youth Services Center Replacement**
- **House Bill 120**: The impending closure of the SYSC prompted urgent discussions on replacing it with a smaller, therapeutic facility. Key points included:
  - **Facility Design**: The new facility will house 12-14 youth, with flexibility for up to 18, emphasizing a therapeutic, trauma-informed environment. It will feature home-like interiors, educational spaces, and recreational areas.
  - **Cost and Efficiency**: The current SYSC costs $13 million annually, deemed inefficient. The new facility is expected to save $2-3 million annually and reduce reliance on out-of-state placements.
  - **State Ownership and Operation**: The facility will be state-owned and operated, ensuring accountability and compliance with state laws. Contracting for specific services, like clinical care, will still be allowed.
  - **Community Concerns**: The location remains undetermined, with plans to address community safety concerns and provide payments in lieu of taxes.
  - **Transition Plan**: The SYSC will close once the new facility is operational, with a focus on in-person therapeutic services and staff training in de-escalation techniques.

### **5. Support for Victims in Court**
- **Victim Support**: Discussions highlighted the need for victims, particularly those with PTSD, to have support persons or animals in court. Advocates emphasized the importance of making victims feel safer when testifying, noting that fear often leads to case dismissals.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Child Welfare and Protection**: Efforts to improve oversight of residential treatment providers, protect minors from exploitation, and ensure children’s voices are heard in court were central to the discussions.
- **Efficiency in Family Court**: Bills aimed at reducing delays in divorce proceedings and providing support for vulnerable individuals in court were debated, with a focus on balancing efficiency with judicial discretion.
- **Therapeutic Care for Youth**: The replacement of the SYSC with a smaller, therapeutic facility reflects a shift from detention-focused models to rehabilitation and trauma-informed care.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Legislative proposals emphasized the need for transparency in child welfare records and independent oversight to protect children’s rights.
- **Urgency and Collaboration**: The impending closure of the SYSC highlighted the need for rapid legislative action and collaboration between the House and Senate to address immediate crises.

Overall, the meeting underscored the legislature’s commitment to improving child and family welfare through data-driven decision-making, safeguarding vulnerable populations, and addressing systemic inefficiencies.
