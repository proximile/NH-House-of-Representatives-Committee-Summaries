The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 20, 2023, covered a wide range of topics, including state-federal relations, veterans affairs, constitutional amendments, and climate accountability. The discussions were divided into several segments, each focusing on specific bills and resolutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **1. Faithful Delegate Law (Segment 1/7)**
The meeting began with discussions on a bill aimed at limiting the authority of New Hampshire delegates to policy-making conventions, particularly Article 5 conventions. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The "Faithful Delegate Law" seeks to establish controls and guidelines for delegates, ensuring they act within the authority granted by the legislature.
- **Historical Context**: The bill referenced historical precedents like the Annapolis Convention and the 21st Amendment ratification process, as well as the 2020 Supreme Court case *Chiafalo v. Washington*, which upheld states' control over delegates.
- **Key Components**: The bill outlines delegate selection procedures, limits delegate authority, and establishes a recall process for delegates acting beyond their scope.
- **Support and Opposition**: Supporters, including former Senator James Rubens, argued the bill builds public trust, while Representative Alvin Z opposed it, citing concerns over state control in federal functions.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The bill includes speculative fiscal notes for delegate reimbursements.

### **2. Veterans and Military Affairs (Segments 2/7 & 3/7)**
Two bills related to veterans and military affairs were discussed:
- **HB 206 (Space Force Inclusion)**: This bill aims to add the U.S. Space Force to the list of Armed Forces in New Hampshire statutes. Supporters, including Melissa Willette and Kevin Grady, emphasized the need to align state laws with federal definitions to ensure benefits for Space Force Guardians and their families. The bill received unanimous support (13-0) and was recommended for the consent calendar.
- **HB 229 (Defend the Guard)**: This bill seeks to require a formal declaration of war by Congress before the New Hampshire National Guard can be activated for federal service. Supporters, including veterans like John Petusic and Tom Mannion, argued it would restore constitutional accountability, while opponents, including Deputy Adjutant General Warren Perry, warned of potential loss of federal funding ($365 million) and operational readiness. The debate highlighted deep divides over constitutional war powers and practical implications.

### **3. Climate Accountability (Segments 4/7 & 6/7)**
The meeting also addressed resolutions related to climate change and fossil fuel accountability:
- **HCR5 (Climate Accountability)**: This resolution urges legal action against multinational fossil fuel companies for their decades-long disinformation campaigns about climate change. Supporters drew parallels to past legal actions against tobacco and opioid companies, emphasizing the moral and legal responsibility of fossil fuel companies to compensate for climate-related damages.
- **Climate Change Impacts**: Representatives highlighted the increasing costs of extreme weather events in New Hampshire, such as flooding and ice storms, and called for immediate action to mitigate climate change through policies like carbon pricing and cleaner energy transitions.

### **4. Term Limits for Congress (Segments 4/7 & 7/7)**
Two resolutions focused on congressional term limits:
- **HCR4 (Term Limits)**: This resolution calls for an Article 5 convention to establish term limits for Congress. Supporters argued that term limits are widely popular (82% support) and necessary to reduce corruption and bring fresh ideas to Congress. Opponents expressed concerns about the safety of an Article 5 convention, but supporters emphasized safeguards like single-subject limits and ratification requirements.
- **HCR3 (State Sovereignty and Nullification)**: This resolution, introduced by Representative Jason Gerhard, emphasized New Hampshire's sovereignty and the right to nullify unconstitutional federal actions. Supporters referenced the 10th Amendment and examples like Montana's handling of speed limits to illustrate state resistance to federal overreach.

### **5. National Guard Recruitment Incentives (Segment 5/7)**
The committee discussed **HB 330**, which aims to support National Guard recruitment by increasing enlistment incentives from $500 to $1,000 and streamlining administrative processes. Military officials, including Major General David Mikolaities and Colonel Warren Perry, advocated for the bill, which received unanimous support (13-0) but required further confirmation due to its fiscal note.

---

### **6. Procedural Discussions and Adjournment (Segment 5/7)**
The meeting concluded with procedural discussions on the consent calendar, which allows bills with strong committee support to be voted on en masse. Representative Rollins explained the new rules requiring ten members to pull a bill off the consent calendar for individual debate. The committee planned to reconvene on January 27, 2023.
