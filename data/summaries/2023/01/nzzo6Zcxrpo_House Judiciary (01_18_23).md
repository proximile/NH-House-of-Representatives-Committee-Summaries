**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Judiciary, January 18, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on January 18, 2023, to discuss a wide range of bills and constitutional amendments, addressing issues from criminal justice reform to property rights, constitutional protections, and religious freedom. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Criminal Justice and Evidence Transparency**
- **House Bill 67**: This bill proposes granting defendants the right to review the source code of software used as evidence in criminal cases, particularly in DNA sequencing, fingerprint analysis, and video processing. Representative Eric Gallagher, the bill’s sponsor, argued that it ensures evidence reliability and promotes transparency. However, concerns were raised about exposing proprietary software, potential misuse, and the burden on the criminal justice system. Opponents, including the Attorney General’s office, argued that existing rules already allow for challenges to evidence reliability. Amendments were suggested to limit the bill’s scope to novel software or allow independent reviews.

---

### **Estate Planning and Property Rights**
- **House Bill 68**: This bill introduces transfer on death deeds, allowing individuals to bypass probate by filing a single form. Supporters, including Representative Jess Edwards, highlighted its potential to simplify estate planning and save costs. However, concerns were raised about fraud, creditor claims, title insurance issues, and notification delays for heirs. Amendments were proposed to address these issues, and a subcommittee was suggested to refine the bill.

### **Supported Decision-Making and Disability Rights**
- **House Bill 162**: This bill seeks to clarify the **supported decision-making** statute (RSA 464d) for individuals with disabilities, ensuring that agreements explicitly describe the types of decisions a supporter can assist with. Testimony from Representative Maureen Mooney and others emphasized the need for clarity, particularly for special needs children transitioning to adulthood. However, some argued that the existing statute is already clear and that the proposed changes might overregulate the process.

### **Constitutional Protections and Peaceful Assembly**
- **House Bill 164**: Introduced in response to arrests during protests outside the governor’s residence in Newfields, this bill aims to prevent municipalities from criminalizing peaceful assembly. Supporters argued that the town’s ordinance violated constitutional rights, while opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, defended local authority. The bill sparked a debate about balancing state and local governance with constitutional protections.

### **Marriage Rights and Judicial Retirement**
- **CACR-5**: Representative Dan Hines proposed a constitutional amendment to explicitly protect the right to marry as a fundamental right, citing concerns raised by the Dobbs v. Jackson decision.
- **HB 240 (Marital Freedom Act)**: This bill seeks to affirm the validity of interracial marriages in New Hampshire, reflecting modern values. Some questioned its necessity, arguing it addresses a non-existent problem.
- **CACR-6**: Representative Bob Lynn proposed raising the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75, arguing that the current limit is outdated given increased life expectancy. Supporters emphasized retaining experienced judges, while critics raised concerns about political misuse.

---

### **Guardianship and Child Welfare**
- **House Bill 169**: This bill seeks to modify guardianship laws to protect children who have been under the care of grandparents or other guardians for extended periods. It proposes raising the standard for terminating guardianship from “preponderance of the evidence” to “clear and convincing evidence” in cases involving parental substance abuse. Testifiers highlighted the trauma of removing children from stable environments and called for systemic changes to prioritize child well-being.

### **Process Serving and Law Enforcement**
- **House Bill 187**: This bill would allow local police departments to serve civil and criminal process papers, a task currently reserved for sheriffs. Supporters argued it would reduce costs and improve efficiency, particularly in rural areas. However, sheriffs and police chiefs expressed concerns about staffing shortages, loss of revenue, and logistical challenges. The bill is enabling legislation, meaning it would be optional for local police.

### **Religious Land Use and Housing for the Unhoused**
- **House Bill 63**: This bill aims to clarify regulations for religious land use, particularly for churches and other religious organizations. Testimony highlighted concerns about municipalities imposing discriminatory zoning restrictions. Representative Maureen Mooney proposed an amendment to preserve existing language while explicitly allowing religious organizations to build housing for the unhoused as part of their religious exercise.
- **House Bill 256**: This bill seeks to prohibit municipalities from discriminating against individuals or groups based on their speech or purpose when using public facilities. Supporters argued it protects free speech, while critics raised concerns about its broad language and potential impact on commercial activities.

### **Key Themes and Debates**
1. **Transparency and Accountability**: Bills like HB 67 and HB 187 emphasized the need for transparency in evidence and process serving, while balancing concerns about security and efficiency.
2. **Constitutional Protections**: Discussions on HB 164, CACR-5, and HB 256 highlighted the importance of safeguarding constitutional rights, including peaceful assembly, marriage, and free speech.
3. **Local vs. State Authority**: Several bills, including HB 164 and HB 63, raised questions about the balance between local governance and state or constitutional protections.
4. **Child Welfare and Guardianship**: HB 169 and related discussions underscored the need to prioritize child well-being in guardianship cases and address systemic issues in the child welfare system.
5. **Religious Freedom and Land Use**: HB 63 and HB 256 addressed the tension between protecting religious freedom and ensuring municipalities can enforce objective, non-discriminatory regulations.
