The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on January 18, 2023, to discuss a series of bills addressing a wide range of issues, from criminal justice and property rights to constitutional protections and religious land use. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **Criminal Justice and Evidence Transparency (HB 67)**
The committee debated **House Bill 67**, which proposes granting defendants the right to review the source code of software used in criminal cases to ensure evidence reliability. Sponsored by Representative Eric Gallagher, the bill aims to codify a right established in *State v. Pickett*, a New Jersey case involving DNA testing software. Proponents, including defense attorney Anthony Scalambrini, argued the bill promotes transparency and accuracy in evidence, likening it to "showing your work" in mathematics. Opponents, including representatives from the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory and the Attorney General’s Office, contended the bill is unnecessary, overly broad, and could lead to delays, increased costs, and disruptions in criminal investigations, particularly in cases involving child exploitation and digital evidence. The committee also discussed whether the bill creates a new right or merely codifies existing judicial authority to order source code reviews.

### **Property Rights and Estate Planning (HB 68)**
**House Bill 68**, introduced by Representative Jess Edwards, seeks to simplify estate planning by creating a "transfer on death deed" as an alternative to trusts and wills. While the bill aims to provide a cost-effective option for simpler estates, witnesses raised concerns about potential fraud, creditor claims, and title insurance complications. Amendments were suggested, including notification requirements for beneficiaries and alignment with New Hampshire’s probate laws.

### **Guardianship and Decision-Making (HB 162, HB 169)**
**House Bill 162** clarifies Section RSA 464-d, requiring supported decision-making agreements to specify the types of decisions a supporter is authorized to assist with. This bill aims to provide an alternative to guardianship for individuals with disabilities, empowering them to make decisions with support rather than delegating authority. **House Bill 169** proposes raising the legal standard for terminating guardianship from "preponderance of the evidence" to "clear and convincing evidence" when a grandparent has custody due to parental substance abuse. Testimony from Linda Morgan, a grandmother who lost custody of her granddaughter, highlighted the need for stronger protections for children in stable guardianship arrangements.

### **Peaceful Assembly and Municipal Authority (HB 164)**
**House Bill 164** seeks to protect the right to peaceful assembly by preventing municipalities from criminalizing it. Inspired by incidents in Newfields, where individuals were cited for a candlelight vigil during COVID-19, the bill aims to ensure that local ordinances do not infringe on constitutional rights. The New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed the bill, arguing it limits municipalities’ ability to regulate public gatherings. The debate centered on balancing municipal authority with individual rights to free speech and assembly.

### **Marriage Rights and Constitutional Protections (HB 240, CACR 5)**
**House Bill 240**, the Marital Freedom Act, aims to explicitly protect interracial marriage by adding "race" to existing marriage laws. Sponsored by Representative Ben Ming, the bill is seen as symbolic but necessary in light of recent Supreme Court decisions like *Dobbs v. Jackson*. **Constitutional Amendment CACR 5** seeks to enshrine the right to marry as a fundamental right in the New Hampshire Constitution, safeguarding interracial and same-sex marriages from potential future challenges. Opponents questioned the necessity of these measures, while supporters emphasized their importance in reinforcing modern values and protecting rights.

### **Service of Process and Local Authority (HB 187)**
**House Bill 187** proposes allowing local police departments to serve criminal or civil process, addressing inefficiencies in rural areas where county sheriffs are far from certain towns. While supporters argued this would reduce costs and improve efficiency, sheriffs and local police chiefs expressed concerns about resource allocation, historical roles, and potential disruptions. Amendments were suggested to allow local police to collect fees and mirror the sheriff’s fee structure.

### **Religious Land Use and Housing (HB 63)**
**House Bill 63** clarifies the use of religious land for housing, particularly for the unhoused. Building on **HB 1021** from the previous year, the bill aims to provide clarity for religious organizations wanting to use underutilized spaces like parking lots for housing projects. Representative Maureen Mooney proposed an amendment to explicitly state that building housing for the unhoused qualifies as a religious exercise. Opponents, including Attorney Michael Tierney, argued the bill weakens existing protections for religious organizations and could lead to unnecessary litigation.

### **Free Speech and Public Facilities (HB 256)**
**House Bill 256** addresses discrimination in public facilities, inspired by an incident where a Republican Town Committee was denied access to a public park pavilion for a political event. Sponsored by Representative Dan McGuire, the bill aims to prevent municipalities from discriminating against individuals or groups based on their speech or purpose when using public facilities. The debate centered on balancing free speech protections with municipalities’ ability to regulate public spaces, with some suggesting the bill be narrowed to focus specifically on political activities.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted several recurring themes:
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Bills like HB 67 emphasize the need for transparency in criminal evidence, while HB 162 focuses on clarity in supported decision-making agreements.
- **Constitutional Rights**: Discussions around HB 164, HB 240, and CACR 5 underscored the importance of protecting fundamental rights, including free speech, assembly, and marriage.
- **Balancing Authority and Individual Rights**: Many bills, such as HB 187 and HB 256, grappled with the tension between municipal authority and individual rights, particularly in the context of public space usage and criminal justice.
- **Practicality and Clarity**: Lawmakers emphasized the need for clear, consistent language in legislation to avoid confusion and unintended consequences, as seen in discussions around HB 63 and HB 68.

The committee’s deliberations reflect a broader effort to address contemporary issues while balancing competing interests and ensuring alignment with constitutional protections.
