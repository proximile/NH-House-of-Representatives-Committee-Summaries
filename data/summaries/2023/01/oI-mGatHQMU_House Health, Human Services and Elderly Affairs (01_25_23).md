The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 25, 2023, convened by the House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs, addressed a wide range of bills and issues related to public health, healthcare policy, and privacy. The discussions were organized into nine segments, each focusing on specific legislative proposals and their implications. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and themes covered during the meeting:

---

### **Privacy and Governance in Health and Human Services (HB 91)**
**House Bill 91** aimed to enhance privacy and governance within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) by establishing a governance board, implementing privacy impact assessments for IT systems, and creating two classified positions to support these efforts. Sponsor **Representative Edwards** explained that the bill addresses gaps in privacy compliance, particularly in light of New Hampshire's 2018 constitutional amendment on privacy rights. The bill simplifies previous legislation and focuses on risk mitigation in IT systems to proactively protect individual privacy. Committee members raised concerns about the necessity of codifying these measures, potential overlaps with the Department of Information Technology (DOIT), and whether the department would implement these changes independently. Edwards clarified that the bill codifies best practices and ensures consistency in privacy protections.

### **Organ Donation and Distribution (HB 587 and HB 47)**
Two bills related to organ donation were discussed: **HB 587** and **HB 47**.

- **HB 587** sought to prioritize New Hampshire residents in organ donation by adding a "New Hampshire first" checkbox on driver's licenses and instructing the DMV to request this preference be incorporated into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) algorithm as a tiebreaker. Sponsor **Representative Jose Cambrils**, a kidney transplant recipient, emphasized that the bill addresses unfairness in the current organ distribution policy, which prioritizes large out-of-state cities over New Hampshire residents. However, opponents, including **Representative Mark Pearson** and **Alexandra Glazier** of New England Donor Services (NEDS), argued that federal law governs organ allocation and that state-level changes would be ineffective. They also highlighted potential unintended consequences if other states adopted similar laws.

- **HB 47** proposed requiring trauma team members to sign a form attesting that all Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocols were followed before organ donation. Medical professionals, including trauma surgeons and nurses, strongly opposed the bill, arguing that ATLS guidelines are not strict protocols but rather flexible frameworks for trauma care. They expressed concerns that the bill would add unnecessary bureaucracy, delay organ donation, and create legal liabilities for healthcare providers.

### **Prescription Drug Policies (HB 223 and HB 338)**
Two bills related to prescription drugs were discussed:

- **HB 223** sought to allow 90-day refills for testosterone gel, currently classified as a Schedule III drug, which limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies. Sponsor **Representative Dan McGuire** argued that testosterone gel is not abusable and should be treated like other maintenance medications, reducing costs and inconvenience for patients.

- **HB 338** aimed to cap insulin costs at $30 per month for uninsured individuals or those with high copays, particularly targeting those who fall into the "coverage gap." The bill also sought to revive the New Hampshire RX Advantage Program, a prescription drug discount program that was defunded in 2008. Testimonies highlighted the rising cost of insulin (over 1,200% since the 1990s) and the life-threatening consequences of insulin rationing, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). **Utahâ€™s Insulin Savings Program** was cited as a successful model where the state negotiates bulk insulin prices and makes it affordable for residents.

### **Health Registries and Data Collection (HB 329 and HB 582)**
Two bills related to health registries and data collection were discussed:

- **HB 329** proposed the creation of a mandatory ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) registry in New Hampshire to better understand and treat the disease. The registry would track prevalence, incidence, genetic predispositions, and environmental factors related to ALS. **Dr. Elijah Stommel**, a neurologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, testified about the importance of the registry for research and patient care, citing environmental risk factors like cyanotoxins, heavy metals, and air pollution.

- **HB 582** sought to require reporting of induced pregnancy termination (abortion) statistics in New Hampshire, aligning with CDC specifications used by 47 other states. The bill aimed to ensure privacy by using non-identifying data, with providers and patients assigned confidential numbers. Supporters argued that collecting abortion data is essential for understanding the impact of legislative decisions, while opponents expressed concerns about privacy, the intrusive nature of the questions, and the potential burden on healthcare providers.

---

### **Needle Exchange and Hypodermic Needles (HB 397)**
**HB 397** aimed to decriminalize minors assisting parents or caregivers with hypodermic needles for medical purposes, such as administering insulin or EpiPens. The bill also sought to protect minors participating in needle exchange programs for substance abuse treatment. Representatives from the Division of Public Health Services discussed the role of syringe service programs in preventing infectious diseases and linking individuals to substance use treatment.

---

### **Audits for Reproductive Health Care Facilities (HB 615)**
**HB 615** proposed independent audits of reproductive health care facilities providing family planning services to ensure taxpayer money is not used for abortion services. Supporters, including **Representative Jess Edwards** and **New Hampshire Right to Life**, argued that the bill is necessary to ensure financial separation between family planning and abortion services. Opponents, including **Planned Parenthood of Northern New England** and the **ACLU**, argued that the bill is redundant, costly, and could limit access to essential health services for low-income individuals.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Privacy and Governance**: HB 91 highlighted the need for consistent privacy protections within DHHS, with debates on the necessity of legislative mandates versus departmental autonomy.
2. **Organ Donation Fairness**: HB 587 and HB 47 raised questions about the balance between state-level initiatives and federal regulations in organ allocation and trauma care.
3. **Prescription Drug Affordability**: HB 223 and HB 338 focused on reducing bureaucratic hurdles and costs for patients, particularly for insulin and testosterone.
4. **Health Registries and Data Collection**: HB 329 and HB 582 emphasized the importance of data collection for public health while addressing privacy concerns and fiscal implications.
5. **Needle Exchange and Harm Reduction**: HB 397 aimed to protect minors and improve public health outcomes through syringe service programs.
6. **Reproductive Health Care Audits**: HB 615 sparked contentious debates over taxpayer funding for abortion services and the potential impact on access to care.
