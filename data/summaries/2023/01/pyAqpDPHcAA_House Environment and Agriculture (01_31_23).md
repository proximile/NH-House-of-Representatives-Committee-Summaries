**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (January 31, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 31, 2023, to discuss a wide range of bills addressing agriculture, food safety, environmental sustainability, and public health. The meeting featured extensive debates on balancing regulatory oversight with support for local farmers and small businesses, emphasizing economic growth, environmental stewardship, and public safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Noise Ordinances and Agritourism**:
   - **HB 252**: The committee debated the impact of noise ordinances on agricultural activities, particularly in areas with increasing retiree populations. The bill exempts agricultural operations and agritourism (e.g., corn mazes, hayrides) from local noise ordinances. Concerns were raised about potential noise issues from events like weddings, but the committee unanimously supported the exemption to protect farmers' livelihoods.

2. **Food Waste Management**:
   - **HB 300**: This bill proposes banning food waste generators producing over a ton of waste from disposing of it in landfills, encouraging diversion to composting, animal feed, or food banks. The committee emphasized the environmental and economic benefits of reducing landfill use.
   - **HB 462**: The bill appropriates $2 million to the Solid Waste Management Fund to support composting and recycling initiatives, with funding sources including federal grants and donations.

3. **Homestead Food Operations**:
   - **HB 119**: This bill seeks to increase the gross income threshold for homestead food operations from $35,000 to $70,000 before requiring a food license. Discussions highlighted the impact of inflation on small producers and the need to reduce regulatory burdens while ensuring food safety. Concerns were raised about the honor system for enforcement, as the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) does not track income.
   - **HB 122**: The bill expands homestead food operations to allow up to 30 meals per day and 60 meals per week to be prepared in private homes without licensing. DHHS opposed the bill due to food safety risks, citing the lack of capacity in home kitchens to handle temperature-controlled foods. Local enforcement challenges were also noted, as only 15 of New Hampshire’s 234 municipalities have health inspectors.

4. **Fertilizer and Soil Management**:
   - **HB 494**: This bill directs fees from fertilizer and lime sales to a dedicated fund within the Department of Agriculture to support soil management programs, improving oversight and funding for agricultural initiatives.
   - **HB 152**: The bill updates definitions, inspection fees, and penalties related to fertilizer sales, clarifying refunds for deficient products and removing outdated exemptions. It passed unanimously.

5. **Raw Milk Regulations**:
   - **HB 348**: The bill proposes increasing the daily limit of raw milk sales from 20 to 160 gallons and removing container size restrictions. DHHS opposed the bill, citing public health risks, particularly for children, who account for 40-50% of raw milk cases. Testimony highlighted the risks of pathogens like listeria and the importance of maintaining strict regulations. A friendly amendment was suggested to limit container sizes to one gallon as a compromise.

6. **State Meat Inspection Program**:
   - **HB 493**: The bill seeks to eliminate the state meat inspection program, arguing it is redundant and costly given the availability of USDA inspections. Exemptions for on-farm poultry slaughter, custom slaughter for home use, and bison slaughter were retained.

7. **Energy Relief for Farms**:
   - **HB 369**: The committee discussed establishing a task force to provide energy relief to farms, focusing on simplifying access to federal and state energy assistance programs (e.g., REAP). The bill was deemed not ready for prime time, and the committee decided to draft a letter encouraging collaboration among relevant organizations.

8. **Agricultural Standards and Seed Labeling**:
   - **HB 79**: The committee amended the bill to create a study committee to review outdated agricultural standards and grading regulations, identifying redundancies and recommending updates. The amended bill passed unanimously.
   - **HB 128**: The committee voted to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** this bill, which aimed to repeal state seed labeling license requirements, as previous legislation already addressed exemptions for small-scale sellers.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Food Safety vs. Economic Growth**: The committee grappled with balancing food safety concerns, particularly for raw milk and home-based food operations, with the need to support small producers and reduce regulatory burdens.
- **Local Control**: Several bills (e.g., HB 122, HB 252) emphasized decentralizing regulation to local authorities, though concerns were raised about enforcement capacity and public health risks.
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Bills addressing food waste management (HB 300, HB 462) and soil management (HB 494, HB 152) highlighted the committee’s focus on reducing landfill use, promoting composting, and improving agricultural practices.
- **Public Health Risks**: Discussions on raw milk (HB 348) and home-based food operations (HB 122) underscored the potential for foodborne illnesses and the importance of maintaining oversight.
- **Economic Relief for Farmers**: Bills like HB 369 and HB 119 aimed to provide financial relief and reduce barriers for small farmers, addressing inflation, energy costs, and regulatory burdens.

### **Next Steps**

- The committee planned work sessions for February 7, 2023, to further discuss **HB 221** (agricultural land development rights) and related bills.
- Several bills (e.g., HB 79, HB 138, HB 152, HB 252) were placed on the consent calendar for final approval.
- Letters were to be drafted to encourage collaboration on energy relief initiatives (HB 369).

The meeting concluded with a focus on ensuring that legislative changes support both the agricultural sector and public health while promoting environmental sustainability and economic growth.
