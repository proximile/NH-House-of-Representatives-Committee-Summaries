**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Ways and Means (01/11/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on January 11, 2023, addressed a wide range of topics related to the state’s economic outlook, tax revenues, labor market dynamics, and demographic trends. The meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s strong financial position but underscored ongoing challenges related to workforce shortages, housing affordability, and an aging population. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed across the segments:

### **Economic and Revenue Overview**
1. **Tax Revenues and Trends**:
   - New Hampshire has experienced record revenue growth, with a surplus of over $400 million in fiscal year 2022. Business taxes, including the Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET), are significant revenue drivers, contributing $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2023.
   - Other key taxes, such as the Meals and Rentals (M&R) Tax and Real Estate Transfer Tax, have seen substantial growth post-COVID, driven by increased tourism and a booming real estate market. However, rising interest rates and cooling housing demand may impact future revenues.
   - The state’s lower tobacco tax rate compared to neighboring states has led to significant cross-border sales, particularly following Massachusetts’ ban on flavored tobacco products. However, a potential federal ban on menthol cigarettes could affect future tobacco tax revenues.

2. **Budget Process and Surplus**:
   - The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) emphasized the importance of accurate revenue estimation for the 2024-2025 biennial budget. The state’s strong cash reserves ($2.5 billion) and a $159.9 million rainy day fund provide fiscal stability, though replenishing the fund after a $100 million withdrawal for the Sununu Center lawsuit remains a priority.

3. **Economic Challenges**:
   - Inflation, global geopolitical instability, and workforce shortages are key factors affecting the state’s economic outlook. The unemployment rate is low (2.6%), but housing affordability and childcare capacity remain critical barriers to workforce participation.

### **Labor Market and Workforce Dynamics**
1. **Employment Recovery**:
   - New Hampshire has recovered private sector employment faster than during the Great Recession, with a 1% increase over pre-pandemic levels. Sectors like professional, scientific, and technical services have seen significant growth, while healthcare and retail face persistent workforce shortages.
   - Unemployment claims have decreased by 36% compared to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a strong labor market. However, labor force participation remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly among younger workers (25-34) and women with young children.

2. **Unemployment Insurance (UI) System**:
   - The UI trust fund balance is healthy at $357 million, with employer tax rates peaking lower during the pandemic (2.3%) compared to the Great Recession (3.7%). New employers are assigned a default tax rate of 2.7%, which adjusts based on their experience.
   - Policymakers are encouraged to focus on re-engagement strategies, such as virtual job fairs and re-employment services, to address labor force participation gaps.

3. **Housing and Infrastructure**:
   - The state is investing $60 million in affordable housing projects and $122 million in broadband expansion to connect underserved areas. However, the housing vacancy rate remains critically low (0.3%), making it difficult for people to relocate for jobs.

### **Demographic Trends and Migration**
1. **Population Growth and Aging**:
   - New Hampshire’s population growth is driven primarily by migration, with significant turnover as people move in and out of the state. The state gains people in their prime working ages (30s and 40s) and their children but loses young adults and faces an aging population.
   - The state’s population is becoming more diverse, with all growth between 2010 and 2020 coming from minority groups. However, New Hampshire remains one of the least diverse states in the nation.

2. **Regional Variations**:
   - Population growth is concentrated in the southeast, while northern regions face declines. Some areas are grappling with declining school enrollments, while others deal with growing older populations.

3. **Future Challenges**:
   - Declining birth rates and an aging population pose long-term challenges. Policymakers must focus on attracting and retaining residents to support economic growth, particularly in areas experiencing population decline.

### **Key Takeaways and Policy Implications**
- **Economic Strengths**: New Hampshire is in a strong financial position, with robust tax revenues, healthy cash reserves, and a low unemployment rate. The state’s recovery from the pandemic has outpaced previous economic downturns.
- **Ongoing Challenges**: Workforce shortages, housing affordability, and childcare capacity remain critical barriers to sustained economic growth. The state’s aging population and declining birth rates pose long-term demographic challenges.
- **Policy Focus**: Policymakers must prioritize investments in affordable housing, childcare, and infrastructure to attract and retain residents. Addressing labor force participation gaps, particularly among younger workers and women, will be essential for maintaining economic momentum.
- **Revenue Monitoring**: The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and LBA will continue to monitor tax revenues and economic conditions to ensure accurate budget planning and fiscal stability.

Overall, the meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s resilience in the face of economic challenges but emphasized the need for strategic investments and collaborative efforts to address workforce, housing, and demographic issues. Policymakers are urged to focus on long-term solutions to sustain the state’s economic growth and quality of life.
