### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 11, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on January 11, 2023, provided a detailed overview of the state’s financial condition, tax revenues, economic recovery, labor market trends, and demographic shifts. The discussions highlighted the state’s strong fiscal position, ongoing economic challenges, and strategies to address critical issues like workforce shortages, housing affordability, and an aging population. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points across all segments:

---

### **State Financial Performance and Tax Revenues**
1. **Tax Revenue Growth**:
   - Business tax revenues have surged, with $1.2 billion collected in fiscal year 2023, 28.7% ahead of projections for the first six months. Other taxes, such as meals and rentals, tobacco, and real estate transfer taxes, have also exceeded expectations.
   - The state’s financial performance remained strong during the COVID-19 pandemic, with tax revenues staying flat or positive.

2. **Legislative Changes and Revenue Trends**:
   - Recent changes to business taxes, including market-based sourcing and single sales factor apportionment, have impacted revenue volatility. The phase-out of the Interest and Dividends Tax (IND) by 2026 has also influenced revenue trends.
   - Other taxes, such as the Communication Services Tax (CST) and Utility Property Tax, have seen fluctuations due to technological shifts and market conditions.

3. **Rainy Day Fund and Cash Reserves**:
   - The state’s rainy day fund stands at $159.9 million, with plans to replenish it further. The state can cover 36.3 days of general fund expenditures and maintains a strong cash position of $3 billion.

### **Economic Recovery and Challenges**
1. **Post-Pandemic Recovery**:
   - New Hampshire’s private sector employment has rebounded faster than after the Great Recession, with the state exceeding pre-pandemic employment levels by over 1%. Key sectors like professional services and construction have driven growth, while healthcare and retail lag behind.

2. **Workforce and Housing Shortages**:
   - The state faces a severe workforce shortage, exacerbated by a housing crisis. The median gross rent is $1,500/month, and vacancy rates are at 0.3%, making housing unaffordable for many workers.
   - Unemployment claims are significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels, but employers struggle to fill positions, particularly in healthcare and childcare.

3. **Inflation and Economic Indicators**:
   - The Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation (which peaked at 7% in December 2022) have led to an inverted yield curve, signaling a potential recession in the next 6-12 months.

### **Labor Market and Demographic Trends**
1. **Labor Force Participation**:
   - New Hampshire’s labor force participation rate (65%) is higher than the national average (62%), but the state still has 8,500 fewer workers than before the pandemic. Challenges include re-engaging women sidelined by childcare responsibilities and younger workers (25-29 years old) with stubbornly low participation rates.

2. **Demographic Shifts**:
   - The state’s population is aging, with declining birth rates and increased mortality. Migration, particularly from Massachusetts, drives population growth, but some rural areas face decline.
   - New Hampshire is becoming more diverse, especially among younger populations, with minority groups accounting for all population growth between 2010 and 2020.

3. **Economic and Educational Attainment**:
   - The state attracts well-educated migrants, but income and educational attainment vary across racial and ethnic groups, with some minority groups experiencing higher poverty rates.

### **Economic Development and Strategic Initiatives**
1. **Tourism and Economic Development**:
   - Tourism remains a major focus, with efforts to integrate marketing and economic development strategies. The Department of Business and Economic Affairs emphasizes business retention, workforce development, and international relations.

2. **Infrastructure Investments**:
   - The state is leveraging federal funds to expand broadband access in underserved rural areas and support affordable housing projects through initiatives like InvestNH.

3. **Regional Collaboration**:
   - Collaborative economic development regions have been established to address regional disparities and implement tailored strategies.

### **Key Takeaways and Future Directions**
1. **Strong Financial Position**:
   - New Hampshire’s tax revenues, cash reserves, and credit ratings are robust, positioning the state well to weather potential economic downturns.

2. **Critical Challenges**:
   - Workforce and housing shortages remain the state’s top economic challenges, requiring immediate attention to sustain growth and competitiveness.

3. **Policy Recommendations**:
   - Policymakers are encouraged to address childcare access, flexible employment opportunities, and training programs to boost labor force participation. Housing affordability and targeted support for underrepresented groups (e.g., women, younger workers) are also priorities.

4. **Monitoring Demographic Trends**:
   - The state must address the implications of an aging population, declining birth rates, and uneven population growth across regions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored New Hampshire’s strong economic recovery and fiscal health but highlighted persistent challenges in housing, workforce availability, and demographic shifts. Strategic initiatives focused on economic development, infrastructure, and workforce engagement will be critical to maintaining the state’s competitive edge and ensuring long-term prosperity. Future sessions will continue to monitor these issues and refine policy responses.
