### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (January 24, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 24, 2023, to discuss several key bills and topics related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, vehicle emissions, and community power programs. The meeting was impacted by weather-related delays, leading to rescheduling of some activities. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

#### **1. House Bill 418: Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and REC Sweeping**
- **Objective**: HB 418 aims to amend New Hampshire’s RPS by ending the practice of "REC sweeping," where utilities claim Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) from customer-owned renewable systems. This practice discourages investment in renewable energy by individuals and businesses.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Ensure RECs from customer-owned systems remain with the owners, incentivizing renewable energy investments.
  - Redirect funds from the **Energy Efficiency Fund** to fully fund energy efficiency programs, emphasizing long-term energy savings (estimated 3-4x return) over small rebates to ratepayers.
- **Debate**:
  - **Proponents**: Highlight the long-term benefits of energy efficiency investments, such as reduced energy demand and lower costs for all ratepayers.
  - **Opponents**: Express concerns about the short-term impact on ratepayers, particularly during a period of high electric rates, as rebates would be eliminated.

#### **2. House Bill 418 FN: Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Funds Allocation**
- **Objective**: Redirect RGGI auction proceeds from rebates to ratepayers (approximately $28–$30 annually) toward **Energy Efficiency programs**, aiming for long-term energy savings.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Allocate $40 million from RGGI funds to energy efficiency initiatives, such as weatherization projects in schools and communities.
- **Debate**:
  - **Proponents**: Emphasize the 3–4x return on energy efficiency investments, reduced peak demand, and lower transmission costs.
  - **Opponents**: Highlight the immediate financial burden on ratepayers and recommend maintaining rebates while supporting energy efficiency programs.
  - **NH Department of Energy**: Opposes the bill, citing the short-term impact on consumers.

---

#### **3. Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire**
- **Overview**: Clifton Below presented on the **Community Power Coalition**, a non-profit joint power agency allowing municipalities and counties to become alternative default electricity providers. The Coalition aims to offer lower rates, more product choices, and value-added services.
- **Key Points**:
  - 27 member communities, representing 21% of NH’s population, are working to launch community power programs.
  - The Coalition has secured funding, contracts, and credit support to become operational.
- **Discussion**: Committee members inquired about the vetting process for communities, financial stability, and the potential for geothermal energy in NH.

#### **4. House Bill 92: Adoption of California’s Section 177 Vehicle Emission Standards**
- **Objective**: Adopt California’s Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standards to increase access to cleaner vehicles in NH, starting January 1, 2024.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Implement a credit system for manufacturers to ensure ZEV/LEV availability on dealer lots.
  - Include an 8-year, 80,000-mile warranty for ZEV/LEV components.
  - Fund program administration through a $0.50 increase in inspection sticker fees.
- **Debate**:
  - **Proponents**: Highlight the need to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and align NH with neighboring states adopting Section 177.
  - **Opponents**: Argue the bill would tie NH to California’s evolving regulations, increase costs, and limit consumer choice. Critics also express concerns about EV infrastructure and practicality in NH’s colder climate.
  - **Public Testimony**: Strong opposition from the NH Auto Dealers Association and NH Motorcyclists Rights Organization, citing limited EV inventory, impracticality for motorcyclists, and potential bans on internal combustion engines by 2035.

---

#### **5. House Bill 576: Energy Conservation and PACE Reserve Fund**
- **Objective**: Establish a **Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE)** program to finance energy efficiency, renewable energy, and infrastructure improvements through voluntary property tax assessments.
- **Key Points**:
  - C-PACE is used in over 37 states and would be voluntary for NH municipalities.
  - Concerns were raised about using the **System Benefits Charge (SBC)** as a financial backstop, potentially impacting existing Energy Efficiency budgets.
  - **Opposition**: The NH Department of Energy and Eversource opposed the bill due to concerns about the SBC provision, though an amendment was proposed to address these issues.

#### **6. Next Steps and Rescheduling**
- The committee canceled the executive session due to weather-related delays, rescheduling many bills for the following week. Meetings are planned for Monday, Tuesday, and Friday, with a House session on Thursday.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
1. **Energy Efficiency vs. Ratepayer Rebates**: Several bills (HB 418, HB 418 FN) sparked debates on whether to prioritize long-term energy efficiency investments or provide immediate financial relief to ratepayers.
2. **Vehicle Emissions Standards**: HB 92 highlighted the tension between reducing emissions and maintaining consumer choice, with strong opposition from auto dealers and motorcyclists.
3. **Community Power and C-PACE**: The Community Power Coalition and HB 576 demonstrated efforts to empower municipalities and businesses to adopt renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.
4. **Weather-Related Delays**: The meeting was impacted by weather, leading to rescheduling of several activities and executive sessions.

The committee’s discussions underscored the challenges of balancing short-term consumer needs with long-term energy and environmental goals, with further deliberations expected in the coming weeks.
