**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/18/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 18, 2023, addressed a wide range of education-related issues, focusing on legislation aimed at improving student outcomes, addressing logistical challenges, and ensuring equitable access to resources. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics discussed across all segments:

---

### **1. Career and Technical Education (CTE) and Transportation Funding**
- **Transportation Reimbursement for CTE Centers**:  
  - The committee discussed the challenges of coordinating transportation for students attending CTE centers, which serve multiple school districts.  
  - A new transportation reimbursement formula is under development by the Department of Education, with implementation expected by 2025.  
  - Concerns were raised about the inefficiency of using large buses for small groups of students and the financial burden on school districts.  
  - **HB 364** proposes updating the reimbursement formula to account for vehicle type and trip frequency, aiming to make transportation funding more equitable and efficient.  

- **CTE Program Accessibility**:  
  - The committee emphasized the importance of expanding access to CTE programs, which are often limited by transportation costs and logistical challenges.

### **2. Criminal Background Checks for School Employees**
- **HB 267**:  
  - Introduced by Representative Joe Alexander, the bill allows school districts to require more frequent criminal background checks for employees and volunteers.  
  - Currently, only one background check is required upon hiring, with no subsequent checks.  
  - The bill aims to empower local districts to negotiate the frequency of checks, enhancing school safety.

### **3. Dyslexia Screening and Intervention**
- **HB 377**:  
  - The bill focuses on improving early identification and intervention for students with dyslexia and related disorders.  
  - It mandates dyslexia screening twice yearly for grades K–2 and clarifies intervention timelines.  
  - Advocates stressed the importance of early intervention to prevent long-term academic and emotional struggles.  
  - Challenges include delayed identification, lack of teacher training, and inconsistent screening practices across districts.  
  - Testimonies highlighted the prevalence of dyslexia (affecting approximately 10,000 NH students) and the need for phonics-based instruction.  
  - Suggested amendments include extending screening to third grade and incorporating Rapid Automized Naming (RAN) tests.

### **4. Dual and Concurrent Enrollment Programs**
- **HB 420**:  
  - The bill aims to expand dual and concurrent enrollment programs, allowing high school students to take college-level courses and earn both high school and college credits.  
  - Proposed changes include increasing the number of courses students can take annually from two to five and broadening the program beyond STEM to include humanities and social sciences.  
  - Supporters argue that the expansion will save families money, increase student engagement, and retain New Hampshire’s workforce by encouraging post-secondary education within the state.  
  - Concerns were raised about the potential shift away from STEM and CTE-focused courses and the challenge of finding qualified teachers, particularly in math.

### **5. Math Learning Communities Program**
- **HB 419**:  
  - The bill seeks to reinstate the Math Learning Communities Program, which addresses math proficiency and remediation needs for high school students transitioning to college.  
  - The program includes two courses: Advanced Mathematical Foundations (remedial) and Quantitative Reasoning (college-level).  
  - Students who complete the program show significant improvement in math skills, with 95% achieving higher Accuplacer scores.  
  - The program requires $200,000 annually for teacher training, curriculum development, and coordination.  
  - Testimonies highlighted the decline in math proficiency among NH students, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the program’s success in reducing remediation needs.

### **6. School Meal Programs**
- **HB 429**:  
  - The bill requires all public schools receiving federal funds to provide breakfast and lunch to students who qualify for free or reduced meals.  
  - Currently, six public schools and many charter schools do not provide meals.  
  - Supporters argue that providing meals is essential for student health, learning, and behavior, especially in light of rising food insecurity.  
  - Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact on schools that currently do not offer meals.  

- **HB 424**:  
  - The bill addresses school lunch debt and prohibits practices that stigmatize students who cannot pay for meals.  
  - It mandates that schools provide the same meal to all students, regardless of lunch debt, and communicate directly with parents or guardians about unpaid balances.  
  - The bill aims to prevent discriminatory practices against students from low-income families while not eliminating lunch debt.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Early Intervention**: Multiple bills emphasized the importance of early identification and support, whether for reading difficulties, math proficiency, or hunger.  
- **Equity and Access**: Discussions highlighted the need to ensure equitable access to educational opportunities, CTE programs, and nutritious meals for all students.  
- **Funding and Resources**: Concerns about costs were raised, but advocates argued that investing in these initiatives would yield long-term benefits for students and communities.  
- **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: The tension between local decision-making and state-level requirements was a recurring theme, particularly in education and nutrition programs.

### **Next Steps**
The committee heard extensive testimonies on all bills and is expected to consider amendments before making recommendations. The focus remains on improving educational outcomes, addressing logistical and funding challenges, and ensuring that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed.
