**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/26/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 26, 2023, to discuss a range of healthcare-related bills, focusing on prescription drug affordability, healthcare cost transparency, ambulance service billing, and the potential implementation of all-payer or single-payer healthcare systems. The meeting also addressed environmental health concerns related to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) exposure and its impact on insurance coverage. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and issues addressed during the meeting:

### **1. Prescription Drug Affordability and the PDAB**
   - **House Bill 172**: The committee debated a bill proposing a temporary suspension of the **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB)**, established in 2020 to address rising prescription drug costs. The bill’s sponsor, **Representative Jess Edwards**, expressed concerns about the board’s effectiveness, transparency, and potential redundancy with existing state and federal programs. Critics argued that the PDAB had yet to produce actionable results and questioned its funding mechanisms, including proposed fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers.
   - **Support for the PDAB**: Advocates, including **Gary Merchant** (PDAB Chair) and **Jen Delaney** (AARP New Hampshire), defended the board’s role in increasing drug price transparency and addressing affordability. They emphasized that 85% of Granite Staters consider drug costs a critical issue and urged against suspending the board’s operations.
   - **Alternative Approaches**: Some committee members suggested that the board’s goals could be achieved more efficiently through existing state agencies, while others advocated for a pause to reassess its structure and mandate.

### **2. Healthcare Cost Transparency**
   - **House Bill 389**: This bill aims to improve healthcare price transparency by requiring hospitals to disclose prices for medical services and prohibiting debt collection from non-compliant facilities. Supporters argued that price transparency empowers patients, reduces unexpected bills, and fosters competition among providers. Opponents, including the **New Hampshire Hospital Association**, claimed that state-level enforcement was unnecessary, as hospitals are already compliant with federal transparency laws.
   - **Federal Context**: The federal **No Surprises Act** (effective January 2021) mandates hospitals to post prices, but compliance has been inconsistent. The bill proposed state-level enforcement mechanisms, including fines and corrective action plans for violations.

### **3. All-Payer and Single-Payer Healthcare Systems**
   - **House Bill 319**: The committee discussed a proposal to study an **all-payer healthcare system**, modeled after Maryland’s system, which standardizes payments across insurers (Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers). Advocates argued that this system could reduce costs, improve transparency, and stabilize rural hospitals by providing predictable funding.
   - **Single-Payer Proposal**: **Representative Peter Schmidt** introduced a single-payer healthcare bill, emphasizing affordability and the potential for a regional compact with other New England states. Supporters highlighted the need for systemic changes to address the healthcare crisis, while opponents expressed concerns about government interference and feasibility.

### **4. Ambulance Services and Balance Billing**
   - **House Bill 373**: The committee discussed a bill to eliminate **balance billing** for ambulance services, ensuring insurers reimburse providers directly rather than burdening patients with unexpected bills. Ambulance service providers and fire chiefs opposed the bill, arguing it would eliminate a critical revenue source, particularly for rural services that already face financial strain.
   - **Federal Context**: The federal **No Surprises Act** prohibits balance billing for most medical services but excludes ground ambulances. Stakeholders urged waiting for the completion of a federal cost study by CMS before enacting state-level changes.
   - **Proposed Solutions**: Stakeholders suggested increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates and implementing regulatory oversight to ensure fair payments from insurance companies.

### **5. PFAS Exposure and Insurance Coverage**
   - **House Bill 414**: This bill would require insurance companies to cover preventive care for illnesses linked to PFAS exposure. Testimony included personal stories of individuals with high PFAS levels and related health issues, such as cancer and reproductive disorders. Supporters emphasized the need for early diagnosis and preventive care, while opponents argued it was premature due to the lack of federal guidelines and scientific consensus.

### **6. Insurance Department Cleanup Bill**
   - **House Bill 613**: The Insurance Department presented a cleanup bill aimed at updating and clarifying RSA 404g, which governs the individual health insurance market. The bill removes obsolete terms and programs, such as high-risk pools, and aligns with current practices, including the administration of the 1332 waiver program.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of healthcare reform in New Hampshire, with discussions focusing on:
   - The need for **prescription drug affordability** and the role of the PDAB.
   - Efforts to improve **healthcare price transparency** and protect consumers from unexpected bills.
   - Proposals for **all-payer and single-payer healthcare systems** to reduce costs and improve access.
   - Challenges faced by **ambulance services**, particularly in rural areas, and the need for fair reimbursement practices.
   - The impact of **PFAS exposure** on public health and the call for insurance coverage for related health issues.

Overall, the meeting underscored the urgency of addressing healthcare affordability, transparency, and access while balancing the economic sustainability of healthcare providers and the need for consumer protection.
