### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting (01/19/23)  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 19, 2023, addressed several key bills related to labor, wages, employment protections, and workplace equity. The discussions centered on raising the minimum wage, eliminating sub-minimum wages for tipped workers, protecting therapeutic cannabis users in the workplace, and safeguarding employee rights regarding earned time and union organizing. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions:

---

### **Raising the Minimum Wage (HB 57)**  
**Proposal**: HB 57 seeks to increase New Hampshire’s minimum wage from the federal standard of $7.25/hour to $15/hour by 2025, with incremental increases and indexing to inflation starting in 2026.  

**Support**:  
- Advocates, including Representatives Kathy Staub and Claudia Estelle, argued that the current minimum wage has not increased since 2009, leaving workers struggling to afford basic necessities like housing, food, and healthcare.  
- Testimonies from workers like Maria Perez and Grace Condecke highlighted the challenges of surviving on low wages, often requiring multiple jobs.  
- Supporters emphasized that raising the minimum wage would reduce poverty, improve mental health, and stimulate the local economy by increasing consumer spending.  
- Reverend Dr. Gail Kinney and others framed the issue as a moral imperative, asserting that all workers deserve a living wage and dignity.  

**Opposition**:  
- Opponents, including Bruce Berkey of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), argued that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses, reduced employee hours, and increased automation.  
- Concerns were raised about “wage compression,” where employees earning slightly above the new minimum wage would demand raises, increasing costs for employers.  
- Critics contended that the current labor market naturally drives wages up without government intervention.

### **Eliminating Sub-Minimum Wages for Tipped Workers (HB 58)**  
**Proposal**: HB 58 aims to eliminate the sub-minimum wage category for tipped workers, ensuring they receive the full minimum wage.  

**Support**:  
- Sponsors and advocates, including Representative Schultz, argued that the sub-minimum wage system has roots in post-slavery practices and perpetuates inequities.  
- Testimonies from workers highlighted the financial instability and lack of dignity associated with relying on tips for income.  

**Opposition**:  
- Opponents, such as Henry Vayu of the NH Lodging and Restaurant Association, argued that tipped workers already earn significantly more than the minimum wage through tips and that eliminating the sub-minimum wage would harm small businesses.

### **Employment Protections for Therapeutic Cannabis Users (HB 82)**  
**Proposal**: HB 82 seeks to protect employees participating in New Hampshire’s therapeutic cannabis program from discrimination or adverse employment actions based on their participation.  

**Support**:  
- Advocates, including Representative Suzanne Vale, shared personal stories of facing employment challenges due to drug testing, despite using cannabis legally for medical conditions.  
- Testimonies emphasized the benefits of therapeutic cannabis in managing chronic pain and reducing opioid dependency, arguing that users should not face discrimination for legally managing their health.  

**Concerns**:  
- Some committee members raised questions about the bill’s implications for safety-sensitive industries and potential conflicts with federal laws.

### **Employee Protections Regarding Earned Time (HB 74)**  
**Proposal**: HB 74 aims to ensure employees are paid for unused earned time (e.g., vacation, PTO) under specific conditions, such as company sale, layoffs, or termination in good standing.  

**Support**:  
- Sponsors, including Representative Michael Cahill, argued that employees should not lose earned time due to circumstances beyond their control, such as sudden layoffs or company sales.  

**Opposition**:  
- Opponents, including the Business and Industry Association (BIA), argued that the bill is too broad and could impose burdens on employers, particularly small businesses.  

---

### **Anti-Union Activities by Employers (HB 118)**  
**Proposal**: HB 118 seeks to prohibit employers from mandating employees to attend anti-union training sessions.  

**Support**:  
- Advocates argued that mandatory anti-union meetings create a biased first impression of unions and prevent employees from making informed decisions.  
- Union organizers shared personal experiences of intimidation tactics used by employers during such meetings.  

**Opposition**:  
- Critics, including the BIA, argued that the bill could infringe on free speech, be preempted by federal labor laws, and impose excessive fines ($10,000 per employee) for non-compliance.
