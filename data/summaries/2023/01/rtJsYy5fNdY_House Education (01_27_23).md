Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and debates:

### **House Bill 572: Expanding Eligibility for Free School Meals**
HB 572 aims to address food insecurity among low- to middle-income families by expanding eligibility for free school meals to families earning up to **300% of the federal poverty level** and eliminating the reduced-price meal category. Key points included:
- **Nutrition Concerns**: Representatives raised questions about the quality of school meals, citing child obesity and the need for healthier options.

### **House Bill 625: Access to Academic Courses**
HB 625 seeks to expand access to academic courses beyond high school to include elementary and middle school students, as well as non-public, charter, and homeschool students. Key points included:
- **Reimbursement**: Schools would be reimbursed at **$0.15 per pupil per course**, but reimbursement is currently contingent on available state appropriations.
- **Funding Concerns**: Representatives questioned the fiscal impact of expanding access to younger grades, estimated at **$120,000 annually**, and the challenges of defining and reimbursing integrated curricula in elementary and middle schools.
- **Amendment Proposed**: An amendment was introduced to include all eligible students and ensure reimbursement regardless of funding availability.

### **Special Education Funding: HB 540, HB 501, and HB 439**
Several bills addressed special education funding and compliance with federal law:
- **HB 540**: Proposed a weighted funding formula for special education services, increasing funding for students requiring more intensive services (e.g., **$6,239.89 for Category C** students in separate facilities). The bill aims to address the inadequacy of the current flat rate of **$2,079 per student**.
- **HB 501**: Made technical corrections to align state statutes with federal law, ensuring services for students with disabilities up to age 21.
- **HB 439**: Repealed redundant language in education statutes related to private school contracts.
- **Concerns**: Representatives raised issues about the potential financial impact (estimated at **$10 million**) and the risk of discouraging mainstreaming students with disabilities.

### **Cooperative School District Withdrawal (HB 530)**
HB 530 aims to create a fairer process for districts wishing to withdraw from Cooperative School Districts. Key points included:
- **Voting Process**: The bill proposes a three-fifths majority vote requirement from both the withdrawing district and the entire Cooperative District.
- **Challenges**: Testimonies highlighted the difficulties faced by smaller districts, such as Carroll and Derry, in withdrawing due to financial and demographic changes.

### **Water Bottle Filling Stations (HB 466)**
HB 466 simplifies the implementation of water bottle filling stations in schools by eliminating the rule-making process. The Department of Education supports this change, stating that statutory language alone is sufficient.

---

### **Education Trust Fund (HB 440)**
HB 440 updates **RSA 198:39** to clarify the uses of the Education Trust Fund, including provisions for **charter school lease aid** and other educational programs. Key points included:
- **Support**: Proponents framed the bill as a **housekeeping measure** to codify existing practices.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including representatives and stakeholders, argued that the bill could divert funds from public schools to private or charter schools, particularly through **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**. Concerns were raised about financial accountability and the potential harm to public education.
- **Litigation Concerns**: Some representatives questioned whether the bill should proceed while legal challenges related to the Education Trust Fund and EFAs are unresolved.

### **Overall Themes and Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted several recurring themes:
1. **Equity and Access**: Bills like HB 572 (school meals) and HB 625 (academic courses) focused on expanding access to essential resources for students, particularly those from low-income families or non-public educational settings.
2. **Funding Challenges**: Discussions around special education funding (HB 540) and the Education Trust Fund (HB 440) underscored the financial complexities of supporting diverse educational needs while ensuring compliance with federal law.
3. **Bipartisan Concerns**: While many bills enjoyed bipartisan support, debates around HB 440 revealed deep divisions over the role of public versus private education and the allocation of state funds.
4. **Logistical and Implementation Issues**: Several bills faced questions about their practical implementation, particularly those involving reimbursement models (HB 625) and special education categorization (HB 540).

The meeting concluded with a mix of procedural votes and ongoing debates, signaling that many of these issues will require further discussion and potential amendments before final resolution.
