**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (January 27, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 27, 2023, to discuss a range of bills and topics related to education policy, funding, and nutrition. The meeting highlighted the complexities of managing school programs, addressing food insecurity, modernizing funding formulas, and ensuring equitable access to education for all students. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **1. School Nutrition and Meal Programs**
The committee focused on two bills aimed at improving access to and the quality of school meals, addressing food insecurity, and balancing nutrition with student preferences.

- **House Bill 572**: This bill proposes increasing the income eligibility threshold for free school meals to 300% of the federal poverty level (up to $90,000 annually for a family of four) and eliminating the reduced-price meal category. The goal is to support low- to middle-income families struggling with rising living costs. Testimony from organizations like New Hampshire Hunger Solutions and the American Heart Association emphasized the link between nutrition, academic performance, and long-term health outcomes. Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact, meal quality, and potential administrative burdens. The committee committed to refining the bill to clarify funding sources and address nutritional standards.

- **School Lunch Quality**: Discussions also addressed the nutritional quality of school meals, acknowledging improvements since 2012 due to USDA guidelines. While school meals are designed to meet higher nutritional standards, challenges remain in balancing health with student preferences. The cost-effectiveness of school meals was highlighted, with the committee noting that they provide significant nutrient value at a low cost.

### **2. Special Education Funding (House Bill 540)**
The committee discussed **HB 540**, which proposes a weighted funding formula for special education services to better align funding with the varying needs of students with disabilities. Key points included:

- **Current Issues**: The existing flat rate of approximately $2,079 per student does not account for the differing costs associated with various disabilities.
- **Proposed Formula**: The bill introduces three funding categories based on the intensity of services required:
  - **Category A**: Less than 80% of the school day ($2,079).
  - **Category B**: More than 80% of the school day ($4,729).
  - **Category C**: Separate schools, residential facilities, or homebound/hospital placements ($6,239).
- **Cost Implications**: The weighted formula would increase funding by about $10 million, from $63 million to $73 million annually.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about potential incentives for placing students in more restrictive settings and the impact on mainstreaming efforts. Testimony from experts, including the Disability Rights Center, supported the bill as a necessary update to ensure compliance with federal law and better meet student needs.

### **3. Education Funding and Governance**
Several bills addressed education funding mechanisms and governance:

- **House Bill 440**: This bill updates RSA 198:39 to consolidate and clarify the permissible uses of the Education Trust Fund, including kindergarten grants and charter school funding. The intent is to provide a comprehensive view of the fund’s uses in one place.
- **House Bill 466**: This bill eliminates the rulemaking process for water bottle filling stations in schools, streamlining implementation and removing bureaucratic hurdles.
- **House Bill 530**: This bill proposes a more balanced process for school districts to withdraw from Cooperative School Districts, requiring a three-fifths majority in both the withdrawing district and the entire Cooperative District.

### **4. Education Trust Fund and Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**
The committee discussed a bill related to the Education Trust Fund, with significant concerns raised about its potential impact on public education funding and accountability:

- **Purpose**: The bill aims to codify existing practices and update laws regarding the Education Trust Fund, including moving charter school lease aid from the general fund to the Education Trust Fund.
- **Concerns About EFAs**:
  - **Blank Check Issue**: Critics argued that the bill could create unlimited spending from the Education Trust Fund for EFAs, potentially shifting costs to the general fund if the trust fund is depleted.
  - **Accountability**: Concerns were raised about the lack of financial and educational accountability for EFAs, with studies suggesting negative impacts on student outcomes.
  - **Civil Rights**: Testimony highlighted potential discrimination in private schools receiving EFA funds, particularly regarding LGBTQ+ students and students with disabilities.
- **Support for Public Schools**: Representatives emphasized the state’s constitutional obligation to fund public education and warned against diverting funds from the Education Trust Fund to EFAs, which could harm public schools and increase taxpayer burdens.

### **5. Broader Context and Procedural Matters**
The meeting also addressed broader issues, including the fiscal impact of proposed bills, the importance of maintaining transparency and fairness in the legislative process, and the need for careful consideration of long-term implications. Procedural matters, such as the timing of executive sessions, were also discussed to ensure proper adherence to legislative protocols.
