The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 9, 2023, conducted by the House Executive Departments and Administration Committee, covered a wide range of topics, focusing primarily on the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS), the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), and the New Hampshire Board of Dental Examiners. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)

1. **System Overview and Benefits**:
   - NHRS is a contributory, multi-employer defined benefit plan established in 1967, providing retirement, disability, death benefits, and a medical subsidy.
   - Benefits include Service Retirement, Disability Benefits (job-related and non-job-related), Early Retirement (with reduced benefits), and Deferred Retirement. Benefits are determined by statutory formulas based on creditable service, average final compensation, and benefit multipliers.

2. **Funding and Liabilities**:
   - The system is funded through employee and employer contributions and investment income. The unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) stands at $5.69 billion, with a funded ratio of 65.6%.
   - Employers are responsible for paying down the UAAL, contributing 77% to 85% of the total pension cost, primarily due to past decisions that led to the unfunded liability.

3. **Investment Management**:
   - The Board of Trustees and an independent investment committee oversee investments diversified across domestic and international equities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative investments.
   - The long-term assumed rate of return is 6.75%, and NHRS has outperformed many peers over the past decade.

4. **Legislative Changes and Challenges**:
   - Numerous statutory changes since 2007 have addressed structural issues, such as funding methodologies and gain-sharing practices.
   - Challenges include hiring public employees, particularly in public safety and teaching roles, due to changing workforce dynamics.

### Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and Dental Board

1. **Performance Audit Findings**:
   - The audit revealed significant deficiencies in the Dental Board's operations, including lack of administrative support, inadequate oversight, and unauthorized actions.
   - Issues included regulatory capture, inconsistent enforcement, poor record-keeping, and failure to conduct criminal history checks.

2. **Credentialing and Licensing**:
   - The board issued credentials without proper oversight and inconsistently enforced continuing education requirements.
   - New procedures, including mandatory background checks for all new licensees, are being implemented.

3. **Enforcement and Investigations**:
   - Enforcement cases were inconsistently managed, with some investigations incomplete or dismissed without proper justification.
   - The board is working on improving the tracking and resolution of complaints, focusing on public safety.

4. **Legislative and Rule Changes**:
   - The board is working on legislative changes to address audit findings, including creating a legislative process for forming committees and ensuring all rules align with statutory requirements.
   - The OPLC is procuring an enforcement case management system to track trends and ensure timely case processing.

### Administrative Rules Process

1. **Rulemaking and Oversight**:
   - The administrative rules process involves agencies drafting rules reviewed by the Administrative Rules Office and the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR).
   - JLCAR ensures rules do not exceed legislative authority, are cost-effective, and are in the public interest.

2. **Examples of Rule Objections**:
   - Examples included a $50 fine for violating a smoking ban that lacked legislative authority and a rule attempting to transfer funds from a malpractice insurance fund to the general fund.

### Strategic Goals and Future Plans

1. **OPLC Strategic Goals**:
   - Increasing licensure portability, collaborating with boards to streamline regulations, and promoting public protection.
   - Improving internal controls, conducting risk assessments, and exploring the use of software robots for data entry.

2. **Dental Board and OPLC Initiatives**:
   - Addressing audit findings, enhancing customer service, and procuring a new licensing portal to streamline the licensing process.
   - Resolving challenges such as the temporary halt in inspections of anesthesia facilities and ensuring all necessary inspections and reviews are conducted promptly.

### Conclusion

The meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to improve the financial health of NHRS, address significant deficiencies in the Dental Board's operations, and streamline regulatory processes within the OPLC. Both NHRS and the Dental Board face challenges in compliance, oversight, and efficiency, but steps are being taken to address these issues and ensure long-term sustainability and public safety.
