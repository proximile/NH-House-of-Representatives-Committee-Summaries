### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program Meeting

The meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program focused on several critical issues related to education standards, assessments, and overall school performance. The committee, recently reinstated, plays a vital role in overseeing the development and implementation of school performance and accountability programs, submitting annual reports, proposing necessary legislation, and collaborating with the State Board of Education to enhance school performance.

#### Key Discussions and Topics:

1. **Committee Introduction and Purpose**:
   - The committee was introduced, with members including Representative Cornell, Representative Luna, Representative Miler, Representative Cordelli, and Senator Ruth Ward.
   - The committee's statutory duties were outlined, emphasizing the importance of public transparency, as the meeting was streamed live.

2. **Academic Standards vs. Minimum Standards**:
   - Dr. Nate Green from the New Hampshire Department of Education explained the distinction between academic standards (e.g., College and Career Ready Frameworks) and minimum standards for public school approval (e.g., ED 306).
   - Academic standards define what students should know and be able to do at each grade level, while minimum standards outline the basic requirements for public schools to operate, such as offering specific programs and services.

3. **State Assessments and Proficiency**:
   - The committee reviewed the statewide assessment program, which includes tests in mathematics, science, and English language arts.
   - Social studies, history, geography, civics, and economics are no longer part of the statewide assessments but are the responsibility of local school boards. Concerns were raised about whether local districts are effectively assessing these subjects.
   - State assessments (e.g., SAT for 11th graders) are aligned with academic standards to measure student proficiency. The process of setting performance levels (1-4) and the challenges of aligning assessments with local curriculum decisions were discussed.

4. **COVID-19 Impact on Test Scores**:
   - The committee addressed the decline in student test scores during the pandemic, particularly in math.
   - Dr. Green mentioned ongoing efforts to analyze cohort data and identify factors influencing student performance, with plans to publish a dashboard for tracking proficiency trends.

5. **Mathematics Education**:
   - The committee revisited a 2012 report on improving mathematics instruction in New Hampshire, which highlighted a decline in math performance, particularly in middle and high school grades.
   - Strategies to address this decline include professional development for teachers and integrating real-world applications into math instruction. The committee expressed concern that math proficiency continues to decline and discussed the need for further action.

6. **Social Studies Curriculum**:
   - The committee discussed the lack of a statewide assessment for social studies and the need for local districts to assess these subjects.
   - There was a call for more information on what local districts are doing in terms of social studies curriculum and assessment.

7. **Formative and Summative Assessments**:
   - The committee discussed the differences between formative assessments (like weekly quizzes) and summative assessments (like final exams).
   - Formative assessments help teachers adjust instruction to address gaps in student learning, while summative assessments measure student achievement at the end of a course or program.

8. **Review of Minimum Standards (ED 306)**:
