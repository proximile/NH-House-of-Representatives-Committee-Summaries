**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (01/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 19, 2023, to discuss critical issues related to energy policy, market dynamics, and the transition to a more sustainable and reliable energy system in New England. The meeting featured presentations and discussions with key stakeholders, including Dan Dolan of the New England Power Generators Association (NEPGA) and representatives from ISO New England. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and topics addressed:

---

### **1. Energy Market Dynamics and Competition**
- **Competitive Wholesale Markets**: Dan Dolan emphasized the importance of maintaining a competitive wholesale electricity market to ensure reliability, affordability, and cleaner energy. He noted that no single energy resource can meet all these needs, highlighting the importance of a diverse energy mix.
- **Market Distortions**: The elimination of the Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) by ISO New England was discussed, with concerns raised about how government subsidies for renewable resources might distort market competition.
- **Capacity Payments and Plant Closures**: There were concerns about the potential closure of oil and gas plants due to reduced capacity payments, particularly during peak winter demand periods. The ISO’s plans to address these challenges were highlighted.

---

### **2. Transmission Infrastructure and Costs**
- **Rising Transmission Costs**: The committee discussed the significant increase in transmission costs, which have risen by 800% since 2004 due to aging infrastructure and the need for improved interconnections. Concerns were raised about utilities over-investing in transmission infrastructure due to guaranteed returns.
- **Future Transmission Needs**: The need for substantial investment in transmission infrastructure to support renewable energy integration and meet future demand was emphasized. Projects like Elective Transmission Upgrades (ETUs) and the Transmission 2050 study were highlighted as critical for long-term planning.
- **Challenges in Building Transmission**: Examples like the Northern Pass project and Maine’s referendum issues were cited as challenges in developing new transmission infrastructure.

---

### **3. Renewable Energy Integration and Storage**
- **Growing Role of Renewables**: The committee discussed the increasing role of solar, wind, and battery storage in the energy grid. The integration of these resources to address intermittency and ensure reliability was a key focus.
- **Interconnection Queue**: The growing interconnection queue for renewable energy projects was highlighted, along with the financial commitments required for these developments.
- **Hydropower’s Importance**: Hydropower was emphasized as a critical resource due to its flexibility, reliability, and long-term performance. However, challenges related to subsidies and reinvestment in hydro facilities were noted.

---

### **4. Decarbonization and State Policies**
- **Diverse State Objectives**: The committee acknowledged the differing policy priorities across New England, with southern states like Massachusetts focusing on aggressive decarbonization and northern states like New Hampshire prioritizing affordability and economic considerations.
- **Impact of State Policies**: Massachusetts’ energy efficiency and decarbonization policies were noted as having a significant impact on regional energy prices, with New Hampshire potentially facing higher costs due to its lack of similar policies.
- **Balancing Regional and State Goals**: The challenge of balancing state-specific policy objectives with regional market dynamics was a recurring theme.

---

### **5. Grid Reliability and Future Challenges**
- **Energy Adequacy and Dispatchable Power**: The importance of ensuring energy adequacy and maintaining dispatchable power sources to guarantee grid reliability was emphasized. Discussions included reevaluating capacity factors for natural gas facilities.
- **Winter Peaking and Electrification**: New England is traditionally a summer-peaking system, but the electrification of heating and transportation may shift peak demand to winter. Investments in energy efficiency and behind-the-meter solar PV have helped reduce peak demand despite population and economic growth.
- **Future Grid Studies**: ISO New England is conducting several studies, including the Future Grid Reliability Study and the Transmission 2050 study, to prepare for a grid with high renewable energy penetration and increased electrification.

---

### **6. LNG and Natural Gas Reliability**
- **Mystic Generating Station Closure**: The potential closure of the Mystic Generating Station and its impact on LNG supply in the region was discussed. The need for reliable natural gas supply, especially during peak winter periods, was emphasized.
- **Coordination Between Industries**: The challenges of coordinating between the gas and electricity industries to ensure reliability were highlighted.

---

### **7. Public Engagement and Regulatory Oversight**
- **ISO New England’s Role**: ISO New England plans the transmission grid, administers wholesale markets, and ensures reliable and competitively priced electricity. It operates independently and is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).
- **Consumer Liaison Group (CLG)**: The ISO’s Consumer Liaison Group was mentioned as a resource for public engagement and updates on ongoing projects.

---

### **8. Future Planning and Collaboration**
- **Long-Term Vision**: The meeting underscored the need for policy direction, leadership, and stakeholder collaboration to address the evolving energy landscape. This includes integrating renewable energy sources, improving market structures, and ensuring grid reliability and affordability.
- **Committee Schedule**: The chair outlined the committee’s upcoming schedule, including presentations, bill hearings, and executive sessions.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of managing a competitive and reliable electricity market in New England, balancing state-specific policy goals with regional market dynamics. Key challenges include rising transmission costs, integrating renewable energy, ensuring grid reliability, and addressing the impacts of state policies on energy prices. The committee emphasized the need for continued planning, investment, and collaboration to support the region’s clean energy transition and meet future energy demands.
