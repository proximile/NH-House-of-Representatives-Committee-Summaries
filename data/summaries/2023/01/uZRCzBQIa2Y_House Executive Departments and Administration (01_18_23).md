The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 18, 2023, focused on several bills aimed at improving data sharing, modernizing state systems, and addressing privacy and software freedom. The session highlighted the importance of balancing efficiency, privacy, and practicality in legislative efforts. Below is a summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **House Bill 355: Study Committee on Data Sharing for Public Housing**
- **Purpose**: Proposed the establishment of a committee to study data sharing between state and federal public housing agencies to streamline the housing application process and reduce redundancy for individuals who relocate.
- **Discussion**: Representative Gallagher emphasized the need for data portability, while concerns were raised about conflicts with state privacy laws, feasibility across housing authorities, and financial implications.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill as **"inexpedient to legislate"**, suggesting further study is needed before pursuing legislation.

#### **House Bill 391: Updating Data-Sharing Agreements Between DHHS and DES**
- **Purpose**: Sought to amend RSA 126-A:76 to clarify and update data-sharing agreements between the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of Environmental Services (DES). It also reduced reporting frequency from semi-annual to annual and removed references to a defunct arsenic pilot project.
- **Discussion**: Representative Murphy highlighted the importance of ongoing data sharing for addressing environmental health issues like PFAS contamination. DHHS clarified that data sharing continued despite the lapse of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in June 2022.
- **Outcome**: The committee discussed the bill’s necessity but did not reach a final decision, with DHHS indicating that the proposed changes were acceptable.

#### **House Bill 230: Modernizing the Department of Agriculture’s Data Systems**
- **Purpose**: Aimed to replace outdated, manual data entry processes with an electronic system for licensing, certification, and registration to improve efficiency and reduce staff workload.
- **Discussion**: Representatives emphasized the urgency of modernizing systems, some of which date back to the 1980s. The fiscal note estimated initial costs of $360,000 to $500,000, with annual maintenance costs of $200,000, to be covered by existing fees.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill as **"ought to pass"**, recognizing its potential to enhance services for the agricultural sector.

- **Discussion**: Supporters argued it promotes software freedom and collaboration, while opponents, including the Department of Information Technology, cited ambiguity, enforcement challenges, and potential negative impacts on businesses.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **18-0** to deem the bill **"inexpedient to legislate"**, effectively killing it.

#### **House Bill 327: Prohibiting Proprietary Software on State Websites**
- **Purpose**: Aimed to ensure state websites do not require users to run proprietary JavaScript, protecting privacy and software freedom.
- **Discussion**: Proponents argued it would prevent tracking and enhance privacy, while the Department of Information Technology opposed it due to high implementation costs, auditing complexity, and potential limitations on vendor options.
- **Outcome**: No final decision was reached, but concerns about cost and feasibility dominated the discussion.
