**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting – House Ways and Means (01/12/23)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on January 12, 2023, addressed critical economic and social challenges facing New Hampshire, with a focus on workforce development, housing affordability, inflation, and energy costs. The discussions emphasized the interconnected nature of these issues and the need for collaborative, innovative solutions to support the state’s economy and residents. Key takeaways from the meeting are outlined below:

### **1. Workforce Development and Labor Market Challenges**
- **Trade Schools and Skilled Trades**: Representatives highlighted the urgent need for more trade schools to address workforce shortages, particularly in skilled trades like woodworking and plumbing. They emphasized the potential for trade careers to provide stable, high-paying jobs and the importance of on-the-job training.
- **Child Care and Workforce Participation**: The lack of affordable child care was identified as a significant barrier preventing women with young children from rejoining the workforce. Businesses are increasingly focusing on holistic employee support, including child care assistance and housing loans.
- **Substance Use and Workforce**: The impact of substance use disorders on industries like hospitality and construction was discussed. Some businesses have implemented drug testing and support systems to address these challenges.
- **Labor Market Tightness**: The labor market remains extremely tight, with more job openings than available workers. Workforce shortages are particularly acute in hospitality and manufacturing, driving wage pressures and contributing to inflation.

### **2. Housing Affordability and Market Dynamics**
- **Housing Demand and Inventory**: Housing demand remains strong, but inventory is historically low, with only about a month’s worth of supply—far below the healthy benchmark of 4-6 months. Homes are selling quickly, especially in competitive markets like Rockingham County, where median prices exceed $500,000.
- **Affordability Challenges**: Rising construction costs ($300-$800 per square foot) and high property taxes make it difficult for first-time buyers to afford homes. Rising interest rates have further slowed sales, as homeowners are reluctant to sell and lose low-rate mortgages.
- **Investors and Short-Term Rentals**: New Hampshire has low investor activity, but some communities are seeing increased short-term rental usage. Zoning and permitting processes continue to hinder development, though density and tax incentives are being explored.
- **State and Local Solutions**: The state may need to play a larger role in addressing the housing crisis, as local control often resists development. Creative solutions like development rights exchanges and incentives for municipalities to build housing are being considered.

### **3. Inflation and Economic Trends**
- **Inflation Drivers**: Jason Huang, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Research at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, outlined six primary contributors to inflation: supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine, increased post-COVID travel demand, high household savings, rising home prices, and labor shortages. While inflation has moderated from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, it remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
- **Household Debt**: Household debt has increased by over 8% in the past year, driven largely by rising housing costs. The average household debt is now around $165,000, with housing accounting for 30% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- **Economic Outlook**: Inflation is expected to moderate, but there is a risk of a shallow recession in the latter half of 2023. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the labor market as a key driver of inflation.

### **4. Commercial Real Estate and Energy Costs**
- **Commercial Real Estate Trends**: The shift to remote work has reduced demand for office space, with some properties being converted into residential units. However, the industrial sector remains strong due to supply chain needs, while retail spaces are adapting through experiential retail and adaptive reuse.
- **Energy Costs**: Rising energy costs are a concern, particularly for energy-intensive industries like manufacturing. The stability and reliability of the energy grid are critical issues for economic growth.

### **5. Workforce Development and Economic Stability**
- **Attracting Talent to Trades**: There is a need to address the stigma against vocational education and attract more people to trade careers. Programs that incentivize students to stay in New Hampshire and pursue trade jobs could help alleviate workforce shortages.
- **Business Travel and Hospitality**: Business travel has not returned to pre-pandemic levels and is not expected to fully recover until 2024. The hospitality industry continues to face challenges, including labor shortages and increased security costs.

### **6. Legislative and Collaborative Solutions**
- **Legislative Action**: Representatives called for increased funding for child care, support for workforce development programs, and scaling business partnerships with public schools. Legislative action is also needed to address housing affordability and streamline development processes.
- **Collaborative Efforts**: The meeting emphasized the importance of collaboration between the state, municipalities, businesses, and educational institutions to tackle interconnected challenges like workforce shortages, housing affordability, and inflation.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a recognition of the critical need for innovative and collaborative solutions to address New Hampshire’s economic and social challenges. Representatives highlighted the importance of legislative action, workforce development, and creative housing solutions to support the state’s economy and improve the quality of life for its residents. The House Ways and Means Committee will continue to explore these issues in future meetings, with a focus on fostering economic stability and growth.
