The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 12, 2023, focused on several key bills, with significant attention given to **House Bill 61 (HB 61)**, which seeks to repeal the state's "divisive concepts" law (RSA 193:40), and **House Bill 35 (HB 35)**, which proposes including a helpline number for eating disorders on student ID cards. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 61: Repealing the "Divisive Concepts" Law**

#### **Overview and Context**
HB 61 aims to repeal the "divisive concepts" law, enacted in 2021, which restricts the teaching of certain topics related to race, gender, and identity in public schools and workplaces. The law has been a source of significant controversy, with arguments both for and against its repeal.

#### **Support for HB 61**
1. **Educators and Teachers**:
   - Teachers testified that the law creates a "chilling effect," discouraging open discussions about race, gender, and historical injustices. They argued that its vague language leads to fear and self-censorship in classrooms.
   - Educators emphasized the importance of teaching systemic racism, historical injustices, and LGBTQ+ identities to foster critical thinking and empathy among students.

2. **Students**:
   - Students highlighted how the law prevents them from learning about their own identities and histories, particularly for marginalized groups. They stressed the need for honest conversations in the classroom for personal growth and understanding diverse perspectives.

3. **Advocates and Parents**:
   - Advocates argued that the law undermines public education by silencing discussions about systemic inequalities. Parents expressed concern that it promotes ignorance and intolerance.

4. **Historical and Societal Context**:
   - Historians and academics underscored the importance of teaching systemic racism and historical injustices, such as slavery and colonialism, to build a more equitable society.

#### **Opposition to HB 61**
1. **Concerns About Indoctrination**:
   - Opponents claimed the law protects students from being taught that they are inherently superior or inferior based on their race, gender, or identity. They argued that repealing it would allow for "divisive" ideologies like Critical Race Theory (CRT).

2. **Focus on Core Education**:
   - Some speakers emphasized that schools should focus on basic skills like reading, writing, and math rather than "divisive" topics. They argued that the law ensures teacher neutrality and avoids personal politics in the classroom.

3. **Parental Rights**:
   - Opponents expressed concern that HB 61 would allow schools to teach controversial topics without parental consent or oversight.

#### **Key Themes**
- **Fear and Ambiguity**: Supporters highlighted the law's vague language, which creates a chilling effect in classrooms.
- **Systemic Racism and Historical Truth**: Advocates stressed the importance of teaching systemic racism and historical injustices.
- **Academic Freedom vs. Neutrality**: Opponents argued for teacher neutrality, while supporters emphasized the need for academic freedom.
- **Impact on Students**: Personal stories were shared about how the law affects students’ ability to learn and feel represented.

### **House Bill 35: Eating Disorders Helpline on Student IDs**

#### **Overview and Purpose**
HB 35 requires student identification cards to include the National Eating Disorders Helpline number, aiming to provide immediate and accessible support for students struggling with eating disorders.

#### **Support for HB 35**
1. **Severity of Eating Disorders**:
   - Experts highlighted that eating disorders are the second leading cause of suicide among youth. The bill aims to provide immediate, anonymous access to help, even for students who may not recognize their condition as a crisis.

2. **Personal Testimonies**:
   - Representatives and health professionals shared personal and professional experiences with eating disorders, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and specialized support.

3. **Adolescent Behavior**:
   - Adolescents are more likely to reach out for help if the resource is directly related to their specific issue, such as eating disorders, rather than a general mental health or suicide hotline.

#### **Concerns and Amendments**
1. **Practicality and Cost**:
   - Representatives from the university and community college systems noted that they already include various helpline numbers on student ID cards. They expressed concerns about the practicality and cost of adding another number.

2. **Proposed Amendments**:
   - An amendment was proposed to allow schools to include the eating disorder helpline number on ID cards if they choose, but not require it, especially for schools that have already printed a bulk supply of cards.

#### **Key Takeaways**
- **Accessibility**: The bill aims to make support for eating disorders more accessible to students.
- **Implementation Flexibility**: Amendments were proposed to address practical concerns and ensure feasibility.

### **House Bill 131: Classroom Recording and Observation Policies**

#### **Overview and Purpose**
HB 131 requires school districts to report their policies on classroom recordings and observers to the Department of Education (DOE) for a "best practices" folder.

#### **Discussion**
1. **Purpose and Intent**:
   - The bill aims to address issues raised during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as hybrid learning, technology access, and privacy concerns.

2. **Concerns and Clarifications**:
   - Concerns were raised about potential safety risks if policies on classroom access were made publicly available. The DOE clarified that collected policies would be made publicly available on their website.

3. **Existing Policies**:
   - The New Hampshire School Boards Association noted that most districts already have public policies online, questioning the need for centralized collection by the DOE.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted deep divisions over how New Hampshire’s education system should address issues of race, gender, and history, with HB 61 at the center of the debate. Supporters argued that repealing the "divisive concepts" law is essential for fostering an inclusive and truthful educational environment, while opponents believed the current law protects against ideological bias in schools. Additionally, HB 35 and HB 131 focused on providing resources and clarity for schools and students, emphasizing the importance of mental health support and practical policy implementation. The discussions underscored broader national conversations about education, equity, and free speech.
