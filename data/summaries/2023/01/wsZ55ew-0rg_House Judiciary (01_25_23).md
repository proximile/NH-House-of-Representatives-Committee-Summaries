The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 25, 2023, centered on several bills addressing the state’s housing crisis, with a focus on tenant protections, landlord rights, and the broader challenges of affordable housing. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 112: Tenant Rights and Property Sales**
- **Purpose**: Requires landlords to provide 60 days' notice before selling multi-family properties (five or more units) and allows tenants to form co-ops to purchase the property, mirroring the successful model used in manufactured housing parks.
- **Support**: Advocates, including **Representative Ellen Reed**, emphasized the severe housing crisis, particularly in the Seacoast region, and the need to empower tenants to achieve homeownership and stability.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including landlords, raised issues about property rights, the feasibility of tenant purchases, and the financial/logistical challenges of forming co-ops. Some suggested expanding the bill to smaller properties.

#### **HB 117: Lease Termination and Eviction**
- **Purpose**: Allows landlords to terminate leases at the end of the term without needing "good cause," overturning a 2005 NH Supreme Court decision.
- **Support**: Landlords argued it restores their rights and removes barriers to removing problematic tenants.
- **Concerns**: Tenant advocates warned it could exacerbate homelessness, particularly in a market with extremely low vacancy rates (0.3%-0.5%), and disproportionately affect low-income renters.

#### **HB 235: Landlord-Tenant Mediation Program**
- **Purpose**: Proposes expanding a successful mediation program to resolve disputes without litigation, with an 80% success rate in preventing evictions.
- **Support**: Advocates highlighted its cost-effectiveness and ability to preserve tenancies.
- **Concerns**: Some questioned the need for a legislative study given the program’s proven success.

#### **HB 261: Lease Termination for Victims of Domestic Violence or Disability**
- **Purpose**: Allows tenants to terminate leases without penalty in cases of domestic violence, stalking, or disabling conditions.
- **Support**: Advocates emphasized the need to protect vulnerable populations.
- **Concerns**: Landlords raised issues about vague language and financial burdens, suggesting public funding to cover costs.

#### **HB 283: Rental Application Fees**
- **Purpose**: Caps application fees at $35 (or the cost of background checks) and limits holding fees to $250, refundable.
- **Support**: Tenant advocates argued it reduces barriers to housing for low-income renters.
- **Concerns**: Landlords claimed the cap is arbitrary and may not cover costs, potentially leading to higher rents.

#### **HB 340: Save Our Homes Act**
- **Purpose**: Restricts corporations from purchasing single-family and multi-family homes to prevent price inflation and preserve homeownership opportunities.
- **Support**: Advocates argued it protects local residents from being outbid by corporate buyers.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including real estate professionals, warned it could hinder housing development and investment.

#### **HB 379: Legal Representation for Indigent Tenants**
- **Purpose**: Provides legal counsel to tenants facing eviction, funded through federal grants.
- **Support**: Advocates highlighted its potential to prevent homelessness and ensure fairness in eviction proceedings.
- **Concerns**: Opponents questioned the feasibility of implementation and the potential overlap with mediation programs.

#### **HB 401: Evictions for Substantial Renovations**
- **Purpose**: Requires landlords to provide 60 days' notice for renovation-related evictions, offer alternative housing, and keep the unit off the market for one year.
- **Support**: Tenant advocates argued it prevents landlords from using renovations as a pretext for eviction.
- **Concerns**: Landlords and realtors claimed it imposes undue burdens and could discourage property upgrades.

### **Key Themes**

1. **Housing Crisis**: All discussions underscored the severe shortage of affordable housing in New Hampshire, with low vacancy rates, rising rents, and increasing homelessness. Both tenants and landlords acknowledged the systemic challenges.

2. **Tenant Protections vs. Landlord Rights**: The debates highlighted the tension between protecting tenants from eviction and displacement and preserving landlords’ rights to manage their properties efficiently.

3. **Mediation and Legal Representation**: Mediation programs and legal representation for tenants were presented as constructive solutions to prevent evictions and resolve disputes without litigation.

4. **Corporate Ownership**: Restricting corporate ownership of housing emerged as a contentious issue, with advocates arguing it preserves homeownership opportunities and opponents warning it could stifle investment and development.

5. **Regulatory Balance**: Many bills aimed to strike a balance between tenant protections and landlord flexibility, with ongoing discussions about funding, implementation, and potential unintended consequences.

### **Outcome**
The meeting concluded with calls for further refinement of the bills to address concerns from both tenants and landlords. The committee emphasized the need for practical, fair solutions to New Hampshire’s housing crisis, with a focus on increasing affordable housing, protecting vulnerable populations, and ensuring a balanced approach to tenant-landlord dynamics.
