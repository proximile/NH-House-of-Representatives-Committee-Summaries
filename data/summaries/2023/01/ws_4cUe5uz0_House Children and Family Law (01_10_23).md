### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Children and Family Law Committee Meeting (01/10/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Children and Family Law Committee meeting on January 10, 2023, addressed a wide range of issues related to child welfare, family law, and systemic reforms. The meeting was structured around discussions of specific bills, committee processes, and testimonies from representatives, advocates, and community members. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions:

---

### **1. Committee Logistics and Collaboration**
- **Introduction and Procedures**: The chair welcomed members, clarified the committee's focus on children and family law, and outlined procedures for handling bills, public hearings, and testimony. Emphasis was placed on bipartisan collaboration, respectful discourse, and efficient scheduling to avoid backlogs.
- **Member Introductions**: Committee members introduced themselves, sharing their professional backgrounds (e.g., education, nursing, finance, juvenile services) and personal motivations for serving on the committee. Many highlighted their commitment to advocating for vulnerable children and families.
- **Committee History**: The chair acknowledged past challenges, including an attempt to abolish the committee seven years ago, and stressed the importance of passionate yet respectful advocacy.

### **2. Family Support Systems and Resource Centers**
- **Family Resource Centers (FRCs)**: FRCs are local hubs providing resources like food, clothing, and support services. Despite efforts to increase utilization (e.g., referrals from teachers), there has been no significant uptick in families accessing these centers.
- **New Initiatives**:
  - **Community Response Guide**: A web-based tool to help individuals (e.g., teachers) decide whether to call a hotline or seek other resources for families in need.
  - **Community Navigator Program**: Direct support for teachers and others in connecting families with resources.
- **Kinship Navigation Programs**: These programs assist relatives or caregivers (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) who step in to care for children, offering guidance on benefits, legal processes, and emotional support.

### **3. Alimony Reform**
- **Temporary Alimony Bill**: A bill was discussed to reform temporary alimony laws, applying a formula-based approach to ensure predictability unless there is evidence of immediate irreparable harm.
  - **Proponents** argued this would reduce system abuse and provide clarity in divorce cases.
  - **Opponents**, including legal aid representatives, contended that applying a formula too early in the divorce process could be problematic, as full financial disclosures and property divisions are often incomplete at that stage.
- **Personal Testimonies**: Individuals shared experiences with the alimony system, emphasizing the need for nuanced considerations, such as the duration of marriage, presence of children with disabilities, and employment history.

### **4. Child Protection and Juvenile Justice Reforms**
- **Child Protection Workforce**: Caseloads have improved but still exceed national standards. Efforts to hire more staff are ongoing.
- **Juvenile Justice Reforms**: Joe Ribson, Director of DCYF, highlighted significant shifts from punitive to proactive, supportive interventions. Programs like **Fast Forward** and **Trek** provide wraparound services to keep children in their communities rather than in residential placements.
- **Senate Bill 94**: Introduced a new process for handling juvenile offenses, allowing assessments and voluntary service referrals before prosecution. Early data shows 72% of families accepting services.
- **Hotline Improvements**: The DCYF hotline now offers referrals to community resources, addressing issues like poverty, mental health, and substance use before they escalate.

### **5. Key Bills and Testimonies**
- **HB 34: Raising the Marriage Age to 18**:
  - **Supporters** argued that child marriage often involves coercion, abuse, and negative outcomes, including higher rates of divorce, mental health issues, and lower educational attainment. They emphasized that minors cannot legally sign contracts, making marriage an inappropriate commitment for individuals under 18.
  - **Opponents** raised concerns about infringing on individual freedom, cultural and religious practices, and potential unintended consequences, such as increased reliance on welfare or out-of-state marriages.
  - **Personal Testimonies**: Survivors of child marriage shared harrowing experiences of abuse and exploitation, advocating for the bill to protect vulnerable children.
- **HB 85: Anti-Nuptial Agreements**: Representative Deborah DeSimone introduced a bill to update language in anti-nuptial agreements to be gender-neutral, reflecting changes in marriage laws, including same-sex marriages.
- **HB 200: Parental Choice in Therapy**: Representative Francis Nutter Upham presented a bill allowing parents to choose therapists for their children under their insurance plans, rather than being forced to use court-appointed therapists. Parents and therapists testified about the financial and emotional burdens of court-mandated therapy.

### **6. Behavioral Health and Pandemic Impact**
- **Behavioral Health System Development**: New Hampshire has developed a children’s behavioral health care system, addressing a previous lack of services. However, outpatient mental health care remains the hardest service to access, with a significant need for more providers.
- **Pandemic Impact**: The pandemic has exacerbated mental health needs among children, with many new cases entering the system and straining limited resources.

### **7. Future Directions**
- **Staffing and Cultural Competency**: The committee discussed the importance of recruiting diverse, culturally competent workers to better serve New Hampshire’s diverse population, including immigrants and non-English speakers.
- **Upcoming Discussions**: Future meetings will focus on bills related to child support payments, confidentiality of reports, and court rules, as well as presentations from experts like Rebecca Ross from Children’s Behavioral Health.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to improve family support systems, reform child protection and juvenile justice processes, and address complex issues like alimony and child marriage. The committee emphasized the importance of collaboration, innovation, and equitable access to resources to support children and families in New Hampshire.
