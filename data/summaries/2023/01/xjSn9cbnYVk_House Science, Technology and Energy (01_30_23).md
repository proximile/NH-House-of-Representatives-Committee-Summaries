### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (01/30/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on **January 30, 2023**, to discuss several bills related to energy, climate, and technology. The meeting included public hearings, executive sessions, and detailed discussions on proposed legislation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **House Bill 175: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Goal**
- **Purpose**: To change the state’s energy consumption reduction goal from "reduce fossil fuel consumption" to "reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
- **Discussion**: Representative Michael Harrington, the bill’s sponsor, argued that this change would broaden the scope to include all greenhouse gas emissions, not just fossil fuels. However, the Department of Environmental Services (DES) and Clean Energy New Hampshire noted that the state had already achieved significant greenhouse gas reductions, and the current goal might need adjustment if the bill passed.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **0-40** against the bill, citing redundancy and lack of necessity.

#### **House Bill 176: Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) Rules**
- **Purpose**: To address the SEC’s overreach in applying rules meant for wind projects to all energy projects.
- **Discussion**: Representative Harrington argued that the SEC’s overreach discourages energy development in New Hampshire. The bill seeks to ensure SEC rules align with legislative intent, particularly for energy projects like wind, solar, and nuclear.
- **Opposition**: Meredith Hatfield of The Nature Conservancy opposed the bill, stating that SEC rules were carefully crafted with public input and approved by the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR).
- **Outcome**: The committee closed the public hearing, with no immediate action taken.

#### **House Bill 208: Climate Action Plan**
- **Purpose**: To establish a comprehensive climate action plan for New Hampshire, including greenhouse gas reduction goals and modernization of energy infrastructure.
- **Discussion**: Supporters emphasized the economic and health benefits of transitioning to renewable energy, including cost savings, job creation, and reduced air pollution. However, DES raised concerns about the lack of funding and staff to implement the plan within the proposed timeline. The 2009 climate action plan was suggested as a starting point for updates.
- **Outcome**: The committee heard testimony but did not take immediate action.

#### **House Bill 443: Study of Withdrawal from ISO New England**
- **Purpose**: To evaluate the pros and cons of New Hampshire withdrawing from ISO New England and becoming an independent grid operator.
- **Discussion**: Representative J.D. Bernardi, the bill’s sponsor, cited rising electricity costs and the potential for New Hampshire to better manage its energy resources, such as the Seabrook nuclear power station. However, concerns were raised about the legal, financial, and logistical challenges of independence, including potential lawsuits and grid stability issues.
- **Outcome**: The committee recessed to further discuss the bill.

#### **House Bill 630: Green Bank (Revolving Clean Energy Accelerator Fund)**
- **Purpose**: To create a revolving fund to attract federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for clean energy projects.
- **Discussion**: The fund would focus on financing projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with 40% of investments directed to vulnerable communities. Concerns were raised about the Department of Energy’s ability to manage the fund and the potential costs of administration. A non-binding straw poll indicated a preference to retain the bill for further study.
- **Outcome**: The committee planned to gather more information before making a final decision.

#### **House Bill 576: Energy Conservation Program and PACE Reserve Fund**
- **Purpose**: To establish an energy conservation program and a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Reserve Fund for commercial projects.
- **Discussion**: Two competing amendments were proposed, with the first amendment (2023-0162h) clarifying the bill as a commercial PACE program and enabling private equity funding for energy efficiency projects. The committee voted **14-5** to adopt the amendment and subsequently adopted HB 576 as amended.
- **Outcome**: The bill will be referred to other committees for further review.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Alignment of Rules with Legislative Intent**: Several bills, including HB 176 and HB 208, emphasized the need for administrative rules to align with legislative intent, particularly in energy and climate policy.
2. **Resource Constraints**: DES repeatedly highlighted the lack of funding and staff as a significant barrier to implementing ambitious climate and energy initiatives.
3. **Federal Funding Opportunities**: Bills like HB 630 and HB 208 underscored the importance of leveraging federal funds, particularly from the Inflation Reduction Act, to support clean energy and climate resilience projects.
4. **Economic and Environmental Impacts**: Discussions frequently touched on the economic benefits of renewable energy, including job creation and cost savings, as well as the environmental and health impacts of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
5. **Feasibility and Practicality**: Concerns were raised about the feasibility of certain proposals, such as New Hampshire’s potential withdrawal from ISO New England and the administrative challenges of managing new funds and programs.
