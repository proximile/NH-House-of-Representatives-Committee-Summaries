**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (January 12, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 12, 2023, to discuss several key bills and issues affecting consumers, businesses, and state operations. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including liquor licensing, restroom requirements, right-to-repair legislation, paper billing fees, and state liquor store closures. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Liquor Licensing for Nano Breweries**
- **Issue**: The **Nano Brewery license** requires operations to be in a **public building**, creating challenges for small breweries operating in private spaces like barns or garages.
- **Federal vs. State Law**: While federal law (TTB) mandates a clear separation between residences and breweries, the state’s public building requirement adds an extra layer of regulation.
- **Concerns**: The **Liquor Commission** expressed worries about removing the public building requirement, citing enforcement and safety inspection difficulties.
- **Proposed Solution**: A **Senate bill** aims to streamline licensing by eliminating the Nano Brewery license and adding tiers to the Beverage Manufacturer license based on production size.
- **Local Impact**: Small breweries, like **Polyculture Brewing** in Croydon, face financial burdens due to the public building requirement, forcing them to obtain more expensive licenses.

### **2. Restroom Requirements for Restaurants**
- **House Bill 173**: This bill seeks to repeal the requirement for restaurants with 25 or more people to have **separate male and female restrooms**, allowing for **unisex or family restrooms** instead.
- **Modern Building Codes**: Testifiers, including representatives from the **State Building Code Review Board**, noted that modern codes increasingly favor gender-neutral restrooms, making the current law outdated.
- **Hygiene and Safety**: While concerns were raised about having only one restroom, the bill does not eliminate the requirement for adequate restroom facilities—it simply removes the gender-specific mandate.
- **Societal Alignment**: The bill aims to align state law with evolving societal norms and building code practices.

### **3. Right to Repair Legislation (House Bill 73)**
- **Purpose**: The bill ensures consumers and independent repair providers have access to the necessary tools and information to repair home appliances, preventing manufacturers from imposing restrictions.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - **Consumer Empowerment**: Allows consumers to repair appliances affordably, reducing the need to buy new ones.
  - **Environmental Benefits**: Reduces electronic waste and extends product lifespans.
  - **Support for Small Businesses**: Enables small repair businesses to compete with manufacturers.
- **Arguments Against**:
  - **Safety Concerns**: Opponents, including the **Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM)**, warned of risks from untrained individuals handling complex appliances.
  - **Cost Implications**: Some raised concerns about increased appliance costs due to additional tools, parts, and training.
  - **Enforcement Challenges**: Questions were raised about enforcing the law, particularly against out-of-state manufacturers.
- **Global Context**: Similar legislation has been enacted in the EU, UK, and other U.S. states, driven by environmental and consumer protection concerns.

### **4. Banning Paper Billing Fees (House Bill 39)**
- **Purpose**: The bill prohibits companies from charging fees for paper billing, ensuring access for older adults and low-income individuals.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - **Financial Inclusion**: Essential for those without access to technology or who prefer paper bills.
  - **Consumer Protection**: Prevents unfair penalties on vulnerable groups.
- **Arguments Against**:
  - **Cost and Enforcement**: Opponents, including the wireless communication industry, cited enforcement difficulties and potential cost increases.
  - **Market Solutions**: Some argued that consumers could switch to companies that don’t charge fees, making government intervention unnecessary.
  - **Private Right of Action**: Critics highlighted the bill’s provision allowing private lawsuits, which could lead to legal complications.

---

### **5. Closure of State Liquor Stores (House Bill 146)**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires the **New Hampshire Liquor Commission** to notify the fiscal committee before closing any state liquor store.
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - **Transparency**: Ensures legislative oversight, especially after a Nashua store was closed without prior notification.
- **Arguments Against**:
  - **Autonomy**: Opponents, including **Joseph Malika** (Chairman of the Liquor Commission), argued that the Commission needs flexibility to make quick business decisions.
  - **Competitiveness**: Requiring fiscal committee approval could hinder the Commission’s ability to respond to real estate opportunities and remain profitable.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Support for Small Businesses**: Bills like HB 167 (Nano Brewery Licensing) and HB 73 (Right to Repair) aim to reduce financial and regulatory burdens on small businesses, promoting economic growth and local control.
2. **Consumer Protection vs. Market Efficiency**: Debates on bills like HB 39 (Paper Billing Fees) and HB 73 highlighted the tension between protecting vulnerable consumers and allowing market-driven solutions.
3. **Transparency and Oversight**: HB 146 (Liquor Store Closures) reflects the ongoing balance between legislative oversight and the autonomy of state agencies.
4. **Modernization and Inclusivity**: HB 173 (Restroom Requirements) seeks to align state laws with modern building codes and societal norms, emphasizing inclusivity and flexibility.
