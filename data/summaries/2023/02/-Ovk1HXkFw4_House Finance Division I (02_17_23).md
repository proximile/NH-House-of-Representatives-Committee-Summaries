**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Finance Division I (February 17, 2023)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on February 17, 2023, convened by the House Finance Division I, covered a wide range of topics, including utility regulation, energy policy, community development, IT infrastructure, debt management, and state funding. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Utility Regulation and Energy Policy**
1. **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**:
   - The PUC oversees utility rate cases, which now occur every 3-4 years instead of every 10 years. It regulates electric, gas, water, and sewer utilities, and handles telecom issues like pole transfers.
   - The PUC’s budget is funded through utility assessments, and it ensures safe, reliable services at reasonable rates.

2. **Department of Energy (DOE)**:
   - The DOE, established in the last state budget, focuses on affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy. It oversees energy programs, consumer assistance, and policy development, including the 10-year State Energy Strategy.
   - The DOE’s FY24 budget is $67.5 million, with 87% from federal funds. It faces staffing challenges but is exploring federal funding for renewable energy and grid innovation.
   - Key programs include LIHEAP, which assists low-income households with heating costs, and RGGI, which rebates most funds to ratepayers.

3. **Energy Challenges and Innovations**:
   - NH faces natural gas capacity constraints and is exploring LNG storage and regional collaboration.
   - The state supports an “all of the above” energy approach, including new nuclear technologies and offshore wind development, with lease awards expected in late 2024.
   - Community aggregation is growing, allowing local communities to purchase power collectively.

### **Community Development and Block Grants**
1. **Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)**:
   - Administered by the Community Development Finance Authority (CDFA), CDBG funds support housing, child care, and economic development projects.
   - Recent projects include affordable housing in Salem and child care expansion in Plymouth. The state’s $260,000-$280,000 match leverages millions in federal funding.

2. **Community Development Projects**:
   - Block grants were discussed for facility improvements, such as the Boys and Girls Club of Laconia, mental health center consolidation, and arts and culture venue renovations.

### **IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity**
1. **Department of Information Technology (DoIT)**:
   - The IT budget is shifting from capital expenditure (Capex) to operational expenditure (Opex), with significant inflation in hardware, software, and contract labor costs.
   - The state is adopting an enterprise approach, consolidating systems across agencies to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

2. **Cybersecurity and Privacy**:
   - Continued investment in cybersecurity is crucial, particularly for aging systems in agencies like Health and Human Services (HHS).
   - A Chief Privacy Officer role was proposed to manage data privacy across state agencies.

### **Debt Management and Treasury Operations**
1. **Debt Management**:
   - The state’s total debt is approximately $1.2 billion, with $600 million being general fund-supported debt. The annual debt service is projected at $62 million.
   - The Treasury Department plans to issue $60 million in bonds annually and is considering moving the debt service for the RIMS project to the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) budget.

2. **Rainy Day Fund and Credit Ratings**:
   - Discussions included the impact of allocating an extra $100 million to the rainy day fund on the state’s credit rating. NH is considered a low-debt state, and maintaining low debt-to-revenue ratios is crucial for good credit ratings.

### **State Funding and Municipal Distributions**
1. **Municipal Funding**:
   - The meal and room tax distribution to municipalities has increased due to recent formula changes. The governor’s budget includes this distribution but suspends state revenue sharing.

2. **Scholarship Programs**:
   - The state administers various scholarship programs, including the Governor’s Scholarship Fund, which is funded with general funds. A request was made for $3 million annually for these scholarships.

### **Abandoned Property Program**
- The state holds approximately $300 million in unclaimed property. A proposal was made to budget $2.6 million annually to expedite payments to claimants, improving transparency and customer service.

### **Future Actions and Follow-ups**
- The committee requested additional information, including a flow chart for the abandoned property program’s financial flows and the upcoming debt affordability study.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting highlighted the state’s efforts to balance utility regulation, energy efficiency, and community development while addressing future energy demands and economic challenges. Key themes included prudent financial management, modernizing IT infrastructure, and ensuring transparency in state funds. The discussions underscored the importance of strategic planning to manage the state’s resources effectively and meet the needs of its residents.
