The New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held a work session on **House Bill 421**, which addresses the provision of menstrual hygiene products to incarcerated individuals. The session focused on refining the bill's language to ensure clarity, safety, and accessibility while addressing concerns raised during testimony.

### Key Points Discussed:
1. **Product Provision**:
   - The bill mandates that menstrual hygiene products (pads, tampons, panty liners) be provided at no cost to incarcerated individuals, with a choice of products to meet their needs.
   - Concerns were raised about newer products (e.g., menstrual cups) posing security risks, but the language allows for flexibility while maintaining security protocols.

2. **Sanitation and Safety**:
   - The bill specifies that menstrual hygiene products must be provided in adequate amounts and not excessive to avoid safety or security issues.
   - Discussions centered on whether items like sheets and undergarments should be new or sanitized. The committee agreed that undergarments should be issued new upon intake, while other items could be sanitized and reused.

3. **Timeliness of Provision**:
   - Testimony highlighted delays in providing menstrual products, prompting discussions on including language to ensure timely access.
   - The committee opted for the term "immediate need" rather than specifying a time frame (e.g., one hour) to avoid potential litigation issues.

4. **Amendments**:
   - Key amendments included:
     - Adding "standard issue" before listing feminine hygiene products.
     - Ensuring undergarments are provided new upon intake.
     - Requiring items impacted by menstruation to be unstained and sanitized before reuse.
     - Including language to address "immediate needs" for timely access.

5. **County and State Alignment**:
   - The bill applies to both state and county correctional facilities, with the goal of standardizing practices across jurisdictions.
   - The State Department of Corrections commissioner and county superintendents were consulted and supported the proposed language.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Representative Reed will finalize the amendments and share them with the committee and county superintendents for feedback.
   - The bill will proceed to an executive session for a vote on the amended version.

### Overall Tone:
The session was collaborative, with a focus on ensuring dignity, safety, and accessibility for incarcerated individuals. The all-female subcommittee emphasized the importance of addressing immediate needs while balancing practical and legal considerations.
