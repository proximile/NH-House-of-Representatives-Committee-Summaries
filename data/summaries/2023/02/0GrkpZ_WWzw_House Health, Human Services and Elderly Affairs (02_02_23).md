**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (02/02/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on February 2, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several bills related to health, human services, and elderly affairs. The meeting focused on procedural matters, collaborative efforts to refine legislation, and logistical clarifications for future discussions. Key highlights from the meeting include:

**1. Voting and Motions:**
   - A motion to retain a bill passed unanimously with a 20-0 vote. Members were reminded to submit committee reports, particularly for motions other than "retain."
   - The committee discussed the formation of informal groups to discuss bills, clarifying that groups of 10 or fewer members could meet without formal notice, but larger groups or official subcommittees would require public notice and in-person meetings.

**2. House Bill 329 (ALS Registry):**
   - Representative Murphy proposed retaining the bill to establish a registry for ALS patients, shifting oversight from HHS to Dartmouth Health. The motion passed unanimously (20-0).

**3. House Bill 566 (Child Care Retention Bonuses):**
   - Representative McLean introduced a motion to retain the bill, which would provide retention bonuses for child care workers. The bill faced significant debate, with concerns about its effectiveness and cost. The motion to retain passed (20-0) after a failed motion to kill the bill (10-10).

**4. House Bill 565 (Medicaid Postpartum Care):**
   - Representative Weber proposed an amendment to correct a technicality in the bill. The bill was recessed for further review due to concerns about section numbering.

**5. House Bill 580 (Vision Screening):**
   - Representative Merchant moved to retain the bill, which addresses vision screening for children, particularly Medicaid recipients. Discussions highlighted the need for broader screening and concerns about inappropriate referrals. The motion to retain passed unanimously.

**6. House Bill 428 (Conditional Licenses for Mental Health Professionals):**
   - The committee opened a public hearing on HB 428, which addresses conditional licenses for mental health professionals. The bill clarifies existing laws, sets fees for conditional licenses, and ensures that those with conditional licenses fall under the jurisdiction of the Board of Mental Health Practice. Representative Shapiro, the prime sponsor, explained that the bill aims to streamline the licensing process and enhance consumer protection. The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to recommend the bill for passage, and it was placed on the consent calendar.

**7. House Bill 47 (Organ Donation Protocols):**
   - The committee discussed HB 47, which proposed protocols for organ donation. Concerns were raised that the bill could harm trauma patients and complicate medical procedures. Representative Nagel moved to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," and the committee unanimously agreed (20-0). The bill was effectively tabled.

**8. House Bill 91 (Privacy Governance Board):**
   - The committee considered HB 91, which establishes a privacy governance board within the Department of Health and Human Services. The board would oversee privacy protections for personal data. An amendment (142h) was introduced to clarify job titles and classifications, which was unanimously approved (20-0). The bill itself passed with a vote of 18-2, with Representatives Seth King and Merchant opposing. Representative King indicated he would file a Minority Report, so the bill will go on the regular calendar rather than the consent calendar.

**9. House Bill 397:**
   - The committee decided to recess discussions on this bill to a later date. Representative Merchant expressed a desire to collaborate with peers to revise the bill for broader acceptance. Representatives Leon, Cushman, and Nagel agreed to work on this initiative.

**10. Other Bills:**
   - Several bills (HB 587, HB 598, HB 264, HB 574, HB 282, and HB 397) were continued to a later date, meaning they were not addressed in this session.

**Adjournment:**
   - The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene the following Wednesday. Members were thanked for their participation and wished a good weekend.

Throughout the meeting, legislators emphasized the importance of addressing critical health and social issues while balancing fiscal responsibility and policy effectiveness. The session highlighted the committee's commitment to refining legislation through collaboration and thorough deliberation.
