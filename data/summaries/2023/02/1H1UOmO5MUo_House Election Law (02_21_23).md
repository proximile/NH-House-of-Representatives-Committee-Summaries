### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. HB 243: Tabulation of Votes in Public**
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies that vote tabulation must be conducted publicly to ensure transparency and voter confidence.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Sponsored by Representative Caitlin Kutab, the bill was inspired by tabulation errors in Windham that led to incorrect election results.
     - While clerks like Dan Healy noted that tabulation is already public, Kutab emphasized the need for consistency across all towns.
   - **Outcome**: The bill faced minimal opposition, with discussions focusing on ensuring clarity in implementation.

#### **2. HB 244: Printing of Election Day Checklist**
   - **Purpose**: Adjusts the deadline for mailing absentee ballots from 5 PM to 12 PM the day before the election and proposes bolding the names of absentee voters on the checklist for easier monitoring.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Clerks, particularly from larger towns like Nashua, raised concerns about the impracticality of printing checklists the day before the election.
     - Testifiers like Liz Tantarelli argued that the change could disenfranchise voters with last-minute emergencies.
   - **Outcome**: Discussions suggested amending the bill to allow in-person delivery of absentee ballots until 5 PM while maintaining the noon mailing deadline.

#### **3. HB 484: Handling of Absentee Ballot Envelopes**
   - **Purpose**: Allows clerks to pre-process absentee ballots before Election Day to verify voter information and ensure accuracy.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Supporters argued that pre-processing, introduced during COVID-19, improves efficiency and voter confidence.
     - Concerns were raised about creating two classes of voters: those whose ballots are pre-processed and those whose ballots arrive on Election Day.
   - **Outcome**: The committee considered moving the pre-processing date from Monday to Friday to address logistical concerns.

#### **4. HB 495: Counting Votes**
   - **Purpose**: Establishes consistent guidelines for interpreting ambiguously marked ballots during recounts.
   - **Key Points**:
     - The bill aims to reduce subjectivity in recounting ballots by standardizing rules for determining voter intent.
     - Critics noted that the bill’s language might not account for all scenarios, such as unique marking patterns or ink issues.
   - **Outcome**: Supporters emphasized the importance of consistency in close elections, with discussions focused on refining the bill’s language.

#### **5. HB 316: Supervisors of the Checklist Meetings**
   - **Purpose**: Requires supervisors of the checklist to meet every 45 days to address voter roll updates.
   - **Key Points**:
     - The bill aims to ensure timely processing of voter removals, particularly in towns where supervisors only meet before elections.
     - Clerks suggested extending the meeting frequency to 60 days to align with existing statutory requirements.
   - **Outcome**: The committee discussed adjusting the meeting frequency to better fit towns’ schedules.

#### **6. HB 415: Public Access to Ballots**
   - **Purpose**: Restores public access to ballots and ballot images under the Right-to-Know Law to improve election transparency.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Supporters argued that transparency is essential to address voter confidence and combat conspiracy theories.
     - Opponents, including the City and Town Clerks Association, raised logistical concerns about retrieving sealed ballots and the lack of procedures for public viewing.
   - **Outcome**: The discussion highlighted the need for clear guidelines on ballot access and retention.

#### **7. HB 460: Voter Identification Requirements**
   - **Purpose**: Eliminates the use of affidavits for voter registration, requiring specific documentation to prove identity, citizenship, and domicile.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Supporters argued that the bill strengthens election integrity by closing loopholes in voter identification.
     - Opponents, including election officials and advocacy groups, argued that the bill would disenfranchise vulnerable populations, such as students, renters, and homeless individuals.
     - Data showed that 2,601 voters used affidavits in the 2022 midterm election, highlighting the potential impact of the bill.
   - **Outcome**: Testifiers overwhelmingly opposed the bill, urging the committee to focus on policies that make voting more accessible rather than adding barriers.
