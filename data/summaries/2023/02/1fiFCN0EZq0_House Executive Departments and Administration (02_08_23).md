The New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee meeting on February 8, 2023, covered a wide range of bills and topics, with extensive discussions on professional licensing, public employee benefits, public safety, and legislative efficiency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

### **Professional Licensing and House Bill 655**
The primary focus of the meeting was **House Bill 655**, which proposes significant changes to the licensing and disciplinary processes for professional boards in New Hampshire. Key points included:

1. **Confidentiality and Due Process Concerns**:  
   - Mental health professionals, particularly psychologists, raised concerns about the potential disclosure of sensitive patient information during investigations. They emphasized the need to protect third-party records and ensure due process for licensees.  
   - Witnesses argued that investigations should involve professionals with expertise in the specific field to ensure fairness and accuracy.

2. **Board Authority and Standardization**:  
   - The bill’s attempt to standardize processes across 53 different boards was criticized as a one-size-fits-all approach that could undermine the unique needs of each profession.  
   - Boards expressed concerns about losing rulemaking authority and the ability to oversee investigations, hearings, and disciplinary actions.  

3. **OPLC’s Role and Streamlining**:  
   - The **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** testified that the bill aims to streamline administrative processes, reduce delays, and lower costs for licensees. They assured that boards would retain authority over substantive decisions.  
   - However, witnesses called for collaboration between the OPLC and boards to address concerns rather than stripping boards of their authority.  

4. **Next Steps**:  
   - The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review, with discussions planned to address detailed concerns and amendments.  

### **Public Employee Benefits**
Several bills related to retirement benefits for public employees, particularly group two members (police, firefighters, and corrections officers), were debated:

1. **House Bill 250**:  
   - This bill proposed increasing the accidental death benefit for group two members from 50% to 100% of their annual compensation. While some argued it was necessary to support families of those who die in the line of duty, others raised concerns about cost and fairness to other retirees. The motion to pass the bill failed on a tie vote, and it was sent to the House with no recommendation.  

2. **House Bill 571**:  
   - This bill aimed to provide cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for group two retirees, who do not receive Social Security benefits. The motion to pass the bill also failed on a tie vote due to concerns about fairness and fiscal responsibility.  

### **Public Safety and Licensing**
1. **House Bill 341**:  
   - This bill proposed establishing licensure for massage therapists to combat sex trafficking. While some argued it was necessary for public safety, others contended it would not effectively address illegal activities. The committee voted 11-9 to pass the bill with an amendment.  

2. **House Bill 620**:  
   - A bill proposing the creation of a new department for a pilot program faced concerns about cost and necessity. An amendment to place the program under the Department of Education was introduced, but the committee tied 10-10, sending the bill to the full House without a recommendation.  

### **Other Key Bills and Amendments**
1. **House Bill 180**:  
   - An amendment to change Columbus Day to Italian Heritage Day was adopted with a vote of 14-6. The amended bill passed 13-7 and will move to the regular calendar.  

2. **House Bill 193**:  
   - The committee unanimously passed a bill with an amendment updating language related to teacher job-sharing arrangements, allowing for more flexible splits in hours.  

3. **House Bill 391**:  
   - A bill updating data-sharing agreements between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Services passed unanimously, with reporting requirements changed from every six months to annually.  

4. **House Bill 266**:  
   - The committee unanimously passed a bill codifying procedures for hybrid and virtual agency meetings, ensuring compliance with the Right-to-Know law.  

5. **CACR1**:  
   - A constitutional amendment proposing the creation of a lieutenant governor position was indefinitely postponed due to concerns about cost and the effectiveness of the current system.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing administrative efficiency, fairness, and fiscal responsibility. While there was support for streamlining processes and addressing public safety concerns, significant opposition arose over bills perceived as overly broad or unfair to specific groups. The committee emphasized the need for collaboration, nuanced solutions, and clear legislative language. Several bills were referred to subcommittees for further review, while others were passed with amendments or sent to the full House for consideration.
