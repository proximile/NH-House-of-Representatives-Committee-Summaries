---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 405: In-State Tuition Requirement for Voter Registration**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes that college students must qualify for in-state tuition to be eligible to vote in New Hampshire, aiming to ensure that only state residents influence local elections.
- **Sponsor’s Argument**: Representative Panic argued that out-of-state students, who make up a significant portion of the college population, have a disproportionate impact on elections. The bill seeks to balance encouraging voting while protecting the voices of New Hampshire residents.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including representatives from the University System of New Hampshire and advocacy groups, contended that the bill creates unnecessary barriers for students, imposes a one-year residency requirement not applied to other voters, and could disenfranchise students. They also highlighted that private institutions do not offer in-state tuition, creating inequities.
- **Legal Concerns**: Opponents cited constitutional issues, referencing past court cases like *Newburger v. Peterson* (1972), which affirmed students’ right to vote where they attend college. They argued that the bill could violate voting rights and create a "second class" of citizens.
- **Public Testimony**: University of New Hampshire students testified in opposition, emphasizing their civic engagement and the bill’s potential to discourage young people from participating in local elections. Supporters argued the bill would protect election integrity by clarifying voting eligibility.

#### **House Bill 179: Political Clothing in Polling Places**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes allowing voters to wear political clothing or paraphernalia (e.g., buttons, hats) in polling places, which is currently prohibited.
- **Supporters**: Argued that the current law is inconsistently enforced and that wearing political items does not disrupt the voting process.
- **Opponents**: Maintained that polling places should remain neutral and free from electioneering to ensure a safe and unbiased environment.

#### **House Bill 599: Election Audits**
- **Discussion**: Representative Wood raised concerns about the bill’s scope, particularly the authorization of an unidentified auditor to conduct audits across 15 towns. He compared it to the narrow focus of the Windham audit and questioned the potential cost and feasibility.
- **Outcome**: The bill was moved to the floor for further debate with a vote of 19-1 in favor.

#### **House Bill 40: Residency Definitions for Voting**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to clarify residency definitions for voting, particularly addressing concerns about college students' voting rights. It seeks to undo changes made to voting laws since 2012 and ensure all citizens over 18 can vote in the community where they live.
- **Debate**: Representative Horgan, the bill’s sponsor, argued that it simplifies residency definitions and protects voting rights for college students, military personnel, and temporary residents. Opponents raised concerns about potential confusion and the bill’s impact on election integrity.
- **Testimony**: Secretary of State David Scanlon expressed concerns about the bill’s clarity, particularly around same-day voter registration and residency definitions.

#### **House Bill 502: Repeal of Voter ID Requirements**
- **Purpose**: The bill would repeal certain voter ID requirements, including the religious affidavit waiver, allowing individuals to vote without presenting identification.
- **Debate**: Representative Barry argued against the bill, stating it would weaken voter ID laws and reintroduce unnecessary complications. He highlighted the popularity of voter ID laws in New Hampshire and their role in ensuring election integrity.
- **Opposition**: Representatives Howard and others raised concerns about the bill’s impact on first-time voters, particularly college students, and its potential constitutional issues.

#### **Campaign Sign Regulations**
- **Purpose**: A separate bill addressed the retrieval of campaign signs removed by public works departments.
- **Proposal**: The amendment allows candidates or their party members to retrieve signs within a week after the election, preventing them from being discarded.

#### **House Bill 508 Reconsideration**
- **Motion**: A motion was made to reconsider **HB 508**, which had previously been defeated 11-9. The motion cited new support from 10 members present, suggesting the bill should be revisited.
