**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (02/07/23)**

The NH House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on February 7, 2023, focused on the state of higher education in New Hampshire, with particular attention to the **New Hampshire Community College System (NHCCS)**, the **University System of New Hampshire (USNH)**, and **UNH Innovation**. Discussions centered on workforce development, affordability, access, innovation, and the challenges facing these institutions. Here are the key themes and takeaways:

---

### **Workforce Development and Alignment**
Both the NHCCS and USNH emphasized their critical role in aligning education with workforce needs.  
- **NHCCS** highlighted programs in healthcare, manufacturing, and technology, including boot camps, dual enrollment, and apprenticeships. Partnerships with employers like BAE Systems and the New Hampshire Automotive Dealers Association ensure programs meet industry demands.  
- **USNH** graduates 2,000 students annually who enter the NH workforce, with over 2,000 employer partnerships. Internships, particularly for small businesses, were a focus, as they improve retention and workforce readiness.  
- **UNH Innovation** supports entrepreneurship and research, with licensing revenue doubling from $860,000 in FY 2017 to $1.8 million in FY 2022. Efforts to commercialize research discoveries contribute to economic development.

### **Affordability and Access**
Affordability remains a priority for both systems:  
- **NHCCS** has kept tuition flat for over a decade, making community college nearly free for many students through state and federal Pell Grants. Dual enrollment and Early College Programs save families millions of dollars while preparing students for post-secondary education.  
- **USNH** reduced costs by $50 million between 2019 and 2022 but faces challenges due to flat state funding since 2021, which remains 11% below 2011 levels. Increased funding is sought to maintain affordability and access, particularly for regional campuses in Plymouth and Keene.

### **Innovative Programs and Partnerships**
Both systems are leveraging innovative programs and partnerships to meet workforce and student needs:  
- **NHCCS** offers short-term, career-focused programs, Prior Learning Assessment, and online education to adapt to changing demands. Healthcare programs, particularly nursing, have high licensing exam pass rates, and graduates often remain in the state.  
- **USNH** is expanding into emerging areas like Esports and robotics to attract students and diversify offerings. The merger of Granite State College into USNH enhances online education for non-traditional students.  
- **UNH Innovation** supports research and entrepreneurship, with significant funding from organizations like NSF, NOAA, and NASA. Aerospace and defense research have notable economic impacts.

### **Challenges**
Several challenges were highlighted:  
- **Demographic Shifts**: Declining K-12 enrollment and intense competition for students in the Northeast are significant concerns. Universities in Maine and New York are aggressively recruiting with in-state tuition offers.  
- **Faculty Shortages**: NHCCS faces faculty shortages in high-demand areas like nursing, while USNH is addressing workforce reductions and right-sizing campuses.  
- **Childcare Barriers**: NHCCS is working to simplify financial aid for childcare programs, which are critical for workforce participation.  
- **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has affected international student enrollment and created lingering challenges, though federal funding helped offset losses.

### **Future Directions**
Both systems are focused on adapting to future needs:  
- **NHCCS** is exploring regenerative medicine and emerging technologies while providing lifelong learning opportunities.  
- **USNH** is enhancing marketing efforts, increasing on-campus housing, and expanding internship programs to attract and retain students.  
- **UNH Innovation** continues to push research discoveries into the market, supporting economic growth in the state.
