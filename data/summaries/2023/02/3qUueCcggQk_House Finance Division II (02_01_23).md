**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Finance Division II Meeting (02/01/23)**

The New Hampshire House Finance Division II meeting on February 1, 2023, focused on critical issues related to public safety, transportation infrastructure, emergency management, and workforce challenges across various state departments. Key discussions centered on the Department of Safety, the Department of Transportation (DOT), and emergency services, with an emphasis on funding, operational efficiency, and addressing systemic challenges.

### **Department of Safety**
The Department of Safety, tasked with enhancing public safety and quality of life in New Hampshire, operates through seven divisions, each with unique missions and funding sources. Key topics included:

1. **Staffing Shortages**: The department faces significant vacancies, particularly in the State Police (64 vacancies) and 911 telecommunicator roles. Recruitment and retention efforts include bonuses and ongoing negotiations for pay increases.
2. **Technological Advancements**: The DMV has made strides in reducing title processing backlogs and improving customer service through online renewals and potential kiosks for low-personnel transactions.
3. **Public Safety Challenges**: The State Police are combating drug trafficking, especially fentanyl, through specialized units and mobile enforcement teams. Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) are preparing for and responding to disasters, with increased grant funding for disaster relief.
4. **Budget Constraints**: The department’s budget is supported by highway funds, general funds, and federal grants. Vacancies and supply chain issues have impacted allocations.

### **Department of Transportation (DOT)**
The DOT, responsible for maintaining and improving New Hampshire’s transportation infrastructure, addressed several pressing issues:

1. **Infrastructure Management**: The DOT oversees 2,159 state bridges (114 structurally deficient), 4,600 miles of roadway, 194 miles of rail lines, 25 airports, and 11 local transit systems. Bridge inspections are conducted every two years, with red-listed bridges inspected every six months.
2. **Budget and Funding**: The DOT’s FY 2022 expenditures totaled nearly $600 million, primarily from federal funds and the highway fund. Inflation and supply chain disruptions have increased construction costs by 15-20%, impacting project budgets.
3. **Turnpike System**: The NH Turnpike system generated $123 million in FY 2022. Discussions included potential toll increases to fund projects, as NH’s toll rates are lower than neighboring states.
4. **Workforce and Equipment Challenges**: High vacancy rates, labor shortages, and delays in equipment delivery have strained operations. The DOT’s fleet, valued at $110 million, requires consistent investment for replacement and maintenance.
5. **Snow Plowing and Winter Operations**: Workforce shortages have impacted snow plowing efforts, with contractors struggling to deploy full fleets due to a lack of drivers. The DOT has reassigned employees with CDL licenses to assist with snow removal, affecting other maintenance tasks.

### **Emergency Services and Public Safety**
The state’s emergency management and public safety divisions are focused on preparedness, response, and community outreach:

1. **Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM)**: HSEM administers federal grants, coordinates emergency preparedness, and conducts training and exercises for local and state partners. The division operates two 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) in Concord and Laconia, ensuring 24/7 coverage.
2. **Fire Standards and EMS**: This division provides training and certification for firefighters and EMS personnel, including hazardous materials and technical rescue training. Two fire training campuses support thousands of students annually.
3. **Fire Safety**: The Division of Fire Safety focuses on education, enforcement, and investigations, including a canine program for ignitable liquid detection. Funding challenges were noted, with discussions about increasing fees to sustain operations.
4. **Community Partnerships**: Collaboration with local, county, and state agencies enhances emergency response capabilities. Partnerships with the DOT and Fish and Game address specific safety concerns, such as bridge weight enforcement and search and rescue operations.

### **Key Challenges and Future Focus**
Several overarching challenges were highlighted across all departments:

1. **Workforce Retention and Recruitment**: High vacancy rates, particularly in critical roles like State Police, 911 telecommunicators, and DOT staff, remain a significant concern. Competitive compensation and long-term solutions are needed to stabilize the workforce.
2. **Funding and Inflation**: Rising costs, inflation, and structural budget deficits have strained resources. Federal grants provide essential support, but state funding gaps persist, particularly for non-federal aid projects.
3. **Technological Advancements**: Departments are leveraging technology to improve efficiency, from DMV online services to DOT’s use of drones and real-time traffic management systems.
4. **Infrastructure Maintenance**: Maintaining aging infrastructure, including bridges, roads, and public transit systems, requires sustained investment and innovative solutions to address funding and labor shortages.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the state’s commitment to enhancing public safety, maintaining critical infrastructure, and improving emergency preparedness. Despite significant challenges in workforce retention, funding, and operational efficiency, departments are implementing strategic initiatives to address these issues. Collaboration, technological innovation, and targeted investments will be essential to ensuring the safety and well-being of New Hampshire residents.
