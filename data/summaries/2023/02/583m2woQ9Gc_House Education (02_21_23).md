The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on February 21, 2023, focused on a series of bills related to the **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)** program and broader school choice initiatives. The discussions centered on expanding access to educational options, ensuring accountability, and addressing concerns about the financial and operational impacts on public schools. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **Overview of the EFA Program and Proposed Bills**
The EFA program allows state funds to follow students to private, religious, or alternative educational options, providing families with greater educational flexibility. Several bills were discussed to modify or expand the program:

1. **HB 446**: Requires parents of students with disabilities to be informed of their rights and potential consequences when enrolling in for-profit private schools, clarifying that these schools are not obligated to provide special education services under federal law.

2. **HB 603**: Proposes additional safeguards for the EFA program, including requiring service providers to be operational for at least one year, ensuring safe instruction locations, and mandating criminal background checks for providers working directly with students.

3. **HB 573**: Aims to impose budget constraints on the EFA program to address significant cost overruns, ensuring funding does not exceed state appropriations and holding the Department of Education accountable for accurate budgeting.

4. **HB 621**: Mandates the suspension of EFA payments and the return of unused funds to the education trust fund when a student re-enrolls in public school. It also strengthens fraud prevention measures by requiring suspected fraud cases to be referred to the attorney general.

5. **HB 331**: Proposes removing the income threshold for the EFA program, making it accessible to all families regardless of income. Proponents argue it ensures equal access to educational opportunities, while opponents worry about the financial impact on public schools.

6. **HB 538**: Establishes a **Local EFA Program**, allowing local school districts to adopt a system where public education funds follow the student to alternative educational options. The bill emphasizes local control, requiring a 60% majority vote by local communities to adopt the program.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

#### **1. Access and Equity**
- **Income Limits**: There was significant debate over whether the EFA program should remain income-restricted or be expanded to all families. Proponents argued that middle-income families also need support, while opponents warned of potential costs exceeding $100 million annually.
- **Equal Opportunity**: Supporters of HB 331 and HB 538 emphasized that all families pay taxes and deserve equal access to educational options, aligning with the state’s constitutional obligation to provide an adequate education.

#### **2. Financial Impact and Accountability**
- **Cost Concerns**: Critics raised concerns about the financial burden of expanding the EFA program, particularly on public schools. Estimates suggested that removing income limits could lead to significant funding diversions, potentially harming underfunded districts.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Several bills, including HB 621, focused on strengthening oversight and accountability measures, such as requiring annual income recertification and ensuring unused funds are returned to the education trust fund.

#### **3. Special Education and Student Rights**
- **Special Education Services**: Discussions clarified that resident school districts remain responsible for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and transportation costs for students with disabilities, even if they use EFAs.
- **Parental Rights**: HB 446 highlighted the need for parents of students with disabilities to be fully informed about their rights and the limitations of private schools in providing special education services.

#### **4. Public vs. Private Education**
- **Dissatisfaction with Public Schools**: Some parents and representatives expressed dissatisfaction with public schools, citing issues like academic performance, bullying, and inappropriate materials in libraries. They advocated for school choice as a solution.
- **Harm to Public Schools**: Opponents argued that diverting funds to EFAs could harm public schools by reducing resources for programs like music, art, and sports, particularly in economically challenged communities.

#### **5. Local Control and Flexibility**
- **Local EFA Program**: HB 538 emphasized local control, allowing communities to vote on whether to adopt a system where public education funds follow the student. The bill also included provisions to ensure significant funding remains with local school districts.
- **Flexibility for Families**: The program allows families to roll over unused funds, use them for tutoring or supplies, and choose educational options that best meet their children’s needs.

#### **6. Legal and Constitutional Concerns**
- **Constitutionality**: Some representatives questioned the constitutionality of using public funds for private education and raised concerns about the potential impact on public school funding.
- **Accountability**: Critics highlighted the lack of accountability in measuring EFA program outcomes compared to public schools, particularly regarding standardized testing and performance data.

### **Proposed Compromises and Solutions**
- **Funding Support for Public Schools**: Representative Campbell proposed an amendment to HB 331 that would provide $2,000 to the resident school district for every student who uses an EFA, ensuring local districts are not financially harmed.
- **Fraud Prevention and Oversight**: HB 538 included robust oversight mechanisms, such as a digital wallet system and investigations by the Attorney General’s office, to ensure transparency and prevent misuse of funds.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted a fundamental divide over the role of public education and the expansion of school choice programs like EFAs. Supporters emphasized the need for flexibility, competition, and equal access to educational opportunities, while opponents stressed the importance of maintaining strong, well-funded public schools as the cornerstone of communities. The discussions underscored the need for balanced policies that address accountability, financial oversight, and the diverse needs of students and families in New Hampshire.
