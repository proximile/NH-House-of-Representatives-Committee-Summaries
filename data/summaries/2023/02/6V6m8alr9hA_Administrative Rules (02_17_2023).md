The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 17, 2023, focused on various administrative rules and legislative updates. Key discussions included:

1. **Consent and Regular Agenda Approval**: The meeting began with the approval of the consent and regular agendas, with no items removed or contested.

2. **Plant and Property Rules**: A proposal with 14 substantive comments was reviewed, focusing on discrepancies between forms and rules. Issues included unclear legislative intent, vendor application requirements, and inconsistencies in form titles and requirements. Solutions involved incorporating forms by reference and conditional approvals.

3. **Therapeutic Cannabis Registry Rules**: Changes to the therapeutic cannabis registry rules were discussed, including the implementation of legislative bills and delays in allowing out-of-state medical cannabis cardholders to purchase in New Hampshire. The Department of Health and Human Services explained staffing shortages and expected implementation by late spring.

4. **Hospice House Licensing Rules**: The committee reviewed expired rules for hospice house licensing, which had been expired since 2017. Enforcement during the expiration period and federal certification were discussed, and the rules were conditionally approved.

5. **Criminal History Record Checks**: Rules for educator licensure criminal history checks, which had expired, were reviewed. The Department of Education acknowledged processing fees during the expiration period and committed to refunds. The rules were approved with staff edits.

6. **State Police Tow List Rules**: The Department of Safety sought emergency rulemaking for a rotating tow list due to delays caused by unexpected fiscal impacts in the original legislation. Concerns were raised about the department's handling of the law, and the committee planned to draft a letter expressing their concerns.

7. **Prescription Drug Affordability Board**: The committee reviewed assessment fees on insurers, PBMs, drug manufacturers, and wholesalers. Concerns were raised about the constitutionality of the fees, as they lacked clear benefits to the payers. The committee recommended the legislature review and potentially amend the statute.

8. **Meeting Schedule**: The committee voted against eliminating secondary meetings.

The meeting concluded with an offer for new members to receive orientation materials and a brief office orientation.
