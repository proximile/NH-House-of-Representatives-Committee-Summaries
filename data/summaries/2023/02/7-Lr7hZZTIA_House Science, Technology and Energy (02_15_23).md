#### **Key Issues and Discussions**

1. **Fee Structures and Transparency**
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of clarity and standardization in fees charged by propane companies, including **tank rental fees**, **safety fees**, and **Hazmat fees**.
   - AmeriGas explained that fees vary based on factors such as tank ownership, geographic location, and customer usage. However, legislators and consumers called for greater transparency and consistency to help customers compare costs and make informed decisions.
   - There was a push for the propane industry to develop **standardized fee templates** and best practices to improve customer understanding and fairness.

2. **Underground Propane Tanks**
   - A significant portion of the discussion focused on **underground propane tanks**, which are prevalent in New Hampshire. Challenges include:
     - Ownership and transfer of tanks when customers switch providers.
     - Costs and logistics of tank removal or transfer.
     - Lack of documentation for tanks acquired through company mergers or acquisitions.
   - AmeriGas outlined efforts to address these issues, such as offering to sell underground tanks to customers and engaging third-party vendors for tank removal. However, legislators emphasized the need for **standardized processes** to reduce confusion and barriers for consumers.

3. **Customer Service Practices**
   - AmeriGas highlighted its **customer service tracking system**, which logs all customer interactions and complaints. The company emphasized its ability to track and resolve issues, including fee negotiations and service delays.
   - Despite these efforts, legislators raised concerns about persistent customer complaints, particularly in **Merrimack, NH**, regarding poor communication, unresolved issues, and lack of transparency in contracts.
   - AmeriGas committed to improving call center efficiency, reducing resolution times, and addressing backlogged tank pickups within **30 to 90 days**, depending on weather and customer availability.

4. **Industry Standards and Self-Regulation**
   - While some legislators suggested the need for legislative action to address these issues, industry representatives expressed a preference for the propane industry to develop **internal solutions** through trade associations.
   - Discussions included the potential for industry-wide **best practices**, standardized fee structures, and improved customer communication to enhance the overall propane delivery experience.

5. **Safety and Maintenance**
   - The conversation touched on **safety fees** and the maintenance of underground propane tanks, including **cathodic protection systems** to prevent corrosion. Companies are responsible for regular inspections and maintenance to ensure safety.
