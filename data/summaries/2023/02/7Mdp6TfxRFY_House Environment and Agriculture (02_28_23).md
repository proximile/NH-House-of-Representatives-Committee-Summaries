### Comprehensive Summary of NH House Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/28/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 28, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several bills related to environmental protection, agricultural preservation, and animal welfare. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

---

### **Agricultural Land Preservation and Development**
1. **HB 221: Agricultural Land Development Rights**
   - **Amendment (2023-0701h)**: Representative Bixby presented an amendment to enhance the preservation of agricultural land by enabling the state to collaborate with federal and private entities (e.g., land trusts) to acquire development rights. The amendment adds a member from the New Hampshire Land Trust Coalition to the Agricultural Lands Preservation Committee and ensures the state can enforce deed restrictions on preserved land.
   - **Key Provisions**:
     - Use of federal matching funds for land preservation.
     - Protection of state rights in jointly held properties, preventing unilateral extinguishment.
     - Participation in conservation easements to keep agricultural land undeveloped.
   - **Clarifications**: The state cannot act without landowner consent, and any release of restrictions must align with deed terms.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was passed with the amendment.

2. **HB 119: Homestead Food Operation Licensure**
   - **Amendment (2023-0629h)**: The dollar amount for homestead food operations was removed, as there were no enforcement issues.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was passed with the amendment.

3. **HB 369: Energy Relief on Farms**
   - The bill was retained to explore the possibility of creating a field specialist for energy purposes through Cooperative Extension.

### **Extended Producer Responsibility and Waste Management**
1. **HB 253: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Study Committee**
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes forming a committee to study EPR, focusing on reducing waste and the tax burden by holding producers responsible for the lifecycle of their products.
   - **Discussion**:
     - Representative Bixby suggested narrowing the scope to focus on high-toxicity waste, packaging, single-use plastics, beverage containers, electronic waste, batteries, and automotive waste.
     - Concerns were raised about the committee’s ability to complete its work by November 1st due to the complexity of the issues.
   - **Amendment Proposal**: The committee discussed allowing the study group to propose both legislation and rules, rather than limiting it to legislation.

### **Animal Welfare**
1. **HB 37: Animal Grooming Practices**
   - The committee discussed the need for best practices for animal groomers and decided to request the Department of Agriculture to post these practices on their website.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was retained for further consideration.

2. **HB 231: Declawing of Cats**
   - The bill seeks to ban the declawing of cats unless medically necessary.
   - **Debate**: Some representatives argued that declawing should be a decision between the veterinarian and the pet owner, while others supported the bill to provide legal cover for veterinarians who oppose the practice.
   - **Outcome**: The vote resulted in a tie (9-9), and the motion to recommend the bill as inexpedient to legislate (ITL) passed.

---

### **Food Security and Safety**
1. **HB 122: Food Security and Assistance**
   - The bill was retained to address issues related to food security and assistance for those in need.

2. **HB 348: Sale of Raw Milk and Products**
   - The bill was moved to Interim Study (ITL) to allow more time to evaluate the effectiveness of the prior law.

3. **HB 493: State Meat Inspection Program**
   - The bill was retained to allow for potential future legislation related to a study committee on meat processing.

---

### **Landfill Regulations and Environmental Protection**
1. **HB 56 and HB 602: Landfill Siting and Water Protection**
   - **Key Concerns**: Protecting perennial bodies of water (rivers, streams, and coastal waters) from contamination due to landfill leaks.
   - **HB 56** proposes a **five-year time-of-travel setback**, based on hydrogeological studies, to determine the distance contaminants would take to reach water bodies.
   - **HB 602** includes additional setbacks for roads, property boundaries, and residences but relies heavily on Maine’s regulatory framework, which some representatives find problematic.
   - **Debate**: Significant discussion focused on whether the five-year setback is arbitrary or necessary, with some suggesting a **two-year setback** combined with flexibility for rulemaking by the Department of Environmental Services (DES).
   - **Study and Rulemaking**: Calls were made for DES to conduct a comprehensive study on landfill siting criteria, including hydrogeological assessments and comparisons with other states.
   - **Outcome**: HB 56 was seen as the stronger bill, focusing on water protection through a science-based approach, while HB 602 faced criticism for its reliance on Maine’s rules and lack of clarity.

2. **HB 326: Rodenticide Regulation**
   - The committee drafted a letter to the Commissioner of Agriculture supporting the work of a stakeholder working group to address issues related to second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs).

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Agricultural Preservation**: HB 221 and HB 119 focus on protecting farmland and supporting homestead food operations, with amendments to strengthen their provisions.
2. **Waste Management and EPR**: HB 253 aims to reduce waste through an EPR study, with discussions on narrowing its scope to high-toxicity waste and packaging.
3. **Animal Welfare**: Bills like HB 231 and HB 37 address animal welfare issues, with mixed outcomes and further study needed.
4. **Landfill Regulations**: HB 56 and HB 602 highlight the committee’s focus on protecting water resources and human health through science-based landfill siting criteria, with calls for further study and rulemaking by DES.

The committee concluded the meeting with plans for further discussions and work sessions on upcoming bills, emphasizing the importance of collaboration with stakeholders and state agencies to address these complex issues.
