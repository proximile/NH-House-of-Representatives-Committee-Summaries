### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (02/21/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on February 21, 2023, addressed a wide range of legislative, budgetary, and administrative issues, with a focus on cybersecurity, environmental sustainability, and modernization of state departments. Here are the key discussions and decisions:

#### **Cybersecurity and Administrative Continuity**
- **Cybersecurity Priority**: A representative underscored the critical importance of cybersecurity, noting its consistent recognition as a top priority by the National Association of State Chief Information Officers over the past 12 years. The discussion also emphasized ensuring continuity in administrative functions.

#### **Legislative Voting and Amendments**
- **Amendment Process**: The committee conducted votes on several amendments and bills, including a unanimous (7-0) passage of a motion by Representative McGuire. Discussions included the implications of amending the municipal PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) statute (RSA 53F), particularly concerning lender consent and lien priorities.

#### **Energy Efficiency and PACE Programs**
- **PACE Program Impact**: The committee debated the effects of PACE programs on property assessments and the secondary mortgage market. Concerns were raised about potential impacts on property values and lien priorities, with discussions on the roles of municipalities and private investors in financing energy efficiency projects.

#### **Department of Agriculture Budget and Modernization**
- **Budget Requests**: The Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture requested funding for an assistant commissioner position, highlighting the need for administrative support. The discussion also covered the invasive species program, full-time coordination for conservation districts, and revenue sources such as pesticide licensing and product registration fees.
- **Data Processing Modernization**: House Bill 230 proposes an electronic data processing system for the Department of Agriculture to replace outdated, paper-based systems. The estimated cost is between $360,000 and $500,000, with annual maintenance costs of $200,000, potentially covered by existing fees. The new system aims to streamline operations, reduce staff workload, and improve regulatory compliance.

#### **Solid Waste Management and Food Waste Management**
- **Solid Waste Management Fund (HB 462)**: Representative Ebel discussed expanding funding sources for the Solid Waste Management Fund, created the previous year to support waste reduction efforts. The bill prioritizes composting and food waste diversion, aligning with state waste management goals. It received unanimous support from the Environment and Agriculture Committee and passed the House on a voice vote.
- **Food Waste Management (HB 300)**: This bill seeks to ban entities generating one ton or more of food waste per week from disposing of it in landfills or incinerators, provided there is a facility within 20 miles capable of handling it. The bill emphasizes reducing food waste and diverting it to human consumption, animal feed, composting, or anaerobic digestion. It passed the House unanimously and includes a two-year delay in implementation to allow for infrastructure development.

#### **Land Use Docket and Information Security**
- **Land Use Docket (HB 347)**: The bill proposes establishing a specialized land use docket in the Superior Court to expedite land use appeals, modeled after the successful business court docket. The goal is to address the backlog of land use cases and support affordable housing development. The judicial branch supports the bill, noting it would not require additional judges beyond the one already requested in the budget.
- **Information Security Officer (HB 337)**: The bill seeks to codify the position of the Chief Information Security Officer within the Department of Information Technology, formalizing a role that has existed for over a decade. No additional funding is required, and the bill has a zero-dollar fiscal note.

#### **Broader Context and Fiscal Concerns**
- **Solid Waste Management Plan**: The state has not updated its solid waste management plan since 2003. The new plan aims for a 25% reduction in waste by 2030 and 45% by 2050. The state is also dealing with increased out-of-state waste as other states reduce their landfill capacities.
- **Fiscal Impact**: Representatives discussed the fiscal impact of these initiatives, suggesting they should be considered in the broader context of the state budget, especially given potential economic uncertainties. Questions were raised about the enforcement of the food waste ban and the availability of facilities to handle the diverted waste.

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the need for modernization and efficiency in state departments and the importance of sustainable waste management practices. The proposed bills aim to address these issues with a focus on cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. The committee also reminded members of an upcoming joint session with Division Three and requested input from the Department of Information Technology on House Bill 230.
