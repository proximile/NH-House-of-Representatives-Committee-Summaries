   - Agencies submitted $750 million in general fund requests, far exceeding the $130 million target, necessitating rigorous prioritization.
   - The process begins in March/April, with agencies submitting requests by May 1. The governor reviews these, and a final "Blue Book" is produced by December, outlining prioritized projects.

3. **Lapse Extensions**:
   - Agencies requested 185 lapse extensions for unfinished projects, allowing them to continue using previously allocated funds. A subcommittee reviews these to ensure projects are progressing as planned.

4. **Education and CTE Funding**:
   - The Newport CTE project was funded via HB2, while the Tilton CTE project was not funded due to pending voter approval.
   - The governor’s budget increased education funding by over 9%, the largest increase in 20 years, but no Community College capital projects were included.
