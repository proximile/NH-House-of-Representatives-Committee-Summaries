The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 24, 2023, focused on a range of education-related bills, addressing issues from free speech on college campuses to teacher certification, school meal programs, and non-discrimination protections in educational institutions. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Teacher Certification and Education Freedom Accounts**
1. **Teacher Shortages and Certification (HB 654)**: The committee discussed extending the one-year Certificate of Eligibility to two years to address teacher shortages, particularly in STEM and special education. An amendment was proposed to broaden eligibility by replacing "teacher" with "educator."
2. **Education Freedom Accounts (HB 515)**: Representative Cordelli presented HB 515, which clarifies aspects of the EFA program, including age eligibility, multiple scholarship organizations, and accountability measures. The bill aims to ensure consistency between statutes and rules.

### **Free Speech on College Campuses (HB 516)**
HB 516, a contentious bill, aimed to protect free speech and associational rights on public college campuses. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill designates outdoor campus areas as public forums, bans "free speech zones," and protects students from overbroad harassment codes.
- **Support**: Advocates, including FIRE, Christian Legal Society, and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, argued the bill is necessary to safeguard First Amendment rights and prevent censorship. Bipartisan support was noted, with organizations like the ACLU and Americans for Prosperity endorsing the bill.
- **Opposition**: The University System of New Hampshire expressed concerns about redundancy, increased costs, and potential litigation, stating that existing policies already comply with First Amendment protections.
- **Legal and Practical Concerns**: Discussions focused on the bill’s applicability to indoor vs. outdoor spaces, the severability clause, and the waiver of 11th Amendment immunity. The committee voted **19-0** in favor, indicating broad support.

### **School Meal Programs (HB 181)**
Representative Horrigan introduced HB 181, which establishes a committee to study school meal programs in public and non-sectarian schools. The committee would build on the success of a similar initiative from the previous session.

### **Constitutional Amendment (CACR7)**
Representative Cordelli presented **CACR7**, a bill to remove the "Blaine Amendment" from the New Hampshire Constitution. The Blaine Amendment, which prohibits public funds from going to religious schools, was criticized as a relic of anti-Catholic bigotry. Supporters argued it is outdated and unconstitutional based on recent Supreme Court rulings. Opponents raised concerns about the potential impact on public education funding.

### **Non-Discrimination Protections (HB 451)**
HB 451 aimed to extend non-discrimination protections to educational institutions receiving public funds, including private schools and vendors. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to ensure that schools adhere to non-discrimination laws in areas like disability, race, sexual orientation, and religion.
- **Concerns**: Testimony highlighted issues such as disability discrimination, racial and economic segregation, and LGBTQ+ discrimination in private schools receiving public funds through programs like EFAs.
- **Opposition**: Some representatives questioned the bill’s necessity, citing existing non-discrimination laws, while others raised concerns about its impact on faith-based institutions.

### **Other Bills**
1. **HB 170**: A bill on cursive handwriting and multiplication tables was debated, with an amendment proposed to accommodate students with IEPs or 504 plans. The committee voted **10-10**, resulting in no recommendation.
2. **HB 394**: A bill on co-op school district meetings was ITL’d (**11-9**) due to concerns about public accessibility.
3. **HB 563**: A bill on SAU budgets was unanimously recommended for ITL.
4. **HB 651**: A bill on contracts with transportation companies was retained for further discussion.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted significant debates on free speech, teacher shortages, education funding, and non-discrimination protections. While some bills, like HB 516, garnered bipartisan support, others, such as HB 451 and CACR7, sparked contentious discussions about their necessity and implications. The committee moved into an executive session to finalize votes on several bills, setting the stage for further legislative action.
