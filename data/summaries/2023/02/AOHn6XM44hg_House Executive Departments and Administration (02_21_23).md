The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee meeting on February 21, 2023, focused on discussions regarding **House Bill 274** and **House Bill 358**, both related to administrative rulemaking processes. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **House Bill 274**:
   - The committee decided to retain HB 274 due to numerous unresolved issues and concerns raised by state agencies.
   - Members acknowledged that the bill requires further work over the summer to address its complexities and incorporate feedback from agencies.
   - Some concepts from HB 274 may be integrated into HB 358, which is seen as a more comprehensive solution.
   - There was debate about whether to kill HB 274 entirely, but it was ultimately retained to allow for further study and potential refinement.

2. **House Bill 358**:
   - The committee discussed amendments to HB 358, focusing on improving the notification process for proposed rules.
   - Proposed changes include sending the rulemaking register via email to all legislators, ensuring broader awareness and participation.
   - Additional amendments were suggested to require agencies to acknowledge and respond to public comments during the rulemaking process, similar to practices by the Department of Environmental Services.
   - A technical correction to RSA 541-A14 was proposed to align deadlines for agency responses to 60 days, addressing a discrepancy with RSA 542-A13.

3. **Notification Processes**:
   - Concerns were raised about the inefficiency and cost of using U.S. mail for notifications, with a preference for email distribution to stakeholders and legislators.
   - Agencies already notify stakeholders via email for specific rules, and the committee sought to formalize this practice in HB 358.

4. **Committee Workflow**:
   - The committee plans to schedule additional subcommittee meetings to finalize amendments to HB 358, with a target date of March 8th.
   - Retained bills like HB 274 will be revisited later in the session, likely in May or June, after addressing active House and Senate bills.

5. **Educational Efforts**:
   - Members emphasized the need for better understanding of the administrative rulemaking process (JLCAR) among legislators, as many are unfamiliar with its workings.
   - Suggestions included forming subcommittees within legislative policy committees to focus on rule review and increasing engagement with the rulemaking process.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities of administrative rulemaking and the committeeâ€™s efforts to streamline processes, improve transparency, and address concerns raised by both legislators and state agencies.
