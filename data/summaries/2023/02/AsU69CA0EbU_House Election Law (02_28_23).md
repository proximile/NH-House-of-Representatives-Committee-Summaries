The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 28, 2023, focused on several election-related bills, with discussions centered on ballot access, transparency, election technology, and voter clarity. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points and debates:

---

### **1. Ballot Access and Transparency (House Bill 415, House Bill 387)**
- **House Bill 415**: This bill aimed to enhance election transparency by allowing public access to cast ballots after elections under RSA 91-A (Right-to-Know law). Proponents argued it would boost voter confidence, while opponents raised concerns about ballot integrity, costs, and logistical challenges.
  - **Amendment 2023-0703H**: Introduced by Representative Weirhead, the amendment sought to address issues in the original bill, such as defining the process for accessing ballots, ensuring ballot security, and clarifying the role of ballot custodians (e.g., town clerks or the Secretary of State’s office). However, the amendment failed to pass due to concerns about costs, ballot secrecy, and potential misuse of ballot data.
  - **Key Concerns**: Representatives debated the financial burden on municipalities for scanning and storing ballots, the retroactive application to 2022 ballots, and the risk of voters making identifiable marks on ballots. Suggestions were made to centralize ballot access through the Secretary of State’s office for consistency and security.
  - **Outcome**: The House voted to expedite House Bill 415 for further study, with plans to address unresolved concerns through a separate, more comprehensive bill.

- **House Bill 387**: This bill proposed allowing anonymized ballots (excluding rejected or canceled ballots with confidential information) to be viewed under right-to-know requests to ensure election transparency.
  - **Opposition**: The Municipal Association raised concerns about the logistical and financial burden of fulfilling requests, including the need for high-speed scanners and potential misuse of ballot data.
  - **Sponsor’s Perspective**: Representative Hole argued that scanning and publishing anonymized ballots would increase election integrity and allow voters to verify their votes, suggesting the use of federal election integrity funds to equip towns with scanning technology.
  - **Outcome**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance transparency with logistical challenges, with questions remaining about funding and implementation timelines.

### **2. Election Technology and Funding (House Bill 447)**
- **House Bill 447**: This bill sought to provide financial support to municipalities for replacing outdated ballot counting machines and other election technology. It proposed using federal HAVA (Help America Vote Act) funds to purchase new machines, electronic poll books, and secure laptops.
  - **Opposition from the Secretary of State**: David Scanlon argued that the bill was not as urgent as some testimony suggested, emphasizing the need to protect the election fund rather than depleting it. He noted that widespread implementation of new devices might not occur until 2026 and suggested using the general fund if additional funding was needed.
  - **Key Concerns**: Representatives debated the allocation of HAVA funds, with amendments proposed to cap distributions to maintain a healthy balance. The bill aimed to prevent election day failures, especially with some machines over 27 years old and parts becoming scarce.
  - **Outcome**: The committee emphasized the need for timely action to avoid disruptions, particularly with the 2024 presidential election approaching.

### **3. Ballot Clarity and Candidate Deadlines (House Bill 336, House Bill 363)**
- **House Bill 336**: This bill focused on clarifying ballot instructions, particularly in districts with multiple representatives, to reduce undervotes (blank votes). Proposed amendments included changing "vote for not more than" to "vote for up to" to make instructions more welcoming and clear.
- **House Bill 363**: Introduced by Representative Alvin C, this bill aimed to adjust the deadlines for candidates filing nomination papers for state general elections. Currently tied to the primary election date, the bill proposed aligning deadlines with the general election date to avoid unintended consequences if the primary date changes.

### **4. General Themes and Concerns**
- **Transparency vs. Practicality**: Discussions consistently balanced the desire for election transparency with concerns about costs, logistical challenges, and ballot security.
- **Funding and Implementation**: Representatives emphasized the need for adequate funding and realistic timelines for implementing new election technologies and processes, particularly with the 2024 presidential election on the horizon.
- **Voter Confidence and Integrity**: The Secretary of State’s office highlighted ongoing post-election audits as a means to ensure voter confidence without compromising ballot security.

### **Outcome and Next Steps**
The House voted to expedite House Bill 415 for further study and refinement, while discussions on House Bills 387, 447, 336, and 363 highlighted the need for careful consideration of funding, implementation, and legal challenges. The committee plans to continue refining these bills to address unresolved concerns and ensure the integrity, transparency, and efficiency of New Hampshire’s elections.
