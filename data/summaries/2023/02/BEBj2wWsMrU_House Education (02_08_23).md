### **Key Bills and Topics Discussed**

#### **1. House Bill 514: Obscene Materials in Schools**
- **Purpose**: HB 514 seeks to regulate the handling of obscene materials in K-12 schools, removing the current exemption for schools under state obscenity laws.
- **Support**: Parents and advocates argued that explicit materials, such as books like *This Book is Gay* and *Flamer*, are accessible through school libraries and digital platforms, potentially exposing minors to inappropriate content. Supporters emphasized the need for consistent state policies to allow parents to object to and remove such materials.
- **Opposition**: Educators, including the New Hampshire Education Association (NEA-NH), opposed the bill, citing concerns about vagueness, subjectivity, and the potential criminalization of educators. Critics warned of self-censorship and the chilling effect on access to diverse and educational materials.
- **Key Debates**: Discussions centered on the balance between parental rights and academic freedom, the role of local vs. state authority, and the potential for book banning and censorship.

#### **2. House Bill 627: Local Education Improvement Plans**
- **Purpose**: HB 627 aims to improve educational outcomes by requiring all public schools to develop and update improvement plans every three years, focusing on areas like student performance, school culture, and community engagement.
- **Accountability**: The bill emphasizes the need for schools to use state funds effectively, particularly given New Hampshire’s low proficiency rates in reading and math.

#### **3. House Bill 563: Transparency in SAU Budgets**
- **Purpose**: HB 563 proposes separating school administrative unit (SAU) budgets into distinct warrant articles for voter scrutiny, particularly in multi-district SAUs.
- **Support**: Advocates argued for greater transparency and voter control over administrative spending, which has grown faster than teacher salaries and student enrollment.
- **Concerns**: Opponents noted potential confusion in single-district SAUs and argued that existing line-item budgets already provide transparency. Amendments were suggested to address these issues.

#### **4. House Bill 452: School Building Aid Program**
- **Purpose**: HB 452 aims to streamline the school building aid application process by moving the deadline to April 1st, allowing schools to know about funding earlier and plan construction projects more efficiently.
- **Testimony**: Amy Clark of the Department of Education highlighted the challenges of the current biennial process and the benefits of an annual application system. Supporters emphasized the need for clarity and efficiency in funding allocations.

#### **5. House Bill 354: Charter School Building Aid**
- **Purpose**: HB 354 seeks to make public charter schools that own their buildings eligible for school building aid, addressing a current exclusion in state law.
- **Support**: Charter school representatives argued that the bill would provide equitable access to funding, easing the financial burden of maintaining facilities.
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the financial sustainability of charter schools and their ability to meet construction cost-sharing requirements.

#### **6. House Bill 632: Cooperative Budget Committees**
- **Purpose**: HB 632 focuses on rotating the chairmanship and meeting locations of Cooperative School District budget committees to ensure fair representation among towns.
- **Testimony**: Concerns were raised about historical imbalances in leadership, particularly in the Hollis-Brookline Cooperative School District, where one town has dominated decision-making.

#### **7. House Bill 604: Reading Specialists**
- **Purpose**: HB 604 allows the Department of Education to employ reading specialists directly, formalizing an existing practice.
- **Testimony**: The bill was presented as a technical adjustment to align statute with current operations, with no additional staff or costs involved.

#### **8. Teacher Shortages and Loan Forgiveness**
- **Discussion**: Representative Myler introduced a teacher candidate loan forgiveness program to address shortages in critical areas and rural schools. The program would provide graduated loan reimbursements over four years to incentivize teachers to work in underserved areas.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about ensuring retention and the program’s long-term effectiveness.
