The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 1, 2023, convened by the Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee, covered a wide array of legislative proposals addressing commerce, consumer protection, public safety, and financial regulations. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

### **1. Consumer Protection and Public Safety**
- **PFAS in Carpets (House Bill 465):** The committee debated the health risks posed by PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in carpets, particularly for children. While some members advocated for immediate action to address the health emergency, others raised concerns about enforcement challenges and the lack of viable replacement products. The bill was discussed in the context of increasing consumer awareness and implementing effective enforcement mechanisms.
- **Alcohol Over-Serving Prevention:** A bill aimed at preventing over-serving alcohol in bars and restaurants was discussed, with some representatives arguing that mandatory training for bartenders and bar managers could raise awareness but might not be sufficient to prevent over-serving. Suggestions included incentivizing training programs and considering the potential unintended consequences on the bar industry.
- **Condo Liens (House Bill 178):** The committee examined a bill related to enforcing condo liens for unpaid assessments. Concerns were raised about the potential displacement of tenants who pay rent but are affected by unpaid condo fees by landlords. The sponsor requested the bill be retained for further work.

### **2. Alcohol and Beverage Regulations**
- **Wine Manufacturers (House Bill 612):** The committee reviewed a bill concerning fees for New Hampshire wine manufacturers, discussing changes to sample sizes, tax codes, and exemptions for small-scale wine production. Concerns were raised about potential revenue loss if the tax structure shifted from a percentage to a per-gallon fee.
- **Liquor Licensing (House Bill 167):** A bill related to nano-brewing licenses and restrictions on manufacturing alcohol in residential areas was considered. The committee debated whether to pass the bill or retain it, with concerns about potential conflicts with federal law and the need for clarity in state statutes.

### **3. Technology and National Security**
- **Prohibition on Contracting with Chinese Technology Manufacturers (House Bill 86):** The committee discussed a bill that would prohibit the state from contracting with Chinese government-owned or affiliated technology manufacturers. Dennis Goulet, the Commissioner for the Department of Information Technology, testified in opposition, suggesting a dynamic list of prohibited companies would be more effective than legislation. He noted that the governor's executive order already addresses this issue. The meeting concluded with a public hearing on HB 86, where further testimony
