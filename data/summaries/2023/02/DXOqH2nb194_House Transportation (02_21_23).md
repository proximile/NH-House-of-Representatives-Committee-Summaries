The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 21, 2023, focused on several transportation-related bills and issues, with discussions centered on road safety, driver education, boating regulations, and seat belt legislation. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Driver Education and Parental Instruction (HB 55)**
The meeting began with a contentious discussion on **House Bill 55**, which proposes allowing parents to teach their teens driver education instead of requiring enrollment in certified programs.  
- **Support for Parental Instruction**: Proponents argued that high costs (up to $800) and long wait times for driver education programs create barriers. They likened the bill to homeschooling, emphasizing parents' vested interest in their children's safety.  
- **Opposition from Experts**: Driving school representatives, DMV officials, and state police strongly opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. They highlighted that teens taught by parents are more likely to be involved in accidents and violations compared to those trained by certified instructors. New Hampshire's current program, which includes 30 hours of classroom instruction, 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training, and 10 hours with a certified instructor, was praised for its effectiveness in reducing fatal accidents among young drivers.  
- **Proposed Solutions**: Instead of allowing parental instruction, speakers suggested improving access and affordability by increasing funding, offering online training, and incentivizing more instructors to enter the field. The DMV is also working on rule changes to streamline instructor certification.

### **Seasonal Speed Limit Reductions (HB 93)**
The House also discussed **House Bill 93**, which would authorize municipalities to reduce speed limits seasonally from 25 mph to 20 mph in areas with safety concerns, such as narrow, winding roads near lakes or high pedestrian activity zones.  
- **Key Provisions**: Towns can act independently or via petitions from residents (10 petitioners required). Seasonal reductions would last up to four months annually, with signage costs borne by municipalities and approved by the NH DOT.  
- **Support for Safety**: Residents and officials from New London testified about dangerous road conditions and near-misses, particularly during summer months when pedestrian and vehicle traffic increases.  
- **Limitations**: The bill applies only to municipally owned roads (Class 4, 5, and 6), and the DOT expressed support for the measure.

### **Boating Safety and Compliance (HB 137)**
The meeting addressed **House Bill 137**, which proposes establishing a study committee to bring New Hampshire into compliance with federal boating regulations.  
- **Federal Non-Compliance**: New Hampshire risks losing approximately $1.7 million in federal funding due to its current fee structure for boat registrations, which does not align with federal requirements.  
- **Study Committee**: The bill would create a committee to explore alternative funding mechanisms and ensure balanced representation between inland and coastal boating interests.  
- **Current Funding**: Boat registration fees support programs like the Lake Restoration Fund, Fish and Game search and rescue, and coastal dredging.

### **Seat Belt Legislation (HB 22 and HB 222)**
Two bills related to seat belt usage were discussed: **House Bill 22** (mandatory seat belt use) and **House Bill 222** (mandatory seat belt law for adults).  
- **Support for Seat Belt Laws**:  
  - New Hampshire is the only state without a mandatory seat belt law for adults, with a seat belt usage rate of 75.5% (compared to the national average of 91.6%).  
  - Unbelted fatalities account for 58% of traffic deaths in the state.  
  - Proponents cited studies showing seat belts reduce fatal injuries by 45% and moderate-to-critical injuries by 50%, saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.  
  - Personal stories from law enforcement and medical professionals highlighted the preventable nature of injuries and fatalities caused by lack of seat belt use.  
- **Opposition**: Critics argued that mandatory seat belt laws infringe on personal freedom and questioned the effectiveness of enforcement.  
- **Secondary Enforcement**: The proposed bills would enforce seat belt violations as secondary offenses, meaning drivers cannot be stopped solely for not wearing a seat belt.

### **Pedestrian Control Signals (HB 153)**
The House passed **House Bill 153**, which clarifies pedestrian control signals, including walk/donâ€™t walk signs and symbols like a walking person or raised hand. The bill also stipulates that pedestrians should not start crossing if it interferes with vehicular traffic but can complete their crossing safely if already started.

---

### **Other Bills and Decisions**
- **HB 356 and HB 386**: The House voted to ITL (kill) several bills, including **HB 386**, which proposed lowering the age requirement for child safety seats from seven to four years old. Concerns were raised about using age as a metric instead of height and weight.  
- **Healthcare System Strain**: A speaker highlighted the strained healthcare system in Northern New Hampshire, where limited resources and understaffed hospitals prioritize the most severely injured patients, underscoring the importance of seat belt use to prevent severe injuries.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting emphasized improving safety across transportation systems, from roads to waterways. Key themes included balancing personal freedom with public safety, ensuring compliance with federal regulations, and addressing practical challenges like access to driver education and healthcare resources. The House will reconvene in two weeks to address remaining bills.
