The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee held a joint work session on February 21, 2023, involving Finance Division I and Division III to discuss **HB 49**, a bill initially aimed at extending the closure deadline of the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC) and allocating funding. However, following the passage of **SB 1**, which repealed the closure date, appropriated operating funds, and established a commission for site selection and recommendations, HB 49 has evolved into a vehicle to incorporate elements of SB 1 into a comprehensive plan for the replacement facility. The session focused on key aspects of the bill, including capacity and design, site evaluation, decision-making, budget, operational considerations, and workforce challenges.

### Key Points Discussed:

1. **Capacity and Design**:
   - The amendment to HB 49 proposes two capacity options for the new facility: **6 to 12 beds** and **12 to 18 beds**. The latter includes an operational capacity of 12 with the potential to expand to 18 in emergencies. The design phase emphasizes evaluating a smaller facility (6-12 beds) to honor a compromise, with an alternative plan to be fully developed.

2. **Site Evaluation and Facility Design**:
   - The bill outlines options for site evaluation (6-12 or 12-18 beds) and transitions into the design and construction phases. The site evaluation process has been delayed, with a consultant expected to deliver a proposal by March. Construction is projected to be completed by the end of 2025.

3. **Decision-Making Process**:
   - The legislature has struggled to reach a decision for over two years. The amendment shifts decision-making accountability to the governor and the executive council, as the legislature has been unable to act.

4. **Budget and Appropriation**:
   - The appropriation for the project is $21.6 million, deemed adequate for either renovating an existing building or constructing a new facility. The initial budget was $15 million, but costs increased due to the need for an 18-bed facility. An additional $400,000 is allocated for site evaluation.

5. **Operational Considerations**:
   - The facility’s design must incorporate virtual and shared services (e.g., telemedicine, shared clinical staff, laundry, and logistics) to meet the needs of the children effectively. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is responsible for constructing the facility, with input from the Division of Public Works (DAS).

6. **Workforce Challenges**:
   - Workforce instability has hindered the implementation of therapeutic programming changes. Staffing shortages (e.g., only 17 youth counselors out of the needed 45) have made it difficult to train staff and implement new models.

7. **Public Input and Advocacy**:
   - Advocates emphasized the importance of virtual and shared services in the facility’s operations. The audience largely supported moving the bill forward.

8. **Division Votes**:
   - Both Division I and Division III conducted straw polls. Division I voted 7-0 to move the bill to the full Finance Committee, while Division III had a split vote (3 yes, 4 no, and 2 abstentions). Despite the split, the chair decided to move the bill forward to the full committee for further discussion and potential amendments.

9. **Concerns and Questions**:
   - Some representatives expressed concerns about the process, the use of ARPA funds, and the need for further clarification on specific language and responsibilities (e.g., DHHS vs. DAS roles). Others felt unprepared to vote due to a lack of background information.

In summary, the meeting focused on advancing **HB 49** to the full Finance Committee, with unresolved questions and potential amendments to be addressed. The bill aims to replace the Sununu Youth Services Center, with a focus on site evaluation, facility design, and operational considerations, while addressing budget and workforce challenges. The legislature is under pressure to make timely decisions, with construction projected to be completed by the end of 2025.
