**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (02/28/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 28, 2023, centered on discussions related to the state budget and professional licensing, with a particular focus on **House Bill 2 (HB2)** and its implications for government reorganization and workforce development. Key themes emerged across the two segments, including concerns about risk, duplication, and the balance between streamlining processes and maintaining professional standards.

### **State Budget and Reorganization**
1. **Risk of Including Reorganizations in HB2**:  
   Members expressed significant concerns about embedding major government reorganizations (e.g., moving boards like the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification [OPLC] from the Secretary of State’s office) into the state budget. They argued that such changes introduce unnecessary risk and complexity and should instead be addressed through standalone legislation, such as **House Bill 655 (HB655)**, which already comprehensively tackles these issues.

2. **Duplication of Efforts**:  
   The committee emphasized the importance of avoiding redundancy between HB2 and HB655. Members agreed that the budget should not duplicate work already being done in other legislation, as this would create inefficiencies and complicate the legislative process.

3. **Governor’s Role in the Budget Process**:  
   Representative Dan McGuire critiqued the current budget process, which grants the governor significant legislative power by allowing the governor to draft HB1 and HB2. He suggested reconsidering this structure to limit the governor’s influence over general legislation.

4. **Lack of Details in HB2**:  
   Members expressed frustration over the absence of specific language in HB2, which made it difficult to assess the implications of proposed changes. They stressed the need for detailed language and thorough review before moving forward.

### **Professional Licensing and Workforce Development**
1. **Licensing and Employment Barriers**:  
   The discussion highlighted the governor’s focus on reducing licensing barriers to address the state’s workforce shortage. However, members cautioned that some licensing requirements (e.g., for medical technicians, athlete agents, and hawkers/peddlers) are not as simple to repeal as they may seem, citing past legislative failures and unresolved issues.

2. **Advisory Boards and Professional Licensing**:  
   Concerns were raised about converting certain boards to advisory roles, particularly regarding potential federal anti-trust issues. Members stressed the need for careful consideration and detailed language before making such changes.

3. **Health and Safety Concerns**:  
   Some members raised concerns about the potential impact of licensing changes on public health and safety, suggesting these issues should be addressed separately rather than in the budget.

### **Focus on Wetland Scientists and Licensing Issues**
1. **Wetland Scientists Licensing**:  
   The committee reviewed the implications of eliminating the state license for Wetland Scientists, which is currently required in addition to professional certification. The license allows them to legally practice in the state and provides a stamp for official documents.

2. **Certification vs. Licensing**:  
   There was confusion over the distinction between certification (provided by a national organization) and state licensing. The committee questioned the value of maintaining the state license if it does not add significant oversight or benefits beyond the certification.

3. **Stamps and Discipline**:  
   A key concern was how to handle the issuance of official stamps and disciplinary actions if the state license were eliminated. The OPLC proposed creating a single, unified stamp for all professions, but questions remained about qualification criteria and enforcement of ethical standards.

4. **Impact on Practice**:  
   Wetland Scientists emphasized their critical role in facilitating permitting processes and their value to the economy. They argued that eliminating the license could slow down processes and create confusion, especially for municipalities that require stamped plans.

5. **Broader Licensing Issues**:  
   The discussion expanded to other professions, such as soil scientists and Landscape Architects, with similar concerns about the necessity of state licensing versus certification. The committee aimed to streamline processes but acknowledged the complexity of ensuring professionals can still practice effectively without a state license.

### **Action Items and Next Steps**
1. **Future Steps**:  
   The committee agreed to continue reviewing HB2 and HB655, with plans for additional full committee work sessions to address unresolved issues and ensure clarity before making final decisions.

2. **Research Assignments**:  
   Several action items were assigned, including researching how stamps would be issued and how disciplinary actions would be handled if the state license were eliminated.

3. **Broader Legislative Context**:  
   The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issue, particularly as it relates to HB2, which includes extensive changes to licensing laws. They expressed concerns about potential conflicts with other bills and the need to ensure that changes do not disrupt existing systems.

### **Overall Themes and Tensions**
The meeting highlighted tensions between streamlining processes to address workforce shortages and ensuring that legislative changes are carefully considered and implemented without unnecessary risk or duplication. Members emphasized the importance of balancing efficiency with maintaining professional standards and public safety. The discussions underscored the complexity of these issues and the need for detailed language, thorough research, and collaboration across legislative efforts.
