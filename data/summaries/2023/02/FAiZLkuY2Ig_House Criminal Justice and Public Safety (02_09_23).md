#### **House Bill 135 (HB135): Ban on No-Knock Warrants**
- **Purpose**: HB135 seeks to ban **no-knock search warrants** in New Hampshire, citing safety concerns and the potential for misuse.
- **Proponents**:
  - Highlighted cases like Breonna Taylor’s death, emphasizing the dangers of no-knock warrants to both civilians and officers.
  - Argued that no-knock warrants lack statutory authority in New Hampshire and are prone to abuse, often based on faulty intelligence.
  - Noted the high risk of violent confrontations in a state with significant gun ownership, where homeowners may mistake police for intruders.
  - Pointed to national trends restricting or banning no-knock warrants for public safety.
- **Opponents**:
  - Law enforcement representatives, including the Manchester Police Department and the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, defended no-knock warrants as essential tools for officer safety and effective law enforcement.
  - Stressed that these warrants are rare, intelligence-driven, and executed by highly trained SWAT teams with judicial oversight.
- **Key Questions**:
  - Legislators debated whether no-knock warrants are explicitly authorized under state law and called for more data on their frequency and outcomes.
  - Suggested alternatives, such as differentiating between warrants for evidence preservation and high-risk situations.

#### **House Bill 156 (HB156): Police Misconduct and Misrepresentation**
- **Purpose**: HB156 expands the definition of police misconduct to include **misrepresentation of facts** or **misidentification of race/ethnicity** in police reports.
- **Key Points**:
  - Debate centered on whether misrepresentation must be **intentional** to constitute misconduct, with law enforcement arguing against penalizing unintentional errors.
  - Concerns were raised about the challenges of accurately identifying race and ethnicity, particularly when individuals self-identify differently.
  - The bill includes a provision requiring officers to report colleague misconduct, raising questions about the burden of proof and procedural fairness.
  - Penalties for misconduct could include loss of certification or criminal charges, depending on severity.
- **Law Enforcement Testimony**: Opposed the bill in its current form, citing vagueness and potential overreach, and suggested amendments to clarify terms like "intentional misrepresentation."

#### **House Bill 113 (HB113): Physical Fitness Requirements for Law Enforcement**
- **Purpose**: HB113 proposes eliminating mandatory physical fitness testing for incumbent officers while maintaining standards for new recruits.
- **Key Points**:
  - Police chiefs testified about recruitment and retention challenges, with the fitness test seen as a barrier for experienced officers, particularly those from other states.
  - Concerns were raised about injuries sustained during fitness testing and the test’s lack of accommodation for aging officers or medical conditions.
  - A survey of police chiefs showed 62% supported eliminating the test, while others suggested modifying it to be more job-specific.
  - Legislators questioned the financial impact on the state’s retirement system and proposed alternative wellness-focused programs.

#### **House Bill 376 (HB376): Public Safety Telecommunicator Training**
- **Purpose**: HB376 proposes a study committee to standardize training and certification for emergency dispatchers and 9-1-1 telecommunicators.
- **Key Points**:
  - Testimony highlighted the lack of state-mandated training requirements, leading to inconsistent training across agencies.
  - Advocates emphasized the critical role dispatchers play in emergency response and the need for training commensurate with their responsibilities.
  - Proposed solutions include an academy-style program or expanded agency training to ensure consistency and professionalism.

#### **House Bill 481 (HB481): Arrest and Search Warrants**
- **Purpose**: HB481 aims to prevent "judge shopping" by requiring law enforcement to disclose if a previous judge denied a warrant based on the same evidence.
- **Key Points**:
  - Supporters argued the bill promotes transparency and accountability, ensuring judges and grand juries are fully informed.
  - Opponents, including law enforcement, claimed the bill addresses a non-existent problem and raised concerns about delays in emergency situations.

#### **House Bill 593 (HB593): Asset Forfeiture Reform**
- **Purpose**: HB593 seeks to streamline the asset forfeiture process by combining criminal and civil forfeiture into a single court process, requiring a conviction for forfeiture.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to make the process fairer and more efficient, restricting the use of federal adoptions programs to circumvent state forfeiture laws.
  - Law enforcement representatives opposed the bill, arguing it would hinder drug enforcement operations by limiting access to federal forfeiture funds.
  - The Judicial Branch raised concerns about the bill’s procedural barriers and resource demands.

#### **House Bill 585 (HB585): Police Steroid Testing**
- **Purpose**: HB585 requires drug screening for anabolic steroids and testosterone-boosting steroids for police officers, particularly those involved in excessive force complaints.
- **Key Points**:

  - Supporters argued the bill addresses concerns about excessive force and police brutality.

#### **House Bill 653 (HB653): Bail Reform for Repeat Offenders**
- **Purpose**: HB653 seeks to restrict the use of **personal recognizance (PR) bail** for individuals charged with serious or violent crimes or repeat offenders, requiring judicial oversight.
- **Key Points**:
  - Supporters highlighted cases where individuals released on PR bail committed additional crimes, emphasizing the need for public safety.
  - Critics argued the bill casts too wide a net, potentially detaining individuals charged with non-violent offenses.
  - The Judicial Council raised concerns about increased bail hearings straining resources.
