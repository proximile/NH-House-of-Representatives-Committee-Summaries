**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting on February 17, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on February 17, 2023, to discuss and vote on several key bills. The meeting highlighted a range of issues, including marijuana legalization, racial profiling, parole reform, and protections for law enforcement and emergency workers. The discussions reflected both bipartisan collaboration and differing perspectives on enforcement mechanisms and public safety.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **Marijuana Legalization**
- **HB 360: Legalization of Cannabis**  
  The committee debated the merits of legalizing cannabis in New Hampshire. Supporters argued that legalization would allow for regulation, reduce black-market activity, and address the unfair criminalization of possession. Opponents raised concerns about the lack of roadside testing for impairment, potential harm to youth, and increased highway fatalities. A motion to declare the bill "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) was made, but no final vote was recorded during the session.  
  **Outcome**: The bill remains under consideration.

#### **Racial Profiling and Law Enforcement**
- **HB 596: Prohibiting Racial Profiling**  
  This bill aimed to prohibit racial profiling by law enforcement and included provisions for data collection to assess racial disparities in policing. Concerns were raised about the lack of clear enforcement mechanisms and the potential for unintended consequences for officers. An amendment was proposed to remove the data collection section (Section 2) and focus solely on the policy statement against racial profiling. The committee recessed to allow for drafting of this amendment, with plans to revisit the bill later.  
  **Outcome**: The bill failed to pass in committee (10-10 vote) and will proceed to the full House without a recommendation.

#### **Parole Reform**
- **HB 588: Parole Eligibility Amendment**  
  The committee discussed an amendment to HB 588, which proposed increasing the minimum sentence percentage from 50% to 65% before parole eligibility, while ensuring the changes were not retroactive. Representatives emphasized the importance of providing hope for early release to incarcerated individuals who demonstrate good behavior.  
  **Outcome**: The amendment was adopted unanimously (22-0), and the bill passed as amended.

#### **Immigration Checkpoints and Civil Liberties**
- **HB 624: Immigration Checkpoints Notification**  
  This bill, amended to align with similar legislation from 2022, aimed to specify notification requirements for immigration checkpoints. Some argued that public notification could undermine checkpoint effectiveness, while others stressed the importance of protecting Fourth Amendment rights.  
  **Outcome**: The amendment was adopted (18-2), and the bill passed (14-6).

#### **Protecting Law Enforcement and Emergency Workers**
- **HB 400: Assault on Police Officers and EMS Workers**  
  The bill sought to create a distinct offense for assaulting police officers, firefighters, or EMS workers, with increased penalties. New Hampshire is currently the only state without such a provision. The bill also included a requirement for individuals arrested for such assaults to appear before a judge for bail determination.  
  **Outcome**: The bill was recommended to pass with strong support.

#### **Firearms and Negligence**
- **HB 351: Strengthening Firearms Negligence Law**  
  The committee debated an amendment to HB 351, which focused on increasing penalties for firearms negligence involving children. The amendment removed a requirement for safety devices on all gun transfers, shifting the focus to stricter penalties for negligence.  
  **Outcome**: The bill passed with a narrow vote (10-9) after the amendment was adopted.

#### **Bipartisan Collaboration**
The chair acknowledged the bipartisan effort in advancing the bills and thanked the committee for their hard work, noting they were ahead of schedule in their legislative work.

### **Key Themes**
- **Public Safety vs. Civil Liberties**: Discussions on bills like HB 624 and HB 596 highlighted the ongoing tension between ensuring public safety and protecting individual rights.  
- **Rehabilitation and Accountability**: Parole reform (HB 588) and protections for law enforcement (HB 400) reflected the committee’s focus on balancing rehabilitation opportunities with accountability for criminal behavior.  
- **Policy Implementation**: Many debates centered on the practical challenges of implementing policies, such as racial profiling data collection and cannabis legalization enforcement.  

The meeting concluded with plans to finalize reports, revisit HB 596 after amendments, and prepare for upcoming Senate bills. The session demonstrated the committee’s commitment to addressing complex criminal justice and public safety issues while fostering bipartisan collaboration.
