**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (February 10, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee met on February 10, 2023, to discuss several key bills impacting education policy, funding, and student rights. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including special education funding, school transportation, local control of schools, vocational rehabilitation, homeschooling, and student rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Special Education Funding and Transportation**
1. **House Bill 577 (Special Education Aid)**:
   - The bill proposes adjusting the funding formula for special education services by reducing the multiplier from 3.5 times to 1.5 times.
   - Concerns were raised about the financial and operational impact on special education services, prompting the committee to **retain the bill** for further study. A subcommittee will be formed to gather more data and refine the proposal, with work expected to begin in late spring or early summer.

2. **House Bill 651 (Transportation Network Companies)**:
   - This bill authorizes school districts to contract with transportation network companies (e.g., Uber, Lyft, HopSkipDrive) for niche transportation needs, such as transporting homeless students, foster care children, or students attending career and technical education (CTE) centers.
   - While the bill is not intended to replace traditional school buses, concerns were raised about **safety**, **driver background checks**, and **vehicle requirements**. The Department of Safety emphasized that existing laws already regulate school transportation and ensure safety standards.
   - The state **opposed the bill** in its current form, citing potential loopholes that could circumvent safety regulations. Amendments were suggested to align the bill with existing laws.

### **Local Control and School District Reconfiguration**
3. **House Bill 349 (Special Purpose School District)**:
   - The bill proposes creating a **K-8 special purpose school district** for the towns of **Bridgewater, Hebron, and Groton**, allowing them to withdraw from the Newfound Area School District (SAU4).
   - **Supporters** argued that the K-8 model reduces student transitions, fosters local control, and improves educational outcomes. They highlighted the unique ownership of the Bridgewater Hebron Village School, which is maintained by the community and serves as a hub for local pride and emergency shelter.
   - **Opponents**, including the Newfound teachers union, raised concerns about the rushed process, potential disruption to students and staff, and the lack of community input. They also noted the financial and administrative challenges of creating a new district.
   - The bill was supported by strong community testimony but faced opposition from the Newfound district, which argued it was developed without consultation and could complicate long-term planning.

### **Vocational Rehabilitation and Tuition Programs**
4. **House Bill 640 (Cost Recovery for Vocational Rehabilitation)**:
   - The bill seeks to repeal the state’s right to recover costs for vocational rehabilitation services from individuals who receive third-party settlements or benefits.
   - The Department of Education supported the repeal, as the existing statute is outdated and no longer relevant to current practices. Vocational rehabilitation programs are closely tied to education, particularly for students with disabilities.

5. **House Bill 275 (School Tuition Programs)**:
   - The bill clarifies how districts handle tuition costs for students attending approved schools, including public and private options.
   - Concerns were raised about tuition caps and the ability of parents to pay the difference if they choose a school that exceeds the district’s tuition cap. The discussion emphasized the importance of ensuring access to free public education.

### **Homeschooling and Background Checks**
6. **House Bill 628 (Background Checks for Non-Public Schools)**:
   - The bill proposes requiring background checks for employees and volunteers at non-public schools and education service providers that accept public funds, including those involved in Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs) and scholarship programs like the Education Freedom Account (EFA).
   - **Opponents**, including homeschooling parents and advocates, argued that the bill represents unnecessary government overreach, particularly for families who do not receive public funds. They emphasized that parents are best equipped to ensure their children's safety.
   - Concerns were raised about the bill’s vague language, potential fiscal impact, and infringement on parental rights. Amendments were suggested to exempt traditional homeschoolers and small co-ops not receiving public funds.

### **Student Rights and School Board Accountability**
7. **House Bill 629 (Student Bill of Rights)**:
   - The bill aims to enumerate existing rights guaranteed to students under the U.S. and New Hampshire Constitutions, emphasizing freedom of speech, privacy, and equal protection.
   - **Supporters** argued that the bill enhances student awareness of their rights and reinforces the role of public education in fostering active citizenship.
   - **Opponents** raised concerns about potential misinterpretations, conflicts with parental authority, and the lack of necessity, as existing frameworks already protect students' rights. Some suggested that civics education might be a better approach.

8. **House Bill 427 (Public Participation in School Board Meetings)**:
   - The bill seeks to ensure that school boards allow sufficient time for public questions and comments during meetings, even if the topics are not on the agenda. It also requires school boards to provide answers to public questions within five business days.
   - **Proponents** emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability, arguing that elected officials should be responsive to their constituents.
   - **Concerns** were raised about the practicality of implementing the bill, particularly for complex or unresolved issues. Some suggested adding penalties for non-compliance.

### **Overall Themes and Next Steps**
The meeting highlighted several recurring themes, including the tension between **local control** and **state oversight**, the importance of **student safety**, and the need for **transparency** and **accountability** in education policy. Key bills like HB 577 (special education funding) and HB 349 (special purpose school district) were retained or advanced for further study, while others, such as HB 628 (background checks) and HB 629 (Student Bill of Rights), faced significant opposition and calls for amendments. The committee will continue to refine these proposals to address stakeholder concerns and ensure they align with the state’s educational priorities.
