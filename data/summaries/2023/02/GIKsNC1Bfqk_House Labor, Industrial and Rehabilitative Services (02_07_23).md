**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services (02/07/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 7, 2023, focused on several labor-related bills and amendments, sparking extensive debates on minimum wage, worker protections, promotional processes, and accommodations for individuals with chronic illnesses. The discussions highlighted deep divisions on economic impact, fairness, and constitutional concerns, with no clear consensus on several key issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

### **Minimum Wage and Labor Protections**
1. **House Bill 561**: The committee debated a motion to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL). The bill proposed raising the minimum wage to $15/hour. Supporters argued it would help low-wage workers, reduce reliance on government assistance, and align New Hampshire with neighboring states. Opponents contended it would harm small businesses, lead to job losses, and that wages should be determined by the free market. The vote on ITL was tied 10-10, resulting in no recommendation.

2. **House Bill 57 FN**: A similar ITL motion was debated for a bill addressing low-wage labor bands. Supporters emphasized economic security for workers, while opponents warned it could price low-wage workers out of the job market. The ITL motion also passed 10-10, with no recommendation.

3. **Amendment to House Bill 58 FN**: Representative Schultz proposed an amendment to retain carve-outs in the minimum wage law, such as exemptions for ski patrol volunteers, while eliminating the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers. The amendment aimed to simplify the bill and avoid unintended consequences, particularly regarding overtime and existing labor laws. The committee discussed the amendment and its implications extensively.

4. **Constitutional Concerns**: Representative Seaworth raised concerns about the constitutionality of raising the minimum wage, citing Article 28a, which requires the state to cover costs imposed on municipalities. This sparked debate about the state's authority to legislate on labor issues.

### **School Board Negotiations and Promotional Processes**
1. **HB 241 - School Board Negotiations**: The bill aimed to address scheduling conflicts for school board members during union contract negotiations by requiring negotiations to occur before 9 AM or after 6 PM. Supporters, including Representative Vanessa Sheehan and Milford School Board Vice Chair Nate Wheeler, argued it would prevent school board members from losing pay or vacation time. Opponents, such as the NEA New Hampshire, contended it would disrupt established negotiation practices and increase legal costs.

2. **HB 410 - Ranked Promotional Lists**: The bill sought to standardize promotional processes in municipalities using ranked promotional lists to ensure fairness and transparency. Representative Steve Pearson introduced the bill, addressing concerns about nepotism and favoritism. The bill allows department heads to select a superior candidate once but requires promotions to follow the ranked list thereafter. Opponents, including police chiefs and municipal associations, argued it could undermine managerial discretion and conflict with collective bargaining agreements.

### **Long COVID and ME/CFS Accommodations**
1. **HB 561 - Study Committee on Long COVID and ME/CFS**: Representative Wendy Thomas introduced the bill, proposing a study committee to explore accommodations for individuals with long COVID and ME/CFS, such as remote work, flexible schedules, and special education services. Testimony from advocate Michelle Roy highlighted the challenges faced by individuals with chronic illnesses in maintaining employment. Questions were raised about whether existing disability laws could address these issues, but concerns were noted about the lack of biomarkers for long COVID and ME/CFS, making diagnosis and accommodation more difficult.

### **Tipped Employees and Vacation Pay**
1. **Sub-Minimum Wage and Tip Credit**: The debate centered around the concept of a "tip credit," where employers use tips to offset their obligation to pay the federal minimum wage. Some representatives questioned whether employers pay taxes on this credit and whether tips are underreported. An amendment proposed eliminating the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, ensuring they receive at least the full minimum wage. Proponents argued it would simplify payroll and align New Hampshire with 11 other states that have abolished the sub-minimum wage. Opponents warned it would harm tipped employees and increase costs for small businesses. The amendment passed 11-9.

2. **Vacation Pay Amendment**: Another amendment addressed the payment of earned but unused vacation time upon termination, particularly in cases of layoffs or business ownership changes. Representatives debated the fairness of requiring employers to pay out vacation time retroactively and the administrative burden it might impose on businesses. The Department of Labor clarified that the amendment would not alter existing overtime protections.

### **Key Outcomes and Themes**
- **No Recommendations**: The committee made no recommendation on **HB 561** and **HB 57 FN**, reflecting deep divisions on minimum wage policy.
- **Amendment Passed**: The amendment to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers passed 11-9, but broader concerns about its impact on the restaurant industry remained.
- **Continued Discussion**: The committee continued discussions on **HB 58 FN** and **HB 410**, with ongoing debates about fairness, transparency, and the balance between employee rights and business interests.
- **Study Committee Proposed**: **HB 561** proposed a study committee to address accommodations for individuals with long COVID and ME/CFS, highlighting the evolving challenges in the workforce and education systems.

The meeting underscored the complexities of labor legislation, with representatives grappling with economic, ethical, and practical concerns while striving to balance worker protections with business interests.
