### **Revenue Estimates and Budget Discussions**  
1. **General Fund and Major Tax Categories**:  
   - The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) presented revenue estimates for major taxes, including business taxes, meals and rentals tax, tobacco tax, interest and dividends tax, real estate transfer tax, and utility property tax.  
   - Estimates were based on five scenarios, accounting for year-to-date revenue, plan revenue, and historical trends. High and low ranges were provided for each tax to reflect potential economic slowdowns or continued growth.  
   - Adjustments were made for recent tax law changes, such as rate changes and caps on credit carryovers for business taxes and the phase-out of the interest and dividends tax.  

2. **Economic Factors and Challenges**:  
   - The committee discussed the impact of inflation, potential economic slowdown, and Federal Reserve actions on revenue projections. While inflation is partially reflected in current revenues, concerns were raised about its future effects.  
   - External factors, such as federal stimulus spending and bans on flavored tobacco products in neighboring states (e.g., Massachusetts), were also considered for their potential impact on New Hampshire’s revenues.  

3. **Specific Tax Discussions**:  
   - **Business Taxes**: Significant growth over plan (33.3%) but only 4.7% ahead of the prior year. Projections for 2024 and 2025 anticipate slower growth (0-2%).  
   - **Meals and Rentals Tax**: Revenue is 33.5% ahead of plan but only 3.3% ahead of the prior year, with potential slowing due to higher prices and staffing issues.  
   - **Tobacco Tax**: Declines in cigarette stamp sales were noted, with growth in other tobacco products and e-cigarettes. Concerns were raised about health care costs associated with tobacco use.  
   - **Interest and Dividends Tax**: Fluctuations due to stock market performance, interest rates, and tax law changes make forecasting challenging.  
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Revenues are ahead of plan due to a post-COVID boom, but concerns were raised about a potential slowdown in the housing market due to high prices and rising mortgage rates.  
   - **Utility Property Tax**: Generally stable, with discussions around valuation methods and appeals processes.

### **State Funds and Special Revenue Sources**  
1. **Fish and Game Fund**:  
   - The committee reviewed revenue estimates for Fish and Game licenses, noting a spike in sales during the COVID-19 pandemic and anticipating a return to normal levels. Agency estimates for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025 were unanimously accepted.  

2. **Highway Fund**:  
   - Discussions focused on motor vehicle fees and road tolls, with concerns about the impact of electric vehicles and hybrids on revenue. A motion to accept agency estimates was postponed for further data collection.  

3. **Lottery Revenue**:  
   - The Lottery Commission provided an overview but lacked detailed revenue information. The committee requested a more in-depth presentation, including a breakdown by game type (e.g., scratch tickets, Powerball, Mega Millions).  

4. **Sports Betting and Liquor Sales**:  
   - Concerns were raised about market saturation due to Massachusetts' sports betting and its impact on New Hampshire’s revenue. Liquor sales were affected by transfers to cover Medicaid expansion costs during COVID-19, prompting discussions on future Medicaid funding.  

5. **Swept Fund and Medicaid Recoveries**:  
   - Estimates for the Swept Fund and Medicaid recoveries were quickly accepted, with minor discussions on rounding numbers and ensuring accuracy.  

6. **Tobacco Settlement**:  
   - The committee acknowledged the unpredictability of Tobacco Settlement revenue, accepting agency estimates while noting potential fluctuations based on legal settlements.
