**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (02/06/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 6, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several bills related to energy policy, net metering, renewable energy, and telecommunications. The meeting featured extensive debates, public testimony, and committee votes on key legislation. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes across all segments:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 211**  
The committee unanimously voted (20-0) to recommend "Ought to Pass" (OTP) for this bill, which aims to streamline certain processes. The bill was placed on the consent calendar.

#### **House Bill 633**  
The committee unanimously voted (20-0) to recommend "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) for this bill, which sought to address energy prices but was deemed unworkable due to pricing complexities and potential constitutional issues. It was also placed on the consent calendar.

#### **House Bill 139**  
The committee deadlocked (10-10) on a motion to recommend ITL for this bill, which proposed expanding eligibility for net metering. The chair ruled that a motion to recommend OTP would also fail, so the bill will be sent to the House floor without recommendation. Representative Harrington will write the ITL position, and Representative Corman will write the OTP position.

#### **House Bill 166**  
The committee voted to retain this bill, which addresses the elimination of useful thermal energy from renewable energy classes. The committee felt more time was needed to explore potential solutions.

### **Net Metering and Renewable Energy**

#### **House Bill 458**  
This bill addresses net energy metering for small hydroelectric generators, allowing facilities with multiple dams but a single interconnection point to aggregate their output for net metering eligibility.  
- **Support**: Brookfield Renewable, Monadnock Paper Mills, and Eversource supported the bill, emphasizing its technical fix to implement SB 91 (2021).  
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Department of Energy (DOE) argued it undermines the statutory definition of a "customer generator" and could set a precedent for broader net metering changes.  
- **Concerns**: Potential cost-shifting to ratepayers and the bill’s broader implications for net metering policy were raised.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee closed the public hearing and will consider amendments in the executive session. Companion legislation (SB 40) may also address this issue.

#### **House Bill 263 FN**  
This bill focuses on **Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)** and customer generators, requiring the DOE to notify generators who are not REC-certified about their renewable energy production being credited to electric providers under the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).  
- **Key Issues**:  
  - **REC Sweeping**: Critics argued that REC sweeping deprives customer generators of their property rights and due process.  
  - **Fiscal Impact**: Estimated at $15,000 annually for notifications, potentially passed to ratepayers.  
  - **Economic Viability**: Low Class 2 REC values make certification financially unviable for many generators.  
  - **Legal Concerns**: Constitutional and legal experts raised concerns about takings and due process violations.  
  - **Next Steps**: Calls for a subcommittee to refine the bill’s language and address discrepancies in the fiscal note.

### **Energy Efficiency and Regulatory Oversight**

#### **House Bill 381**  
This bill proposes that adjustments to the **System Benefits Charge (SBC)**, which funds energy efficiency programs, must be approved by the legislature or fiscal committee.  
- **Support**: Prime Sponsor Rep. Michael Harrington argued that tax-like charges should require legislative oversight.  
- **Opposition**: The DOE remained neutral but noted the removal of an escalator clause tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) could reduce funding for energy efficiency programs. Consumer Advocate Don Kreis opposed the bill, arguing the SBC is not a tax and that legislative rate-setting is bad policy.  
- **Public Testimony**: Mixed, with some residents expressing frustration over the SBC as an unfair tax, while others defended its role in funding energy efficiency.

#### **House Bill 385**  
This bill shifts the responsibility for investigating complaints related to **community power aggregation** from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to the DOE.  
- **Support**: Prime Sponsor Rep. Michael Vose argued the PUC lacks the staff to handle complaints effectively.  
- **Concerns**: The DOE highlighted resource constraints, estimating the need for two additional full-time positions.  
- **Public Testimony**: Questions focused on the DOE’s readiness to handle complaints and the need for clarity on funding and enforcement mechanisms.

### **Telecommunications Regulation**

#### **House Bill 257**  
This bill aims to relieve telecommunications carriers of their **"carrier of last resort"** obligation in areas with sufficient competition.  
- **Support**: Rep. Michael Vose emphasized the need to modernize regulations in a competitive market. Stakeholders like the NH Telephone Association and Consolidated Communications supported the bill, arguing that maintaining outdated copper networks is costly.  
- **Concerns**: The NH Municipal Association and the DOE raised concerns about gaps in essential services, especially in rural areas, and the need for comprehensive broadband mapping before moving forward.

### **Procedural Matters and Next Steps**  
The committee addressed procedural issues, including the need to redo executive sessions on previously discussed bills due to noticing issues. Updates on committee members' health were also shared. The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene for further public hearings and executive sessions on additional bills, including **House Bill 166** and **House Bill 263 FN**, which require further analysis and potential subcommittee work.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**  
1. **Net Metering and Renewable Energy**: Debates centered on balancing support for renewable energy initiatives with concerns about cost-shifting to ratepayers and administrative complexities.  
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Discussions highlighted the tension between legislative oversight and the need for stable funding for energy efficiency programs.  
3. **Regulatory Oversight**: Questions arose about the appropriate division of responsibilities between the legislature, PUC, and DOE, as well as the need for adequate funding and staffing.  
4. **Telecommunications**: The focus was on modernizing regulations while ensuring universal access to essential services, particularly in rural areas.  
5. **Administrative Challenges**: Tracking customer generators, issuing RECs, and aligning utility and DOE systems emerged as recurring administrative hurdles.  

The meeting underscored the complexity of energy and telecommunications policy in New Hampshire, with a clear need for further deliberation, data analysis, and stakeholder engagement to address these issues effectively.
