**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (02/08/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 8, 2023, centered on discussions and amendments related to **House Bill 49 (HB 49)** and **Senate Bill 1 (SB1)**, focusing on the **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)** and its planned closure. The meeting highlighted the complexities of planning and funding a replacement facility, addressing operational challenges, and ensuring public safety and community engagement. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **1. Budget and Design for a New Youth Development Center**
- **Budget Allocation**: The committee debated the allocation of **$2 million** for the design of a new secured Youth Development Center. There was discussion about whether to pursue one or two design options (small and medium-sized facilities) and concerns about whether the $2 million would suffice. The committee ultimately agreed to proceed with two design options (6-12 beds and 12-18 beds) and retain the $2 million allocation.
- **Site Selection**: Three potential locations were under consideration: the current SYSC campus, a site near New Hampshire Hospital, and a site near Hampstead Hospital. The committee emphasized the importance of shared services and cost savings, particularly for clinical and educational services. The timeline for site evaluation and the role of the Public Works committee in assessing construction feasibility were also discussed.
- **Operational Funding**: The committee allocated **$1.5 million** for operational costs from March to the end of the fiscal year to address shortfalls caused by unexpected retirements and overtime expenses.

### **2. Amendments to HB 49 and SB1**
- **Fire Safety**: Concerns were raised about fire safety at the SYSC, with suggestions to involve fire department experts in the facility design process to ensure proper fire truck access and site evaluation.
- **Amendment Proposals**: Key amendments to HB 49 included:
  - Repealing the SYSC closure date (originally set for March 1, 2023) and extending it to **June 30, 2025**.
  - Appropriating $2 million for site evaluation, architectural consultation, and design development.
  - Incorporating language from SB1 to establish a commission to study public safety, fire safety, and site selection impacts. The commission would include representatives from local law enforcement, municipal governing bodies, and potentially fire and ambulance services.
- **Operational Savings**: The committee discussed potential savings from shared services with other facilities (e.g., Hampstead Hospital or New Hampshire Hospital) and proposed staffing reductions, particularly in nursing and maintenance roles, with an estimated $2 million in savings.

### **3. System of Care and Future Facility Needs**
- **System of Care Impact**: The **System of Care** program, implemented in 2018, has reduced the number of youth in detention and residential care. While it is expected to have a long-term impact, the committee acknowledged that SYSC will still be needed for a small number of youth requiring secure detention.
- **Federal Funding and Timeline**: Federal **ARPA funds** must be obligated by December 31, 2024, and spent by December 31, 2026. Delaying design work could jeopardize the ability to use ARPA funds, potentially requiring general funds for construction. The estimated cost for a replacement facility is **$15 million**, though inflation and labor costs may increase this amount.

### **4. Staffing and Morale**
- The SYSC is experiencing significant staffing shortages, with a 60% vacancy rate. Extending the closure date and committing to a replacement facility could help stabilize the workforce and prevent further employee attrition.

### **5. Commission on Public Safety and Community Impact**
- The committee discussed the inclusion of a commission to study the public safety and community impacts of the new facility. This commission would include representatives from local law enforcement, municipal governing bodies, and potentially fire and ambulance services. The commission would also consider site selection and recommend locations and legislative actions.

### **6. Concerns and Next Steps**
- **Concerns**: Several representatives expressed concerns about the lack of clarity on the site selection process, the potential for increased costs, and the need for community involvement. Amendments were proposed to expand the commission’s mandate to include site selection and community impacts, such as fire safety and other local services.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to finalize amendments and continue discussions in the **HB2** process. The commission’s role in site selection and community impact assessments will remain active.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing the SYSC’s closure while balancing careful planning, financial constraints, and operational challenges. The committee aimed to ensure thoughtful, deliberate decision-making to avoid repeating past mistakes in facility planning and closure timelines. The discussions highlighted the importance of public safety, cost-effectiveness, and community engagement in the development of a new Youth Development Center.
