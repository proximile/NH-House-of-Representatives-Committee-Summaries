**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Legislative Administration (02/06/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 6, 2023, centered on critical discussions around **ethics guidelines**, **conflicts of interest**, and several key legislative bills. The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing ethical standards with practical governance, aiming to create clearer, more effective guidelines to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain public trust. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points across all segments:

---

### **Ethics Guidelines and Conflicts of Interest**
1. **Purpose and Clarity of Ethics Guidelines**:
   - The committee debated whether the ethics booklet should serve as a **guideline** for legislators to self-assess conflicts of interest or as a tool for the Ethics Committee to determine **guilt or innocence**.  
   - There was a focus on providing clarity for legislators on when to **recuse themselves** from votes or decisions due to potential conflicts.

2. **Defining Conflicts of Interest**:
   - Discussions centered on how broadly to define conflicts of interest, including whether they should extend to **family members**, **friends**, **business associates**, or others a legislator might care about.  
   - Ambiguous terms like "someone the legislator cares about" or "closely associated" raised concerns about subjective interpretations and potential misuse.

3. **Recusal and Disclosure**:
   - Legislators discussed whether recusal should be **mandatory** or **discretionary** when a conflict arises. Some argued that requiring recusal could hinder the functioning of committees, especially in a **citizen legislature** where members bring specialized knowledge.  
   - The importance of **disclosure** was emphasized as a way to maintain transparency while allowing legislators to participate in discussions and votes.

4. **Ethics Committee Challenges**:
   - The Ethics Committee has faced a significant increase in complaints, many of which are perceived as **frivolous** or related to **social media interactions**.  
   - The process for filing and handling complaints—including **initial review**, **preliminary investigation**, and **formal hearings**—was explained. Concerns were raised about complaints based on perceived conflicts rather than actual wrongdoing.

5. **Amendments and Comparisons**:
   - Representative Nutting Wong proposed an amendment to simplify and clarify the language around conflicts of interest, borrowing from **Massachusetts'** approach.  
   - The committee reviewed amendments to refine definitions and scope, considering examples from other states to inform their decisions.

6. **Practical Challenges**:
   - Practical challenges were highlighted, such as how to handle situations where a legislator’s **neighbor**, **friend**, or **distant relative** might benefit from a vote, even if the legislator is unaware of the connection.  
   - The committee acknowledged the difficulty of balancing **transparency**, **accountability**, and the need for legislators to bring their expertise to the legislative process.

7. **Public Perception and Legislative Integrity**:
   - The discussion emphasized the importance of maintaining public trust in the legislature. There was a focus on how to handle complaints that arise from public perception rather than substantive ethical violations.

### **Key Legislative Discussions**
1. **House Bill 134 (HB 134)**:
   - Introduced by Representative Mike Edgar, this bill seeks to classify the legislature as a **public employer** under the Public Employee Labor Relations Act, allowing non-partisan employees to engage in **collective bargaining**.  
   - The discussion highlighted the potential impact on legislative staff and the need for clarity on who would be included in such bargaining units.

2. **House Bill 157 (HB 157)**:
   - Requested by the Joint Legislative Committee on Legislative Facilities, this bill aims to align current practices with statutory language.  
   - The discussion revolved around the Ethics Committee’s jurisdiction over certain policies and whether the bill provides sufficient clarity for handling complaints related to **harassment** and **discrimination**.

3. **House Concurrent Resolution 6 (HCR 6)**:
   - Introduced by Representative Santo Nastasso, this resolution affirms the right to **self-determination** and opposes the use of military force against groups seeking self-governance.  
   - The resolution drew support from members who emphasized the moral and political importance of respecting autonomy and human rights.

### **Scheduling and Logistics**
- The committee discussed scheduling challenges due to holidays, school vacations, and other commitments.  
- They tentatively planned to meet on **March 8th and 9th** to finalize amendments and conduct work sessions, with the possibility of holding **executive sessions** in the afternoon.

### **Chairman’s Perspective**
- The chairman emphasized that the bill aims to **prevent inadvertent violations** by providing clear guidance to legislators, rather than creating a rigid framework for punishment.

### **Future Steps**
