**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Meeting (02/06/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on February 6, 2023, focusing on several legislative matters, including House Bills 134, 157, and 301, as well as House Concurrent Resolution 6 (HCR6). The discussions centered on employee unionization, legislative facility rules, ethics guidelines, and the right to self-determination, with an emphasis on clarity, procedural efficiency, and addressing public concerns.

### **Key Legislative Discussions:**

1. **House Bill 134: Unionization of Legislative Employees**
   - The bill addresses the unionization rights of legislative employees. Representative Conley clarified that public employees, unlike private sector workers, require legislative approval to join a union. The discussion highlighted that over 100 General Court staffers, including 24 full-time House employees, could be affected, with 12 potentially impacted directly. Notably, legislative staff have never been surveyed on their interest in unionization, raising questions about the need for the bill.

2. **House Bill 157: Clarifying Legislative Facility Rules**
   - This bill aims to align legislative facility rules with current practices, particularly regarding the jurisdiction of the Ethics Committee in handling harassment and discrimination complaints. The discussion emphasized the need for clarity in the statute to ensure proper procedures are followed, with input from the Ethics Committee expected in future deliberations.

3. **House Concurrent Resolution 6 (HCR6): Right to Self-Determination**
   - HCR6 advocates for the right to self-determination and opposes military action against those seeking self-governance. Representatives Santonastaso and Gearhart spoke in support, framing the resolution as a moral issue rooted in principles of freedom and liberty. The resolution underscores the importance of allowing people to choose their governance without fear of violence.

4. **Scheduling and Logistics**
   - The committee addressed scheduling challenges due to holidays and school vacation weeks, proposing meetings on March 8th and 9th to allow time for amendments and discussions. Plans included a morning work session followed by an afternoon executive session.

### **Ethics Guidelines and Conflict of Interest (House Bill 301):**

The committee engaged in extensive discussions on **House Bill 301**, which focuses on ethics guidelines and conflict-of-interest rules for legislators. Key points included:

1. **Purpose of Ethics Guidelines**
   - The committee debated whether the ethics booklet should serve as a self-assessment tool for legislators or a strict legal standard for the Ethics Committee. The consensus leaned toward it being a guideline rather than a rigid rulebook.

2. **Defining Conflicts of Interest**
   - Significant discussion centered on how broadly to define conflicts of interest, particularly regarding individuals a legislator "cares about" or is "closely associated with." Concerns were raised about vague language leading to ambiguity and potential misuse, with lawyers in the group advocating for more precise definitions.

3. **Recusal and Disclosure**
   - The committee discussed whether legislators should be required to recuse themselves from voting on issues where they have a conflict of interest or if disclosure of the conflict is sufficient. Opinions varied, with some members advocating for mandatory recusal in certain cases and others emphasizing transparency.

4. **Ethics Complaints Process**
   - The process for filing ethics complaints was outlined, emphasizing that anyone—including the public or other legislators—can file a complaint. The Ethics Committee reviews complaints in stages, maintaining confidentiality until a formal hearing.

5. **Preventative Measures**
   - The committee considered creating a decision tree or simplified guide to help legislators navigate potential conflicts of interest more effectively, aiming to prevent ethical violations before they occur.

6. **Challenges with Broad Definitions**
   - Concerns were raised about extending the definition of conflicts of interest beyond immediate family to include friends, business associates, or neighbors. This raised questions about practicality and the potential for excessive reporting requirements.

7. **Campaign Contributions**
   - The irony of campaign contributions being listed as a permitted activity in the ethics guidelines was noted, given public concerns about their influence on conflicts of interest. Addressing this issue was acknowledged as politically challenging.

8. **Advisory Role of the Ethics Committee**
   - The committee discussed the Ethics Committee's role in providing advisory opinions to legislators seeking guidance on potential conflicts, aiming to prevent inadvertent violations.

### **Ethics and Public Perception:**
Legislators expressed concerns about the increasing number of ethics complaints, many of which were perceived as frivolous or driven by social media. The committee debated whether current guidelines are clear enough to prevent misuse and discussed refining the language to better address ethical concerns.

### **Amendment Discussion:**
Representative Nutting Wong proposed an amendment to simplify and clarify the definition of a conflict of interest, drawing inspiration from Massachusetts' language. The amendment focused on real or perceived financial or personal benefits.

### **Moving Forward:**
The committee agreed to continue discussions after receiving input from the Ethics Committee, which was scheduled to meet the following Monday. Members were encouraged to consider further amendments or clarifications to the bill, with the goal of refining it to provide clear guidance for legislators and address public concerns.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the tension between creating clear, enforceable ethics rules and ensuring they are practical and fair for a citizen legislature. Discussions on unionization, legislative facility rules, self-determination, and ethics guidelines underscored the importance of clarity, procedural efficiency, and addressing public concerns in legislative processes. The committee plans to reconvene after gathering additional input to refine the bills and resolutions under consideration.
