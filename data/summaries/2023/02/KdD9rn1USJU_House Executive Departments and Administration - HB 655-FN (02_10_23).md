**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on HB 655-FN (02/10/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on **House Bill 655-FN**, which aims to streamline the operations, licensing, disciplinary, and investigative procedures of professional boards overseen by the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC). The discussions highlighted both the potential benefits and concerns surrounding the bill, with a focus on balancing efficiency, fairness, and collaboration across diverse professional sectors. Key points from the meeting include:

### **Structure and Operations of the OPLC**
1. **Organization and Access to Information**: Concerns were raised about the OPLC’s structure, staffing levels, and the handling of sensitive information. Participants emphasized the need to limit access to investigation-related data to a small, authorized group to protect privacy and ensure security.
2. **Funding and Budgeting**: Questions arose about the bill’s handling of two non-lapsing funds and their impact on the budget and fee structure. Clarification was sought on how these funds are allocated and whether they return to the general fund.

### **Licensing and Appeals Process**
3. **Licensing Consistency**: Elizabeth Robb, a licensed acupuncturist, highlighted inconsistencies in how different professions (e.g., naturopaths, mental health professionals, pharmacy interns) have their applications reviewed. She advocated for uniformity in the licensing process for acupuncturists.
4. **Appeals Process**: The bill’s provision for direct appeals to the Supreme Court was scrutinized. Participants suggested adding an intermediate step, such as a review by a legislative jury, to make the process more accessible, particularly for blue-collar workers.

### **Disciplinary and Investigative Procedures**
5. **Disciplinary Concerns**: Significant attention was given to the disciplinary portion of the bill, particularly around investigations, complaints, and allegations. Participants stressed the need for clear definitions of terms like "allegations," "complaints," and "investigations" to ensure consistency and fairness.
6. **Investigation Authority**: Concerns were expressed about the OPLC’s authority to conduct investigations, especially in home offices. Participants called for clearer guidelines to protect privacy and ensure fairness.
7. **Cost of Investigations**: The bill’s provision allowing the recovery of investigation costs from licensees was criticized as punitive and redundant, given that license fees already cover these expenses. Participants argued this could violate constitutional protections against excessive fines.
8. **Medical Review Subcommittee (MRC)**: Issues with the MRC’s backlog of medical complaints were highlighted. While the bill proposes eliminating the MRC, concerns were raised about losing subject-matter expertise. Participants suggested alternative models to address the backlog.

### **Privacy and Procedural Protections**
9. **Privacy and Record Handling**: Psychologists and mental health professionals expressed concerns about the privacy of client records during investigations. They requested clarity on whether records could be re-released to third parties without a court order.
10. **Procedural Uniformity vs. Flexibility**: There was debate over whether a one-size-fits-all approach to procedural rules would work across all boards. Some representatives argued for the involvement of subject matter experts in investigations, while others emphasized the need for flexibility, particularly for boards like electricians and funeral directors, which may not require external experts.

### **Collaboration and Communication**
11. **Collaboration vs. Streamlining**: While the bill aims to streamline processes, some participants felt it lacked collaboration with professional boards. There was a call for a balanced approach that maintains board authority while improving efficiency.
12. **Communication and Board Involvement**: Attendees, including Stephen Reinkort of the Electrical Contractors Business Association, highlighted communication gaps between the OPLC and the boards. They stressed the need for better notification and involvement of boards in legislative changes affecting their professions.

### **Repeals and Policy Changes**
13. **Repeals and Streamlining**: The bill proposes repealing redundant sections of law to streamline processes. However, stakeholders expressed concerns that some repeals might unintentionally remove important protections or authority from boards. Participants requested a clear distinction between housekeeping changes and substantive policy changes in the bill.

### **Amendments and Future Work**
14. **Proposed Amendments**: Amendments included deleting certain sections related to sanctions and investigation costs, as well as reordering sections to improve clarity. OPLC representatives acknowledged the feedback and indicated they were working on amendments to address concerns, particularly around privacy and procedural protections for psychologists and mental health professionals.
15. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to draft amendments and continue discussions in future sessions. OPLC representatives also committed to providing a crosswalk of the bill’s changes for clarity.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing efficiency and uniformity with the unique needs of different professional boards. Key themes included the need for clearer definitions, procedural fairness, privacy protections, and improved collaboration between the OPLC and professional boards. The subcommittee planned to hold additional meetings to refine the bill based on stakeholder input, ensuring it addresses these critical concerns while achieving its goal of streamlining professional licensing and disciplinary processes.
