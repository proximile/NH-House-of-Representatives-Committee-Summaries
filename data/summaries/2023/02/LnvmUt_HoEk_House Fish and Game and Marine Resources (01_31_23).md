### **Overview of the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHFGD)**

1. **Committee Introductions and Orientation**  
   Chair Representative James Spillane and Vice Chair Representative Jeff Goley, along with other committee members, introduced themselves and their districts. The meeting began with an orientation to the committee's responsibilities and the NHFGD's mission.

2. **NHFGD History and Mission**  
   Scott Mason, Executive Director of NHFGD, provided a historical overview of the department, established in 1865. The department's mission is to conserve and manage New Hampshire's fish, wildlife, and marine resources. Mason explained the department's structure, including its 11-member commission representing the state's counties, and its primary funding sources: hunting and fishing licenses, federal excise taxes, and grants.

3. **Department Divisions and Operations**  
   Mason introduced the various divisions within NHFGD, including Business, Facilities and Lands, Inland Fisheries, Law Enforcement, Marine, Wildlife, and Public Affairs. Division chiefs detailed their responsibilities, such as managing boat access sites, enforcing hunting and fishing laws, conducting search and rescue operations, and overseeing hatcheries and wildlife management.

4. **Law Enforcement Division**  
   Chief Kevin Jordan highlighted the Law Enforcement Division's role in enforcing hunting, fishing, and ATV laws, managing nuisance wildlife, and conducting search and rescue missions. He emphasized the division's specialty teams, including dive teams, K-9 units, and airboat rescue teams, underscoring the department's commitment to public safety and wildlife conservation.

5. **Funding Challenges**  
   Speakers, including Mason and Jordan, discussed the department's funding challenges, particularly for search and rescue operations, which rely heavily on license fees paid by sportsmen and women. They stressed the need for additional funding to meet the department's growing responsibilities.

6. **Public Engagement and Education**  
   The department highlighted its efforts in public education, including hunter safety courses, aquatic education programs, and the television show *NorthWoods Law*, which offers insights into the daily activities of NHFGD officers.

### **House Bill 442: Recreational Scuba Diving for Lobsters**

1. **Bill Overview**  
   House Bill 442 initially aimed to prevent state funds from enforcing federal lobster fishing regulations but was amended to focus on allowing New Hampshire residents to harvest lobsters using scuba diving. The bill proposed designated areas, limited permits, and data collection on catches to ensure sustainability.

2. **Support for the Bill**  
   Proponents argued that hand-catching lobsters via scuba diving is more sustainable and less disruptive than traditional pot fishing. Divers can assess lobsters underwater for size and egg-bearing status, reducing bycatch and environmental impact. Advocates also highlighted potential economic benefits for local dive shops and the declining scuba diving industry, suggesting the bill could attract more people to the sport.

3. **Opposition to the Bill**  
   Opponents, including the New Hampshire Commercial Fishermen's Association and lobstermen, expressed concerns about enforcement, safety, and sustainability. They argued that lobster traps are essential for the resource's sustainability, acting as "lobster feeders" and allowing juvenile lobsters to escape. They also raised concerns about divers poaching lobsters from traps, which would be difficult to enforce.

4. **Enforcement and Safety Concerns**  
   Colonel Jordan of NHFGD highlighted significant enforcement challenges, noting that monitoring divers underwater would be nearly impossible. Safety concerns were also raised regarding increased diver activity in areas where lobstermen operate, potentially leading to accidents or conflicts.

5. **Sustainability and Economic Impact**  
   Experts, including Josh Colony from NHFGD, warned about declining juvenile lobster populations due to warming waters in the Gulf of Maine. Opponents emphasized the lobster fishery's economic importance, contributing over $34 million annually to New Hampshire's economy. They argued that adding another harvesting method could jeopardize this resource.

6. **Ghost Trap Cleanup**  
   The bill included provisions to address "ghost traps" (lost or abandoned lobster traps), which continue to catch marine life. Proponents suggested that divers could help remove these traps, improving sustainability, while lobstermen disputed claims about the prevalence of ghost gear, noting that biodegradable escape vents are effective.

7. **Massachusetts Comparison**  
   Scuba diving for lobsters is legal in Massachusetts, where it accounts for less than 5% of landings. New Hampshireâ€™s proposal included stricter limits on permits, seasons, and catch reporting.

8. **Alternative Methods and Amendments**  
   Opponents suggested that recreational harvesters could use the existing five-trap license system, which is more sustainable and easier to enforce. The committee planned to hold another hearing to discuss further amendments to the bill.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**

1. **Balancing Access and Sustainability**  
   The debate over House Bill 442 highlighted the challenge of balancing access to natural resources with sustainability and economic concerns. Proponents emphasized the environmental benefits of scuba diving, while opponents stressed the importance of maintaining the lobster fishery's sustainability and economic viability.

2. **Enforcement Challenges**  
   Enforcement emerged as a significant concern, with both sides acknowledging the difficulties of monitoring underwater harvesting. Proponents argued that divers and lobstermen already co-exist without major issues, while opponents warned of potential conflicts and illegal activities.

3. **Economic and Environmental Impact**  
   The lobster fishery's economic importance to New Hampshire was a central theme in the opposition's arguments. Proponents countered that the bill would not significantly impact the lobster population and could benefit the local economy by supporting dive shops and recreational diving.

4. **Future Discussions**  
   The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issues and planned to hold additional hearings to discuss amendments and gather further input from stakeholders.

### **Overall Takeaways**

The meeting provided a comprehensive overview of the NHFGD's operations, challenges, and commitment to conserving New Hampshire's natural resources. The discussion on House Bill 442 revealed deep divisions between those advocating for recreational scuba divers' rights and those concerned about the potential negative impacts on the lobster industry, enforcement, and safety. The committee's next steps will involve further deliberation and amendments to address these concerns.
