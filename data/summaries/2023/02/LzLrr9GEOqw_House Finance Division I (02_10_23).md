**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Finance Division I (02/10/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 10, 2023, covered a wide range of topics, focusing on the state’s natural and cultural resources, economic development, tourism, and infrastructure. The meeting included presentations and discussions from the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR), the New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC), and the Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA). Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR)**
1. **Department Overview**:
   - The DNCR manages over 220,000 acres of public land, 870 buildings, 7,000 miles of snowmobile trails, and infrastructure like bridges and dams. It employs nearly 1,000 people and oversees cultural and historical assets.

2. **State Parks and Trails**:
   - State parks and trails are significant economic drivers, with increased attendance and camping during the pandemic. The department is requesting funding to convert temporary positions to full-time and add staff, including forest rangers and a curator.
   - Challenges include staffing for fee collection and trail enforcement, particularly with motorized and non-motorized recreation. Coordination with Fish and Game and local law enforcement is ongoing.
   - The aging tramway at Franconia Notch State Park, a key tourist attraction generating $2 million annually, is at the end of its lifespan. The department is seeking $25 million for its replacement.

3. **Forest Health and Invasive Species**:
   - The Forest Health Program focuses on mitigating invasive species like the emerald ash borer, which threatens New Hampshire’s ash trees. Parasitic wasps are being introduced to combat the pest, and additional funding has been secured.

4. **Archaeology and Historical Preservation**:
   - The DNCR oversees over 3,700 archaeological sites, including pre-contact sites dating back 12,500 years. The state maintains an archaeology lab and curates artifacts from state-funded projects, with hopes of creating a museum to showcase these items.
   - Criteria for designating archaeological sites were discussed, including the potential for everyday items like discarded beer cans to be considered artifacts.

5. **Cultural Initiatives**:
   - The department supports New Hampshire’s cultural assets, including NH PBS and historic sites like the Wentworth-Coolidge Mansion. A GIS mapping tool is being developed for trail management and public accessibility.

### **New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC)**
1. **Operations and Revenue**:
   - The NHLC is self-funded and operates under a three-tier system, generating significant revenue from liquor and wine sales. It has 68 retail outlets, including state-owned and leased locations, and introduced curbside pickup during the pandemic.
   - The commission is expanding and renovating outlets, focusing on larger stores to compete with private retailers like Total Wine.

2. **Staffing Challenges**:
   - The NHLC faces staffing issues, with part-time employees working fewer hours and a high vacancy rate for full-time positions. A new incentive program offers bonuses based on sales increases in employees’ respective areas.

3. **Community Involvement**:
   - The NHLC contributes to non-profits and has received numerous awards for its operations and community involvement.

4. **Cannabis and Alcohol Sales**:
   - There is no significant impact on alcohol sales from neighboring states legalizing recreational cannabis, as New Hampshire residents often travel out of state to purchase cannabis products.

### **Economic Development, Tourism, and Infrastructure (BEA)**
1. **Tourism and Marketing**:
   - Tourism is a major focus, with a budget of about $9.5 million. The state faces competition from neighboring states like Maine and Vermont, which have larger marketing budgets.
   - The marketing strategy includes digital advertising, destination takeovers, and targeting specific demographics. The state has expanded its marketing reach to a 600-mile radius due to the pandemic and is focusing on sustainable tourism.
   - A five-year strategy is being developed to promote New Hampshire as a tourism destination, considering factors like visitor spending, migration rates, and sustainability.

2. **Broadband Expansion**:
   - The state has allocated $122 million for broadband expansion through the Broadband Connect program, aiming to serve unserved and underserved locations. The first round of funding awarded $50 million to the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative, covering approximately 23,000 locations.

3. **Housing and Workforce Development**:
   - The state is addressing housing challenges, including the impact of short-term rentals like Airbnb. The InvestNH housing program, funded with $100 million from ARPA funds, aims to develop housing with 18-month funding windows.
   - Workforce development programs are helping businesses experiencing downsizing and layoffs to relocate employees quickly.

4. **Visitor Services and Rest Areas**:
   - The Bureau of Visitor Services manages rest areas and welcome centers, which face staffing challenges due to low pay ($12/hour) and labor shortages. Solutions being explored include increasing pay and using Granite State ambassadors.

5. **Challenges and Future Plans**:
   - The state is grappling with the impact of climate change on tourism, particularly on ski areas, and is exploring ways to make tourism more sustainable.
   - Efforts are underway to attract talent and businesses to New Hampshire, leveraging the state’s tax advantages and quality of life.
   - A post-COVID outdoor recreation and tourism strategy is being developed to manage increased visitor numbers and ensure a strong visitor experience.
