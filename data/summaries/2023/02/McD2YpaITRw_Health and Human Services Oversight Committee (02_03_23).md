### **Child Fatality Review Committee Report**
Trish Tilly, Director of Public Health, presented the annual report from the Child Fatality Review Committee. The report highlighted the leading causes of child deaths in New Hampshire, including:
- **Unintentional Deaths**: Overdoses, motor vehicle accidents, and drowning.
- **Intentional Deaths**: Primarily suicides.

The committee emphasized data-driven prevention strategies, such as promoting firearm safety during pediatric visits and swim safety education. A notable discussion ensued regarding the role of pediatricians in asking about firearms in homes, with some members expressing concerns about privacy and effectiveness. Committee members also inquired about opioid-related deaths and the impact of past legislation, such as the requirement for pharmacists to label opioids with an orange sticker.

### **Prescription Drug Monitoring and Opioid Sticker Law**
Representative Merchant raised questions about the effectiveness of the opioid sticker law in preventing children’s access to opioids and its potential impact on child suicides. The committee considered analyzing data from the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) and child fatality reports to assess the law’s impact.

### **Medicaid Unwinding and Eligibility Redetermination**
Medicaid Director Henry Lipman discussed the process of unwinding continuous Medicaid enrollment following the end of the federal Public Health Emergency. Approximately 102,000 individuals are in protected status, with eligibility redeterminations phased over nine months. A risk-based strategy prioritizes vulnerable populations, such as nursing home residents and individuals with chronic conditions. A special enrollment period has been announced to help individuals transition to other health plans without coverage gaps.

### **Adult Dental Program and Provider Challenges**
The committee reviewed progress on the adult dental program, set to launch by April 1, 2023, with Delta Dental as the provider. Challenges in recruiting dentists willing to accept Medicaid patients were noted, with loan forgiveness programs highlighted as a potential solution. Discussions also centered on Senate Bill 86, which proposes $145 million in rate increases for Medicaid providers over the biennium, addressing ongoing concerns about provider access.

### **Healthcare Transparency and Emerging Technologies**
A subcommittee report on improving transparency at the NH Board of Medicine was presented, prompted by a surgeon’s malpractice cases not being reported on the NH website. Recommendations included changes to reporting protocols and increased staffing for investigations. A related bill (HB 322) is in progress. Additionally, a subcommittee on emerging medical technologies, chaired by Representative Soloway, produced a report that led to the introduction of HB 323.
