### Comprehensive Summary of NH House Executive Departments and Administration Work Session: HB 250, HB 571, HB 436, HB 449 (2/2/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee held a subcommittee work session on February 2, 2023, to discuss several bills: **HB 250**, **HB 571**, **HB 436**, and **HB 449**. The session focused on retirement benefits, labor retention, fiscal impacts, and constitutional concerns. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **HB 250: Accidental Death Benefits**
- **Objective:** The bill aims to increase the surviving spouse’s benefit from 50% to 100% of the pension for active members of the retirement system who die accidentally.  
- **Fiscal Impact:** The bill would create an unfunded liability paid over 20 years, starting in 2026, with costs estimated at $1 million annually.  
- **Constitutional Concerns:** Representative True raised concerns about unfunded liabilities being passed to towns, potentially violating Article 28-a of the NH Constitution, which prohibits unfunded mandates. Others countered that the retirement system’s structure, established in 1967, does not violate this provision.  
- **Outcome:** The subcommittee voted 4-1 to recommend the bill for passage (OTP).

### **HB 571: Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA) for Group 2 Retirees**
- **Objective:** The bill proposes COLAs for certain Group 2 retirees in the NH Retirement System.  
- **Fiscal Impact:** The fiscal note estimates an $84 million cost in 2023.  
- **Policy Concerns:** Representative True opposed the bill, arguing that COLAs for defined benefit plans are not good policy, especially since many private-sector retirees do not receive such adjustments. Others highlighted the regional competitiveness of New Hampshire’s retirement system compared to other New England states, which have statutory COLAs.  
- **Outcome:** A motion to pass the bill failed (3-2), followed by a motion to deem it "inexpedient to legislate," which passed (3-2), effectively killing the bill in the subcommittee.

### **HB 436: Restoring Promised Pension Benefits**
- **Objective:** This bill seeks to address unconstitutional retroactive changes made to the retirement system in 2011, which reduced benefits for certain employees.  
- **Proposed Amendment:** Representative Pearson proposed an amendment to restore promised benefits to affected employees, particularly those nearing retirement. The amendment includes:  
  - Adjusting the pension cap from $120,000 (2009) to $166,000 (accounting for inflation) and implementing an annual 1.25% increase to address dollar devaluation.  
  - A 10-year phased approach with $25 million annually allocated from the state budget to cover costs.  
- **Moral and Ethical Responsibility:** Members emphasized the state’s obligation to fulfill promises made to employees who planned their retirements based on the original pension terms.  
- **Challenges:** Tight deadlines and the need for actuarial analysis posed challenges, but most subcommittee members supported the amendment as a necessary step to rebuild trust and rectify past injustices.  
- **Outcome:** The amendment will replace HB 436 entirely, pending finalization and actuarial review.

### **HB 449: Increasing Retirement Benefits**
- **Objective:** Sponsored by Representative Gooley, the bill aims to increase retirement benefits for all employees moving forward, not just those affected by a 10-year transitional period from 2011.  
- **Fiscal Impact:** The fiscal note estimates $13.3 million in costs for 2026, paid by employers rather than the state.  
- **Labor Retention Concerns:** Members highlighted significant labor shortages in critical sectors like law enforcement, firefighting, and corrections, with many employees leaving for better benefits in neighboring states like Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts.  
- **Debate:** While some members supported the bill as a step toward improving competitiveness, others suggested a deeper analysis or reconvening a commission to address the issue comprehensively.  
- **Outcome:** The subcommittee decided to reconvene for further discussion on HB 449 and related bills.

### **Key Themes and Considerations**  
1. **Fiscal Responsibility:** Members consistently emphasized balancing policy goals with fiscal constraints, particularly concerning unfunded liabilities and their impact on municipalities.  
2. **Constitutional Concerns:** Article 28-a, which prohibits unfunded mandates, was a recurring topic, with debates over whether certain provisions of the bills violated this constitutional provision.  
3. **Regional Competitiveness:** The need for New Hampshire’s retirement system to remain competitive with other New England states, particularly regarding COLAs and benefits, was a central focus.  
4. **Moral and Ethical Obligations:** The subcommittee acknowledged the state’s responsibility to fulfill promises made to employees and rebuild trust in the retirement system, especially in light of the unconstitutional 2011 changes.

### **Next Steps**  
The subcommittee plans to reconvene, likely the following Wednesday, to continue discussions on **HB 449** and finalize the amendment to **HB 436**. The session underscored the urgency of addressing labor retention and retirement benefit issues while balancing fiscal and constitutional considerations.
