The New Hampshire House of Representatives held an executive session to discuss **House Bill 453**. Representative Berry introduced a motion to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate," which was seconded. 

During the discussion, Representative Berry explained that while he initially supported the bill, he changed his position after learning that current electronic ballot counting machines can accurately process folded ballots when used in accordance with state law. He also noted that new machines being tested could address the issues the bill aimed to resolve, making the legislation unnecessary. Additionally, he raised concerns about unattended large envelopes at apartment complexes, which could lead to security issues.

Another representative shared that folded ballots in their town often require manual counting, which is time-consuming and causes delays. They argued that unfolded ballots would prevent such problems.

After further discussion, the House voted on the motion, with 18 members in favor and 2 opposed. The motion passed, and the bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate. The session concluded with plans to move the bill to the consent calendar, and Representative Brian was tasked with preparing the report. The executive session on House Bill 453 was then closed.
