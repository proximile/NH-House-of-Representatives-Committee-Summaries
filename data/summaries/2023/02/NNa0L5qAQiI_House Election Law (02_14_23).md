The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened an executive session to discuss **House Bill 453**, focusing on issues related to folded ballots and electronic ballot counting machines. **Representative Berry** moved that the bill be deemed **inexpedient to legislate**, citing new information that current electronic machines can accurately count folded ballots when used in accordance with state law and good practices. He also noted that newer machines being tested could address the problems the bill aimed to solve, making the legislation unnecessary. Additionally, concerns were raised about unattended large envelopes at apartment complexes.

Another representative highlighted that folded ballots often require manual counting, which delays the process and causes issues with machine readability. Despite this, the majority supported the motion to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate. The vote resulted in **18 in favor** and **2 opposed**, and the bill was moved to the **consent calendar** without objection. The executive session on HB 453 was then closed.
