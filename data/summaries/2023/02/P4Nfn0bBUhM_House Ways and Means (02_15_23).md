**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Ways and Means Committee, February 15, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee convened on February 15, 2023, to discuss several bills related to charitable gaming, taxation, and regulatory updates. The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing economic growth, revenue generation, and the potential societal impacts of proposed legislative changes. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Charitable Gaming and House Bill 607**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 607**, which proposes updates to charitable gaming regulations. Key points included:

1. **Support for Non-Profits**: Representatives and non-profit leaders, including Home Health and Hospice Care and the Law Enforcement Memorial Association, testified about the critical financial support they receive from charitable gaming. For instance, Home Health and Hospice Care received $71,000 last year, directly funding patient care.

2. **Fingerprinting Requirement**: The bill proposes eliminating the annual fingerprinting requirement for individuals picking up charitable gaming checks, as it was deemed redundant and burdensome given existing background checks.

3. **Bet and Tournament Limits**: The bill seeks to increase the maximum bet limit from $10 to $25 and raise tournament buy-ins from $250 to $2,500 to remain competitive with neighboring states like Massachusetts, which have higher limits.

4. **Historic Horse Racing (HHR) Machines**: The bill proposes extending the exclusivity of HHR machines to the 14 existing licensed facilities beyond the July 1, 2024, deadline, preventing new facilities from offering HHR. These machines are a significant revenue source for charitable gaming.

5. **Licensing and Bond Requirements**: The bill would extend the licensing period for gaming employees from one year to three years and increase the bond requirement for facilities from $500,000 to $1 million.

6. **Revenue Sharing**: For table games, 35% of gross gaming revenue goes to charities, and 10% goes to the state. For HHR, 25% of the revenue is split, with 35% going to charities and 65% to the state.

7. **Concerns About Problem Gambling**: While there was broad support for the benefits of charitable gaming, some representatives raised concerns about potential increases in problem gambling due to higher wager limits. However, it was noted that sports betting poses a greater risk in this regard.

### **Taxation and Other Bills**
The committee also addressed several other bills related to taxation and regulatory updates:

1. **House Bill 288**: Proposed exempting sole proprietorships and single-member LLCs from the Business Profits Tax and Business Enterprise Tax. Concerns about a $36 million annual revenue loss and fairness issues led the committee to vote 20-0 to recommend "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), effectively killing the bill.

2. **House Bill 297**: Addressed the repeal of two defunct dedicated funds (Room and Board Scholarship Fund and Cold Case Unit Fund) and removed certain enterprise funds from the dedicated funds committee's review. The committee voted 20-0 to recommend "Ought to Pass" with an amendment.

3. **House Bill 569**: Proposed changes to the taxation and distribution of "swept" proceeds, modifications to the Low and Moderate-Income Homeowners Property Tax Relief Program, and a study on property taxes embedded in rent payments. Due to ongoing litigation, the committee voted 20-0 to retain the bill for further review.

4. **House Bill 220**: Aimed to establish a committee to study the regulatory structure of charitable gaming, citing the industry's rapid growth and complexity. The committee heard testimony supporting the need for continued oversight and fairness.

### **House Bill 510: Tax on Premium Cigars**
The committee discussed **House Bill 510**, which proposed taxing premium cigars at 65.03% of the wholesale price. Key points included:

1. **Testimony Against the Tax**: Curtis Berry, representing the Cigar Association of New Hampshire, argued that the tax would harm the state’s cigar industry, which relies heavily on out-of-state customers. He emphasized that premium cigars are made entirely of natural tobacco and are not addictive like other tobacco products.

2. **Economic Impact**: Berry noted that New Hampshire is one of only three states that do not tax premium cigars. Imposing a tax could lead to store closures, job losses, and a decline in revenue, as seen in Massachusetts.

3. **Consumer Behavior**: Most premium cigar sales are to out-of-state customers who purchase in bulk and store cigars for long-term use. If taxed, these customers would likely shift to online purchases, bypassing New Hampshire retailers.

4. **Health and Youth Access**: Berry argued that premium cigars are not a youth access issue, as the average age of first-time cigar smokers is 30. He also noted that cigar smoking is seasonal and not addictive.

5. **Fiscal Note**: The Department of Revenue Administration estimated the tax could generate $967,000 in revenue but acknowledged this figure does not account for potential sales declines.

### **House Bill 568: Education Funding Assessments**
The prime sponsor of **House Bill 568**, Representative Sanborn, requested the bill be withdrawn, stating it was not written as intended and the timing was not right for amendments. The committee unanimously voted to **ITL** the bill, effectively killing it, and placed the motion on the consent calendar.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on modernizing charitable gaming laws to enhance competitiveness, streamline operations, and ensure continued revenue for charities and the state. Concerns about problem gambling and the need for careful regulation were also highlighted. Additionally, the committee addressed taxation issues, with a strong emphasis on fairness and economic impact. The decision to **ITL House Bill 568** and the ongoing discussions on **House Bill 510** reflect the committee’s cautious approach to legislative changes with significant economic implications. The meeting concluded with procedural discussions, including the possibility of immediate executive sessions under new House rules.
