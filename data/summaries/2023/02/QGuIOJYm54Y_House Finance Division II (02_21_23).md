**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (02/21/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on February 21, 2023, covered a wide range of topics, focusing on education funding, transportation infrastructure, and budgetary challenges. The discussions highlighted efforts to address declining math proficiency, expand dual enrollment programs, and manage the state’s transportation funding amid inflationary pressures and declining revenue. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Education Funding and Programs**
1. **House Bill 419: Math Learning Communities Program**  
   - **Purpose**: To address declining math proficiency among New Hampshire students by continuing the Math Learning Communities program, which provides additional resources and support to high school students struggling with math.  
   - **Background**: The program, initially funded by a $200,000 grant, has been successful in helping students prepare for college-level math and reducing the need for remedial courses.  
   - **Request**: $200,000 in funding to cover materials, teacher training, and transportation for summer sessions.  
   - **Support**: The program has been effective in 37-38 high schools across the state, demonstrating measurable improvements in math skills.

2. **House Bill 420: Dual and Concurrent Enrollment Expansion**  
   - **Purpose**: To expand the dual enrollment program, allowing high school students to take up to five college-level courses per year, starting as early as grade 10, and including non-STEM courses.  
   - **Benefits**: The program helps students earn college credits while in high school, reducing future college debt and building confidence in various subjects.  
   - **Cost**: The program currently costs $1.5 million annually, with a proposed increase to $3.25 million to accommodate more students and courses.  
   - **Support**: The program has been highly successful, with some students graduating high school with nearly a year’s worth of college credits.

3. **House Bill 542: Academic Research and Data Analyst Position**  
   - **Purpose**: To hire a data analyst at the Department of Education to analyze student performance data, evaluate programs, and guide curriculum development and resource allocation.  
   - **Need**: The department currently lacks the capacity to deeply analyze test scores and provide actionable insights to schools, particularly smaller districts.  
   - **Cost**: $160,000 in the first year and $145,000 in the second year, with startup costs already covered.  
   - **Support**: The data analyst would help identify weaknesses in math and reading proficiency and improve overall educational outcomes.

4. **General Discussion on Education**  
   - **Math Proficiency**: Concerns were raised about declining math scores, exacerbated by the pandemic but rooted in pre-existing issues. There was a consensus on the need for better teacher training and curriculum alignment.  
   - **Dual Enrollment**: The program was praised for its success in helping students transition to college and reducing debt, with calls for further expansion.  
   - **Data Analysis**: The lack of detailed data analysis at the state level was identified as a barrier to improving education, with the proposed data analyst role seen as a critical step forward.

### **Transportation Funding and Infrastructure**
1. **Department of Transportation (DOT) Budget**  
   - **Overview**: The DOT presented its budget, which is primarily funded by the highway fund, federal funds, turnpike funds, and a small portion from the general fund.  
   - **Challenges**: Inflation has increased costs for bridge building and other infrastructure projects, reducing the number of projects that can be completed with available funds.  
   - **Turnpike Fund**: The turnpike system is an enterprise fund, with all revenue from tolls reinvested into the system. Despite a decline in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic, the system is recovering, though future growth in traffic volumes and revenue is expected to be modest.  
   - **Highway Fund**: The fund, supported by gas taxes and motor vehicle fees, faces challenges due to flat revenue projections, inflationary costs, and structural deficits. The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is further reducing gas tax revenue.

2. **Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Program**  
   - **Request**: The DOT sought funding for an additional UAS (drone) operator to enhance efficiency and reduce costs in infrastructure projects.  
   - **Benefits**: UAS technology offers significant cost savings and faster survey times compared to traditional methods.

3. **Transit Funding**  
   - **Need**: State matching funds are required to access additional federal transit funding. Without state support, municipalities risk losing federal dollars that could improve public transit services.

4. **Capital Projects and Delays**  
   - **Turnpike Fund Projects**: Key projects, including the replacement of the General Sullivan Bridge, the widening of the Epi Everett Turnpike, and the reconstruction of exits six and seven in Manchester, are being delayed due to flat revenue and increasing costs.  
   - **Exit 4A Project**: The project is progressing, with the first contract under construction and efforts underway to acquire property for the second contract.

5. **Toll Rates and Revenue**  
   - **Current Rates**: The last toll rate increase was in 2009, and New Hampshire has some of the lowest toll rates in the country.  
   - **Discussion**: Raising tolls to support capital projects has not advanced, despite the financial pressures on the Turnpike Fund.

6. **Winter Maintenance and Fleet Investment**  
   - **Winter Maintenance**: The DOT has historically underfunded winter maintenance, leading to frequent requests for additional funds. Inflationary pressures on salt, fuel, and other materials are expected to strain the budget further.  
   - **Fleet Investment**: Continued investment in the DOT’s fleet is necessary to maintain operations. Underfunding fleet maintenance could lead to higher long-term costs.

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Bedford Toll Plaza Relocation**  
   - There are no plans to relocate the Bedford toll plaza further south due to restrictions on the use of federal funds for that section of the turnpike.

2. **Manchester Airport Access**  
   - The routing to Manchester Airport was designed decades ago to alleviate congestion around Brown Avenue, accommodating the growth of the airport.

3. **Budget Satisfaction**  
   - The committee expressed satisfaction with the current budget, noting that most programs were covered without cuts. However, they acknowledged potential future needs due to inflationary impacts and committed to addressing them as necessary.

### **Long-Term Challenges**
- **Declining Revenue**: Both the Highway Fund and Turnpike Fund face long-term challenges due to flat revenue projections, inflationary costs, and the impact of EVs on gas tax revenue.  
- **Equitable Road User Fees**: There is a need for equitable road user fees to ensure all drivers, including EV owners, contribute to road maintenance costs.  
- **Strategic Planning**: The DOT emphasized the importance of strategic planning to manage the state’s transportation infrastructure effectively and address delayed projects.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for continued investment in education and transportation infrastructure to address pressing challenges. While the committee expressed satisfaction with the current budget, they acknowledged the long-term financial pressures and committed to finding solutions to ensure the state’s educational and transportation systems remain effective and sustainable. Collaboration and strategic planning were emphasized as key to navigating the budgetary and infrastructural challenges ahead.
