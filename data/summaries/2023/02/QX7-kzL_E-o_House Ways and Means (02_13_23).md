The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on February 13, 2023, focused on a wide range of topics related to state revenues, tax administration, and upcoming legislative activities. The meeting was structured around three main segments, each addressing specific aspects of the state's financial and tax systems.

### Upcoming Activities and Revenue Estimates

The committee discussed several upcoming meetings and presentations critical to their work. On February 14th, the governor was scheduled to present revenue estimates for 2023, 2024, and 2025 in an executive summary format, including historical data and future projections. The committee planned to review these estimates starting February 16th, with a comprehensive document summarizing planned revenues, actual revenues, and agency estimates. Additionally, on February 28th, Employment Security would provide an update on workforce trends and issues.

### Detailed Tax Discussions

The committee delved into various state taxes and revenue streams, including:

1. **Interest and Dividends Tax**: Currently at 4% (down from 5%), this tax is set to be repealed by January 1, 2027. It applies to residents, fiduciaries, LLCs, partnerships, and associations with income from interest and dividends. The committee noted an upward trend in revenue, with a slight dip in fiscal year 2021 likely due to increased dividend payouts.

2. **Medicaid Enhancement Tax (MET)**: A 5.4% tax on net patient service revenue of hospitals, used to draw down federal Medicaid matching funds. The tax has been increasing steadily, with a dip in fiscal year 2021 due to reduced elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Nursing Facility Quality Assessment (NFQA)**: A 5.5% tax on net patient revenues of nursing facilities and specialty hospitals, deposited into the Nursing Facility Trust Fund.

4. **Utility Property Tax (UPT) and Railroad Tax**: Property taxes assessed based on market value, with UPT revenues showing a sawtooth pattern due to available credits.

5. **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)**: Assessed on all real property except utility and railroad properties, set to generate $363 million annually, though reduced to $263 million for fiscal year 2023 using surplus funds.

### Revenue Information Management System (RIMS)

The committee highlighted the successful implementation of RIMS, which replaced the outdated TIMS system. RIMS has improved tax administration efficiency, enhanced data use, and improved taxpayer interactions through features like the Granite Tax Connect portal. The system was implemented in three phases, completed on time and within budget despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Other Key Discussions

1. **Tax Assessment and Reevaluations**: Municipalities are required to conduct full property reevaluations every five years, with some opting for more frequent assessments. Compliance is monitored to meet legal standards.

2. **Litigation on Excess Revenue**: A lawsuit is underway concerning whether municipalities can retain excess revenue collected above adequacy standards, with a briefing expected to conclude by early March.

3. **Excavation and Timber Taxes**: Local taxes managed with state assistance, with specific rates and administration discussed.

4. **Revenue Timing and Trends**: The committee reviewed when different tax revenues are collected throughout the year, with notable peaks in September, December, March, April, and June.

5. **Impact of Federal Policies**: The committee discussed the impact of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on state revenues, particularly the deemed repatriation of foreign profits influencing dividend and interest distributions.

### Schedule and Logistics

The committee outlined their schedule for the week, including a House session on Tuesday, public hearings on Wednesday, and a return to revenue estimates on Thursday. Breakfast and caucus meetings were also noted for Tuesday before the session.

### Overall Focus

The meeting emphasized the importance of accurate tax administration, the benefits of the new RIMS system, and the ongoing process of revenue estimation and legislative review. The committee members sought clarifications on various aspects of the taxes, including their impact on consumers, the accuracy of revenue estimates, and the implications of federal tax changes on state revenues. The discussion also included considerations of potential litigation and its effects on tax assessments and revenues.
