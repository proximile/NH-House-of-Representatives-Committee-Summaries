The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on Housing meeting on February 17, 2023, addressed the state’s ongoing housing crisis, focusing on challenges, potential solutions, and policy recommendations. The discussion highlighted the complexity of affordable housing development, regulatory barriers, and the need for a multi-faceted approach to increase housing supply and affordability. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key points:

### **Affordable Housing Challenges and Programs**
1. **Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program**: The primary affordable housing program in New Hampshire, administered by HUD and New Hampshire Housing, provides tax credits to developers who sell them to equity investors. This funds the construction of rental properties with rates based on area median income. However, managing these properties requires specialized expertise, certifications, and compliance with rigorous oversight, including annual inspections and financial audits.
2. **Section 8 Voucher Program**: While the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program helps low-income tenants pay rent, finding landlords who accept vouchers is challenging. Streamlining the inspection process and reducing bureaucratic hurdles for landlords were suggested to improve participation.
3. **Cost of Managing Affordable Housing**: Managing affordable housing is more expensive than market-rate housing due to compliance, maintenance, and staffing needs. The lack of competition in management services further increases costs.

### **Development Barriers and Solutions**
1. **Zoning and Land Use Issues**: Restrictive zoning practices, such as large lot size requirements, density restrictions, and lengthy permitting processes, hinder affordable housing development. Towns like Hanover and Windham were cited as examples of municipalities with restrictive zoning.
2. **Mini Flats and Micro Units**: These small, well-appointed units with shared spaces were proposed as a cost-effective solution for urban areas, though they may not be suitable for long-term living for everyone.
3. **Labor and Construction Costs**: Labor shortages and high construction costs are significant barriers. Suggestions included streamlining trade licensing and attracting skilled workers to New Hampshire.
4. **Inspection Process**: Multiple inspections for different funding sources (e.g., low-income insurance, tax credits) create inefficiencies. Streamlining inspections was recommended to reduce costs and delays.
5. **Fire Department Requirements**: Fire departments often impose additional safety requirements after planning board approvals, leading to significant cost increases and project delays.

### **Market Trends and Housing Supply**
1. **Inventory Crisis**: New Hampshire faces a severe housing shortage, with only 1,300 homes for sale in January 2023 compared to 5,000 five years prior. The supply is critically low, with only 1.1 months of supply available.
2. **Rising Home Prices**: The median home price surged from $300,000 in 2019 to $460,000 in 2022, outpacing inflation and making homeownership increasingly unaffordable. Multi-family housing prices have also risen significantly.
3. **Corporate Buyers**: While corporate buyers represent only 4% of single-family home purchases, they contribute to the competitive market. Most buyers are local, but there is a small increase in out-of-state buyers, particularly from Massachusetts.
4. **Population Growth and Housing Costs**: New Hampshire’s population growth has slowed since the 1970s, partly due to rising living costs. Towns with high demand and population growth often adopt stricter zoning ordinances, limiting housing supply.

### **Policy and Advocacy Efforts**
1. **Legislative and Regulatory Improvements**: The committee discussed reducing regulatory burdens, streamlining inspections, and incentivizing landlords to participate in affordable housing programs. State-level action was recommended to address local control issues hindering housing development.
2. **Workforce Housing Law and ADUs**: Municipalities must allow reasonable opportunities for workforce housing and accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in areas where single-family homes are allowed. These mandates are steps in the right direction but need broader implementation.
3. **New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority (NHHFA)**: NHHFA plays a key role in financing affordable housing, administering federal programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and managing housing choice vouchers. The Invest NH Municipal Planning and Zoning Grant Program aims to make local regulations more housing-friendly.
4. **Community Engagement**: Grants are being provided to municipalities to encourage regulatory changes that facilitate housing development. Community engagement is crucial for changing local zoning regulations.

### **Innovative Housing Solutions**
1. **Manufactured Housing**: Manufactured homes were explored as an affordable housing option, though zoning regulations often restrict their placement.
2. **Harmony Homes Initiative**: Harmony Homes built 43 small rental units for employees in Durham and Dover to address housing affordability issues. This project, developed in cooperation with the city of Dover, is nearing completion.

### **Data and Research**
1. **Rental Market Data**: New Hampshire Housing’s annual rental cost survey shows rental costs have been rising since 1995, with a significant acceleration post-2020. Vacancy rates are extremely low, indicating a severe housing shortage.
2. **Zoning Atlas Project**: The New Hampshire Zoning Atlas, set to be released soon, maps where different housing types are allowed. Key findings include:
   - Only 13% of buildable land allows small-lot single-family homes.
   - 10% allows duplexes on small lots.
   - Five-family structures are allowed in some rural areas.
   - Most land allows manufactured housing and large ADUs, reflecting state mandates.

### **Call to Action**
The meeting concluded with a call for comprehensive solutions, including legislative support for increased housing density, streamlined permitting processes, and incentives for developers. The committee emphasized the importance of balancing local control with the need for statewide housing solutions. Collaboration between state agencies, municipalities, and developers is essential to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis effectively.

Overall, the meeting underscored the urgent need for regulatory reforms, innovative housing solutions, and coordinated efforts to increase housing supply and affordability in New Hampshire.
