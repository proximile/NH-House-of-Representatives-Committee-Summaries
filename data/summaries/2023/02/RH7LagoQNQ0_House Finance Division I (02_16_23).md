The meeting emphasized the importance of maintaining efficient and effective government services, addressing staffing challenges, and ensuring fiscal responsibility. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics discussed:

---

### **1. Insurance Department Operations and Budget**
- **Role and Responsibilities**: The Insurance Department regulates over 1,300 insurance companies and 200,000 licensed insurance producers, focusing on consumer protection through rate approval, financial oversight, and fraud investigations. It handles consumer complaints with a 90% satisfaction rate and actively investigates insurance fraud, including scams related to health sharing ministries.
- **Budget and Funding**: The department is self-funded, with a $39 million budget derived from insurance premiums, taxes, and fees. It collects nearly $140 million annually for the state. The proposed budget increased from $11 million to $14 million, with a focus on retaining in-house expertise rather than outsourcing. The department requested three new junior examiner positions to address staff turnover.
- **Key Initiatives**: The department is upgrading its technology infrastructure, including cybersecurity measures and vehicle replacements. It also operates healthcost.gov, a leading health cost transparency website, and conducts annual hearings on health insurance market trends.

### **2. Tax Appeals Board**
- **Operations**: The board handles property tax appeals and eminent domain cases, processing around 400 appeals annually with a low appeal rate to the Supreme Court.

### **3. Department of Employment Security**
- **Budget and Staffing**: The department’s budget is heavily reliant on federal grants, particularly for the unemployment insurance program. It has 293 authorized positions, with 262 filled and 55 vacant. Historically, some positions are left unfilled to allow flexibility during economic downturns.
- **Unemployment Trust Fund**: The fund has grown significantly since the pandemic, from $310 million to $360 million, due to increased employer contributions from 9,000 new employers since 2020. Unemployment insurance tax rates for employers are adjusted based on the fund’s balance.
- **Fraud Prevention**: The department collaborates with the Attorney General’s office to prosecute unemployment fraud, particularly identity theft-related fraud during the pandemic.
- **Benefit Payments**: Unemployment benefits are calculated based on earnings during a base period, with a maximum weekly benefit of $427. The department also reviewed historical reforms to the unemployment insurance system.

### **4. New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**
- **Overview and Progress**: NHRS has made significant operational improvements over the past decade, with over 48,500 active members and 42,000 retirees. It has achieved an average annual net return of 8.5% over the last 10 years, despite a negative return in FY 2022.
- **Budget and Funding**: NHRS’s administrative budget is self-funded, with a FY 2023 budget of $12.2 million, increasing to $13.6 million in FY 2025. The budget includes costs for staffing, IT upgrades, and a pension system software upgrade project, which is 73% complete.
- **Unfunded Liability**: NHRS has a significant unfunded actuarial liability, with 16 years remaining on the payoff plan established in 2007. Employer contribution rates will decrease in FY 2024-25 due to strong investment performance.
- **Pension Benefits**: NHRS provides modest pension benefits, with an average annual pension of $21,800. Nearly two-thirds of retirees receive less than $25,000 per year.

### **5. Executive Council Budget and Stipends**
- **Budget**: The Executive Council’s budget includes venue fees for meetings held outside the State House and stipends for council members, which have not been adjusted since 2010. There was consideration of raising stipends for certain districts due to changes in district boundaries.
