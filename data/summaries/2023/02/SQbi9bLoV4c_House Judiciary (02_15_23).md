The February 15, 2023, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee centered on several key pieces of legislation related to reproductive rights, particularly **CACR-2**, a proposed constitutional amendment to protect reproductive freedom, and three bills (**HB 271**, **HB 88**, and **HB 224**) addressing abortion access and penalties under the state’s **Fetal Life Protection Act (FLPA)**. The discussions were deeply polarized, reflecting national tensions over abortion rights, healthcare access, and the role of government in reproductive decisions. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key themes, arguments, and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **CACR-2: Constitutional Amendment to Protect Reproductive Rights**
1. **Purpose**: CACR-2 seeks to enshrine reproductive rights, including abortion, in the New Hampshire Constitution, ensuring individuals can make personal reproductive decisions without undue government interference. It would require any government limitations on reproductive rights to meet a strict scrutiny standard.
2. **Support**:
   - Proponents argued that reproductive freedom is essential for bodily autonomy, gender equality, and healthcare access. They emphasized the need for constitutional protections in light of the Supreme Court’s overturning of *Roe v. Wade*.
   - Personal testimonies highlighted the life-saving importance of abortion access, particularly in cases of life-threatening pregnancies or fetal anomalies.
   - Supporters stressed that CACR-2 would allow New Hampshire voters to decide the issue directly, reflecting the state’s values of personal freedom and privacy.
3. **Opposition**:
   - Critics contended that the amendment would undermine protections for fetal life, eliminate safeguards like informed consent and parental involvement laws, and infringe on healthcare providers’ conscience rights.
   - Some argued that the amendment’s broad language could lead to unintended consequences, such as unrestricted abortion access at any stage of pregnancy.
4. **Conclusion**: The debate underscored the deeply personal and polarizing nature of reproductive rights, with supporters framing CACR-2 as a necessary protection for individual freedom and opponents expressing concerns about its impact on women’s safety and healthcare regulation.

### **HB 271: Repeal of the Fetal Life Protection Act**
1. **Purpose**: HB 271 seeks to repeal the FLPA, which restricts abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for the life or health of the mother and fatal fetal diagnoses.
2. **Support**:
   - Advocates argued that the FLPA creates barriers to necessary medical care, particularly for women facing complex or life-threatening pregnancies. They emphasized the importance of trusting medical professionals to make decisions without government interference.
   - Personal stories highlighted the emotional and financial burdens of terminating pregnancies due to fatal fetal anomalies.
   - Supporters noted that late-term abortions are rare and typically performed only in cases of severe medical necessity.
3. **Opposition**:
   - Opponents argued that the FLPA protects unborn children, particularly after 24 weeks when a fetus is considered viable. They raised concerns about the health risks of late-term abortions and the moral implications of unrestricted access.
   - Critics contended that repealing the law would put New Hampshire out of step with the majority of the country, which supports restrictions on late-term abortions.
4. **Conclusion**: The debate highlighted deep divisions over abortion policy, with supporters emphasizing reproductive rights and medical autonomy, while opponents stressed the protection of fetal life and public health.

### **HB 88: Access to Abortion Care Act**
1. **Purpose**: HB 88 aims to codify the right to abortion in New Hampshire state law up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, providing legal clarity and protection in the wake of *Roe v. Wade* being overturned.
2. **Support**:
   - Advocates argued that New Hampshire is the only state in New England without explicit abortion protections, leaving residents vulnerable to future restrictions.
   - Supporters emphasized that abortion is a safe medical procedure and essential for women’s autonomy, economic stability, and workforce participation.
   - Testimonies from healthcare providers, clergy, and advocates highlighted the importance of ensuring access to abortion care.
3. **Opposition**:
   - Critics argued that the bill undermines protections for human life and could interfere with future legislative efforts to regulate abortion.
   - Some raised concerns about the bill’s potential to conflict with existing laws and the need for a constitutional amendment rather than statutory changes.
4. **Conclusion**: The discussion reflected the urgency of addressing legal uncertainty surrounding abortion access in New Hampshire, with supporters advocating for statutory protections and opponents raising ethical and procedural concerns.

### **HB 224: Repeal of Criminal Penalties Under the Fetal Life Protection Act**
1. **Purpose**: HB 224 seeks to remove criminal and civil penalties for performing abortions after 24 weeks, which include felony charges, up to seven years in prison, and a $100,000 fine.
2. **Support**:
   - Medical professionals testified that the FLPA’s penalties create fear and uncertainty, hindering their ability to provide compassionate, life-saving care, particularly in complex cases like fetal anomalies or maternal health risks.
   - Supporters highlighted the state’s healthcare workforce crisis, arguing that criminal penalties deter obstetricians and gynecologists from practicing in New Hampshire.
   - Advocates stressed that patients trust their doctors to make sound medical decisions and that the state should not interfere by criminalizing providers.
3. **Opposition**:
   - Opponents argued that removing penalties would undermine the state’s responsibility to protect unborn children, particularly after 24 weeks when they are considered viable.
   - Critics emphasized the moral and ethical imperative to protect life, sharing personal stories of individuals born prematurely or with disabilities.
   - Some raised concerns about the psychological and physical harm to women from abortions and the potential for removing penalties to allow abortions up to birth.
4. **Conclusion**: The debate reflected deep divisions over abortion rights, healthcare access, and the moral implications of terminating pregnancies, with supporters advocating for the removal of penalties to protect providers and patients, while opponents stressed the need to protect fetal life and maintain legal accountability.

### **Key Themes Across All Discussions**

2. **Healthcare Access and Workforce Concerns**: Medical professionals highlighted the chilling effect of abortion restrictions and penalties on healthcare delivery, particularly in rural areas and for maternal-fetal medicine specialists.
3. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: Opponents of abortion access framed the issue as a matter of protecting human life, particularly in late-term pregnancies, and emphasized the sanctity of life from conception.
4. **Legal Uncertainty and Public Input**: Both sides acknowledged the current legal uncertainty in New Hampshire, with supporters advocating for statutory or constitutional protections and opponents stressing the need for restrictions and public accountability.
