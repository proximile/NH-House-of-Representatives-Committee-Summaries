The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 1, 2023, focused on a range of bills related to municipal and county government, addressing issues such as property taxes, waste management, environmental protection, and public safety. Here is a comprehensive summary of the discussions across all segments:

### **Property Tax and Assessment Reforms**
- **HB 202 - Property Tax Revaluation and Ratios**: This bill addressed the process of property tax revaluation and the use of equalization ratios in tax appeals. Representatives debated the fairness of using prior year ratios in revaluation years, particularly in fluctuating markets. The bill aimed to address inequities in the abatement process, ensuring proportionality and fairness for taxpayers. Concerns were raised about the potential for over- or under-abating taxes, with expert testimony both supporting and opposing the bill.
- **HB 237 - Property Tax Exemptions for Disabled and Elderly**: Introduced by Representative Diane Power, this bill sought to standardize the date (December 31st of the prior year) for evaluating assets when determining eligibility for property tax exemptions for disabled, deaf, severely hearing impaired, and elderly individuals. The bill aimed to address inconsistencies across municipalities and align with financial institutions' reporting practices.

### **Waste Management and Environmental Issues**
- **HB 204 and HB 226 - Single-Use Packaging Waste**: These bills focused on regulating single-use packaging waste, particularly plastic bags, and returning regulatory authority to municipalities. Supporters, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, argued for local control to address waste management challenges, while opponents, such as the New Hampshire Grocers Association and the American Recyclable Plastic Bag Alliance, warned of increased costs and inconsistent regulations. The discussion highlighted the environmental and financial impacts of plastic waste, with comparisons to neighboring states that have implemented bans.
- **HB 300 - Food Waste Disposal Ban**: This bill aimed to establish a food waste disposal ban in New Hampshire, encouraging composting and anaerobic digestion infrastructure to reduce landfill waste.
- **HB 273 - Composting and Waste Recycling in Public Housing**: This bill would require composting and waste recycling services to be made available to residents of public housing, addressing waste management in public housing developments.

### **Condominium Conversions and Septic System Regulations**
- **HB 236 - Condominium Conversions and Septic Systems**: This bill sought to clarify that condominium conversions should not be subject to subdivision regulations or site plan reviews unless there is a change in land use or septic system load. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) opposed the bill, arguing it would weaken protections for water quality and public health by allowing outdated septic systems to remain in use. Supporters, including Representative Faulkner, argued that ownership changes alone should not trigger regulatory oversight.

### **Tourism Development and Economic Initiatives**
- **HB 489 - Tourism Development Funding**: This bill, introduced by Representative Aaron, aimed to expand the existing Joint Promotional Program (JPP) by adding an Operational Support Program to provide grants to counties for tourism development. The program seeks to support local businesses, grow the tax base, and increase state revenue by addressing the current lack of funding for county tourism initiatives.

### **Public Safety and Fire Suppression Systems**
- **HB 265 - Tax Relief for Fire Suppression Systems**: Inspired by recent fires in North Conway and Wolfeboro, this bill aimed to provide tax relief to property owners who install fire suppression systems in older buildings. Fire Chief Tom Zotti testified in favor, highlighting the effectiveness of sprinkler systems in reducing fire deaths, injuries, and property damage. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on municipal resources and the subjective nature of tax relief decisions.

### **Key Themes**
- **Local Control vs. Uniformity**: Debates over waste management and tourism funding highlighted tensions between local autonomy and the need for consistent statewide regulations.
- **Environmental Protection**: Bills addressing waste management, septic systems, and composting reflected a strong focus on environmental sustainability and public health.
- **Economic Considerations**: Discussions on property tax reforms, tourism funding, and fire suppression systems emphasized the financial impact on municipalities, property owners, and businesses.
- **Public Safety**: The need for improved fire safety in older buildings was a key concern, with proposals for tax relief to encourage the installation of fire suppression systems.

Overall, the meeting underscored the challenges of balancing local control, environmental protection, economic considerations, and public safety in crafting effective legislation. The discussions reflected a commitment to addressing these issues through careful policy design and stakeholder collaboration.
