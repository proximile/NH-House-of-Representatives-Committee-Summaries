**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services (02/16/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on February 16, 2023, to discuss a range of bills and issues impacting labor, safety, and employment in the state. The meeting featured extensive debates, amendments, and recommendations, focusing on collective bargaining, youth employment, safety standards, volunteer protections, and the therapeutic cannabis program. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Collective Bargaining and Employment Issues**
- **Lowering Threshold for Collective Bargaining Units**: The committee debated reducing the minimum number of employees required to form a collective bargaining unit from 10 to 5. Proponents argued it would empower more workers, while opponents raised concerns about increased costs and administrative burdens for small organizations.
- **House Bill 241**: This bill aimed to expand collective bargaining opportunities for school district employees. The committee unanimously recommended it as **inexpedient to legislate**, citing existing processes as sufficient to resolve disputes.
- **House Bill 410**: Addressing municipal ranking lists for promotions to prevent nepotism, the committee voted **12-8** to recommend the bill as **inexpedient to legislate**, favoring local solutions and collective bargaining over statewide mandates.

### **2. Youth Employment and Labor Protections**
- **House Bill 125**: Discussions centered on youth employment during the school year and at night. Representatives debated appropriate cutoff times for work hours, balancing parental responsibility, student well-being, and business needs. Amendments were proposed to clarify language, particularly around midnight work hours on weekends.
- **House Bill 182**: This bill sought to protect volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel from being fired for responding to emergencies. The committee delayed the vote to work on amendments, such as adding a minimum employee threshold for businesses and allowing employer discretion in cases of abuse. Concerns about the impact on small businesses were highlighted.

### **3. Safety Standards and OSHA Compliance**
- **OSHA 1910 Standards**: The committee discussed implementing OSHA 1910 safety standards for public employers. While New Hampshire already enforces safety standards, OSHA 1910 would formalize and clarify them. Concerns were raised about costs under RSA 28a, which prohibits unfunded mandates. The Department of Labor emphasized a focus on remediation and education rather than punitive enforcement.
- **Cost and Implementation**: Small municipalities and state agencies expressed concerns about the financial burden of compliance. Suggestions included a 12-month lead-in period for education and potential state funding to offset costs. Maine’s experience with OSHA standards, which leveraged federal funding, was cited as a positive example.
- **Workers’ Compensation and Safety Programs**: The historical context of workers’ compensation reforms in New Hampshire was discussed, emphasizing the long-term cost savings of comprehensive safety programs.

### **4. Emerging Issues: Long COVID and Workforce Accommodations**
- **House Bill 561**: This bill proposed establishing a committee to examine workforce and school accommodations for individuals with long-term COVID-19 and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The committee voted **12-8** to recommend it as **inexpedient to legislate**, citing existing disability laws and the broader scope of the issue.

---

### **5. Therapeutic Cannabis Program and Employment**
- **Protections for Cannabis Patients**: Discussions focused on protecting employees in the therapeutic cannabis program from being fired solely based on a positive THC test or program participation, provided they are not impaired at work. Existing law prohibits workplace use without employer permission and prohibits impairment during work hours.
- **Impairment vs. THC Presence**: A significant challenge is the lack of standardized tests to measure cannabis impairment. Current drug tests detect THC presence but not impairment, leading to potential unfairness in employment decisions.
- **Federal vs. State Law**: The bill included provisions to avoid conflicts with federal laws, particularly in industries like transportation, healthcare, and federal contracting, where drug testing is mandatory.
- **Employer Concerns**: Employers raised concerns about liability, insurance, and workplace safety, especially in high-risk industries. The bill sought to balance employee protections with employer flexibility to address impairment.
- **Patient Population**: The program serves approximately 14,000 patients, many of whom are elderly or unable to work due to health issues. Some patients have returned to work after using therapeutic cannabis to manage pain or other conditions.

### **6. Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Local Solutions and Collective Bargaining**: The committee emphasized the importance of local solutions and collective bargaining over statewide mandates, particularly in addressing issues like nepotism and volunteer protections.
- **Balancing Interests**: Discussions consistently highlighted the need to balance the interests of workers, employers, and taxpayers, particularly in areas like youth employment, safety standards, and cannabis use.
- **Cost Concerns**: Financial implications were a recurring theme, with small municipalities and businesses expressing concerns about the costs of compliance with new standards and regulations.
- **Education and Remediation**: The committee favored educational and remediation-focused approaches over punitive measures, particularly in implementing safety standards and addressing workplace cannabis use.
- **Future Considerations**: The need for clearer guidance, potential carve-outs for specific industries, and further legislative action to address emerging issues like long COVID and cannabis impairment were acknowledged.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of crafting legislation that balances worker protections, employer concerns, and public safety. While some bills were recommended as **inexpedient to legislate**, the discussions laid the groundwork for potential amendments and future action on critical issues like OSHA compliance, volunteer protections, and the therapeutic cannabis program. The committee emphasized the importance of clear, fair, and practical legislation that addresses the needs of all stakeholders in New Hampshire’s labor and industrial landscape.
