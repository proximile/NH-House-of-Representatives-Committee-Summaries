The NH House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 21, 2023, focused on the operations, challenges, and strategic initiatives of the **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**, as well as discussions on the **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB)** and the **Employee Assistance Program (EAP)**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all segments:

---

### **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**

#### **Licensing and Regulatory Services**
1. **Child Care Licensing**: Ensures licensing and compliance of child care centers (center-based, family-based, and residential) with health and safety regulations, including federal criminal background checks. Recreational camps, previously under the Department of Environmental Services, are now under DHHS.
2. **Health Facilities Administration**: Licenses and certifies health facilities, including assisted living and adult day care centers, ensuring compliance with Medicare and Medicaid regulations.
3. **Community Residences**: Certifies residences for individuals with developmental disabilities or acquired brain disorders, ensuring compliance with health and safety standards to receive state funding.

#### **Challenges in Child Care Licensing**
- Workforce shortages due to insufficient child care availability.
- Federal background check requirements are a significant barrier to onboarding staff.

#### **Legal Services**
1. **General Counsel**: Provides legal representation for the department in court and administrative forums, advises on audits, federal compliance, and state laws.
2. **Administrative Appeals Unit (AAU)**: Handles appeals related to departmental decisions.

#### **Budget and Organizational Structure**
1. **Budget Overview**: Nathan White, Chief Financial Officer, discussed the department's financial operations, emphasizing the connection between operational functions and budget accounts.
2. **Organizational Changes**: Centralized finance and contracting functions to improve efficiency, including moving the rate-setting team from Medicaid to finance and converting temporary positions to permanent ones.
3. **Contracting and Procurement**: Streamlined processes using DocuSign and a contract lifecycle management system, significantly reducing contract processing times.
4. **Vacancies and Staffing Challenges**: The department faces a 20% vacancy rate, with concerns about retirements and loss of institutional knowledge. The governor’s proposed 10% salary increase may help, but targeted increases were suggested for greater effectiveness.

#### **Human Resources and Employee Support**
1. **Recruitment and Retention**: Focused on improving recruitment, retention, and employee engagement, including better tracking of employee data and professional development.
2. **Employee Assistance Program (EAP)**: Provides confidential support to state employees and their families. The program is rebranding to emphasize wellness and retention, with a new data management system to track trends without compromising privacy.

#### **Other Key Issues**
1. **Long-Term Care Ombudsman Office**: Discussed federal support and necessity, noting increased caseloads due to better tracking and pandemic-related visitation issues.
2. **HIPAA Compliance**: All incidents are logged and investigated, with a privacy governance board anticipated.
3. **Litigation and Legal Bureau**: Active litigation cases, overseen by the Attorney General’s office, impact the department’s legal operations.
4. **Federal Vaccine Mandate**: All employees at Glencliff Hospital and New Hampshire Hospital are in compliance, either through vaccination or exemptions.

### **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB)**

#### **Mission and Goals**
- The PDAB aims to improve transparency and reduce prescription drug costs, with concrete strategies expected in years three or four.
- The board focuses on public payers, such as school districts and state employees, who currently use different Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), leading to inefficiencies.

#### **Budget Proposal**
- Requests funding for an executive director ($118,000), an administrative assistant ($45,000), and contract services ($133,500) for data analysis, legal services, and subscriptions to Medi-Span.
- A dedicated fund is proposed for voluntary contributions from stakeholders.

#### **Concerns and Amendments**
- Concerns about the constitutionality of the PDAB’s fee structure and authority to issue fines.
- House Bill 130 proposes eliminating the fee structure and funding the PDAB through general funds.
- House Bill 172 suggests pausing the PDAB’s fee authority to assess redundancies and best practices.

#### **Stakeholder Feedback**
- Pharmaceutical manufacturers raised concerns about data confidentiality but not fees.
- AARP and New Futures support the PDAB’s mission, while wholesalers and distributors raised constitutional concerns.

#### **Next Steps**
- The committee plans to revisit the PDAB’s budget and proposed amendments during discussions on House Bill 2 (HB2).

### **Employee Assistance Program (EAP)**

#### **Rebranding and Support**
- The EAP is rebranding to be seen as a supportive resource for employees, not just a crisis intervention service, focusing on wellness and retention.

#### **Confidentiality and Data Management**
- Emphasizes confidentiality while implementing a new data management system to track trends and challenges within state agencies.

#### **Impact on Workforce Wellness**
- Crucial for maintaining workforce morale and productivity, with a focus on creating healthy workplaces for state employees and managers.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**
1. **Staffing and Vacancies**: Significant staffing challenges across DHHS, with a 19.6% vacancy rate. Efforts to recruit and retain staff include salary increases and improved HR initiatives.
2. **Federal Compliance**: Ongoing efforts to comply with federal mandates, including HIPAA and vaccine requirements.
3. **Budget and Efficiency**: Centralized finance and procurement processes, along with IT initiatives like a budget business intelligence tool, aim to improve financial reporting and forecasting.
4. **Transparency and Cost Reduction**: The PDAB’s mission to reduce prescription drug costs and improve transparency remains a priority, though funding mechanisms are contentious.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted DHHS’s efforts to address staffing shortages, improve operational efficiency, and ensure compliance with federal mandates.
