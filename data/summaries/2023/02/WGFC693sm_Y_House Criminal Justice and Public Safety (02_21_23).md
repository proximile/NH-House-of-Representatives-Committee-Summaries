**New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting Summary (February 21, 2023)**

On February 21, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held a meeting to discuss three key bills: **House Bill (HB) 107**, **HB 113**, and **HB 305**. The discussions focused on closing legal loopholes, reforming law enforcement fitness requirements, and amending firearm sanctuary laws. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **HB 107: Closing Loopholes in Employment Restrictions for Registered Sex Offenders**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to prevent registered sex offenders from working in positions where they supervise or have direct contact with minors, addressing a loophole in current law.
- **Key Points**:
  - An amendment clarified language to ensure offenders cannot work in roles involving direct supervision of minors or in environments predominantly serving minors.
  - Law enforcement representatives highlighted gaps, such as offenders convicted of crimes like online luring not being explicitly covered under current restrictions.
  - The bill is expected to be retroactive, requiring offenders currently in restricted roles to leave those positions upon enactment.
- **Outcome**: The subcommittee voted 3-2 to adopt the amendment and recommended the bill **"Ought to Pass" (OTP)**. The bill will now move to the full committee for further consideration.

### **HB 113: Reforming Physical Fitness Requirements for Law Enforcement Officers**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses challenges in recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers, particularly in smaller communities, by reforming physical fitness performance requirements.
- **Key Points**:
  - Representative Michael Abbott argued that the current fitness test is a barrier to retaining officers, especially as they age, and cited competition from better-paying jobs in neighboring states.
  - Representative Muse proposed an alternative to repealing the fitness requirement: allowing officers to participate in annual wellness programs instead of a mandatory fitness test.
  - John Skippa, Director of Police Standards and Training, acknowledged the need for reform, suggesting that alternative tests better reflect the functional demands of police work.
- **Outcome**: The subcommittee voted 3-2 in favor of **"ought to pass,"** recommending the bill to the full committee for further consideration.

### **HB 305: Amending New Hampshire’s Firearm Sanctuary Law**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to limit local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal authorities to cases involving **Class A felonies** (e.g., murder, violent assault, sexual crimes) rather than any federal law violation.
- **Key Points**:
  - Representative Tom Manion argued that the current law’s broad language undermines the intent of the original firearm sanctuary law and proposed narrowing exceptions to serious, violent crimes.
  - The committee debated whether **Class B felonies** (e.g., theft, minor drug offenses) should also be included, with Manion maintaining that only Class A felonies warrant local law enforcement’s involvement.
- **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on HB 305 during this session but highlighted ongoing concerns about balancing state sovereignty and public safety. Discussions will continue to refine the bill based on stakeholder input.

### **Overall Themes**
- **HB 107**: Focused on protecting minors by closing loopholes in employment restrictions for registered sex offenders.
- **HB 113**: Aimed at improving officer retention by reforming physical fitness requirements and promoting wellness programs.
- **HB 305**: Sought to strengthen New Hampshire’s firearm sanctuary law by limiting local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal authorities to serious crimes.

The meeting concluded with plans to continue refining the bills based on committee discussions and stakeholder input. HB 107 and HB 113 were recommended to move forward, while HB 305 remains under review.
