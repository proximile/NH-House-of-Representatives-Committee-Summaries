The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 16, 2023, covered a range of significant legislative topics, focusing on government transparency, accessibility, civic engagement, and demographic trends. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Proprietary Software and Government Interactions (Segments 1 & 2)**
The meeting addressed **House Bill 617**, titled "An Act Prohibiting, with Limited Exceptions, Agencies from Requiring Use of Proprietary Software in Interactions with the Public." The bill, part of the broader "SOFTWARE Act" initiative, aims to ensure that citizens are not forced to use proprietary software when interacting with government agencies. Key points included:
- **Intent**: The bill seeks to provide alternatives such as free or open-source software (FOSS) for public interactions, emphasizing privacy, independence, and the ability to modify software without corporate oversight.
- **Examples**: Testifiers highlighted situations where proprietary software is currently required, such as using Zoom for remote court appearances or Adobe Reader for submitting government forms.
- **Fiscal Note Concerns**: The fiscal note was criticized for being based on incorrect assumptions, as the bill does not require replacing existing government software but rather ensuring open standards.
- **Security and Accessibility**: Open standards and FOSS were emphasized for their transparency, security, and accessibility, particularly for individuals with disabilities.

The bill aims to reduce reliance on proprietary software, promoting inclusivity and security in government interactions.

### **Election Day as a State Holiday (Segment 3)**
Representative Reed presented a bill to make Election Day a state holiday, arguing that it would encourage civic engagement and remove barriers to voting. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill would close public offices and schools on Election Day, except for essential services, and allow private sector employees up to three hours of unpaid time to vote.
- **Cultural Shift**: Making Election Day a holiday was framed as a way to celebrate democracy and foster a cultural shift toward civic participation.
- **Minimal Impact**: Concerns about productivity and financial impact were addressed, with Reed stating that the effect would be minimal, equivalent to one school day or snow day per year.

The bill was supported as a means to promote voter turnout and celebrate democratic processes.

### **Transparency, Efficiency, and Voter Participation (Segment 4)**
Several bills and amendments were discussed to enhance transparency, efficiency, and voter participation:
- **House Bill 327**: Aimed to standardize costs for implementing state government applications and consider open-source solutions, though concerns were raised about practicality.
- **House Bill 284**: Sought to clarify and modify the information made public regarding Requests for Bids (RFBs), Requests for Proposals (RFPs), and Requests for Applications (RFAs), promoting transparency without disclosing specific bid details.
- **Amendment to House Bill 284**: Proposed increasing the threshold for counties to request bids from $5,000 to $10,000, saving time and costs.
- **House Bill 359**: Proposed establishing Election Day and Primary Election Days as legal holidays to improve voter turnout, drawing parallels to Puerto Rico’s high voter turnout where Election Day is a holiday.

These discussions emphasized the need for clarity, efficiency, and increased participation in government processes.

### **Commission on Demographic Trends (Segment 5)**
The meeting also addressed two bills related to the **Commission on Demographic Trends**:
- **House Bill 64**: Introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, the bill sought to mandate the commission to consider data on race and ethnicity to increase diversity in New Hampshire. Gallagher argued that this would address critiques about the state’s lack of demographic representation and strengthen its first-in-the-nation primary status.
- **House Bill 228**: Introduced by Representative Gerald Griffin, the bill proposed eliminating the commission, arguing it was redundant and underutilized, with UNH already providing comprehensive demographic data.

**Key Debates**:
- Opponents of HB 228 emphasized the commission’s value in addressing demographic challenges, such as an aging population and the need for economic growth through diversity.
- Proponents of HB 228 highlighted the commission’s inefficiency and lack of clear mission.

The committee moved into executive session, with Representative Schuett proposing a motion to not pass HB 64, citing UNH’s existing efforts and the inefficiency of maintaining underutilized commissions.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several overarching themes:
1. **Accessibility and Security**: Ensuring government interactions are inclusive, secure, and based on open standards, reducing reliance on proprietary software.
2. **Civic Engagement**: Promoting voter participation and celebrating democracy through measures like making Election Day a holiday.
3. **Transparency and Efficiency**: Enhancing transparency in government processes and improving efficiency in procurement and application implementation.
4. **Demographic Challenges**: Addressing New Hampshire’s aging population and lack of diversity, with debates over the necessity and role of the Commission on Demographic Trends.

The discussions reflected a commitment to improving government processes, fostering civic participation, and addressing demographic and economic challenges in the state.
