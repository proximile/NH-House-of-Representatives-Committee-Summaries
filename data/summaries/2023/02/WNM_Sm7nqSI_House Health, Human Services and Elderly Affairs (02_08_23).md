The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on February 8, 2023, to discuss a range of bills addressing healthcare, public health, and medical oversight. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and proceeded to address several key pieces of legislation, involving detailed discussions, stakeholder testimonies, and committee deliberations.

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **House Bill 262 (Naturopathic Doctors and Lab Tests):**
   - Introduced by Representative Jess Edwards, this bill aims to include naturopathic doctors in the list of licensed medical practitioners authorized to order and interpret laboratory tests without additional oversight. Supporters, including Dr. Michelle Half of the New Hampshire Association of Naturopathic Doctors, argued it corrects an oversight in existing law (RSA 151:12-c). Opponents, such as Dr. Eric Liu of the New Hampshire Medical Society, raised concerns about the scientific legitimacy of naturopathic practices, overutilization of tests, and potential financial burdens.

2. **House Bill 454 (Examining Board of Medicine Transparency):**
   - Also introduced by Representative Jess Edwards, this bill seeks to enhance the transparency and accountability of the Examining Board of Medicine. It was prompted by discrepancies in how the board handled complaints against a physician practicing in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The bill focuses on clarifying the board’s mission and improving public transparency.

3. **House Bill 322/323 (Board of Medicine Oversight):**
   - These bills propose establishing a study committee to examine the Board of Medicine’s rules, reporting practices, and potential legislative changes. Amendments include reducing the number of senators on the committee and setting a sunset date for 2026. The committee would include non-voting stakeholders, such as hospital representatives, to provide input.

4. **House Bill 299 (Anti-Discrimination in Healthcare):**
   - Introduced by Representative Mike Belcher, this bill adds specific protections against discrimination in healthcare, focusing on recent trends in health equity, anti-racism, and justice. The bill sparked debate on whether it would prevent past injustices like the Tuskegee experiments or lead to unintended consequences in prioritizing care based on medical evidence.

5. **House Bill 614 (PFAS Contamination Study):**
   - Introduced by Representative Nancy Murphy, this bill proposes a feasibility study to investigate the health impacts of PFAS contamination in Merrimack, NH, particularly the excess cases of kidney cancer. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supported the bill, emphasizing the need for a feasibility study to determine if a full epidemiological study is warranted.

6. **House Bill 565 FNA (Postpartum Medicaid Expansion):**
   - This bill aims to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage from 2 months to 12 months, addressing maternal mortality and health issues that arise beyond the initial postpartum period. Supporters argued it would improve maternal and child health and reduce long-term healthcare costs. Opponents expressed concerns about fiscal impacts and potential dependence on government healthcare. The committee voted 10-10, sending the bill to the floor with no recommendation.

7. **House Bill 413 (Diabetic Shoes Prescription):**
   - This bill authorizes advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants to prescribe diabetic shoes. The committee agreed this was already within their scope of practice, leading to a unanimous vote to recommend it for further legislative action.

### **Other Key Discussions:**

- **Emerging Medical Technologies Committee:**
   - Representative Pearson introduced a bill to establish a committee to monitor and facilitate emerging medical technologies. The committee would assess the state's role in adopting new technologies and provide oversight to identify potential harms. Concerns were raised about the committee’s ability to keep up with the rapid pace of medical advancements.

- **Organ Donation and Prescription Refills:**
   - The committee voted to retain House Bill 587, which addresses organ donation, to gather more data. They unanimously passed House Bill 223, allowing quarterly refills for certain controlled substances like topical testosterone, reducing administrative burden.

- **Maternal Mortality and Domestic Violence Funding:**
   - House Bill 598, which proposed diverting funds from domestic violence programs to maternal mortality reviews, was opposed by many committee members. They argued it was ill-conceived and could harm existing domestic violence programs. The bill was ultimately retained for further review.

- **WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program:**
   - House Bill 574, aimed at re-establishing the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program, sparked debate. Some members supported it for promoting fresh produce access, while others questioned its cost and effectiveness. The committee split 10-10, leading to a motion to retain the bill for further discussion.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing innovation, privacy, and fiscal responsibility while addressing public health needs. Key themes included the need for transparency in medical oversight, the importance of addressing environmental health concerns, and the debate over expanding Medicaid and other healthcare services. The committee planned to reconvene to address deferred bills and continue their work on pending legislation.
