The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 21, 2023, convened by the Children and Family Law Committee, focused on a series of bills and resolutions addressing family law, child support, and court processes. The discussions highlighted systemic issues, proposed reforms, and the complexities of balancing legal requirements with the needs of families and children. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **Child Support and Compliance (HB 548)**
- **HB 548** proposed a $25 threshold for defining arrears in child support payments to prevent minor discrepancies from triggering federal enforcement actions, such as passport denials. Representative James Spillane shared a personal experience of being denied a passport due to a rounding error in his child support payments, despite compliance through wage garnishment.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to protect individuals from penalties for small arrearages, requiring system and policy changes.
  - Concerns were raised about the Bureau of Child Support Services’ handling of wage garnishment and compliance reporting.
  - Amendments were proposed to clarify the $25 threshold and allow parents to opt out of wage garnishment if both parties agree.

### **Termination of Child Support (HB 583)**
- **HB 583** sought to end child support when a child turns 18, removes the requirement for high school graduation, and includes exceptions for marriage, military service, or emancipation.
- **Key Points**:
  - Supporters argued that parents should not be forced to pay child support indefinitely if a child chooses not to complete high school.
  - Opponents raised concerns about the impact on vulnerable children, including those with disabilities or in foster care, who may need continued support.
  - Proposed amendments included extending support until the end of the school year in which the child turns 18 or until they obtain a GED.

### **Investigation of Family Court Due Process (HR 14)**
- **HR 14** called for an investigation into alleged due process violations in New Hampshire’s family court system, including judicial misconduct, financial exploitation, and mismanagement of child support cases.
- **Key Points**:
  - Testimonies highlighted systemic issues such as arbitrary judicial discretion, fabricated orders, and prolonged cases that financially drain families.
  - Concerns were raised about the lack of accountability, particularly with the Judicial Conduct Committee’s handling of complaints.
  - Supporters urged legislative oversight and subpoena power to investigate specific cases and ensure fairness.

### **Family Court Processes and Systemic Improvements**
- Discussions emphasized the need for reforms in emotionally charged family court cases, including reducing judicial delays and ensuring fair representation for indigent parents and children.
- **Key Points**:
  - Suggestions included adopting efficient processes from neighboring states like Massachusetts.
  - Bills such as **HB 535**, which proposes appointing attorneys for children in family court cases, were discussed, with concerns about funding and logistics.
  - The committee considered retaining certain bills for further refinement to address systemic issues.

### **Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (HB 455)**
- **HB 455** aimed to align New Hampshire state law with federal requirements for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS), which allows abused, neglected, or abandoned immigrant youth to apply for lawful permanent residency.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill seeks to address inconsistencies among judges in issuing findings for SIJS cases and increased federal scrutiny for older youth.
  - Concerns were raised about creating new causes of action solely for SIJS, which could attract federal scrutiny.
  - The committee voted unanimously to retain the bill for further work.

### **Rules of Evidence in Family Court (HB 499)**
- **HB 499** proposed applying the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence to family court cases, particularly in child neglect and abuse cases, with a waiver provision for judges.
- **Key Points**:
  - Critics argued that the bill’s broad scope could allow respondents to introduce irrelevant evidence without judicial oversight.
  - Amendments narrowed the bill’s focus to RSA 169-C cases and clarified the waiver provision.
  - The committee closed the hearing and planned to revisit the bill after further input.

---

### **Other Bills and Discussions**
- **HB 470**: Retained for further work, this bill addresses final disposition hearings in divorce proceedings.
- **HB 497**: A tied vote (8-8) on a bill concerning the confidentiality of records within the Division of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) means it will proceed without a specific recommendation.
- **HB 185**: Sparked debate on promoting shared parenting and equal access to children’s records after divorce, with concerns about domestic violence and the challenges of proving abuse in court.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Systemic Issues**: Testimonies highlighted widespread concerns about judicial misconduct, due process violations, and financial exploitation in the family court system.
2. **Proposed Reforms**: Bills like HB 548, HB 583, and HR 14 aim to address these issues by setting thresholds for arrears, revising child support termination rules, and investigating family court practices.
3. **Vulnerable Populations**: Discussions emphasized the need to protect immigrant youth, children in foster care, and victims of domestic violence.
4. **Retention and Refinement**: Several bills were retained for further work, reflecting the committee’s commitment to careful consideration and stakeholder input.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of family law and the need for thoughtful reforms to ensure fairness, accountability, and the well-being of families and children. The committee’s collaborative approach and willingness to retain bills for further refinement demonstrate a commitment to addressing systemic issues while balancing legal requirements and family needs.
