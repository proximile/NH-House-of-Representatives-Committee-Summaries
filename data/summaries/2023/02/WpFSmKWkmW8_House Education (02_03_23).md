The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 3, 2023, to discuss a range of education-related bills, addressing issues from teacher shortages and school meal programs to curriculum mandates and the administration of educational programs. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Teacher Shortage and Certification (HB 654)**
The committee focused on **House Bill 654**, which aims to address the **teacher shortage** in high-need areas like science, mathematics, and special education. The bill proposes a **one-year certificate of teaching eligibility**, allowing individuals with a bachelor’s degree and relevant subject knowledge to teach while working toward full certification. Key points included:
- **Flexibility for Schools**: The bill provides flexibility for districts to hire teachers when fully certified candidates are unavailable.
- **Certification Process**: The certificate can be extended for a second year if the teacher is making progress toward full certification, with an emphasis on professional ethics and accountability.
- **Mentoring and Support**: Concerns were raised about ensuring teachers on temporary certification receive adequate mentoring and support.
- **Long-Term Solutions**: While the bill was supported as a temporary fix, committee members stressed the need for long-term strategies to strengthen the educator pipeline.

### **Curriculum Mandates**
The committee debated several bills related to curriculum, including:
- **Teaching Cursive and Multiplication Tables (HP 170)**: This bill mandates instruction in cursive writing and multiplication tables by the end of fifth grade, with accommodations for students with IEPs or 504 plans. Supporters highlighted the cognitive benefits of cursive and the foundational importance of multiplication, while opponents argued against legislative overreach into local curriculum decisions. The bill passed with an amendment.
- **Legislative Role in Curriculum**: Some representatives questioned whether the legislature should dictate curriculum, advocating for local control and decisions by education experts.

### **School Meal Programs**
The committee discussed bills aimed at expanding access to school meals:
- **Breakfast and Lunch Programs (HB 429)**: The bill would require public and charter schools to offer breakfast and lunch programs. Proponents emphasized the importance of ensuring students have access to meals, particularly those from low-income families. Opponents raised concerns about costs, logistical challenges, and potential unintended consequences. An amendment was proposed to exclude charter schools and provide a waiver process for schools not participating in federal meal programs. The committee deadlocked 10-10, resulting in no recommendation.
- **Unfunded Mandates**: Concerns were raised about the potential financial burden on schools, with some arguing that the bill could impose unfunded mandates.

### **Educational Freedom Accounts (HB 626)**
The committee debated **House Bill 626**, which proposes transferring the administration of **Educational Freedom Accounts (EFAs)** from the private **Children’s Scholarship Fund** to the **New Hampshire Department of Education (DOE)**. Key points included:
- **Arguments in Favor**: Proponents argued that the DOE would provide greater oversight, transparency, and efficiency, potentially reducing administrative costs.
- **Arguments Against**: Opponents defended the current private administration as effective and successful, serving over 3,000 students with a 10% administrative cost cap.
- **Outcome**: The committee deadlocked 10-10, meaning the bill will move to the full House without a committee recommendation.

### **Other Bills and Discussions**
- **Non-Academic Surveys (HB 380)**: The committee debated changing the consent requirement for non-academic surveys from “opt-in” to “opt-out.” Concerns were raised about privacy and awareness, particularly for sensitive surveys. The committee deadlocked 10-10, effectively stopping the bill from advancing.
- **Extraordinary Need Grants (HB 638)**: This bill aimed to adjust accountability plan requirements for smaller grants, reducing administrative burdens. The committee moved to recommend “Ought to Pass” (OTP), signaling support for the bill.
- **Surety Bonds for Career Schools (HB 155)**: The committee discussed reducing the annual growth requirement for surety bonds for private post-secondary career schools. The motion to recommend the bill failed, and it was retained for further discussion.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between **state-level mandates** and **local control** in education policy, as well as the challenges of balancing **educational priorities** with **practical considerations** like funding and implementation. While some bills advanced, others were tabled or deadlocked, reflecting the complexity of addressing issues like teacher shortages, student hunger, and curriculum standards. The discussions underscored the need for careful consideration of both short-term solutions and long-term strategies to support New Hampshire’s students and educators.
