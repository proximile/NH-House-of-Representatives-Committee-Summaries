The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 8, 2023, featured extensive discussions on several gun-related bills, reflecting deep divisions on gun rights, public safety, and state sovereignty. The key bills debated included **House Bill 32 (HB 32)**, **House Bill 59 (HB 59)**, **House Bill 76 (HB 76)**, **House Bill 78 (HB 78)**, **House Bill 106 (HB 106)**, **House Bill 351 (HB 351)**, **House Bill 444 (HB 444)**, **House Bill 474 (HB 474)**, and **House Bill 512 (HB 512)**. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **HB 32: Gun-Free School Zones**
- **Support**: Advocates argued that HB 32 would protect children and staff by creating gun-free zones in schools, aligning with the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. They emphasized the need for safe learning environments and shared personal experiences with gun violence.
- **Opposition**: Critics contended that the bill is unnecessary, unconstitutional, and could make schools targets for criminals. They argued that New Hampshire’s low crime rates are due to the presence of armed citizens and that the bill infringes on Second Amendment rights.

### **HB 59 & HB 76: Background Checks and Waiting Periods**
- **HB 59 (Background Checks)**: Supporters highlighted the importance of universal background checks in preventing gun violence and suicide. Opponents argued that the bill infringes on Second Amendment rights and would burden law-abiding citizens, including domestic violence victims needing immediate self-defense.
- **HB 76 (Three-Day Waiting Period)**: Proponents argued that waiting periods could reduce impulsive violence and suicide. Critics claimed it could endanger individuals in urgent need of self-defense and questioned its effectiveness given New Hampshire’s low gun violence rates.

### **HB 78 & HB 1178: State Sovereignty and Federal Gun Laws**
- **HB 78 (Repealing HB 1178)**: Supporters of HB 78 argued for cooperation with federal gun laws to enhance public safety, particularly in cases involving mental health or domestic violence. Opponents emphasized the importance of state sovereignty and protecting Second Amendment rights from federal overreach.
- **HB 1178**: This law prevents state law enforcement from enforcing federal gun laws deemed unconstitutional by the state. Supporters argued it protects state sovereignty and individual rights, while critics claimed it undermines federal efforts to regulate firearms.

### **HB 106: Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs)**
- **Support**: Advocates, including mental health organizations, argued that ERPOs could prevent suicides and homicides by temporarily restricting firearm access for individuals deemed a risk. They cited evidence from other states where ERPOs have been effective.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about due process violations, potential abuse, and the stigmatization of mental health. They argued that ERPOs could be weaponized and infringe on Second Amendment rights.

### **HB 351: Firearm Storage Requirements**
- **Support**: Proponents emphasized the importance of responsible gun ownership, particularly in households with children, to prevent accidental shootings.
- **Opposition**: Critics argued that the bill infringes on gun rights and that existing laws are sufficient.

### **HB 444: Firearms Near Polling Places**
- **Support**: Advocates argued that banning firearms near polling places would create safer environments for voters.
- **Opposition**: Critics claimed the bill infringes on constitutional rights and creates unnecessary gun-free zones.

### **HB 474 & HB 512: State Sovereignty and Gun Rights**
- **HB 474 (Gun Sanctuary Bill)**: This bill aims to protect citizens’ gun rights from federal overreach and imposes penalties on law enforcement aiding federal agencies in infringing on these rights.
- **HB 512 (State Sovereignty for Firearms)**: This bill seeks to exempt firearms, accessories, and ammunition manufactured and kept within New Hampshire from federal jurisdiction, promoting state sovereignty and protecting local businesses.

### **Key Themes Across All Bills:**
1. **Second Amendment Rights**: Opponents of stricter gun control measures consistently emphasized the importance of protecting constitutional gun rights, arguing that such laws infringe on individual freedoms.
2. **Public Safety**: Supporters of gun control measures focused on reducing gun violence, particularly suicides and domestic violence, and creating safer environments in schools and polling places.
3. **State Sovereignty vs. Federal Overreach**: Several bills, including HB 78, HB 474, and HB 512, sparked debates about the balance between state sovereignty and federal authority, with many speakers advocating for New Hampshire’s independence from federal gun regulations.
4. **Due Process and Abuse**: Concerns about due process violations and the potential for abuse were prominent in discussions on ERPOs and other restrictive measures.
5. **Mental Health**: Both sides acknowledged the importance of addressing mental health issues, but they differed on whether gun control measures are part of the solution.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing public safety, individual rights, and state sovereignty in the context of gun legislation. Supporters of gun control measures emphasized the need to prevent violence and protect vulnerable populations, while opponents stressed the importance of constitutional rights and the risks of government overreach. The committee heard extensive testimony from both sides and planned to review the arguments and amendments before making final decisions on the bills.
