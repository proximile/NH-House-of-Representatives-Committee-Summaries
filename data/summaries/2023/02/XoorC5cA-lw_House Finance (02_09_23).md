**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting (February 9, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on February 9, 2023, to discuss several critical issues, with a primary focus on **Senate Bill 1 (SB1)**, which addresses the closure of the **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)** and the establishment of a new **Secured Youth Development Center**. The meeting also touched on related topics, including administrative release processes, facility design, funding, and community impact. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **1. Senate Bill 1 (SB1) Overview and Key Provisions**
SB1 proposes the creation of a new secured youth development facility to replace the aging SYSC. The bill includes:
- A **$15 million cap** on expenditures for design and construction, though estimates have risen to **$21.6 million** due to inflation and supply chain issues.
- A **commission** to study public safety concerns, site selection, and community impact, with a focus on ensuring the new facility is **therapeutic, trauma-informed, and home-like**.
- A **delay in SYSC’s closure** from March 1, 2023, to **November 1, 2024**, to allow for transition planning and the construction of the new facility.

### **2. Facility Design and Capacity**
The proposed new facility would have **18 beds**, designed to meet the needs of youth with complex trauma and behavioral challenges. Key design features include:
- **Therapeutic and trauma-informed** spaces, including medical and behavioral health care areas, recreational spaces, and staff visibility.
- **Architectural security** to ensure safety while maintaining a home-like environment.
- Concerns were raised about the low bed capacity, as no state has successfully operated a facility with such limited capacity. The **Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF)** noted that the average number of youth at SYSC has dropped significantly, from 75 in 2016 to 12 in recent years, due to changes in law and the development of a **system of care**.

### **3. Administrative Release Process**
The committee discussed the **administrative release process** for youth who achieve clinical readiness, which involves judicial review and parole. Key concerns included:
- The lack of a clear process when facilities are full and no youth are clinically ready for release.
- Neighboring states’ unwillingness to accept these youth due to their own capacity and workforce issues.

### **4. Funding and Fiscal Concerns**
Funding for the new facility was a major point of discussion:
- **$15 million** in federal ARPA funds has been allocated, but the estimated cost is **$21.6 million**, raising concerns about budget overruns.
- Amendments were proposed to reduce the initial appropriation for site evaluation from $2 million to **$400,000**, focusing solely on site evaluation rather than architectural design.
- The committee emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility and transparency in the use of funds.

### **5. Workforce and Programming Challenges**
The importance of **qualified personnel** and **evidence-based programming** was highlighted:
- Current workforce issues, including low staffing levels and salary challenges, hinder the implementation of therapeutic programs.
- The bill outlines staff qualifications and training requirements to ensure the new facility is staffed by professionals equipped to provide trauma-informed care.

### **6. Community Impact and Site Selection**
The commission’s role in engaging with affected communities and proposing legislation was emphasized:
- Three potential sites were discussed, with **Hampstead** being the most favored due to its flexibility and existing infrastructure.
- The commission’s role is **advisory**, focusing on community engagement, site evaluation, and proposing legislation to ensure the new facility does not adversely impact the community where it is placed.

### **7. Amendments and Voting**
The committee reviewed and modified several amendments to SB1:
- **Amendment 0465-H** was unanimously adopted (23-0), aligning the bill with prior agreements and clarifying the scope of the commission’s role.
- Amendments included changing procurement language to align with state processes and adjusting the commission’s structure to allow for more flexibility in membership.

### **8. Broader Medicaid Rate Issues**
The committee also addressed broader Medicaid rate issues, including:
- The need for a **service-based rate model** for Medicaid reimbursements in assisted living facilities.
- Workforce shortages and the sustainability of current rates across various sectors, including nursing homes and mental health services.

### **9. Next Steps and Urgency**
The committee expressed a sense of urgency to move forward, given the **March 1st deadline** for SYSC’s closure and the need to address the facility’s future. Next steps include:
- Continuing discussions on SB1 and related legislation, such as **House Bill 49 (HB49)**.
- Refining amendments and ensuring clarity on the facility’s design, location, and funding.
- Addressing workforce and programming challenges to ensure the new facility is effective and sustainable.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing the needs of committed youth, balancing fiscal responsibility, and ensuring the new facility is both effective and community-sensitive. The committee aimed to align SB1 with other related legislation, address concerns raised by members, and ensure a thoughtful transition from SYSC to a new, therapeutic facility that meets the mental health and safety needs of youth while ensuring adequate capacity and funding.
