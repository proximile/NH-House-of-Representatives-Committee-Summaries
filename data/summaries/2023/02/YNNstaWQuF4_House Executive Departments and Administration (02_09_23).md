### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (02/09/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on February 9, 2023, to discuss several bills aimed at reforming occupational licensing and improving access to professional services. The meeting focused on four key pieces of legislation: **House Bill 518**, **House Bill 532**, **House Bill 594**, and **House Bill 644**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points raised during the meeting.

---

### **House Bill 518: Occupational Regulations for Pharmacists and Pharmacies**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes establishing a commission to study revisions to occupational regulations for pharmacists and pharmacies in New Hampshire.
- **Key Points**:
  - The commission would explore separating the **business of pharmacy** from the **practice of pharmacy** under RSA 318, akin to the separation of hospital operations from physician practices in medicine.
  - Stakeholders would be involved to determine the necessity and benefits of such a separation.
  - Concerns were raised about the commissionâ€™s short timeline (ending November 1, 2023) and its ability to produce meaningful results.
  - The bill would impose minimal costs on taxpayers, as non-legislative members would not receive reimbursement.
- **Outcome**: The bill was briefly discussed, with no immediate action taken.

### **House Bill 532: Licensure and Regulation of Music Therapists**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to license and regulate music therapists in New Hampshire, enabling them to bill insurance and Medicaid for their services.
- **Key Points**:
  - Proponents, including board-certified music therapists and clients, highlighted the **evidence-based benefits** of music therapy for individuals with autism, trauma, mental health issues, and other conditions.
  - Licensure would **increase access** to therapy, especially for low-income individuals, and prevent harm from unqualified practitioners.
  - Opponents raised concerns about the **cost of licensure** (approximately $60,000) and potential barriers for practitioners.
  - An amendment was proposed to clarify the scope of music therapy and distinguish it from speech therapy.
- **Outcome**: The committee decided to send the bill to a subcommittee for further review, pending the finalization of the amendment.

### **House Bill 594: Streamlining Licensing Reciprocity**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to simplify licensing reciprocity for professionals licensed in other states, particularly in mental health, substance use disorder, and psychology.
- **Key Points**:
  - The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) would be responsible for determining "substantially similar" licensing requirements, in consultation with relevant boards.
  - The bill addresses workforce shortages in mental health by expediting the licensing process for out-of-state professionals.
  - Concerns were raised about the potential for the OPLC executive director to override board input, but it was clarified that consultation with boards is required.
  - Real estate licensing was discussed, with assurances that the bill would not override existing requirements.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed the committee with a unanimous 18-0 vote.

### **House Bill 644: Removing Licensing Requirements for Niche Beauty Services**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to exempt low-risk beauty services (e.g., shampooing, blow drying, threading, and makeup application) from occupational licensing requirements.
- **Key Points**:
  - Current licensing laws require significant time, cost, and training (over $19,000 and 1,500+ hours), which are seen as **overburdensome** for these inherently safe services.
  - Proponents argued that removing licensing barriers would create **economic opportunities**, particularly for lower-income individuals, often women.
  - The bill includes provisions to ensure salon owners verify worker competence and maintain hygiene standards.
  - Over 20 states have already exempted these services from licensing, with no significant increase in consumer harm.
  - Concerns were raised about hygiene and safety, particularly for services like threading, but the bill addresses these issues by holding salon owners accountable.
  - Testimonies highlighted how licensing laws force some workers into **underground economies** and hinder economic mobility.
- **Outcome**: The bill was extensively discussed, with plans to potentially move it to a subcommittee for further review.

### **Themes and Broader Implications**
The meeting reflected a broader debate about the balance between **public safety**, **professional standards**, and **economic freedom** in the context of occupational licensing. Key themes included:
1. **Reducing Barriers to Entry**: Many bills aimed to simplify licensing processes, reduce costs, and promote economic opportunity, particularly for lower-income individuals.
2. **Public Safety and Consumer Protection**: Opponents of deregulation emphasized the need for mandatory licensure to ensure quality standards and prevent harm from unqualified practitioners.
3. **Workforce Shortages**: Bills like HB 594 sought to address critical shortages in fields such as mental health by streamlining licensing for out-of-state professionals.
4. **Economic Impact**: Licensing reforms were seen as a way to encourage entrepreneurship, reduce unemployment, and foster competition in various industries.

- **HB 594**: Passed the committee with a unanimous 18-0 vote.
