**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on HB 436-FN-L (02/09/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee held a work session on **HB 436-FN-L**, a bill aimed at addressing complexities and inequities in the state’s retirement system. The discussions centered on pension benefits, unfunded liabilities, vesting rules, and phased transitions for certain employee groups. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **1. Tier B Pension Adjustments and Equity Restoration**
The bill focuses on moving a fixed population of employees (approximately 1,700 people) back into **Tier B pensions** over a 10-year period. This group is based on years of service as of January 1, 2012, and the population will decrease as individuals retire or pass away. The bill seeks to restore equity for employees who were negatively impacted by legislative changes in 2011, such as having to work additional years to receive the same benefits. However, it does not fully address all lost equity.

### **2. Unfunded Liability and Funding Challenges**
The state’s unfunded pension liability, currently estimated at **$5.7 billion**, remains a significant concern. Employers (municipalities) bear the primary responsibility for funding this liability, with rates varying by employee group (e.g., police, fire, teachers). A substantial portion of employer contributions (75-85%) is dedicated to paying down the unfunded liability. This liability stems from past legislative decisions in the 1990s and early 2000s, where temporary funding solutions were left in place longer than intended, compounded by the impact of the Great Recession. The goal is to fully fund the liability by **2039**, with employer rates remaining high until then, subject to adjustments based on investment performance.

### **3. Vesting and Retirement Benefits**
The bill clarifies the definition of "vested" in the retirement system, requiring employees to work **10 years** to qualify for pension benefits, consistent with current practices and regional standards. It also introduces a provision to **freeze pension benefit calculations after three years of service**, preventing retroactive changes for employees who have worked at least three years. This aims to restore trust in the system by providing clarity and stability in retirement benefits.

### **4. Pension Caps and Anti-Spiking Provisions**
The bill adjusts pension caps for different employee groups:
- Employees hired **before July 1, 2001**, are exempt from any pension cap.
- Employees hired between **July 1, 2001, and July 1, 2011**, have their pension cap increased to **$125,000**, up from the previous $120,000.
- Employees hired **after July 1, 2011**, remain subject to the existing cap of 85% of their average final compensation or $120,000, whichever is lower.

The bill also retains **anti-spiking measures** introduced in 2009 to prevent employees from inflating their pensions by working excessive overtime in their final years.

### **5. Incentives to Extend Employment**
To encourage longer careers in public service, the bill increases the pension multiplier from **2.1% to 2.5%** for employees who delay retirement. This incentivizes employees to contribute to the system longer rather than withdrawing benefits early.

### **6. Phased Implementation and Transition**
The bill includes a phased approach to transition employees back into the original retirement system (Tier A) from the modified system (Tier B) implemented in 2011. Employees hired between 2002 and July 1, 2011, will gradually return to more favorable Tier A benefits, including a higher multiplier (2.5%) and earlier retirement eligibility (age 45 with 20 years of service). The transition is structured in **one-year increments** to prevent disproportionate impacts on specific groups.

### **7. Constitutional Concerns and Policy Changes**
The bill addresses constitutional concerns raised by the retroactive changes made in 2011, which were seen as violating Article 23 of the New Hampshire Constitution, prohibiting retroactive laws that harm individuals. By undoing these changes and restoring original benefits for affected employees, the bill aims to rectify past injustices. It also includes policy changes such as increasing the maximum pension from 85% to 100% of final compensation for certain employees and removing the reduction in benefits after three years of service.

### **8. Financial Impact and Funding**
The fiscal impact of the bill is estimated at **$229 million**, with the potential for further reductions through concessions and actuarial adjustments. Funding will come from the general fund, ensuring no financial burden is passed down to municipalities. The bill’s phased approach also aims to prevent mass retirements, maintaining experienced staff in critical roles like law enforcement and education.

### **9. Simplification and Clarity**
The bill seeks to simplify and clarify the retirement system by cleaning up statutory language, removing redundant references, and ensuring consistent definitions of terms like "earnable compensation" and "average final compensation" across tiers. This improves transparency and equitable treatment for all employees.

### **10. Long-Term Goals**
The overarching goals of **HB 436-FN-L** are to:
- Address constitutional and fairness issues in the retirement system.
- Provide a structured, phased approach to restore more favorable benefits to affected public employees.
- Ensure the financial sustainability of the retirement system while maintaining trust and clarity for employees.
- Incentivize longer careers in public service to retain experienced personnel in critical roles.

The committee plans to finalize amendments and vote on the bill, ensuring it is ready for further legislative action. Overall, the bill represents a significant step toward balancing fiscal responsibility with fairness to New Hampshire’s public workforce.
