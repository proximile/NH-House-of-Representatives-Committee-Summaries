**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (02/28/23)**

The NH House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 28, 2023, focused on the budget and operations of the Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The discussions highlighted the critical role of public health in addressing current and future health challenges, the need for adequate funding and workforce support, and the importance of data-driven decision-making.

**Budget Overview and Challenges**

The Division of Public Health has a total budget of approximately $124 million, with only about 15% coming from general funds. The majority of the funding is federal, often restricted to specific programs. Challenges include the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, workforce shortages, and the need for more flexible funding. The pandemic has led to a decrease in preventative health services, which may result in future health issues.

**Public Health Mission and Programs**

The mission of Public Health is to prevent disease spread, promote health, and address health disparities. Key programs include maternal and child health, chronic disease prevention, emergency response, and environmental health. The Bureau of Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recovery (EPER) plays a crucial role in coordinating responses to public health emergencies, including pandemics and radiological events.

**COVID-19 Impact and Data Modernization**

The pandemic has significantly impacted public health operations, with ongoing efforts to manage COVID-19, including vaccination and therapeutics programs. Efforts have been made to modernize data systems, such as electronic case reporting and immunization information systems, to enhance data transparency and public health response.

**Workforce Issues and Future Focus**

The division is experiencing workforce challenges, with many staff feeling burnt out after years of intense work during the pandemic. There is a need for competitive compensation to retain skilled public health professionals. Moving forward, the division will focus on addressing the long-term impacts of the pandemic, improving preventative health services, and managing environmental health threats.

**Specific Program Discussions**

1. **Wastewater Testing and Public Health Monitoring**: Wastewater testing, initially used for COVID-19 monitoring, has potential for detecting other diseases like polio.
2. **Tobacco Prevention and Youth Outreach**: The tobacco prevention program focuses on reducing vaping among adolescents, with some success in reducing vaping rates.
3. **Chronic Disease Management**: Programs like diabetes self-management and mobile integrated health (MIH) aim to reduce hospital readmissions and improve long-term health outcomes.
4. **Nutrition and WIC Programs**: Expanding access to fresh fruits and vegetables for WIC participants, including potential funding for farmer's market access.
5. **Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program**: Funding will be zeroed out in the next biennium due to the decision not to apply for additional federal funds.
6. **Family Planning and Reproductive Health**: Reallocation of funds to existing family planning providers and incentives for new vendors.
7. **Home Visiting Program**: The Healthy Families New Hampshire program aims to reduce adverse childhood experiences, with a need for additional state funds to match federal funds.
8. **Infectious Disease and Public Health**: Funding for infectious disease control, including programs for HIV, Lyme disease, and other tick-borne illnesses.
9. **STD Prevention and Awareness**: Increasing public awareness and screening for STDs, particularly chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
10. **Laboratory Services**: The Public Health Lab's role in testing for various diseases, including rabies, gonorrhea, and water quality.
11. **Vaccination Programs**: The state's vaccination program is funded through a revolving fund supported by insurers to ensure all children have access to recommended vaccines.

**Budget and Funding Management**

Managing multiple funding sources, especially federal grants, is complex due to their varying stability and duration. The discussion emphasized the importance of transparency and a methodical approach to handling these funds. Temporary and permanent staff positions are used in response to fluctuating grant availability, with challenges in maintaining core infrastructure and statutory responsibilities.

**Data and Informatics**

Data modernization in public health is crucial, including the use of data dashboards for opioid monitoring and other health statistics. Better communication strategies are needed to inform the public and policymakers.

**Legislative and Budgetary Challenges**

Various legislative concerns were addressed, including the potential impacts of new bills on existing programs and the challenges of aligning federal grant requirements with state budget practices. The representative encouraged questions and feedback from the committee members to ensure clarity and alignment on budget priorities.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of public health monitoring, emergency preparedness, chronic disease management, and leveraging federal funds to address emerging health challenges effectively.
