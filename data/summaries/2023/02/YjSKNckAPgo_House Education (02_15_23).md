The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 15, 2023, to address several key education funding bills, align legislative proposals with the governor’s budget, and discuss accountability and oversight in education. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Charter School Funding (House Bill 272)**
The committee focused on **House Bill 272**, which pertains to funding for charter schools. Representative Cordelli proposed an amendment to reduce the funding amount by approximately $500 per student, bringing it down to $4,627 per pupil to align with the governor’s budget proposal. The amendment passed with broad support. Discussions highlighted that charter schools had not received a funding increase in five years, and while there was support for increasing funding, concerns were raised about accountability and oversight. Representatives emphasized the need for better data collection, transparency, and more robust oversight by the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Charter Schools, which has not met since 2016. The amended bill passed with 19 votes in favor and 1 against, with representatives noting the importance of charter schools as public educational options.

### **Governor’s Budget Proposal**
The committee reviewed the governor’s budget, which proposed significant increases in education funding, including:
- A $1,000 increase in base adequacy funding, totaling $150 million.
- A $20 million increase in free and reduced-price lunch aid.
- A $20 million boost in special education funding.
The budget also addressed stabilization grants and differentiated aid, aiming to address disparities in school funding.

### **Additional Aid Grants (House Bill 529)**
**House Bill 529** focuses on providing additional aid grants to schools based on free and reduced-price meal rates and fiscal capacity disparities. The committee discussed amendments to the bill, including technical corrections, accountability measures, and adjustments to align with the governor’s budget. The bill aims to distribute $100 million annually to schools with lower property valuations and higher rates of free and reduced-price lunch students.

### **Other Bills and Actions**
1. **House Bill 492**: Passed with an amendment, this bill requires the Department of Education to provide the House and Senate Education Committees, as well as superintendents, with copies of education laws and rules.
2. **House Bill 382**: The committee voted to indefinitely postpone (ITL) this bill, which would have allowed local school boards to grant students release time for religious instruction. The bill’s sponsor did not attend the hearing, and the committee decided not to move forward with it.
3. **Procedural Discussions**: The committee addressed procedural questions regarding reconsideration of **HB 437** (related to reading instruction) and **HB 170** (cursive writing and multiplication tables).

### **Consolidation and Administrative Costs**
The committee discussed the challenges of high administrative costs in New Hampshire due to the large number of small school districts. They noted that some districts are withdrawing from cooperative agreements, leading to increased costs and inefficiencies. The committee emphasized the need for consolidation and better resource management.

### **Accountability and Oversight**
Accountability in education funding was a recurring theme. The committee stressed the importance of districts reporting how funds are used, particularly for grants exceeding $50,000. They also highlighted the need for transparency and oversight in the use of state education funds.

### **Adjournment and Next Steps**
The committee adjourned with plans to continue executive sessions in March and address remaining bills. Representatives emphasized the importance of collaboration and efficiency in moving forward with pending legislation, ensuring that policy decisions align with the governor’s budget and guide the finance committee’s budget process.

Overall, the meeting focused on balancing increased funding for education with accountability measures, addressing disparities in school funding, and ensuring that legislative proposals align with the governor’s budget priorities.
