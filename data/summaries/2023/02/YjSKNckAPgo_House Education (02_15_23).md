The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on February 15, 2023, focused on several key education-related bills and budget discussions. Here’s a summary of the main points:

1. **Governor’s Budget Presentation**: The committee discussed the governor’s proposed budget, which included significant increases in education funding. Key highlights included:
   - A $1,000 increase in base adequacy funding, totaling $150 million.
   - A $20 million increase in free and reduced-price lunch (F&R) aid.
   - A $20 million increase in weighted funding for special education.
   - The stabilization grant was also addressed, though details on its distribution were still pending.

2. **Bill Discussions**:
   - **HB 492**: This bill requires the Department of Education to provide the House and Senate Education Committees with copies of education laws and rules. An amendment was introduced to clarify that the books would be provided to the education committees and superintendents. The bill passed with the amendment.
   - **HB 272**: This bill addresses funding for charter public schools. An amendment was introduced to reduce the per-student funding increase from $5,141 to $4,627 to align with the governor’s budget proposal. The bill passed with the amendment.
   - **HB 529**: This bill provides additional aid grants to schools based on free and reduced-price meals and fiscal capacity disparity. An amendment was introduced to make technical corrections, add an accountability section, and ensure the grants could be used in the upcoming fiscal year. The bill passed with the amendment.
   - **HB 382**: This bill, which allows local school boards to give students release time for religious instruction, was voted to be "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) due to concerns about oversight and the bill’s sponsor’s lack of support.

3. **Accountability and Oversight**: There was significant discussion about accountability for charter schools and the need for better oversight. Concerns were raised about the lack of data on charter school performance and the fact that the Legislative Oversight Committee for charter schools had not met in several years.

4. **Consolidation of School Districts**: The committee discussed the challenges of school district consolidation in New Hampshire, noting that the state has one of the highest numbers of administrative units in the country, which drives up costs. The governor’s budget proposal included incentives for consolidation.

5. **Retained Bills**: The committee discussed several bills that had been retained for further study, including HB 437, which addresses reading instruction methods in public schools. A letter from a reading specialist was shared, urging the committee to pass the bill to improve reading instruction.

6. **Recess and Next Steps**: The committee recessed to attend a finance meeting and planned to continue discussions and executive sessions the following day.

Overall, the meeting focused on aligning education funding with the governor’s budget, addressing accountability in charter schools, and considering the impact of various education policies on New Hampshire’s school districts.
