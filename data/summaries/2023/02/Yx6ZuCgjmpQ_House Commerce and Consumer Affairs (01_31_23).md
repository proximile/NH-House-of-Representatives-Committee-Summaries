Edwards cited five existing state-level initiatives (e.g., all-payer claims database, health care cost website) that overlap with the PDAB’s mission. He criticized the PDAB for bypassing normal legislative processes and lacking scrutiny from the Ways and Means Committee.  
     - **Opposition**:  
       - **Representative Gary Merchant**, a pharmacist and PDAB chair, emphasized the need for transparency in drug pricing and the board’s role in addressing rising drug costs.  
       - **Dr. Tom Sherman**, a former state senator and PDAB member, defended the board, stating it needs infrastructure and staff to analyze confidential data and provide actionable recommendations.  
       - **Jennifer Rick** from the **National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP)** provided background on PDABs in other states, noting their role in setting prescription drug spending targets and identifying cost drivers.

   - **Key Provisions**: Consumer protections, definitions of coverage, pre-existing conditions, wellness programs, and training requirements for insurance producers.  
   - **Classification**: Pet insurance is classified as a **property and casualty product**, not health insurance.  
   - **Support**: The New Hampshire Insurance Department supports the bill, citing the rapid growth of the pet insurance industry and the need for standardized regulations.

#### **3. House Bill 210: Fire Insurance Contracts**
