The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 22, 2023, for a session that spanned a wide range of legislative discussions, memorial remarks, and votes on numerous bills. The session began with standard formalities, including a prayer by Representative Alexis Simpson, the Pledge of Allegiance, and a performance of the National Anthem by Josi and Lilly Lion.

### **Memorial Remarks and Opening Proceedings**
Representative Cushman delivered heartfelt memorial remarks for the late Representative Gary Hopper, who served seven terms and was known for his dedication to issues such as the right to life, the right to bear arms, and combating human trafficking. A moment of silence was observed, and a motion was passed to print these remarks in the permanent journal. The session also included the introduction of guests and the adoption of the Consent Calendar, with several bills removed, including HB 498-FN, HB 598, HR 7, and HR 16.

### **Key Legislative Discussions and Votes**
The House engaged in extensive debates and votes on a variety of bills, with significant attention given to issues such as healthcare, education, public safety, and economic development. Key bills discussed included:

1. **HB 565-FN-A**: This bill aimed to extend Medicaid maternity care benefits from 60 days to a full year postpartum. Supporters argued it would improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality, while opponents expressed concerns about the sustainability of Medicaid expansion. The bill passed with a roll call vote of 184-179.

2. **HB 574-FN-A**: This bill sought to re-establish the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Farmers Market Nutrition Program. Supporters highlighted its benefits for women, children, and local farmers, while opponents criticized it as a failed program with low participation. The bill was ultimately tabled after a division vote.

3. **HB 57-FN**: This bill proposed establishing a state minimum wage of $15 over three years. Supporters argued it would benefit low-wage workers and align New Hampshire with neighboring states, while opponents claimed it would harm businesses and the economy. The motion to pass failed with a roll call vote of 178-183.

4. **HB 74-FN**: This bill required employers to pay out unused earned time (vacation/sick leave) upon termination. Supporters argued it would protect workers, while opponents claimed it would burden businesses. The bill passed with a roll call vote of 187-174.

5. **HB 489-FN-A**: This bill aimed to establish a County Tourism Development Fund to promote tourism in individual counties. Supporters argued it would boost local economies, while opponents claimed it was unnecessary given existing state programs. The bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate with a roll call vote.

6. **HB 639-FN-A**: This bill proposed the legalization and regulation of cannabis, sparking a contentious debate. Supporters argued it would create a safe, regulated, and profitable industry, while opponents raised concerns about public health, safety, and the lack of a legal standard for impairment. The bill was amended and passed with a division vote.

7. **HB 581-FN**: This bill focused on the repeal of the Controlled Drug Act, with arguments highlighting the failures of the War on Drugs, including increased incarceration rates and drug-related violence. Proponents argued for redirecting resources toward prevention, education, and treatment.

8. **HB 601-FN-L**: This bill centered on the Medicaid Direct Certification Program for free and reduced-price school meals. Amendments were proposed to ensure parental opt-in and compliance with privacy laws. The bill aimed to streamline the process for students to access meals but faced concerns about privacy and federal mandates.

9. **HB 252**: This bill addressed exemptions for agricultural operations from municipal noise ordinances. An amendment proposed excluding agritourism from these exemptions to maintain local control over noise regulations. The bill aimed to support farmers while addressing community concerns.

### **Special Orders and Announcements**
House Bill 35 was moved to the first order of business for the next day to accommodate the family for whom the bill was inspired. The session concluded with announcements, unanimous consent requests, and a motion to recess until February 23, 2023, at 11:00 am.
