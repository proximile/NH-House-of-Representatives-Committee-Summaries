**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (February 7, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 7, 2023, to discuss several key bills and issues related to animal welfare, agricultural land preservation, and pet grooming standards. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting’s key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Cat Declawing (HB 231)**  
The committee debated **HB 231**, a bill aimed at banning non-therapeutic declawing of cats, with exceptions for medically necessary procedures.  

- **Support for the Bill**: Advocates, including the Humane Society and legislators, argued that declawing is a cruel and unnecessary practice, likening it to amputating a human’s fingers at the knuckle. They highlighted the long-term physical and emotional harm to cats, such as chronic pain, arthritis, balance issues, and behavioral changes like increased biting. Major veterinary associations, including the American Association of Feline Practitioners, oppose declawing, and supporters emphasized that even sparing a few cats from the procedure would justify the bill.  

- **Opposition to the Bill**: Opponents, including veterinarians and pet owner groups, argued that the bill infringes on the veterinarian-client relationship and could criminalize veterinarians for performing procedures they deem necessary. Concerns were raised about enforcement, the potential for owners to use harmful at-home declawing kits, and the slippery slope of restricting other elective animal procedures.  

- **Medical Necessity Exception**: Both sides agreed that declawing should be allowed for legitimate medical reasons, such as treating bone cancer or severe injuries, but there was debate over how to define and enforce this exception.  

- **Declining Practice**: Veterinarians noted that declawing is already rare in New Hampshire, with many practices and corporate clinics no longer offering the procedure. This decline is attributed to increased client education and the availability of alternatives like nail trimming and claw caps.  

- **Outcome**: The committee closed the hearing on HB 231 after receiving mixed feedback (2 in favor and 2 against in-person testimony; 61 in favor and 6 against online). The bill remains under consideration.

### **2. Agricultural Land Preservation (HB 221)**  
The committee discussed **HB 221**, a bill aimed at modernizing New Hampshire’s agricultural land preservation program to protect farmland and leverage federal funding opportunities.  

- **Purpose of HB 221**: The bill seeks to update the state’s outdated agricultural land preservation program, established in the 1980s, by removing statutory impediments and enabling partnerships with land trusts and federal agencies.  

- **Federal Funding Opportunities**: The bill aims to align with the USDA’s Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), which requires matching state or local funds. Without changes, New Hampshire risks losing access to federal conservation funding, particularly with anticipated increases through the upcoming Farm Bill and the Inflation Reduction Act.  

- **Conservation Easements**: The bill addresses issues with conservation easements, including the "extinguishment clause," ensuring that all stakeholders must agree to release easements. It also proposes excluding solar panels from protected farmland to preserve agricultural use.  

- **Monitoring and Staffing**: The Department of Agriculture lacks the capacity to monitor conservation easements, so the bill would allow land trusts to handle this responsibility. The department is also hiring a part-time staff member to assist with rulemaking and administrative processes.  

- **Support for the Bill**: Stakeholders expressed strong support for HB 221, emphasizing its importance in preserving farmland, ensuring food security, and aligning with modern conservation practices.

### **3. Anticoagulant Rodenticides (HB 326)**  
The committee addressed **HB 326**, which proposes banning second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides due to their harmful effects on wildlife.  

- **Issue**: Anticoagulant rodenticides pose significant risks to non-target animals, such as raptors, foxes, and other wildlife. These chemicals are often purchased in bulk by homeowners, leading to unintended ecological harm.  

- **Working Group**: A working group, led by Director Russo and including representatives from the Audubon Society and wildlife rehabilitators, has been tasked with providing recommendations by August 1st. These may include restrictions on sales, changes to state laws, or federal advocacy.  

- **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain HB 326, keeping it active for potential legislative action if the working group identifies a need for statutory changes.

### **4. Companion Animal Grooming Standards (HB 37)**  
The committee considered **HB 37**, which proposes establishing a committee to study best practices for companion animal groomers.  

- **Background**: The bill was inspired by a tragic incident where a dog died in a groomer’s care, highlighting the lack of regulation in the pet grooming industry.  

- **Key Issues**:  
  - New Hampshire has no licensing or standard of care for groomers, leading to preventable tragedies.  
  - The industry is diverse, with groomers coming from apprenticeships, self-taught backgrounds, or formal training.  
  - Certification programs are costly, potentially barring entry for many groomers.  

- **Proposals**:  
  - Develop a list of best practices, such as supervision, cleanliness, and reporting health issues.  
  - The Department of Agriculture could issue certificates of best practices, with inspections triggered by complaints.  
  - Encourage groomers to form professional organizations to set standards.  

- **Outcome**: The committee will hold executive sessions to further discuss the bill and finalize recommendations by March.

### **Additional Committee Business**  
- The committee scheduled hearings for other bills, including **HB 253** (EPR bill) and landfill-related legislation, with an executive session planned for February 28th.  
- The meeting concluded with acknowledgment of Representative Brouillard’s upcoming parenthood and a reminder of the committee’s busy March schedule.

### **Key Themes**  
1. **Animal Welfare**: Discussions on cat declawing, anticoagulant rodenticides, and pet grooming standards all centered on protecting animals from harm.  
2. **Legislative Process**: The committee emphasized collaboration with stakeholders, such as the working group on rodenticides, to ensure informed decision-making.  
3. **Balancing Interests**: Debates highlighted the need to balance animal welfare with practical concerns, such as public health, veterinary autonomy, and economic impacts on small businesses.  
4. **Modernization and Regulation**: Efforts to update agricultural land preservation programs and establish grooming standards reflect a broader push for modernization and accountability in state policies.  

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing complex issues through thoughtful deliberation and stakeholder engagement.
