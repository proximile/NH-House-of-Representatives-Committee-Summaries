The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 7, 2023, to discuss several bills addressing animal welfare, agricultural preservation, and pet grooming standards. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **House Bill 231: Prohibition of Non-Therapeutic Declawing of Cats**
The committee debated **House Bill 231**, which seeks to ban the non-therapeutic declawing of cats in New Hampshire, with exceptions for medical necessity. Key points included:
- **Introduction and Support**: Representative Mike Bordes introduced the bill, describing declawing as a cruel and unnecessary procedure akin to amputating a human finger. Advocates, including the New Hampshire Animal Rights League, emphasized the long-term physical and emotional harm to cats, such as arthritis and behavioral changes. They highlighted that many states and countries have already banned the practice, and alternatives like scratching posts and furniture covers exist.
- **Opposition and Concerns**: Opponents, such as Nancy Holmes, argued that declawing should remain a decision between veterinarians and pet owners, particularly for elderly or immunocompromised individuals. They expressed concerns that banning the procedure could lead to more cats being abandoned or euthanized. Some veterinarians also testified that declawing is rarely performed and that the bill might constitute government overreach.
- **Veterinary Perspectives**: While some veterinarians supported the bill, others argued that declawing should remain an option in specific medical cases. Opponents raised concerns about enforcement and the potential criminalization of veterinarians.
- **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on the bill but retained it for further consideration, allowing stakeholders to provide additional input.

### **House Bill 221: Acquisition of Agricultural Land Development Rights**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 221**, which aims to modernize New Hampshire’s agricultural land preservation program by removing statutory barriers and enabling collaboration with land trusts. Key points included:
- **Purpose and Proposed Changes**: The bill would allow the state to hold a right of enforcement for agricultural land development rights, making it easier to leverage federal funding programs like the USDA’s Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). This would unlock over $1.75 million in state funds and enable federal matching.
- **Farmland Loss and Conservation**: New Hampshire has lost 90% of its farmland since 1925, with an additional 35,000 acres projected to be lost by 2040. The bill emphasizes the importance of preserving farmland for food security and clarifies that conservation easements are perpetual, with exceptions requiring judicial approval.
- **Solar Panels and Land Trusts**: Concerns were raised about solar panels on protected farmland, which the Department of Agriculture opposes. The bill also proposes adding a representative from the New Hampshire Land Trust Coalition to the advisory board to enhance expertise in modern land conservation practices.
- **Outcome**: The committee expressed support for the bill and plans to draft an amendment to refine the language.

### **House Bill 37: Study of Best Practices for Companion Animal Groomers**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 37**, which proposes establishing a committee to study best practices for companion animal groomers. The bill was introduced by Representative Jim Maggiore in response to a tragic incident involving a dog named Teddy, who died while in the care of a groomer in 2018. Key points included:
- **Purpose and Industry Overview**: The bill aims to study best practices for pet groomers, addressing safety, health, and accountability. While there are approximately 1,430 animal caretakers in New Hampshire, there is no standardized licensing or regulation for groomers.
- **Tragic Incidents and Regulation Debate**: Multiple cases of pets dying or being injured in grooming facilities were cited, highlighting the need for better oversight. Some representatives expressed concerns about overregulation and the potential burden on small businesses, while others advocated for a balanced approach, such as creating a certificate of best practices.
- **Proposed Solutions and Next Steps**: Ideas included involving groomers and industry organizations in developing best practices, issuing certificates through the Department of Agriculture, and conducting inspections only in response to complaints. The committee plans to hold further hearings and work sessions to refine the bill.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on ethical, practical, and legal considerations in animal welfare and agricultural preservation. While the declawing bill sparked intense debate, the agricultural preservation and grooming bills received broad support, with plans for further refinement and stakeholder input. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing regulation, public safety, and industry concerns in shaping effective policies.
