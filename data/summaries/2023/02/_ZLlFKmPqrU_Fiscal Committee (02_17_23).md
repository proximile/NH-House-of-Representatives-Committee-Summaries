**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting on February 17, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on February 17, 2023, addressing a wide range of financial and administrative topics. The meeting, which began at 10:00 AM, was structured around several key discussions, including ESG reporting, state financial updates, consent calendar items, and detailed deliberations on specific fiscal matters. Here’s a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **Key Discussions and Updates**

1. **ESG Reporting and Audits**:
   - The committee clarified that current financial audits focus solely on financial statements and do not include Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) components. While the SEC has disclosure requirements for public companies, there is no state or federal mandate requiring ESG auditing in the context of the discussed audits.

2. **State Treasurer’s Report**:
   - State Treasurer Monica Mazzapelli provided positive updates on the state’s financial management. She highlighted the success of the state’s 529 plan, which is the fourth largest in the country with $21 billion under management and is recovering well despite a challenging year. Additionally, $19 million in revenue share was distributed for scholarships, benefiting over 7,200 New Hampshire students. Plans to expand scholarship eligibility and increase award amounts were also discussed.

3. **ESG in State-Managed Investments**:
   - The committee addressed whether New Hampshire law requires or avoids ESG principles in state-managed investments. It was noted that there is no specific regulation on ESG, but Fidelity Investments offers a standalone ESG portfolio as an option for participants based on demand rather than legal requirements.

4. **Consent Calendar and Removed Items**:
   - Most consent calendar items were routine, but several were removed for further discussion:
     - **FIS 23064 (Department of Transportation)**: Questions were raised about the exclusion of certain projects, particularly in Manchester. The DOT explained the vetting process and promised follow-up information.
     - **FIS 23044 (Department of Health and Human Services)**: Concerns about administrative overhead and funding shifts were addressed, with DHHS clarifying the federal grant budget process. The item was approved.
     - **FIS 23050 (Administrative Services)**: The committee discussed upgrading the state’s 14-year-old financial payroll system, including costs and options. The item was approved.
     - **FIS 23065 (Department of Transportation)**: Increased salt costs and overtime benefits were discussed, along with high vacancy rates and reliance on contractors. The item was approved.

5. **Regular Calendar**:
   - **FIS 23061 (Department of Safety)**: Adopted without significant discussion.
   - **FIS 23065 (Department of Transportation)**: Further discussion on increased salt costs and benefits led to its adoption.

6. **Informational Items**:
   - The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) Audit Division was recognized for their work on the Adult Parole Board audit.
   - PWC presented the College Savings Plans audit, which reported no significant issues and received an unqualified opinion. The audit was well-received, with no major changes or issues noted.
