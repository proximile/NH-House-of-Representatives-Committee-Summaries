The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on February 1, 2023, covered a wide range of topics, including environmental management, judicial operations, election administration, and the state’s retirement system. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions from the meeting:

---

### **Environmental Management and Department of Environmental Services (DES)**
The meeting began with a focus on the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**, highlighting its critical role in managing New Hampshire’s natural resources. Key points included:

1. **State Revolving Fund (SRF) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)**: The SRF program, primarily a loan program for wastewater and drinking water systems, was discussed alongside opportunities from the IRA, including funding for resilience in flood zones, environmental justice, and addressing emerging contaminants like PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). New Hampshire has some of the strictest PFAS standards in the country, and the state anticipates adopting new federal standards once finalized by the EPA.

2. **Budget Overview**: DES presented its efficiency budget for 2024-2025, requesting $271 million for 2024 and slightly more for 2025. The department manages over 21,000 permits annually, 35 state laws, and 115 federal grants, with funding primarily from permits, fees, and federal sources.

3. **Divisions Within DES**:
   - **Air Division**: Responsible for implementing air quality standards, monitoring pollution, and ensuring compliance through permitting and inspections.
   - **Water Division**: The largest division, overseeing public water supplies, wastewater treatment, dam safety, and the state-owned Winnipesaukee River Basin wastewater treatment plant.
   - **Waste Management Division**: Focused on solid and hazardous waste management, including PFAS contamination, petroleum storage tanks, and emergency response capabilities.

4. **PFAS Challenges**: The strain on wastewater treatment and landfill systems due to PFAS contamination was emphasized, with concerns about the limitations of current technology to effectively treat PFAS in wastewater plants.

### **Judicial Branch Operations and Challenges**
The **Judicial Branch** presented its structure, challenges, and budget requests, emphasizing the need for increased staffing and resources to manage its caseload effectively. Key points included:

1. **Court Structure**: The Judicial Branch comprises the Circuit Court (handling 90% of cases), Superior Court (jury trials and major felonies), Supreme Court (appellate cases), and the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), which supports court operations and security.

2. **Caseload and Staffing**: A 2022 weighted caseload study revealed a need for 50 additional judges and staff to handle the current workload. The branch requested funding for seven new Circuit Court judges, one Superior Court judge, and additional clerical staff to address staffing shortages.

3. **Pandemic Response and Technology**: The Judicial Branch invested in technology during the pandemic, enabling remote operations and electronic filing systems. However, staffing shortages, particularly in critical roles like the information center, remain a challenge.

4. **Treatment Courts**: New Hampshire’s drug courts, mental health courts, and family treatment courts were highlighted for their success in reducing recidivism and addressing substance use and mental health issues.

5. **Access to Justice**: Many litigants appear in court without legal representation, particularly in cases involving eviction, domestic violence, and family law. Pilot programs allowing paraprofessionals to represent clients and expanding legal resources are being implemented to improve access.

6. **Innovative Programs**: The branch is focusing on eviction diversion, mediation, and civic engagement to resolve disputes before they reach court and educate the public about the judicial system.

### **Election Management and Technology**
The **Secretary of State’s office** provided updates on election management and technology, emphasizing transparency and accessibility. Key points included:

1. **Centralized Voter Database**: The state is transitioning to a new centralized voter database and testing new ballot counting devices to improve efficiency and accuracy.

2. **Post-Election Audits**: Mandated post-election audits using high-speed scanners were successfully conducted, though the tight timeframe between elections and recounts poses challenges.

3. **Help America Vote Act (HAVA) Funds**: The state is using federal HAVA funds to support election infrastructure, including voter education, poll worker training, and accessibility enhancements for voters with disabilities.

4. **Electronic Poll Books**: The use of electronic poll books is expanding, streamlining voter check-in processes and improving election administration.

### **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**
The **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)** was a major focus, with discussions on funding, liabilities, and challenges. Key points included:

1. **Unfunded Liability**: The NHRS faces a significant unfunded liability of $5.69 billion, with a funded ratio of 65.6%. Policy decisions, market fluctuations, and reductions in the assumed rate of return have contributed to this issue.

2. **Investment Management**: The NHRS Board of Trustees oversees the investment strategy, which has seen strong long-term returns despite a negative return of 6.1% in fiscal year 2022. Actuarial smoothing is used to stabilize employer rates.

3. **Employer Contribution Rates**: For fiscal years 2024-2025, employer rates range from 16.05% for Group 1 employees to 35.90% for Group 2 firefighters. The unfunded liability accounts for 77-85% of total pension costs.

4. **Deferred Compensation Plan**: The voluntary 457 plan for state employees has grown significantly, with assets of $448 million. It operates similarly to a 401(k) and does not affect pension benefits or Social Security.

5. **Progress and Challenges**: The NHRS has made steady progress in improving its funded ratio, from 54.7% in 2012 to 65.6% in 2022. However, achieving full funding by 2039 will require continued fiscal discipline and addressing market fluctuations.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the state’s efforts to manage environmental challenges, modernize election infrastructure, address judicial staffing shortages, and stabilize the retirement system. Each segment highlighted the importance of efficient resource allocation, proactive planning, and collaboration with federal and state agencies to meet New Hampshire’s needs effectively.
