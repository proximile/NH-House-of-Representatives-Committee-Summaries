### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (02/07/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on February 7, 2023, addressed a wide range of bills related to vehicle safety, driver’s licenses, and transportation infrastructure. The discussions centered on medical exemptions for window tinting, child passenger safety, Real ID compliance, driver’s licenses for immigrants, electric vehicle (EV) charging, and vehicle inspections. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **Window Tinting Bills**
1. **House Bill 370 FN: Aftermarket Window Tinting for Medical Conditions**  
   - **Purpose**: Restore exemptions for side window tinting for drivers with medical conditions, which were inadvertently removed in a 2021 amendment.  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Yokella argued that the 2021 amendment eliminated medical waivers for side window tinting, causing issues for individuals who rely on tinting for medical reasons.  
   - **Proposed Changes**: Reintroduce language allowing medical practitioners to attest to the need for tinting, rather than requiring commissioner approval.  
   - **Testimony**: The Department of Safety supported restoring medical waivers but expressed concerns about removing the commissioner’s ability to review suspicious cases.  

2. **House Bill 537: Front Windshield Tinting**  
   - **Purpose**: Allow front windshield tinting using ceramic films that block ultraviolet (UV) and infrared light without significantly reducing visible light transmittance.  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Hole introduced the bill on behalf of a constituent seeking UV and infrared protection.  
   - **Testimony**: Industry representatives opposed the bill, citing costs and potential visibility issues. The Department of Safety raised concerns about enforcement and fraud.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee planned further discussions to refine the bill and align it with existing standards (70% light transmittance).

### **Child Passenger Safety and Real ID**
1. **House Bill 386: Child Passenger Safety**  
   - **Purpose**: Lower the age requirement for child passenger restraints from seven to four years old.  
   - **Testimony**: Opponents, including child safety experts and AAA, argued that lowering the age could reduce safety, as children aged 4-8 are particularly vulnerable in crashes. They emphasized the importance of booster seats until age 12 or height of 4’9”.  

2. **House Bill 570: Real ID Compliance**  
   - **Purpose**: Align New Hampshire’s Real ID requirements with federal standards, particularly for non-citizens lawfully residing in the U.S.

2. **House Bill 374: Driver’s Licenses for Undocumented Immigrants**  
   - **Purpose**: Allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses while restricting information sharing with immigration authorities.  
   - **Discussion**: Supporters argued it promotes public safety by ensuring drivers are tested and insured. Opponents expressed concerns about granting licenses to undocumented individuals.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted to recommend "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).
