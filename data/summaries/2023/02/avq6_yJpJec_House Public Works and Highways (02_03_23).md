The **New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee** meeting on **February 3, 2023**, addressed a wide range of infrastructure and transportation issues, focusing on electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, passenger rail projects, road toll adjustments, and local infrastructure improvements. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure and Funding**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill 606**, which mandates the inclusion of EV charging infrastructure in state-funded construction projects. Key points included:
- **EV Readiness**: The bill emphasizes laying essential electrical infrastructure during initial construction to avoid costly retrofitting, focusing on home charging rather than public stations.
- **Funding Challenges**: Concerns were raised about who should finance EV infrastructure, particularly in apartment complexes and parking garages, with electric companies potentially benefiting from increased electricity sales.
- **Definitions and Requirements**: Representatives clarified terms like "EV ready," "EV capable," and "EV installed," ensuring minimal above-ground infrastructure requirements.

Additionally, the committee discussed broader EV funding mechanisms, including proposals to impose fees on EV registration or public charging stations to ensure EV drivers contribute to road maintenance, as they do not pay gas taxes. Opponents, like Representative Timothy Horrigan, argued that such fees could be regressive and hinder infrastructure development, suggesting mileage-based fees as an alternative. The committee also explored using state property and public-private partnerships to incentivize investment in EV charging infrastructure.

### **Passenger Rail Projects**
The committee debated **House Bill 110**, which seeks to prohibit state funding for new passenger rail projects, particularly the proposed commuter rail connecting Nashua and Manchester to Lowell, Massachusetts. Key points included:
- **Opposition to State Funding**: Critics argued that rail projects are economically unviable due to low population density and high subsidies, with the MBTA in Boston relying on 91% subsidies. They emphasized that rail would primarily benefit southern New Hampshire while burdening all taxpayers.
- **Support for Rail Development**: Proponents highlighted the economic benefits of rail, including job creation, reduced traffic congestion, and enhanced connectivity to Boston. They cited the success of the Amtrak Downeaster as evidence of rail’s viability.
- **Environmental and Equity Benefits**: Advocates emphasized rail’s potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide transportation options for vulnerable populations.
- **Federal and State Priorities**: Opponents of the bill noted that it could conflict with federal infrastructure laws and limit future legislators’ ability to pursue rail projects, which are already prioritized in the state’s 10-year transportation plan.

The committee ultimately retained the bill (17-1) for further discussion, reflecting ongoing tension between rail as an economic driver and concerns about fiscal responsibility.

### **Road Toll Adjustments**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 62**, which proposed reducing the gas tax (road toll) from 22.4 cents to 18 cents, offsetting lost revenue with transfers from the general fund. Key points included:
- **Opposition to the Bill**: Stakeholders, including the NH Department of Transportation (NHDOT), engineering firms, and contractors, argued that the gas tax is a critical user fee for road maintenance and infrastructure projects. They expressed concerns about financial uncertainty, bond rating impacts, and shifting the burden to New Hampshire taxpayers.
- **Minimal Consumer Savings**: The bill’s potential savings for consumers were deemed insignificant (approximately $20/year), while its long-term financial implications were seen as detrimental.
The committee voted unanimously (19-0) to kill the bill, emphasizing the importance of stable funding for infrastructure projects.

### **Local Infrastructure Projects**
The committee discussed several local infrastructure issues, including:
- **Roundabout vs. Traffic Signal in Conway**: The NH DOT proposed a roundabout at a problematic intersection, citing safety benefits over a traffic signal. However, local residents and truck drivers expressed concerns about the roundabout’s size and functionality for large vehicles. The committee emphasized the need for a solution balancing safety, cost, and community preferences.
- **House Bill 480**: This bill sought to replace a planned roundabout with a traffic signal at the intersection of Route 302 and East Conway Road. Opponents, including the Conway town engineer, argued that the roundabout design had been carefully vetted and adjusted to accommodate large vehicles, making it the safer and more efficient option.

### **Other Key Discussions**
- **Complete Streets Program**: The committee debated **House Bill 511**, which aims to integrate the Complete Streets program into road maintenance, prioritizing pedestrian, bicycle, and multi-modal transportation. The NH DOT opposed the bill due to technical issues and concerns about increased workload, though it highlighted its existing commitment to multimodal transportation.
- **Peace Development Authority (PDA) Representation**: The committee discussed proposals to ensure representation for towns like Rye and Newcastle on the PDA board, with some advocating for direct input rather than indirect reporting.

### **Committee Actions**
The committee voted on several bills:
- **House Bill 20**: Passed unanimously (19-0) to name a bridge in Merrimack after The Honorable Richard “Dick” Hinch.
- **House Bill 456**: Retained (19-0) to study collecting road tolls on EV chargers.
- **House Bill 110**: Retained (17-1) to prohibit state funding for new passenger rail projects.
- **House Bill 62**: Killed (19-0) due to concerns about financial stability and road funding.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of modernizing New Hampshire’s infrastructure while balancing fiscal responsibility, community needs, and long-term sustainability. Key themes included the transition to EV infrastructure, the viability of passenger rail, the importance of stable funding for road maintenance, and the need for community input in local infrastructure projects. The committee demonstrated bipartisan cooperation, focusing on practical solutions and alignment with state priorities.
