**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee Meeting (02/10/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee convened on February 10, 2023, to discuss and vote on a series of measures. The meeting was marked by procedural votes, substantive debates, and reflections on the committee’s collaborative and respectful environment. Below is a detailed summary of the key highlights:

### **Voting on Measures and Resolutions**
1. **HR 15 and HR 16**:  
   - **HR 15**: This resolution aimed to affirm support against the establishment of a state religion, referencing Marxism. A motion to **ITL** (Inexpedient to Legislate) was made, with arguments that the bill appealed to a narrow audience and lacked broad support. The ITL motion passed 14-3.  
   - **HR 16**: This resolution addressed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Critics argued it was convoluted and unlikely to influence the IRS. The ITL motion passed 16-1.  

2. **Delegates to Conventions of States (HB 269 and HB 392)**:  
   - The committee discussed two bills related to delegates for Article 5 constitutional conventions. HB 269 broadly addressed conventions but lacked depth, while HB 392 focused specifically on Article 5 conventions and included stricter controls over delegates.  
   - Amendments were introduced to clarify delegate election processes and penalties for violating oaths. HB 392’s amendment adjusted the number of delegates per congressional district and differentiated penalties based on intent (misdemeanor for knowingly violating, felony for purposefully violating). Both bills passed with amendments, emphasizing democratic oversight of delegates.  

3. **Recognition of Native American Band (HCR 7)**:  
   - A resolution recognizing the Nowhegan Band of the Classic Abenaki Nation was debated. Concerns were raised about the resolution potentially interfering in tribal disputes. The committee voted to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the resolution, suggesting tribal recognition be addressed through a more comprehensive process.  

4. **Protection of Social Security and Medicare (HR 7)**:  
   - A resolution calling on the federal government to preserve Social Security and Medicare without benefit cuts was discussed. The resolution passed unanimously, with members emphasizing the importance of protecting these programs for older Americans.  

5. **Term Limits for Congress (HCR 4)**:  
   - A resolution calling for a convention of states to impose term limits on Congress was reconsidered after being previously retained. An amendment corrected drafting errors, and the committee voted to pass the amended resolution. Supporters argued term limits would serve as a check on government power, while opponents viewed them as undemocratic and limiting voter choice.  

### **Committee Dynamics and Closing Remarks**  
- Representatives expressed appreciation for the committee’s collaborative and cordial atmosphere, highlighting positive experiences and effective teamwork.  
- The chair thanked members for their work, acknowledged the potential for future business in April, and adjourned the session.  

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
- **Procedural Safeguards**: The committee emphasized the importance of democratic oversight and clarity in legislation, particularly in bills like HB 269 and HB 392.  
- **Protection of Federal Programs**: Unanimous support for HR 7 underscored the committee’s commitment to preserving Social Security and Medicare.  
- **Differing Views on Reform**: Debates over term limits (HCR 4) and tribal recognition (HCR 7) highlighted varying perspectives on government reform and cultural acknowledgment.  
- **Collaborative Environment**: The meeting was characterized by a respectful and productive atmosphere, with members acknowledging the value of teamwork and constructive dialogue.  

Overall, the session reflected the committee’s focus on addressing state-federal relations, veterans’ affairs, and broader governance issues while maintaining a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.
