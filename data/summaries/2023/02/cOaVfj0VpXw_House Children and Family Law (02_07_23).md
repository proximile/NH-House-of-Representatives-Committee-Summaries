The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 7, 2023, focused on several bills related to children, family law, and the use of restraints in schools and treatment facilities.

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 218: Personal Transcripts in Court**
- **Purpose**: The bill sought to make personal transcripts admissible in court.
- **Concerns**: Committee members raised issues about proving the accuracy of transcripts and potential misuse.
- **Outcome**: An amendment to the bill failed (9-7), but the original bill passed unanimously (16-0) and moved to the consent calendar.

#### **House Bill 108: Penalties for False Reports to DCYF**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to impose penalties for making false reports to the Division of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).
- **Debate**: Concerns were raised about the potential chilling effect on reporting versus the need to deter malicious reports.
- **Outcome**: The bill narrowly passed (9-8).

#### **House Bill 126: Child Support Payment Dates**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposed allowing parents to choose child support payment dates (either the 1st or 15th of the month).
- **Concerns**: Potential conflicts and the need for consistency were discussed.
- **Outcome**: The bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate (15-1).

#### **House Bill 124: Temporary Alimony**
- **Purpose**: The bill allowed courts to deviate from the standard alimony formula if immediate economic harm would result.
- **Debate**: The committee discussed fairness and the implications of the bill.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed narrowly (9-8).

#### **House Bill 491: Prohibition of Prone Restraint**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to explicitly ban prone restraint (holding a child face down) in schools and treatment facilities, citing its life-threatening risks.
- **Key Points**:
  - Prone restraint can cause severe physical harm or death, particularly in children with trauma or mental health issues.
  - Current law (RSA 126-U) lacks clarity, leading to inconsistent enforcement.
  - Medical experts, including Dr. Thomas Andrew, highlighted the dangers of prone restraint.
  - Many facilities have already stopped using prone restraint, but clearer legal language is needed to ensure compliance.
  - The bill emphasizes training staff in de-escalation techniques and safer alternatives.
  - The bill received unanimous support (16-0) and passed with an amendment to clarify its intent.

#### **House Bill 490: Definition of Neglect**
- **Purpose**: The bill sought to modify the definition of neglect to clarify when parents can allow children to engage in activities like walking to school or riding bikes alone.
- **Concerns**: DCYF testified that they do not file neglect cases for “free-range” children, and the proposed changes would complicate their work.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 14-2 to recommend “inexpedient to legislate” (ITL).

#### **House Bill 551: DCYF Data Tracking**
- **Purpose**: The bill required DCYF to track and publish detailed child welfare statistics.
- **Concerns**: DCYF representatives cited feasibility issues and high costs (e.g., $1 million for a new website).
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to recommend ITL.

#### **House Bill 306: Prohibition of Reunification Therapy**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to ban reunification therapy, a non-evidence-based practice often ordered by courts in cases involving abused children and their abusers.
- **Key Points**:
  - Reunification therapy is criticized as unethical and harmful, often forcing families to pay out-of-pocket for unlicensed therapy.
  - Experts, including representatives from the New Hampshire Psychological Association and the National Association of Social Workers, testified against the practice.
  - The judicial branch expressed concerns about the bill’s broad language and potential unintended consequences.
  - The committee decided to retain the bill for further refinement to clarify its scope and intent.

4. **Judicial Role**: Judges were urged to avoid ordering specific therapies and instead focus on assessments and licensed interventions.
5. **Balancing Rights**: Discussions often centered on balancing the need for protection and fairness with concerns about unintended consequences, such as chilling effects on reporting or complicating DCYF’s work.
