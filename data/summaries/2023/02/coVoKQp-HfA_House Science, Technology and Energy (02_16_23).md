The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 16, 2023, to discuss and vote on several bills related to energy, technology, and environmental policies. The meeting highlighted the committee's efforts to balance transparency, cost, and practicality in various legislative proposals, often reaching compromises to move bills forward despite differing opinions. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 139 (HB 139)**  
The committee reconsidered its earlier decision on this bill, which had previously been concluded without recommendation. A proposed amendment aimed to allow municipalities to install solar arrays in neighboring towns if their own town lacked space. Concerns were raised about the requirement for municipalities to own the solar panels outright, which could hinder financial viability. The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to reconsider the bill and recessed the executive session until March 7th.

#### **House Bill 208 (HB 208)**  
This bill addressed climate action planning and renewable energy transition. It faced significant opposition due to concerns about funding and the need for additional staff. After multiple votes, the committee decided to send the bill to the House floor without recommendation, with a 10-10 split on motions to recommend or oppose the bill.

#### **House Bill 298 (HB 298)**  
This bill focused on modifying the application process for wireless service facilities. An amendment was proposed to remove certain requirements and clarify language, particularly regarding environmentally sensitive areas. The committee adopted the amendment unanimously (20-0) but later split 10-10 on whether to recommend the bill. The bill was sent to the House floor without recommendation.

#### **House Bill 233 (HB 233)**  
The committee discussed a bill related to the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) and thermal energy credits (T-RECs). An amendment was proposed to differentiate between large and small thermal systems, allowing small systems to qualify for T-RECs without needing meters. The amendment was adopted (17-3), and the bill was recommended for passage (19-1).

#### **House Bill 257 (HB 257)**  
This bill addressed telephone carrier of last resort obligations. The committee decided to form a study committee to explore potential solutions, recessing the executive session until March 7th.

#### **House Bill 251 (HB 251)**  
The committee discussed a bill requiring utilities to include the annual estimated cost of the RPS on electric bills. An amendment was proposed to add a dollar figure based on average consumption. While some members expressed concerns about the accuracy and usefulness of the average figure, the amendment was adopted, and the bill was recommended for passage.

#### **House Bill 631 (HB 631)**  
This bill aimed to require electric utilities to offer customers the option to purchase and install smart meter gateway devices. The bill does not mandate smart meters but ensures customers have the option to purchase them, with the customer bearing the cost (approximately $200). Eversource opposed the bill, citing concerns about the need for significant system upgrades to support smart meters. The committee called for further discussion, potential amendments, and subcommittee work to refine the bill.

#### **House Bill 159 (HB 159)**  
This bill sought to address volatility in electricity rates by using a five-year average of ISO New England retail rates to set default service rates. The Department of Energy raised constitutional concerns, suggesting the bill could result in an "unconstitutional taking" under the Fifth Amendment. The Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) and Sierra Club supported the bill, emphasizing the need to protect consumers from sudden rate spikes. The committee planned to hold executive sessions on several other bills, including those related to renewable energy, utility planning, and carbon pricing mechanisms.

#### **House Bill 605 (HB 605)**  
This bill proposed changes to solar generation under the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The committee debated the bill extensively, with arguments centered on its fiscal impact, alignment with renewable energy goals, and potential benefits or drawbacks for ratepayers. The committee voted on three motions related to HB 605:
- **Motion to ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**: Failed 10-10.
- **Motion to OTP (Ought to Pass)**: Failed 10-10.
- **Motion to Retain**: Failed 5-15, meaning the bill will proceed to the House floor **without recommendation**.

#### **House Bill 263 (HB 263)**  
This bill required notification to renewable energy customer generators about issues related to renewable energy credits. The motion to pass the bill failed with a tie vote of 10-10. The bill was ultimately judged as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) by a vote of 19-1.

#### **House Bill 281 (HB 281)**  
This bill sought to repeal the least cost integrated resource planning statute. After extensive debate, the motion to pass the bill failed with a tie vote of 10-10, and the motion to retain the bill also failed with a tie vote of 10-10. The bill will go to the house floor with no recommendation.

#### **House Bill 443 (HB 443)**  
This bill proposed establishing a commission to study the withdrawal of New Hampshire from ISO New England. An amendment to extend the commission's timeframe and add funding for contract services was rejected by a vote of 10-10. The motion to pass the bill also failed with a tie vote of 10-10. The bill was ultimately judged as ITL by a vote of 19-1.

#### **House Bill 372 (HB 372)**  
This bill aimed to establish a commission to study the impacts of pending national and regional carbon pricing mechanisms on New Hampshire. An amendment to add positions for the Department of Energy and Department of Health and Human Services and extend the reporting period was rejected by a vote of 10-10. The motion to pass the bill failed with a tie vote of 10-10, and the motion to retain the bill also failed with a tie vote of 10-10. The bill will go to the house floor with no recommendation.

### **Overall Themes**
- **Energy Cost Volatility**: Several bills addressed concerns about the unpredictability of electricity prices and the financial burden on consumers.
- **Consumer Choice vs. Utility Readiness**: Bills like HB 631 emphasized consumer choice in adopting smart meters, while others like HB 159 focused on stabilizing rates, highlighting the need for utility readiness and potential system upgrades.
- **Legislative Challenges**: Many bills faced opposition due to legal, technical, and financial concerns, with stakeholders calling for further study and potential amendments to address these issues.
- **Renewable Energy Goals**: The committee grappled with balancing the state's renewable energy goals with the fiscal impact on ratepayers, often reaching compromises to move bills forward.

The meeting concluded with a call for further discussion, potential amendments, and subcommittee work to refine the bills, reflecting the committee's commitment to addressing complex energy and technology issues in a balanced and practical manner.
