### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (02/13/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on February 13, 2023, focused on a wide range of education-related bills and issues, including improving academic outcomes, addressing teacher shortages, enhancing mental health services, and refining policies for charter schools and non-academic surveys. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes:

---

### **Improving Academic Outcomes and Equity**
1. **HB 552: Incentive Grants for School Districts**  
   - Establishes a fund to reward schools demonstrating measurable improvement in math achievement.  
   - Schools compete against their own baseline scores, with rewards usable at the district’s discretion.  
   - Concerns were raised about equity, as schools with fewer resources might have more room for improvement.  
   - Opponents suggested funds might be better spent on addressing teacher shortages or providing resources for math education.  

2. **HB 371: Commission to Evaluate Public School Standards**  
   - Creates an independent commission to review and update the **306 rules**, which set minimum standards for public school approval.  
   - Aims to ensure transparency, public input, and alignment with New Hampshire’s tradition of academic excellence.  
   - Concerns were raised about potential changes to special education rights, discipline policies, and the removal of competency standards in core subjects.  

3. **Dyslexia Intervention Bill**  
   - Mandates early screening for dyslexia within 60 days of a student entering public school, with follow-up interventions as needed.  
   - Emphasizes the use of evidence-based reading interventions and timely communication with parents.  
   - Addresses challenges faced by resource-limited districts in providing immediate support.

### **Addressing Teacher Shortages**
1. **HB 623: Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program**  
   - Proposes a loan reimbursement program to incentivize teachers to work in rural, underperforming, or high-need districts (e.g., math, science, special education).  
   - Features a tiered reimbursement structure, increasing with each year of service, up to $12,000 over four years.  
   - Discussions focused on refining eligibility criteria to include urban schools with similar challenges and ensuring clarity and equity in the program.  

2. **General Strategies**  
   - Emphasized the need for data-driven decisions to retain educators in underserved districts.  
   - Considered upfront loans versus annual payments to ensure sustained support for teachers.

### **Mental Health Services in Schools**
1. **Role of School Psychologists and Mental Health Services**  
   - Schools primarily focus on educational evaluations and special education processes, contracting with local providers for mental health services due to funding or geographic limitations.  
   - Youth Mental Health First Aid training, facilitated by Justice Broderick and Dartmouth-Hitchcock, helps students support each other.  

2. **Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)**  
   - An anonymous, aggregate survey administered by the CDC to understand student behaviors and emotional well-being.  
   - Data is shared with schools in a way that protects student privacy and informs broader community health initiatives.

### **Charter School Policies**
1. **HB 550: Charter School Dissolution**  
   - Standardizes the process for handling assets when a charter school closes, ensuring transparency and accountability.  
   - Proposes that remaining state-funded assets revert to the state, with oversight by the Department of Justice’s Charitable Trust Division.  
   - Highlights the need for early warning systems to prevent charter school insolvency.  

2. **Financial Oversight**  
   - The Charitable Trust Division monitors charter schools’ financial health and ensures compliance with legal requirements.

   - Debates centered on the role of schools in addressing mental health needs versus maintaining privacy and academic focus.

### **Religious Instruction in Schools**
1. **HB 382 and HB 634: Religious Instruction Credit**  
   - Allow students to receive elective credit for religious instruction conducted off school premises, in line with the *Zorach v. Clauson* Supreme Court decision.  
   - Ensures that costs are not borne by taxpayers and that no single religion is favored.

### **General Themes**
- **Equity and Transparency**: A recurring emphasis on addressing disparities in resources and outcomes across districts, as well as ensuring public involvement in education policy decisions.  
- **Local Control**: Strong support for allowing districts flexibility in how they use rewards or implement standards.
