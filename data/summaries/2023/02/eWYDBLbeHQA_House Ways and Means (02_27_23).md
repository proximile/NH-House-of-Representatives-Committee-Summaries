**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (February 27, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on February 27, 2023, to discuss a wide range of budgetary and revenue-related matters for fiscal years 2023-2025. The meeting was marked by detailed discussions on revenue projections, budget adjustments, and the economic factors influencing the state’s financial outlook. Key topics included fee structures, tax revenues, lottery and gambling income, personnel changes, and the challenges of forecasting in a volatile economic environment.

### **Revenue and Budget Discussions**
The committee reviewed revenue estimates across various categories, including business taxes, meals and rooms tax, tobacco tax, and liquor revenue. Historical data, economic trends, and external factors such as inflation, consumer behavior, and regional variations were considered. For instance, declining tobacco tax revenues were attributed to shifts in consumer preferences away from traditional cigarettes, while the meals and rooms tax was analyzed in the context of inflation’s impact on restaurant spending.

James Gary, the State Budget Director, presented the governor’s revenue projections, emphasizing the difficulty of accurate forecasting amid economic uncertainties like the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and potential federal debt limit changes. He highlighted specific tax trends, such as the volatility of the real estate transfer tax and the declining relevance of the communications tax, which he described as "dying" due to changes in communication habits. Gary also noted discrepancies between the governor’s estimates and those provided by state departments, stressing the need for continuous updates to projections.

### **Fee Discrepancies and Adjustments**
The committee addressed minor discrepancies in motor vehicle and Fish & Game fees, projecting steady numbers for 2023-2025 without significant growth or decline. They also compared the governor’s executive budget summary with other estimates, particularly for highway fund and general fund expenditures, raising questions about inconsistencies.

### **Lottery, Gambling, and Liquor Revenue**
The Lottery Commission provided a detailed breakdown of revenue by product line, including scratch tickets, multi-state jackpot games (e.g., Powerball, Mega Millions), and sports betting. Fluctuations in revenue were attributed to factors like interest rates and market trends. The committee also discussed revenues from charitable gambling and historic horse racing, noting growth in the latter due to recent legislative approvals, though some facility delays impacted revenue.

Liquor revenue projections were debated, particularly regarding transfers to the general fund and Medicaid expansion. The committee ultimately accepted adjusted numbers for liquor revenue.

### **Rainy Day Fund and Salary Increases**
The process for accessing the rainy day fund during emergencies was explained, with the fund capped at 10% of general fund revenue, currently around $400 million. Additionally, a 10% pay raise for state employees, negotiated by unions, was discussed. The raise would apply to all state employees, including those not part of the union, with a 2% increase in the second year.

### **Insurance Market Analysis**
The committee requested more detailed information on insurance markets, distinguishing between soft and hard markets, to better understand revenue implications. Written materials from the Department of Employment Security and the Insurance Department were prioritized over in-person presentations due to time constraints.

### **Straw Votes and Logistical Adjustments**
The committee conducted straw votes on several revenue items, including Lottery Commission projections and communications tax estimates, with near-unanimous approval in most cases. Due to an impending snowstorm, the next day’s meeting was canceled and rescheduled for March 1. The committee emphasized the importance of meeting their Wednesday deadline to finalize revenue estimates for the budget, committing to work through the day if necessary.

### **Personnel Changes**
Amy DuHamel was announced as the new committee member, replacing Norma, who retired.

### **Economic Context and Cautious Optimism**
While expressing optimism about New Hampshire’s economy, particularly in areas like business taxes and housing demand, Gary advocated for a cautious approach in revenue forecasting to account for potential economic slowdowns. The meeting underscored the complexity of revenue forecasting and the importance of collaboration between state agencies to refine projections and make informed budgetary decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on remaining revenue items and further analysis of insurance market data. The committee remained focused on meeting its deadlines and ensuring accurate, data-driven revenue estimates to support the state’s budgetary process.
