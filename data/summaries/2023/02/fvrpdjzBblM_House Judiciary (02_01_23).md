The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee met on February 1, 2023, to discuss and vote on a wide range of bills addressing issues such as government transparency, privacy, land use, tenant rights, and remote participation in meetings. The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing constitutional considerations, practical implementation, and potential unintended consequences of proposed legislation. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Government Transparency and Right-to-Know Laws**
1. **HB 149 (Right-to-Know Requests)**:
   - The committee voted to retain this bill, which seeks to impose reasonable timelines for government entities to respond to right-to-know requests. Members supported the intent but wanted to allow the newly established right-to-know ombudsman time to address issues before moving forward with legislation.

2. **HB 289 (Legal Counsel and Right-to-Know Law)**:
   - This bill aimed to prevent public bodies from using legal counsel to evade compliance with the Right-to-Know Law. It was deemed unnecessary and unanimously voted "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).

3. **HB 307 (Attorney Fees in Right-to-Know Cases)**:
   - The bill would allow individuals to recover attorney fees if they win a case under the Right-to-Know Law. It was seen as a reasonable measure to encourage transparency and passed unanimously.

4. **HB 321 (Review of Sealed Minutes)**:
   - This bill would require public bodies to review sealed minutes from non-public sessions every 10 years to determine if they should be unsealed. It was supported as a simple, low-cost measure and passed unanimously.

### **Privacy and Data Protection**
- **HB 314 (Privacy in Personal Information Collection)**:
  - The committee voted to retain this bill, which aims to establish an expectation of privacy in the collection and use of personal information. Members acknowledged the importance of privacy protections but felt the bill needed further refinement, particularly in distinguishing between government and private entities’ roles.

### **Land Use and Housing**
1. **HB 347 (Superior Court Land Use Docket)**:
   - This bill proposed creating a specialized land use docket in the Superior Court, with a judge experienced in land use law. An amendment clarified the need for an additional judge. The bill passed 16-4, though some members expressed concerns about adding bureaucracy and costs.

2. **HB 340 (Regulation of Residential Property Transfers)**:
   - The bill sought to impose additional regulations on real estate transfers to entities like LLCs or trusts. It was seen as overly burdensome and unanimously voted ITL.

3. **HB 379 (Legal Representation for Tenants)**:
   - The original bill required legal representation for tenants in eviction cases. An amendment simplified it to include a notice on eviction notices informing tenants they may contact New Hampshire Legal Assistance. Due to concerns about the language, the discussion was postponed to the next session.

### **Remote Participation in Governance**
1. **HB 254 (Remote Participation in Local Meetings)**:
   - This bill aimed to limit remote participation in local board meetings, emphasizing in-person attendance. Debate centered on accessibility, practicality, and the potential for abuse. The motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill passed, effectively killing it.

2. **HB 308 (Remote Participation in State Boards)**:
   - This bill allowed remote participation for state boards, committees, and advisory councils, excluding the legislature and governor’s council. An amendment clarified that at least one-third of members must be physically present to establish a quorum. The bill passed with bipartisan support.

### **Other Key Bills**
1. **HB 169 (Consensual Guardianship and Parental Rights)**:
   - The committee voted ITL this bill, which aimed to address issues related to consensual guardianship and parental rights. Members expressed concerns about the bill’s potential to do more harm than good, its constitutional implications, and its lack of clarity in defining evidence standards.

2. **HB 320 (Social Media Censorship)**:
   - This bill sought to prevent social media platforms from censoring content. Members debated the balance between free speech and platforms’ rights to moderate content. Concerns about enforceability, federal jurisdiction, and unintended consequences led to a vote to ITL.

3. **HB 171 (Government Liability)**:
   - The committee voted ITL this bill, which proposed expanding liability for state and local governments by redefining discretionary and ministerial functions. Members expressed concerns about increasing government liability and the bill’s unclear language.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the committee’s emphasis on careful consideration of constitutional issues, the potential unintended consequences of legislation, and the importance of bipartisan collaboration. Members highlighted the need for clarity, practicality, and accessibility in crafting effective policies, while also addressing procedural matters such as the role of subcommittees and the implications of retaining bills for future refinement.
