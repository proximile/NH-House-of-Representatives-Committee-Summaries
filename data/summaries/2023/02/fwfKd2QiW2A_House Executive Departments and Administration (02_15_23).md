### **Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting – Executive Departments and Administration (02/15/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Executive Departments and Administration convened on February 15, 2023, to discuss several key bills and amendments related to retirement systems, pension liabilities, and fiduciary responsibilities in state investments. The meeting focused on addressing unfunded liabilities, modernizing retirement plans, and ensuring financial accountability in state pension fund management. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Retirement System Reforms and Pension Liabilities**

#### **House Bill 461**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to close a loophole where municipalities convert full-time Group 2 positions (e.g., fire chiefs) to part-time roles or eliminate them, thereby avoiding responsibility for the associated unfunded liability (debt). The debt is then transferred to other communities.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Municipalities must pay the unfunded liability for any eliminated or converted positions, with a 20% penalty to discourage such actions.
  - The retirement system will analyze the debt based on the highest salary from the previous five years.
- **Concerns**: Committee members raised questions about retroactivity, application to Group 1 positions (e.g., school superintendents), and the impact on municipalities facing declining populations or staffing challenges.
- **Outcome**: The bill was advanced for further consideration to ensure municipalities remain accountable for their pension liabilities.

#### **House Bill 436**
- **Unfunded Liability and Employer Contributions**: The bill addresses the unfunded liability of the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS), which increases as the number of contributing members decreases. Employers are paying significant amounts into the system, leading some to hire part-time employees to reduce costs.
- **Amendment**: An amendment was proposed to restore benefits for Group 2 members (police, firefighters) affected by changes in benefit calculations in 2011. It includes funding through the general fund over 10 years to address the unfunded liability.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the cost (estimated at $200-250 million) and fairness, citing constitutional prohibitions against laws benefiting specific classes.
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed unanimously (19-0), and the bill passed 16-3, with a minority report requested.

### **2. Transition to Defined Contribution Plans**

#### **House Bill 559**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes transitioning new state employees (Group 3) from a defined benefit (DB) plan to a defined contribution (DC) plan starting July 1, 2024. Existing employees remain in the DB plan.
- **Key Features**:
  - Employees contribute 7% of their salary, and employers contribute approximately 2.48%.
  - The DC plan shifts investment risk from the employer to the employee, offering portability, customization, and inheritability.
- **Benefits**: Proponents argue that DC plans align with modern workforce trends, providing flexibility for younger employees who frequently change jobs.
- **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about market risks for employees, the lower employer contribution rate compared to private-sector 401(k) matches, and the potential impact on the sustainability of the DB plan.
- **Comparison with Other States**: Examples from Alaska, Michigan, and Oklahoma were cited, where transitions to DC plans have saved taxpayers billions of dollars.
- **Outcome**: The bill was advanced, with amendments addressing funding mechanisms and compliance with IRS requirements.

### **3. Fiduciary Responsibilities in Pension Fund Management**

#### **House Bill 457**
- **Purpose**: The bill mandates that state treasury and pension fund investments must prioritize maximizing financial benefits for the state and its beneficiaries, opposing the use of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria.
- **Concerns**: Opponents argued that the bill is vague, unenforceable, and could harm the state’s economy by limiting competition among financial institutions. They cited examples from Texas where similar legislation led to increased costs for municipalities.
- **Support**: Proponents, including Representative JD Bernardi, argued that ESG-focused investments, promoted by firms like BlackRock, prioritize social and environmental goals over financial returns, potentially harming pensioners.
- **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) Position**: NHRS testified that it does not prioritize ESG factors and is committed to maximizing returns for its members. However, it expressed concerns that any legislation adding non-fiduciary factors could impair its ability to fulfill fiduciary duties.
- **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review.

### **4. Pension Legislation Amendments**
- **Key Changes**:
  - Moving from an 85% to a 100% pension cap on members’ final average compensation, with an annual 1.25% increase to account for inflation.
  - Consolidation of groups into a vested category, ensuring pensions cannot be reduced after three years of service.
- **Debate**: Committee members discussed the implications of wording changes (e.g., "reduced" vs. "changed") and their impact on policy decisions.
- **Outcome**: The amendments were recommended for adoption with a 5-0 vote, to be brought to the executive committee for further deliberation.

### **5. General Themes and Outcomes**
- **Accountability and Sustainability**: The committee emphasized the need to address unfunded liabilities, prevent "double dipping" (retirees returning to work while drawing pensions), and ensure municipalities remain accountable for their pension obligations.
- **Modernizing Retirement Systems**: Discussions highlighted the tension between traditional defined benefit plans and the flexibility of defined contribution plans, with a focus on adapting to modern workforce trends.
- **Fiduciary Responsibility**: The committee underscored the importance of prioritizing financial returns in state investments, opposing the use of ESG criteria that could compromise pensioners’ interests.
