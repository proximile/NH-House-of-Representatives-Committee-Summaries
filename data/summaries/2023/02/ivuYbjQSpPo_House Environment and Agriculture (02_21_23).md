### Comprehensive Summary of NH House Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/21/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 21, 2023, to discuss several key pieces of legislation aimed at updating landfill siting regulations, exploring Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), and enhancing environmental protections. The meeting highlighted the urgency of modernizing waste management practices to safeguard public health, water resources, and the environment while balancing economic and regulatory considerations.

#### **Key Legislation Discussed**

1. **House Bill 56 (HB 56): Updating Landfill Siting Regulations**  
   - **Purpose**: HB 56 introduces stricter criteria for siting new landfills, including a **five-year groundwater travel time requirement** to prevent contaminants from reaching nearby water bodies. It mandates **hydrogeological studies** at the applicant’s expense and exempts existing landfills and expansions.  
   - **Support**: Proponents, including Representatives Megan Murray and Wendy Thomas, emphasized the bill’s focus on protecting water quality and preventing future contamination, particularly from **PFAS** and other toxins. Testimonies highlighted the economic and health benefits of proper landfill siting.  
   - **Concerns**: The NH Department of Environmental Services (DES) raised feasibility issues, citing the **lack of clarity** in the five-year travel time standard and the variability of New Hampshire’s geology. DES recommended combining HB 56 with **Senate Bills 61 and 227** for a comprehensive study of setback requirements.  
   - **Call for Further Study**: Experts and DES advocated for a **third-party review** to ensure scientifically sound regulations, emphasizing the need for specificity in the bill’s language.

2. **House Bill 602 (HB 602): Adopting Maine’s Landfill Siting Criteria**  
   - **Purpose**: HB 602 proposes adopting Maine’s landfill siting regulations, including **setback requirements** (e.g., 1,000 feet from residences, 300 feet from roads/property boundaries) and **soil composition standards** to minimize leachate infiltration.  
   - **Support**: Representative Matthew Simon introduced the bill, arguing for consistency with Maine’s proven regulations. Supporters highlighted the need for stricter standards to protect public health and the environment.  
   - **Criticism**: Experts, including Nikki Delude Roy, noted that Maine’s regulations may not suit New Hampshire’s unique geology. Key terms in the bill (e.g., "significant sand and gravel aquifer") lack definitions, raising concerns about arbitrary enforcement.  
   - **Role of DES**: Critics argued that landfill siting rules should be developed by DES rather than codified in statute, allowing for a more flexible, science-based approach.

3. **House Bill 253 (HB 253): Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Study**  
   - **Purpose**: HB 253 proposes establishing a study committee to explore EPR, a policy that shifts waste management costs from municipalities to producers of packaging and other materials. The study would examine payment models, material differentiation, and incentives for reducing packaging waste.  
   - **Support**: The bill received strong backing, with 62 individuals submitting comments in favor. Supporters emphasized the need to reduce waste, lower taxpayer costs, and align with waste reduction goals outlined in RSA 149-M.  
   - **Scope**: The committee discussed the complexity of EPR and suggested narrowing the focus to specific areas, such as electronics, tires, or packaging materials.  
   - **Previous Efforts**: Representative Murray referenced prior work on EPR, including a subcommittee study on electronics recycling, and suggested leveraging Maine and Oregon’s EPR legislation as models.

#### **Key Themes and Considerations**

1. **Environmental and Public Health Risks**  
   - Testimonies highlighted the inevitability of **landfill leaks** and the presence of toxic substances like **PFAS, lead, and arsenic** in leachate, posing serious risks to water quality and public health.  
   - Advocates stressed the importance of **prevention** over remediation, as contamination is often irreversible and costly to address.

2. **Economic and Practical Implications**  
   - Supporters argued that updated regulations would not harm the landfill industry or significantly increase costs, as they simply require safer siting practices.  
   - With New Hampshire’s landfill capacity sufficient until at least 2034 and a goal to reduce solid waste by 25% by 2030, representatives noted that now is an ideal time to implement these changes.

3. **Regulatory Flexibility vs. Legislative Oversight**  
   - The meeting underscored the tension between **legislative oversight** (e.g., codifying specific criteria in statute) and **regulatory flexibility** (e.g., allowing DES to develop rules based on broader guidelines).  
   - DES advocated for a **data-driven, process-driven approach**, estimating a two-year timeline to conduct studies and develop new rules.

4. **Comparison with Maine’s Regulations**  
   - Maine’s stringent landfill siting regulations were frequently referenced as a model. However, experts cautioned against directly adopting these rules without considering New Hampshire’s unique geology and geography.

5. **Call for Urgent Action**  
   - Representatives and stakeholders emphasized the need for **proactive measures** to protect New Hampshire’s water resources, public health, and environment for future generations.

#### **Outcomes and Next Steps**

- The committee planned a full **work session** for February 28 to further discuss HB 56, HB 602, and related legislation.  
- Amendments were proposed to address concerns, such as clarifying definitions and exempting existing landfill expansions.  
- Strong support was expressed for HB 253, with the committee considering amendments to refine the study’s scope and focus.

#### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the complexity of updating landfill siting regulations and the importance of balancing environmental protection with economic and regulatory feasibility. Stakeholders advocated for a **science-based, data-driven approach** to ensure effective and practical rules. The discussions underscored the urgency of modernizing New Hampshire’s waste management practices to safeguard public health, water resources, and the environment for future generations.
