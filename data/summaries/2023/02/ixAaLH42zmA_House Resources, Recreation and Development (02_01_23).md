**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Resources, Recreation, and Development (02/01/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 1, 2023, addressed several bills related to water resources, environmental protection, housing development, and wetland regulations. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing public health, environmental sustainability, and economic feasibility. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **1. Water Quality and PFAS Contamination**
Several bills focused on addressing water quality issues, particularly PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, which poses significant health risks such as cancer, immune system disruption, and developmental issues.

- **House Bill 205 (Testing Private Wells)**: This bill mandates testing new private wells for contaminants, including PFAS, and requires disclosure of results to property buyers. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) supports the intent but acknowledges the financial burden on homeowners, as PFAS testing could add $400–$800 to the cost of drilling a new well. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, opposed the bill, citing existing water testing practices and unnecessary costs. Amendments were proposed to strengthen language around health impacts and adjust the effective date to January 1, 2024.

- **House Bill 398 (Disclosure of Groundwater Contamination)**: This bill requires sellers to disclose PFAS and other groundwater contamination to potential buyers during real estate transactions. Concerns were raised about the lack of explicit testing requirements, the 500-foot notification rule, and enforcement challenges. DES suggested merging this bill with HB 205 to improve clarity and effectiveness.

- **PFAS Education and Outreach**: DES emphasized the importance of educating homeowners about water quality, particularly PFAS contamination. The agency’s PFAS data mapper allows residents to view general water quality results in their neighborhoods, though specific addresses are protected for privacy. Historical contamination issues, such as those from gas stations or industrial sites, were also discussed.

### **2. Water Supply Planning and Housing Development**
The meeting addressed concerns about water supply planning for new housing developments and the potential impact on affordable housing.

- **House Bill 310 (Water Supply Planning)**: This bill requires developers planning to build more than four houses to include a hydrologic analysis and PFAS assessment in their site plans. Opponents, including developers and the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, argued that the high cost of hydrologic studies ($15,000–$100,000) and delays (6–9 months) could stifle affordable housing. DES suggested that existing local regulations already address water supply concerns and recommended amendments rather than a statewide mandate.

### **3. Wetland Buffer Regulations**
The meeting also covered **House Bill 592**, which seeks to limit municipalities’ ability to regulate local wetlands and buffers.

- **Opposition to HB 592**: Multiple organizations, including the Municipal Association and the New Hampshire Association of Conservation Commissions (NHACC), testified against the bill, arguing that it undermines local control over wetland protection. They emphasized the importance of local ordinances in preserving natural resources, water quality, and wildlife habitats. Testifiers highlighted the cumulative impacts of small projects, such as erosion, siltation, and invasive species, and warned that weakening regulations could exacerbate wetland loss (approximately 90 acres annually in New Hampshire).

- **Support for HB 592**: The bill’s sponsor, Mr. Campbell, argued that current regulations are overly restrictive, especially for small, temporary projects like solar development. He proposed exempting projects with minimal impact (e.g., less than 3,000 square feet of impervious surface) from local overlay district permits. DES clarified that the bill does not affect state-level wetland permits and suggested placing it under Planning and Zoning statutes for clarity.

### **4. Grafton County Sewage Disposal System**
- **House Bill 186 (Alternative Sewage Disposal Systems)**: This bill addresses high costs associated with a small utility company, Woodsville Power and Light, which charges exorbitant rates for services to the Grafton County complex. While progress has been made in non-legislative negotiations with stakeholders, the committee was asked to retain the bill to allow further discussions.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Balancing Act**: The discussions underscored the tension between environmental protection, public health, and the financial and logistical challenges of implementing new regulations.
- **Local vs. Statewide Regulation**: Stakeholders emphasized that water supply and contamination issues are best addressed at the local level rather than through statewide mandates.
- **PFAS Concerns**: PFAS contamination emerged as a significant issue, with testimony highlighting its widespread presence and severe health impacts. However, the proposed bills faced criticism for their potential to increase costs and create logistical hurdles.
- **Wetland Protection**: HB 592 sparked heated debate, with overwhelming opposition from environmental organizations and support from property rights advocates. The bill’s fate hinges on balancing conservation goals with property owner flexibility.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the need for careful policy consideration to address complex environmental and public health issues while ensuring feasibility and affordability for homeowners, developers, and municipalities. Amendments and further negotiations are expected to refine the bills discussed, with a focus on striking a balance between protecting natural resources and supporting economic development.
