**Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Childcare Meeting (02/15/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare convened on February 15, 2023, to address critical challenges facing the childcare industry, including workforce shortages, regulatory barriers, and the need to expand childcare availability. The meeting focused on identifying solutions to streamline processes, reduce inefficiencies, and support childcare providers and workers. Key discussions and proposals included:

1. **Demystifying Childcare Business Operations**:  
   Committee members emphasized the disconnect between passion for childcare and the business management skills required to operate childcare centers. To address this, they proposed offering programs to support aspiring childcare providers, equipping them with the necessary skills to start and manage successful childcare businesses.

2. **Background Check Process**:  
   The committee highlighted inefficiencies in the background check process for childcare workers, which includes scheduling fingerprint appointments, long wait times, and reliance on outdated practices like wet signatures and paper submissions. The lack of electronic fingerprinting centers further exacerbates delays. A potential $700,000 federal fine for non-compliance with background check requirements was discussed, with suggestions to either pay the fine or streamline the process to avoid it. Proposals included the use of electronic signatures and expediting the hiring process by allowing conditional employment while background checks are pending, provided workers are not left alone with children.

3. **Licensing Process**:  
   The committee identified the cumbersome licensing process for childcare centers as a significant barrier. Extensive regulations, delays in inspections, and lack of responsiveness from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) were cited as major issues. Members shared personal experiences of delays in facility approvals, underscoring the need to expedite and simplify the licensing process to encourage more providers to open centers.

4. **Workforce Shortages**:  
   The childcare sector faces severe workforce shortages, worsened by the lengthy background check process. The committee explored ways to reduce barriers for existing childcare workers to advance into leadership roles or open their own centers. Additionally, they discussed strategies to attract and retain workers, such as improving hiring efficiency and reducing redundant regulations.

5. **Potential Solutions**:  
   The committee considered legislative changes to address these challenges, including allowing electronic signatures, prioritizing childcare applications, and reducing regulatory redundancies. Collaboration with the Senate to introduce emergency legislation was also discussed as a way to implement changes quickly.

6. **DHHS Involvement**:  
   While the committee expressed frustration with DHHS’s lack of responsiveness and inefficiencies, they acknowledged the need to hear DHHS’s perspective before finalizing any changes. The possibility of shifting some responsibilities, such as background checks, to the Department of Safety was proposed as a way to improve efficiency.

**Overall Goals**:  
The committee aimed to reduce bureaucratic obstacles, improve responsiveness, and expand childcare capacity in New Hampshire. By streamlining processes, supporting providers, and addressing workforce shortages, they sought to create a more accessible and efficient childcare system for families.

This meeting underscored the urgency of addressing systemic issues in the childcare industry and highlighted the committee’s commitment to fostering legislative and administrative changes to meet these challenges.
