The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee met on February 15, 2023, to discuss several key bills and amendments, focusing on cannabis regulation, liquor licensing, patient safety, auto glass repair, and specialty drug delivery practices.

### **1. Cannabis Regulation (House Bill 639)**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 639**, which addresses the regulation of cannabis in New Hampshire. Key points included:
- **Penalties and Licensing**: Debate centered on whether penalties for violations related to liquor and cannabis sales should be mandatory or discretionary, with some members advocating for stricter penalties to deter violations.
- **Advisory Board and Licensing Caps**: Timothy Egan of the Cannabis Trade Advisory Group emphasized the need for an advisory board and caps on the number of licenses a single entity can hold to prevent market monopolization.
- **Possession Limits**: Representative Gibbs questioned the rationale for limits on personal cannabis possession, comparing it to the lack of limits on alcohol possession. The committee explored whether these limits are necessary to prevent resale and ensure responsible consumption.
- **Retention of the Bill**: The committee voted 4-2 to retain the bill for further refinement, allowing for additional stakeholder input and consideration of issues like the advisory board and possession limits.

### **2. Liquor Licensing and Penalties**
The committee reviewed proposed amendments to liquor licensing laws, focusing on penalties for overserving alcohol, particularly in cases leading to injury or death:
- **Increased Penalties**: The amendment proposed raising fines and suspension periods for first offenses, with mandatory 30-day suspensions for establishments lacking employee training.
- **Training Incentives**: The amendment aimed to encourage training by offering reduced penalties for establishments with trained staff.
- **Second Offense Penalties**: For second offenses, the license would be revoked, though there was debate over whether this should be mandatory or discretionary.
- **Industry Concerns**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association expressed concerns about the severity of penalties, particularly for small businesses, and suggested allowing the Liquor Commission more discretion.

### **3. Cannabis Accessories and Patient Safety**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 639** (cannabis accessories) and **House Bill 513** (patient safety and medication delivery):
- **Cannabis Accessories Licensing**: The committee discussed licensing requirements for businesses selling cannabis-related accessories, such as water pipes and vaping devices, to prevent sales to individuals under 21. The bill passed with amendments.
- **Patient Safety**: **House Bill 513** addressed practices like **white bagging** (insurers sending drugs directly to providers) and **brown bagging** (insurers sending drugs to patients' homes), which pose risks to patient safety and treatment efficiency. The bill included provisions for patient consent and aimed to minimize risks associated with these practices.

### **4. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Disclosures (House Bill 304)**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 304**, which focuses on consumer protection in auto glass repair:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill requires auto glass repair shops to inform customers about the need for recalibration of ADAS features (e.g., collision sensors, automatic braking) after windshield repairs or replacements.
- **Safety Concerns**: Proper recalibration is critical for vehicle safety, and the bill aims to prevent shops from charging for recalibration services without performing them.
- **Industry Support**: Representatives from Safelite and Glass America supported the bill, emphasizing the need for consumer awareness and transparency in the repair process.

### **5. Specialty Drug Delivery Practices (House Bill 513)**
The committee revisited **House Bill 513**, which addresses **white bagging** and **brown bagging** practices in the delivery of specialty drugs:
- **Safety and Efficiency**: The bill aims to mitigate risks associated with insurer-driven practices, such as delayed or incorrect drug shipments, which can harm patients, particularly those with cancer or chronic conditions.
- **Hospital vs. Insurer Perspectives**: Hospitals argued for greater control over drug administration to ensure safety and reduce waste, while insurers defended these practices as cost-effective alternatives to the traditional buy-and-bill model.
- **Amendments**: The bill sponsor proposed amendments to allow patient opt-in for brown bagging, which insurers supported but hospitals opposed.

### **Overall Themes and Next Steps**
The meeting underscored the committee's commitment to balancing public safety, consumer protection, and industry fairness. Key themes included:
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: The committee emphasized the importance of involving industry representatives, healthcare providers, and affected families in the rule-making process.
- **Regulatory Clarity**: Discussions highlighted the need for clear statutory guidelines to avoid excessive bureaucracy and ensure effective regulation.
- **Further Deliberation**: Several bills, including **House Bill 639** and **House Bill 513**, were retained or referred to subcommittees for further refinement and stakeholder input.

The committee's deliberations reflect a nuanced approach to addressing complex issues, ensuring that legislative efforts are both effective and equitable. Further meetings will focus on finalizing amendments and addressing outstanding concerns to advance these bills.
