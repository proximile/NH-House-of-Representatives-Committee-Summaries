**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (02/15/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 15, 2023, focused on a range of topics under the purview of the **House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee**, including **liquor sales regulations**, **cannabis legalization**, **consumer protection in healthcare and auto glass repair**, and **PFAS regulations**.

### **1. Liquor Sales and Penalties**
- **Key Issues**: Representatives debated penalties for establishments violating liquor laws, particularly overserving alcohol. The proposed amendment increased fines and suspension periods for first-time offenses:
  - **First Offense**: Fine raised from $5,000 to $7,500, and suspension period from 10 to 15 days. If employees lacked training, the suspension period increased to 30 days.
  - **Second Offense**: License revocation (a new provision).
- **Concerns**: Small businesses could face severe financial hardship, especially with a 30-day suspension for first-time offenses. Some argued for more flexibility, suggesting "up to 30 days" suspensions to allow discretion based on mitigating factors.
- **Training Incentive**: The Liquor Commission’s comprehensive training program (updated annually) was emphasized as a way to reduce violations and mitigate penalties.
- **Proposed Compromises**: Suggestions included tiered penalties for repeat offenses and retaining current penalties for first-time offenses unless training was lacking.

### **2. Cannabis Legalization**
- **Key Issues**: Discussions centered on the structure of the cannabis industry, including licensing, advisory boards, and possession limits.
  - **Advisory Board**: Concerns were raised about the lack of an advisory board to guide the Liquor Commission in regulating cannabis.
  - **Market Dominance**: Some feared large corporations could dominate the market, limiting opportunities for smaller businesses.
  - **Possession Limits**: Questions were raised about why cannabis has possession limits while alcohol does not.
- **Balancing Act**: The debate highlighted the need to balance public safety, consumer access, and market fairness.

### **3. PFAS Regulations**
- **Key Issues**: A bill addressing **PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)** in products, particularly carpets, was discussed.
  - **Labeling vs. Ban**: Representatives debated whether to mandate labeling for PFAS-containing products or ban them outright.
  - **Environmental and Health Concerns**: PFAS are linked to significant health and environmental risks.
  - **Consumer Education**: Some argued for market-driven solutions and consumer education rather than strict regulations.

### **4. Consumer Protection in Healthcare (House Bill 513)**
- **Key Issues**: The bill addressed **white bagging** and **brown bagging** practices in healthcare, particularly for cancer patients receiving infusion treatments.
  - **White Bagging**: Medications are shipped from a Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) directly to the provider.
  - **Brown Bagging**: Medications are shipped to the patient’s home, and the patient brings them to the provider.
  - **Concerns**: Both practices raise safety issues (e.g., delays, improper storage, wrong medications) and reduce patient and provider control over treatment.
  - **Hospitals vs. Insurers**: Hospitals oppose these practices, advocating for **buy-and-bill models** to ensure safety. Insurers argue these practices reduce costs and meet safety standards.
  - **Proposed Amendments**: An **opt-in provision** for brown bagging in specific cases (e.g., rural areas) was discussed. The bill aims to ensure medications are billed under the most efficient benefit (pharmacy vs. medical).
  - **Outcome**: The committee voted to **retain the bill** for further refinement, with plans to address safety and cost concerns.

### **5. Consumer Protection in Auto Glass Repair (House Bill 304)**
- **Key Issues**: The bill focused on **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** recalibration during auto glass repair and replacement.
  - **Transparency**: Shops must inform consumers if ADAS recalibration is needed and whether they can perform it.
  - **Safety Concerns**: Improperly calibrated ADAS systems (e.g., lane departure warnings, automatic braking) pose significant risks.
  - **Fraud Prevention**: The bill aims to prevent shops from charging for recalibration services they cannot perform.
  - **Support**: Industry representatives, including **Safelite** and **Glass America**, emphasized the importance of consumer safety and transparency.

---

### **6. Retention of Bills**
- Several bills, including those on **liquor penalties**, **cannabis legalization**, and **healthcare practices**, were **retained** for further review. This allows the committee more time to refine language, address stakeholder concerns, and ensure the policies are fair, enforceable, and aligned with New Hampshire’s values of limited government intervention.

---

### **Key Themes**
1. **Balancing Interests**: The meeting underscored the challenge of balancing **consumer protection**, **business interests**, and **public safety**.
2. **Flexibility in Penalties**: Discussions on liquor penalties emphasized the need for flexibility to avoid disproportionately harming small businesses.
3. **Safety vs. Cost**: Debates on healthcare practices and PFAS regulations highlighted the tension between **safety** and **cost-effectiveness**.
4. **Regulatory Clarity**: Representatives sought clear, enforceable regulations in areas like cannabis, healthcare, and auto glass repair.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee plans to finalize amendments and move bills forward by mid-March, with continued focus on stakeholder input and refining policies to address safety, fairness, and economic concerns.

The meeting demonstrated the House’s commitment to addressing complex issues with a thoughtful, collaborative approach, ensuring that new regulations serve the best interests of New Hampshire’s consumers and businesses.
