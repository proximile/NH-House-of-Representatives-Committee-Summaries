**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (02/01/23)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 1, 2023, focused on critical issues related to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Hampstead Hospital, and the state’s public health infrastructure. The discussions highlighted challenges in staffing, budgeting, and service delivery, as well as efforts to modernize systems and address long-term sustainability. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and takeaways from the meeting:  

### **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**  
1. **Strategic Overview and Challenges**:  
   - Interim Commissioner Lori Weaver and CFO Nathan White outlined DHHS’s mission and 2023 strategy, emphasizing investment in people, efficient resource management, and enhancing organizational value.  
   - The department faces significant staffing shortages, with a 21% vacancy rate exacerbated by COVID-19, hiring freezes, and a $22.6 million personnel budget cut in the current biennium. Efforts to address vacancies include recruitment tools, cross-training, and temporary positions, though burnout remains a concern.  

2. **Contract Management and Performance Metrics**:  
   - DHHS manages over 400 contractors, with contract processing times reduced from 142 days in 2018 to 94 days. A new contract life cycle management system is being implemented to improve efficiency.  
   - A two-person unit evaluates contractor service quality, aiming to align contracts with strategic goals. Form B is used to track activity-level goals and performance metrics, ensuring accountability and progress toward public health outcomes.  

3. **Budget Constraints and Future Goals**:  
   - Budget cuts have limited the department’s ability to fill positions and leverage federal funds, impacting service delivery.  
   - DHHS is developing a detailed roadmap with specific goals and metrics to track progress, improve contract management, and enhance data-driven decision-making.  

### **Hampstead Hospital**  
1. **Overview and Services**:  
   - Hampstead Hospital, a state-owned psychiatric facility for children and adolescents, serves ages 4 to 25, offering trauma-informed, family-centered mental health care.  
   - The hospital has a capacity of 70 beds across four units, but only three are operational due to staffing shortages. Current census is 45 patients, with an 11-person waitlist.  

2. **Staffing Challenges and Recruitment Efforts**:  
   - Vacancy rates are high: 52% for direct care counselors and 39% for nurses. Recruitment efforts include bonuses and phasing out agency nurses in favor of permanent staff.  
   - The hospital serves as a safety net for children with unstable home environments or those awaiting placement in therapeutic foster care.  

3. **Future Goals and Collaboration**:  
   - Plans include increasing bed capacity, developing a Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF), and improving collaboration with state agencies like DCYF and Behavioral Health.  
   - The hospital aims to enhance continuity of care, ensuring patients have aftercare plans before discharge.  

### **Public Health Infrastructure and COVID-19 Response**  
1. **Data Modernization and Dashboard**:  
   - New Hampshire’s COVID-19 dashboard, built on the state’s data portal, has set a standard for data sharing. The state shifted focus from case counts to hospitalizations and deaths as more reliable indicators.  
   - The pandemic spurred investments in data analytics, data warehouses, and public health infrastructure, though sustaining these improvements post-federal funding remains a challenge.  

2. **Federal Funding and Workforce Development**:  
   - The state received over $77 million in federal funds for COVID-19 response, including testing, vaccination, and workforce development. Temporary positions and contracts, such as those with Maxim staffing, were scaled back as the pandemic waned.  
   - As federal funds expire by 2024, the state faces workforce challenges in data analysis, epidemiology, and community health workers, necessitating long-term planning and sustainable funding.  

3. **Immunization Efforts and Future Preparedness**:  
   - Over 2.6 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered, supported by an immunization information system. The state has no plans to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for school entry or childcare.  
   - After-action reviews are underway to document lessons learned, informing future public health preparedness and resource allocation.  

### **Key Takeaways and Future Directions**  
- **Staffing and Budget Challenges**: DHHS and Hampstead Hospital face significant staffing shortages and budget constraints, impacting service delivery and the ability to leverage federal funds.  
- **Modernization and Efficiency**: Efforts to improve contract management, data analytics, and public health infrastructure are critical for long-term sustainability.  
- **Collaboration and Strategic Planning**: Enhanced collaboration between state agencies, community providers, and stakeholders is essential to address systemic challenges and ensure continuity of care.  
- **Transition from Federal Funding**: The state must prepare for the expiration of federal COVID-19 funds by identifying ongoing needs and securing alternative funding sources to maintain public health initiatives.  

The meeting underscored the importance of transparency, accountability, and strategic planning as New Hampshire navigates complex challenges in health and human services, mental health care, and public health infrastructure.
