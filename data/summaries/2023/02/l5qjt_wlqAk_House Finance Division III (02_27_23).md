The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 27, 2023, covered a wide range of topics related to Medicaid, healthcare services, child welfare, juvenile justice, and behavioral health. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **Medicaid and Healthcare Services**
1. **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**: The committee reviewed Medicaid reimbursement rates, which are significantly lower than Medicare rates in areas like obstetrical care and speech therapy. There was a call for targeted rate increases to address workforce shortages and improve access to care. The governor proposed a 3.1% across-the-board rate increase, but members debated the need for more targeted adjustments to address specific challenges, such as nursing home staffing crises and home health care.

2. **Choices for Independence (CFI) Program**: The CFI program, which provides home-based care for elderly and disabled individuals, was highlighted as a cost-effective alternative to nursing homes. However, chronic underfunding has led to difficulties in recruiting and retaining workers. Advocates requested rate increases to align with market rates and ensure service delivery.

3. **Nursing Home Crisis**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Healthcare Association emphasized severe staffing shortages in nursing homes, leading to waitlists and reduced capacity. They requested a 15% rate increase to stabilize the workforce and reduce reliance on expensive staffing agencies.

4. **Budget Constraints and Federal Funding**: The committee discussed the reduction in Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) funding and the need to backfill these reductions with state funds. A $16.3 million allocation was proposed to mitigate the impact of reduced federal funding. Members also reviewed trends in federal and state funding, noting a decrease in federal funds from $500 million in 2022 to just over $400 million.

5. **Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)**: The role of MCOs in Medicaid was discussed, including how they negotiate rates with providers and the financial structure of MCO contracts. The committee also touched on the need for actuarial reviews to implement rate changes effectively.

### **Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice**
1. **Child Protection**: The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) uses actuarial tools to assess family needs and risk profiles. Child removals are rare, occurring in only hundreds of cases out of over 10,000 assessments annually. Families are often offered services within or outside the child protection system to address their needs and prevent court involvement.

2. **Juvenile Diversion Programs**: A new program aims to reduce court involvement for young people by identifying alternative interventions. The program shows promise, with 72% of families agreeing to participate, leading to positive outcomes. However, 28% of cases still require court involvement, often due to more serious offenses or lack of family engagement in services.

3. **Kinship Care**: A new licensure type for kinship caregivers is being developed to simplify requirements, making it easier for relatives like grandparents to care for children. Legislative changes allow for broader definitions of kinship caregivers and include licensure processes to ensure safety and provide additional support.

4. **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)**: The budget for SYSC includes $11.1 million in General Funds for FY 2024 and $11.4 million for FY 2025, reflecting a shift from previous reliance on out-of-state revenue. Workforce shortages continue to impact operations, with only about half of the authorized positions currently filled.

5. **Support for Transition-Aged Youth**: The Hope Program extends voluntary foster care to age 21, providing housing and support for young people aging out of foster care. The Youth Villages LifeSet program offers evidence-based support for transition-aged youth to help them plan for successful adulthood.

### **Behavioral Health and Mental Health Services**
1. **Mental Health Services**: The committee reviewed data on new programs aimed at reducing court involvement for young people by identifying alternative interventions. Challenges remain in accessing outpatient mental health services for children.

2. **Workforce Challenges**: Hiring and retaining child protection and youth center staff remains a significant challenge, though recent pay enhancements have helped reduce vacancy rates. An "impact team" model is proposed to mitigate the cascading effects of staff turnover by deploying a central group to support overwhelmed offices.

3. **Domestic Violence and Family Resource Centers**: Funding for domestic violence programs and Family Resource Centers is discussed, with a focus on increasing state support for these services, which are currently reliant on local funding.

### **Legislative and Budgetary Considerations**
1. **Budgetary Concerns**: The committee expressed uncertainty about how certain budget increases were calculated, particularly regarding rate factors and utilization rates. They requested more detailed information to evaluate the proposed budget effectively.

2. **Legislative Support for Caregivers**: Senate Bill 172 aims to extend Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits to fictive kin caregivers, such as neighbors or close family friends, who step in to care for children but currently do not qualify for support.

3. **Future Discussions**: The committee planned to continue discussions on HB 527, which focuses on rate setting and funding allocations, and to explore ways to balance competing demands within the budget. They also requested further analysis and recommendations from the Department of Health and Human Services.

### **Public Health and Logistical Concerns**
1. **Public Health**: The meeting concluded with logistical discussions about the next day's public health session and potential weather-related disruptions.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the tension between the need for increased funding to address critical healthcare workforce and access issues and the limitations of available state resources. Key themes included the importance of targeted rate increases, the challenges of workforce shortages, and the need for systemic reforms in child welfare, juvenile justice, and behavioral health. The committee emphasized the importance of detailed information and holistic approaches to Medicaid rate setting and budget planning to ensure continued access to services for eligible populations.
