**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (02/03/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 3, 2023, to discuss a wide range of topics related to energy regulation, utility oversight, and legislative proposals. The meeting included presentations from state agencies, testimony from stakeholders, and debates on several bills. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Utility Regulation and Rate Setting**
The committee began with a detailed discussion on utility regulation, focusing on the complexities of rate setting, the cost of capital, and the balance between consumer and investor interests. Key points included:
- **Rate Setting**: Utilities determine rates based on factors like the cost of capital, debt, and operating expenses. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) ensures rates are just and reasonable, balancing the need for utilities to remain financially stable with consumer affordability.
- **Market Conditions**: Rising interest rates and stock market volatility were noted as factors influencing utility rates and investment decisions.
- **Regulatory Compact**: The agreement between utilities and the state grants utilities a monopoly in exchange for their obligation to provide safe, reliable service. The PUC oversees this compact and investigates utilities when necessary.
- **Jurisdiction**: State regulators oversee local energy distribution, while federal authorities manage interstate transmission and wholesale energy sales.

### **2. Legislative Proposals and Debates**
The committee reviewed several bills, with significant debate on the following:

#### **House Bill 633 (Eversource Market Share and Rate Caps)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to limit Eversource’s market share to 50% and cap electric rate increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- **Support**: Advocates argued that Eversource’s monopoly has led to high prices and poor service, and the bill sought to restore competition.
- **Opposition**: The NH Department of Energy and Eversource opposed the bill, citing constitutional concerns, potential financial instability, and the risk of increased costs for ratepayers.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) due to constitutional and operational challenges.

#### **House Bill 139 (Net Metering Revisions)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposed allowing municipalities to collaborate on net metering projects and expanding eligibility to housing authorities and quasi-public entities.
- **Concerns**: Committee members raised issues about undefined terms, potential cost shifting to non-net metering customers, and the need to wait for the PUC’s ongoing review of net metering tariffs.
- **Outcome**: The bill was discussed in detail, but no final decision was made pending further review.

#### **House Bill 92 (Vehicle Emission Standards)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposed adopting California’s vehicle emission standards, requiring a percentage of vehicles sold to be electric or low-emission.
- **Concerns**: Opponents highlighted the environmental impact of lithium mining, reliance on China for rare earth minerals, and the practicality of implementation.
- **Outcome**: A motion to ITL the bill failed, and it will proceed to the House floor without a recommendation.

#### **House Bill 630 (Clean Energy Accelerator Fund)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aimed to establish a revolving fund for clean energy projects.
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the lack of a fiscal note, administrative costs, and potential federal mandates.
- **Outcome**: A motion to ITL the bill failed, and it will proceed to the House floor without a recommendation.

#### **House Bill 234 (Wreck Sweeping)**
- **Purpose**: The bill sought to repeal wreck sweeping, a policy allowing utilities to reclaim abandoned renewable energy credits.
- **Debate**: Arguments centered on the impact on energy rates, property rights, and the historical context of the policy.
- **Outcome**: A motion to ITL the bill failed, and it will proceed to the House floor without a recommendation.

### **3. Energy Efficiency and Consumer Protection**
The committee emphasized the importance of energy efficiency and demand-side management as tools to reduce overall energy costs. Key discussions included:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Time-of-use rates and dynamic pricing were explored as ways to incentivize off-peak energy usage.
- **Rebate Programs**: Bills like HB 246 and HB 418 addressed energy efficiency rebates, with debates focusing on balancing program benefits with the financial burden on ratepayers.
- **Consumer Choice**: The committee discussed ways to improve customer choice in energy suppliers and the potential for community power aggregation to lower prices.

### **4. Presentations and Testimonies**
The PUC provided a comprehensive overview of its mission, structure, and regulatory responsibilities. Key points included:
- **Rate-Setting Process**: The PUC explained how it determines utility revenue requirements, operating expenses, and return on investment.
- **Consumer Protection**: The PUC highlighted its role in fostering competition and protecting consumers through transparent communication and ethical practices.
- **Testimonies**: Representatives from the Department of Energy, Eversource, and other stakeholders provided input on various bills, offering perspectives on competition, cost shifting, and regulatory oversight.

### **5. Committee Actions and Outcomes**
The committee took action on several bills, including:
- **House Bill 211**: A housekeeping bill correcting a typographical error passed unanimously and was moved to the consent calendar.
- **House Bill 219**: The bill proposed repealing outdated RSA chapters and establishing a legislative study committee. The committee suggested referring specific sections to the study committee for further review.
- **Executive Session**: The committee addressed multiple bills in the executive session, with several moving to the House floor without recommendations due to divided votes.

### **6. Key Themes and Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted several recurring themes:
- **Balancing Interests**: The committee grappled with balancing consumer affordability, utility financial health, and environmental goals.
- **Constitutional Concerns**: Several bills faced opposition due to potential constitutional issues, particularly those involving rate caps and market share limits.
- **Federal and State Jurisdiction**: The interplay between state and federal regulations was a key consideration in discussions on energy policy and utility oversight.
- **Need for Caution**: Representatives emphasized the importance of careful deliberation, particularly in the context of evolving federal guidelines and high energy prices.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of energy regulation and the challenges of crafting legislation that addresses the needs of consumers, utilities, and the environment. While some bills advanced, others were deemed unworkable or required further study. The committee’s discussions reflected a commitment to thoughtful, evidence-based policymaking in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.
