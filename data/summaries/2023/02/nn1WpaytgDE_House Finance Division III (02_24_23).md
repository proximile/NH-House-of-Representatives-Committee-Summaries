**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (02/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 24, 2023, focused on key discussions related to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), with an emphasis on IT infrastructure, health equity, program quality, and budget planning. The meeting highlighted ongoing challenges, strategic initiatives, and future goals across various DHHS divisions.

### **Key Discussions and Highlights**

1. **System Enhancements and IT Infrastructure**  
   - The committee discussed the process for identifying and implementing system improvements, emphasizing the need for a structured approach to prioritize enhancements.  
   - Concerns were raised about potential redundancy in IT systems, particularly with the Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB). It was clarified that the Department’s enterprise business intelligence (EBI) platform is robust enough to handle data integration, making redundant systems unnecessary.  
   - Ongoing IT projects, such as the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) stabilization, Salesforce implementation, and the development of a closed-loop referral system for care coordination, were highlighted.  
   - The importance of data privacy and security, especially in new systems like the referral system, was emphasized, with discussions around informed consent and opt-in/opt-out mechanisms.  

2. **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB)**  
   - The integration of PDAB’s data requests into the state’s business intelligence platform was discussed. While the PDAB has not yet collected revenue or appointed an executive director, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) is being finalized to address data integration.  

3. **Health Equity and Refugee Services**  
   - Reuben Hampton, the new director of the Office of Health Equity, presented the office’s mission to ensure equitable access to DHHS programs, particularly for marginalized populations. Challenges such as housing and transportation for refugees were discussed, along with the importance of geographic data to target services effectively.  
   - Refugee services were highlighted, with a focus on the increase in refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine. While overall refugee numbers in New Hampshire have not significantly risen, additional federal funding has been provided to support resettlement and employment programs.  

4. **Program Quality and Integrity**  
   - The Division of Program Quality and Integrity focuses on program development, quality improvement, and financial integrity across DHHS. Key accomplishments include implementing a Quality Reporting System for Medicaid dental benefits, integrating health analytics into Medicaid eligibility processes, and creating a Contracts Quality Management Unit to oversee vendor performance.  
   - The Bureau of Program Integrity addressed fraud, waste, and abuse investigations, Medicaid provider enrollment, and third-party liability. Progress was noted in reducing backlogs in fraud investigations and improving financial compliance.  

5. **Staffing, Wages, and Workforce Challenges**  
   - Low wages impacting recruitment and retention were a recurring theme. A proposed 10% wage increase was discussed, but it was acknowledged that this alone may not be sufficient to compete with the private sector. Additional strategies, such as leveraging funding for recruitment, retention, and recognition programs, were highlighted.  
   - The budget includes increased funding for IT consultants to address workforce shortages and support critical IT projects.  

6. **Budget and Strategic Planning**  
   - The committee emphasized the need for a structured approach to IT planning and development, including a 10-year plan to establish baselines, goals, and measurable outcomes for state programs.  
   - Members called for better tracking of program outcomes and performance metrics to ensure effective use of state funds.  
   - The department is implementing a new Learning Management System (LMS) to provide standardized training for employees and external providers, separate from the state’s existing LMS.  

7. **Closing Remarks and Future Goals**  
   - The chair emphasized allowing natural conversation flow during discussions and highlighted the importance of transparency and strategic alignment in IT investments.  
   - The committee requested a detailed roadmap of IT projects aligned with the commissioner’s priorities to ensure efficient use of resources and improve service delivery.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the critical role of IT infrastructure, data-driven decision-making, and strategic planning in improving DHHS services. Addressing workforce challenges, enhancing program quality, and ensuring health equity remain key priorities. The committee concluded with a focus on long-term planning, performance metrics, and the need for cohesive strategies to maximize the impact of state resources.
