### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (02/24/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health and Human Services Oversight Committee met on February 24, 2023, to address critical issues related to Medicaid, healthcare access, workforce shortages, and the implementation of new programs. The meeting focused on two main themes: **Medicaid-related challenges and reforms** and **the rollout of the adult dental benefit program**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Medicaid: Challenges and Reforms**

1. **Medicaid Enrollment and Reimbursement**:
   - New Hampshire has the fourth-lowest Medicaid enrollment in the U.S., with significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic due to continuous enrollment requirements. The Granite Advantage program (Medicaid expansion) saw an 86% increase in enrollment.
   - The committee discussed the importance of improving reimbursement rates to ensure providers are paid promptly and adequately, particularly in underserved areas. Comparisons were made to Medicare and other states' rates, with a focus on targeted increases for areas like ambulance services and private duty nursing.

2. **Medicaid Unwinding Process**:
   - The Consolidated Appropriations Act mandates the unwinding of continuous enrollment protections, with New Hampshire aiming to begin disenrollments by April 1, 2023. Approximately 102,000 individuals may no longer qualify for Medicaid.
   - The state has developed a 12-month plan to prioritize disenrollment of those who have used fewer healthcare services to minimize harm. Outreach efforts include contacting over 40,000 families and collaborating with managed care organizations and providers.
   - Challenges include staffing shortages (a 22% vacancy rate among eligibility workers), burnout risks, and the need for efficient handling of potential appeals. Strategies to address these include overtime, temporary hires, and redistributing caseloads.

3. **Spend Down Program**:
   - The Medicaid spend-down program, which requires individuals with higher incomes to incur medical expenses before qualifying, was briefly discussed. Recent increases in income limits and the impact of continuous eligibility during the pandemic were noted.

4. **Federal Funding**:
   - The phase-down of additional federal Medicaid funding (FMAP) will require the state to manage the program with fewer federal resources, adding financial pressure.

### **Adult Dental Benefit Program**

1. **Implementation and Challenges**:
   - The adult dental benefit program is set to begin on April 1, 2023, focusing initially on waiver populations and nursing home residents. The program includes cost-sharing requirements.
   - Building a provider network, particularly for oral surgery, has been challenging, with gaps remaining in certain geographic areas. However, the department is confident that urgent dental needs will be met by the start date, with preventative care services expanding over time.

2. **Incentivizing Dentists and Expanding Roles**:
   - The committee explored financial incentives, such as enhanced fee schedules, to encourage dentists to participate in Medicaid, especially for adult dental care.
   - Expanding the roles of dental extenders (e.g., dental hygienists) and leveraging tele-dentistry were discussed as potential solutions to improve access to care.

### **Workforce Shortages**

1. **Healthcare Workforce Challenges**:
   - Workforce shortages were a recurring theme, particularly in mental health, substance use disorder treatment, and private duty nursing. The committee discussed solutions such as tuition assistance programs for medical and dental students, temporary pay enhancements, and reclassifying positions to attract and retain staff.
   - Concerns about burnout and turnover were highlighted, with the department acknowledging the need for aggressive recruitment efforts and strategies to mitigate these risks.

2. **Staffing in Medicaid Programs**:
   - The Medicaid unwinding process and dental benefit rollout are straining existing staff, with a 22% vacancy rate among eligibility workers. Temporary measures, such as overtime and redistributing caseloads, are being implemented to address this.

### **Next Steps and Future Meetings**

- The committee scheduled its next meeting for March 24, 2023, and encouraged members to suggest topics for further discussion, particularly areas requiring more information or clarification.
- Regular updates on the Medicaid unwinding process and the adult dental benefit program were requested, with a focus on monitoring staffing levels, appeal volumes, and network development. The department committed to providing ongoing reports and addressing emerging issues.

### **Overall Focus**

The meeting underscored the complexities of managing large-scale healthcare programs in New Hampshire, particularly in the context of Medicaid reforms and the rollout of the adult dental benefit. Key priorities included improving healthcare access, addressing workforce shortages, ensuring financial sustainability, and preparing for the challenges of the Medicaid unwinding process. The committee emphasized the need for collaboration, innovative solutions, and ongoing monitoring to achieve these goals.
