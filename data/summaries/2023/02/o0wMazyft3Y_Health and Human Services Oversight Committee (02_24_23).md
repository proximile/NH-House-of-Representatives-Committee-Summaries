**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (02/24/23)**

The February 24, 2023, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health and Human Services Oversight Committee addressed critical issues related to healthcare access, Medicaid, and workforce challenges in the state. The discussions were organized around two primary themes: Medicaid unwinding and the implementation of the adult dental benefit program, with additional focus on broader healthcare and Medicaid-related concerns.

### **Medicaid Unwinding**
1. **Background and Context**: Due to the federal Public Health Emergency and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Medicaid enrollment in New Hampshire has surged to over 250,000 individuals. The continuous enrollment requirement is ending, and the state must begin redetermining eligibility starting April 1, 2023.
2. **Preparation and Outreach**: The state has been preparing for this transition since July 2020, leveraging existing systems and conducting extensive outreach to beneficiaries. Approximately 73,000 individuals will require redetermination, with a focus on streamlining the process by targeting households.
3. **Challenges and Strategies**: Staffing shortages (22% vacancy rate for eligibility workers) and the potential for increased appeals pose significant challenges. To manage the increased workload, the Department is using overtime, redistributing caseloads, and hiring temporary staff. However, concerns about long-term sustainability and worker burnout remain.
4. **Federal Reporting and Metrics**: New Hampshire must meet federal reporting requirements and is enhancing its technology to track and report on the unwinding process. The state aims to minimize coverage gaps and ensure eligible individuals transition to other coverage options, such as the Exchange or Medicare.

### **Adult Dental Benefit Program**
1. **Implementation Timeline**: The program is set to launch on April 1, 2023, focusing initially on waiver populations and nursing home residents. Waivers and cost-sharing arrangements are being finalized to ensure smooth implementation.
2. **Network Development**: Building a provider network, particularly for oral surgery, has been challenging. While progress has been made, geographic gaps in provider availability, especially in rural areas, remain a concern.
3. **Next Steps**: The state is collaborating with Northeast Delta Dental and DentaQuest to expand the network and ensure readiness for the April 1 launch. Preventative care services will be gradually introduced over time.

### **Broader Healthcare and Medicaid Discussions**
1. **Dental Care and Incentives**: The committee explored strategies to incentivize dentists to participate in Medicaid, including partnerships with Delta Dental and the use of tele-dentistry and extenders for preventative care.
2. **Medicaid Enrollment and Workforce Shortages**: New Hampshireâ€™s Medicaid enrollment is lower than the national average, with 70% of recipients employed. Workforce shortages in healthcare, particularly in mental health and private duty nursing, were highlighted as significant challenges.
3. **Reimbursement Rates and Access to Care**: Concerns were raised about low reimbursement rates for Medicaid providers and their impact on access to care. The committee discussed targeted rate adjustments versus across-the-board increases, with examples from nursing homes, private duty nursing, ambulance services, and hospice care.
4. **Spend Down Program**: The committee addressed the "spend down" program, where individuals with income above Medicaid limits must incur medical expenses before qualifying for coverage. There was discussion about increasing the income threshold to reduce the burden on patients and providers.
5. **Reports and Future Agenda**: The committee reviewed reports on Medicaid spending and provider rates, with plans to continue discussions on targeted rate adjustments. Future meetings will include updates from the interim commissioner and other department officials, with opportunities for committee members to suggest agenda items.

### **Key Takeaways**
- The Medicaid unwinding process is a monumental task, and the state is working diligently to minimize disruptions. However, staffing shortages and potential appeals could strain resources.
- The adult dental benefit program is on track for implementation, but network development remains a challenge, particularly in underserved rural areas.
- Broader issues, such as workforce shortages, low reimbursement rates, and the need for innovative strategies to improve access to care, remain critical priorities for the committee.
- The Department emphasized the need for ongoing support and flexibility as they navigate these complex initiatives to ensure sustainable healthcare services in New Hampshire.
