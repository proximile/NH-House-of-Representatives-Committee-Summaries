**New Hampshire House of Representatives Session Summary – February 2, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 2, 2023, for a session that included a mix of procedural activities, legislative debates, and personal reflections. The meeting began with traditional opening proceedings, including a prayer led by Reverend Father Paul M. Leary, the Pledge of Allegiance, and a rendition of the National Anthem by Christina Dyer and Kristin Grant. Leaves of absence were noted, and guests were introduced.

**Consent Calendar and Bill Discussions**  
The session moved to the consent calendar, where several bills were removed or tabled, including **HB 140**, **HB 148**, and **HB 422-FN**. Key bills debated included:  
- **HB 33**, **HB 94**, **HB 230-FN**, **HB 445-FN**, and **HB 95**, with **HB 95** generating significant discussion. This bill, which would enable municipalities to adopt rental practice regulations, faced strong opposition from critics who argued it would harm landlords and the housing market. A motion to table the bill failed, but the committee report recommending it be deemed inexpedient to legislate was ultimately adopted.  
- **HB 295-FN**, requiring select board and school board meetings to be recorded and broadcast live online, was tabled.  
- **HB 412**, re-establishing a commission to study revenue alternatives for funding state highways and bridges, was passed.  
- **HB 140**, which sought to proclaim January 24th as Granny D-Day in honor of Doris Haddock, was deemed inexpedient to legislate.  
- **HB 148**, raising the minimum value of county purchases subject to competitive bidding, was tabled.  
- **HB 422-FN**, proposing a public county registry of monthly rent charged by landlords, was indefinitely postponed.  

**Personal Reflections and Announcements**  
Several representatives shared personal stories and reflections:  
- **Representative Roesener** drew parallels between the Hindu festival of Sankranti (Pongal) and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, emphasizing the importance of community building, love, and harmony across diverse cultures. She shared her heritage with colleagues and offered a symbolic trail mix.  
- **Representative Rosner** apologized for a procedural misstep earlier in the session and called for a moment of silence to honor Tyree Nichols, a 29-year-old man fatally beaten during a traffic stop in Memphis, Tennessee, on January 7, 2023.  
- **Representative Wendy Thomas** shared her personal health struggles, including a battle with a virus and cancer, and expressed gratitude for the support she received from her legislative colleagues.  
- **Representative Rung** highlighted the importance of early lung cancer detection, inspired by the experiences of Representatives Mary Hagen Phillips and Kat McGee.  
- **Representative Mangipudi** discussed the cultural significance of the Hindu festival Makara Sankranti, marking the transition to longer days.  

**Unanimous Consent and Adjournment**  
The session concluded with unanimous consent requests, announcements of upcoming committee meetings and caucuses (including a disability caucus meet and greet and a meeting for Masons), and the adoption of the third reading motion. The House adjourned and recessed until February 14, 2023, at 10:00 AM.  

This session highlighted the House’s focus on both legislative matters and the personal, cultural, and community-oriented aspects of its members’ lives.
