The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on February 3, 2023, covered a wide range of topics related to state operations, focusing on the Department of Corrections (DOC), the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA), space planning, capital projects, personnel management, and administrative modernization. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Department of Corrections (DOC):**
The DOC provided an overview of its operations, emphasizing its commitment to public safety, rehabilitation, and employee well-being. Key points included:
- **Facilities and Staffing Challenges**: The DOC oversees three correctional facilities, a secure psychiatric unit, and 11 probation and parole offices. It faces significant staffing shortages, with a 50% vacancy rate for correctional officers due to competition with other law enforcement roles, outdated facilities, and high stress levels. The aging New Hampshire State Prison for Men, built in 1878, exacerbates these issues. The DOC is requesting $2.5 million to design a new facility, estimated to cost $500 million.
- **Population Trends**: Incarceration rates have declined due to diversion programs like Drug Court, Mental Health Court, and Veterans Court, which aim to reduce incarceration when public safety allows.
- **Rehabilitation Programs**: The DOC focuses on vocational training, particularly for women, and initiatives like the Pathways Program and re-entry care coordination to reduce recidivism and support reintegration.
- **Employee Well-being**: The DOC is implementing wellness initiatives, such as comfort dogs and improved workspaces, to reduce stress and improve morale.
- **Legislative Support**: The DOC seeks funding for infrastructure improvements, retention incentives, and continued support for its programs.

### **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA):**
The DRA discussed its mission to administer tax laws fairly and efficiently, highlighting:
- **Tax Administration**: The DRA collects nearly $2.9 billion annually, about 80% of the state’s general and education trust fund. It manages property assessments, tax rates, and compliance, including taxes on public utilities and railroad properties.
- **Modernization Efforts**: The Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) and Granite Tax Connect (GTC) have streamlined tax administration, improved efficiency, and enhanced taxpayer services. The DRA is requesting additional funding to maintain RIMS consulting services and hire IT staff.
- **Compliance and Enforcement**: The DRA emphasizes voluntary compliance, using reminder letters and federal tax data to ensure taxpayers meet their obligations.
- **Budget Requests**: The DRA seeks funding for low and moderate-income hardship grants and to support ongoing system upgrades.

### **Space Planning and Capital Projects:**
The meeting addressed space planning, building renovations, and capital projects, focusing on:
- **Sununu Youth Development Center**: The closure of the center is imminent, with pending legislation to address its future. A new 18-bed facility is estimated to cost $21.5 million and take 18 months to construct.
- **Parking Garage Project**: A $25 million parking garage project was discussed, with concerns about oversight, cost, and the number of parking spaces. Representatives emphasized the need for transparency and collaboration with the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) to ensure the project stays within budget.
- **Infrastructure Challenges**: Aging and substandard buildings require significant remediation, with “hoteling” (shared desk spaces) considered as a potential solution to optimize space utilization.

### **Personnel and Administrative Processes:**
The state faces significant challenges in personnel management and administrative modernization, including:
- **Staffing Shortages**: High vacancy rates and a tight labor market have impacted hiring. The state is reviewing its classification system, which dates back to 1950, to align with market compensation and improve flexibility.
- **Compensation and Collective Bargaining**: Corrections officers, among the lowest-paid state employees, have seen recent salary increases. The state manages collective bargaining with 14 unions and is working to modernize its compensation system.
- **Procurement and Contracts**: The state emphasizes fair bidding processes and competitive pricing for state contracts, with efforts to standardize procurement and improve vendor engagement.
- **Technology Upgrades**: The state is upgrading its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to cloud-based storage, modernizing financial, payroll, purchasing, and HR software at an estimated cost of $25 million.

### **Work-from-Home Trends and Health Benefits:**
The state is evaluating the impact of remote work on office space needs. While some employees work from home, most state agencies still require in-office presence at least one day every two weeks. The state provides self-insured health benefits for employees and retirees but is not extending these benefits to municipalities due to administrative complexities.

### **Key Themes:**
- **Staffing and Budget Constraints**: Both the DOC and DRA face significant staffing shortages and budget challenges, impacting their ability to fulfill their mandates.
- **Infrastructure and Modernization**: Aging facilities and outdated systems require significant investment, with efforts underway to modernize infrastructure and administrative processes.
- **Efficiency and Transparency**: Both departments emphasize the importance of efficiency, transparency, and collaboration to improve operations and public service.
- **Legislative Support**: Continued legislative support is critical for funding, infrastructure improvements, and program continuity to address these challenges effectively.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the state’s efforts to manage resources efficiently, modernize systems, and address staffing and infrastructure challenges while ensuring transparency and fairness in state operations.
