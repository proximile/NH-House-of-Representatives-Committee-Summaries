The amendment passed 18-2.
   - HB 135 was also discussed, with an amendment proposing to ban no-knock warrants except in extreme cases where safety or evidence preservation is at risk. Representatives emphasized the need for high standards and accountability in their use.

2. **Police Misconduct (HB 156)**:

3. **Asset Forfeiture and Federal Referrals (HB 593)**:
   - HB 593, a complex bill addressing asset forfeiture and federal referrals, generated confusion among committee members.
