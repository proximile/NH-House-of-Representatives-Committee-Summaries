### **Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (02/13/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 13, 2023, to discuss a range of energy-related bills and initiatives. The meeting focused on advancing renewable energy, improving grid resiliency, addressing greenhouse gas emissions, and exploring innovative energy solutions. Key topics included microgrids, carbon pricing, renewable portfolio standards (RPS), net metering, biomass, and thermal renewable energy credits (T-RECs). Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes from the meeting.

---

### **1. House Bill 558: Microgrids**
**Overview**:
- Sponsored by Representative Keith Ammon, **HB 558** proposes the creation of **microgrid zones**—deregulated industrial power areas where businesses can directly interact with power generators. The bill aims to improve grid resiliency, reduce energy costs, and attract new industries by offering cheaper energy alternatives.
- Microgrids must provide up to 20% of their power to the traditional grid and are overseen by the Department of Energy to ensure grid stability and clean energy production.
- The bill limits microgrid zones to three per county, with a minimum size of five acres, to manage growth and avoid unintended consequences.

**Testimony and Concerns**:
- **Support**: Dennis Porter (Satoshi Action Fund) highlighted microgrids' potential to lower energy prices, attract jobs, and reduce carbon emissions. Drew Armstrong (Cathedral Bitcoin) discussed how microgrids could support Bitcoin mining as a dispatchable load, improving grid resiliency.
- **Neutral**: Griffin Roberts (NH Department of Energy) raised concerns about unclear definitions, cybersecurity, and the department’s expanded oversight role. Sam Evans Brown (Clean Energy NH) supported microgrids as "non-wires alternatives" to reduce infrastructure costs.
- **Opposition**: Michael Licata (Eversource Energy) opposed the bill as written, citing conflicts with existing state statutes and the Department of Energy’s capacity to manage microgrids.

**Outcome**: The committee heard extensive testimony on the potential benefits and challenges of microgrids. While many stakeholders supported the concept, they called for further refinement of the bill, particularly regarding cybersecurity, county-level oversight, and alignment with New Hampshire’s utility structure.

### **2. House Bill 372: Carbon Pricing Study Commission**
**Overview**:
- Introduced by Representative Tony Kaplan, **HB 372** proposes a study commission to examine the impacts of carbon pricing mechanisms on New Hampshire’s economy, industries, and environment.
- The bill highlights the increasing global adoption of carbon pricing, including initiatives like the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Canada’s carbon pricing regime.

**Key Points**:
- Carbon pricing aims to internalize the hidden costs of fossil fuel use, such as health impacts and climate change, by assigning a cost to carbon emissions.
- The commission would assess the potential impacts of carbon pricing on New Hampshire’s economy, businesses, and environment, providing recommendations for future policy.

**Outcome**: The committee discussed the need for New Hampshire to prepare for potential federal or regional carbon pricing regimes, with a focus on ensuring affordability for low-income households and driving innovation in carbon-intensive industries.

### **3. Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and Net Metering**
**Key Discussions**:
- **RPS**: The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining and expanding the RPS to diversify energy sources, stabilize energy costs, and support industries like biomass and forestry. Representative Harrington proposed consolidating several RPS-related bills into a single bill.
- **Net Metering (HB 523)**: The bill proposes increasing the net metering limit from 1 MW to 4.99 MW, allowing larger-scale renewable energy systems to sell excess power back to the grid. Supporters argued this would lower energy costs, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and benefit businesses and the grid. Critics suggested waiting for the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to complete its review of net metering tariffs before making statutory changes.

**Outcome**: The committee voted to retain several RPS-related bills for further consolidation and study, reflecting a focus on thorough analysis and bipartisan collaboration.

### **4. House Bill 233: Thermal Renewable Energy Credits (T-RECs)**
**Overview**:
- **HB 233** addresses metering issues for thermal energy systems, particularly those using wood pellets and wood chips. The bill seeks to enable the Department of Energy to consider alternative verification methods for energy output, rather than requiring costly BTU meters for residential and small-scale systems.

**Key Points**:
- The bill aims to simplify participation in the thermal REC market, reduce alternative compliance payments (ACPs) made by utilities, and lower electricity costs.
- Stakeholders discussed the environmental and economic benefits of using locally sourced wood for heating, as well as concerns about carbon emissions and forest sustainability. Experts clarified that New Hampshire’s forests are growing more wood than is harvested, ensuring sustainability.

**Outcome**: The committee highlighted the complexities of implementing thermal REC programs, balancing economic incentives, environmental concerns, and administrative feasibility. The bill aims to incentivize the adoption of modern wood heating systems while ensuring accurate and verifiable energy output measurements.

### **5. Biomass and Forestry Management**
**Key Discussions**:
- Representatives expressed confidence in New Hampshire’s ability to sustain wood harvesting, citing historical data and the need for younger forests to address aging forest growth.
- Biomass products like wood chips were described as byproducts of timber harvesting and lumber production, ensuring that biomass bills would not lead to deforestation.
- The opportunity presented by thermal markets to utilize forest materials and byproducts from mills was emphasized.

**Outcome**: The committee reaffirmed the importance of biomass in supporting renewable energy goals and forest health, while addressing concerns about carbon emissions and sustainability.

---

### **6. Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and Energy Efficiency**
**Key Discussions**:
- **HB 524** focuses on investing more RGGI auction proceeds into energy efficiency programs rather than distributing them as bill credits. The Department of Energy and Environmental Services provided neutral testimony, highlighting the fiscal impact and potential benefits of the bill.
- Testimony emphasized the public health benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, linking air pollution to respiratory diseases, tick-borne illnesses, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s.

**Outcome**: The committee discussed the need to maximize the benefits of RGGI funds, with a focus on improving energy efficiency and public health outcomes.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected New Hampshire’s efforts to explore innovative energy solutions, improve grid resiliency, and address climate change. Key takeaways included:
- Strong support for microgrids, with calls for further refinement of **HB 558**.
- A focus on studying carbon pricing through **HB 372** to prepare for future policy shifts.
- Emphasis on maintaining and expanding the RPS and net metering to support renewable energy goals.
- Simplifying participation in thermal REC programs through **HB 233** to incentivize renewable heating systems.
- Continued investment in energy efficiency and public health through RGGI funds.

The committee plans to continue refining these proposals based on stakeholder feedback, with additional discussions and subcommittee meetings scheduled in the coming weeks.
