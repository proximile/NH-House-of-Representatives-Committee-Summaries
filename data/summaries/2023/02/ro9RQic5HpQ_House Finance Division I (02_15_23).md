**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (02/15/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on February 15, 2023, centered on the **Exit 4A project**, a significant infrastructure initiative involving the construction of a new exit on I-93 and connecting roads in Derry and Londonderry. The discussion also focused on **House Bill 5506**, which addresses the design of a rail trail crossing as part of the project. Key themes included project design, cost and timeline considerations, environmental impacts, and public involvement. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

### **Project Overview and Key Issues**
1. **Exit 4A Project**:
   - The project involves building a new interstate exit and reconstructing roads to connect it to Route 102. It aims to alleviate traffic congestion and support economic development in the region.
   - The towns of Derry and Londonderry have a municipal agreement with the Department of Transportation (DOT), capping their financial contribution at $5 million. Any additional costs would be the state’s responsibility.
   - The project’s **environmental impact statement** was completed around 2015, but changes to the design, such as adding a tunnel, would require reevaluation.

2. **Rail Trail Crossing Design**:
   - The debate centered on whether to include a **tunnel** or an **alternative design** for the rail trail crossing. Proponents of the tunnel argued it offers better long-term value, safety, and alignment with the original federally approved design from 2020. Critics of the alternative design cited its environmental impact on wetlands and questioned its safety and functionality.
   - The DOT explained that changing the design to include a tunnel would cause significant delays, pushing construction from 2024 to 2025. The department also noted that both the tunnel and alternative designs have wetland impacts, though the alternative design affects slightly more wetlands.

3. **Design-Build Process**:
   - The DOT used a **design-build process** for the project, which allows for flexibility and faster completion but has led to confusion and controversy. Stakeholders, including some representatives, expressed frustration over the lack of transparency and public input in the decision-making process. The alternative technical concepts (ATCs) proposed by contractors were a particular point of contention.

### **Key Concerns and Debates**
1. **Cost and Delays**:
   - Representatives expressed concern about the potential delays and increased costs associated with changing the project design. The DOT emphasized the need to move forward without further delays to avoid economic consequences, particularly for developments like Woodmont Commons, which are hindered by the project’s delays.
   - There was debate over whether to include funding for the tunnel in the state budget or retain the current plan. Ultimately, a motion was passed to retain the bill, meaning the issue will be addressed in the budget process rather than moving forward with immediate changes.

2. **Environmental and Economic Impact**:
   - The economic benefits of the rail trail, including job creation and increased revenue for surrounding towns, were highlighted. Studies referenced during the meeting showed significant return on investment (ROI) for such projects.
   - Environmental concerns were raised regarding the alternative design’s impact on wetlands, with some retired DOT engineers describing it as “problematic.”

3. **Public Involvement and Transparency**:
   - Representatives criticized the lack of public input and transparency in the decision-making process. Some argued that public hearings felt like a “sham” because the DOT had already decided on the alternative plan.

4. **Grade-Level Crossing Debate**:
   - Some representatives questioned the need for a tunnel or underpass, suggesting a **grade-level crossing** might suffice. The DOT explained that the decision for a grade-separated crossing was based on projected pedestrian and cyclist usage, though comparisons were made to other areas with similar traffic that lack such features.

5. **Criminal Implications**:
   - A bill initially included criminal implications for altering the design, which was later amended out. This added a contentious tone to the debate.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with discussions on the next steps, including potentially including the project in the state budget. The DOT emphasized the need to move forward without further delays to avoid economic consequences. The decision to retain the bill means the issue will be revisited during the budget process, allowing for further deliberation on the design and funding of the Exit 4A project.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities and trade-offs involved in the Exit 4A project, with a focus on balancing cost, time, design considerations, environmental impacts, and public input.
