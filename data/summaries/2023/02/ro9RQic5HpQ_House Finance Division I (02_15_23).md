**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (02/15/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on February 15, 2023, centered on **House Bill 5506**, which addresses the design and construction of Exit 4A, a project connecting I-93 to Route 102 in Derry and Londonderry. The discussions focused on the inclusion of a **tunnel** versus an **at-grade crossing** for the rail trail component of the project, as well as broader concerns about delays, funding, and stakeholder involvement. Key points from the meeting include:

---

### **Project Delays and Uncertainty**
- The bill has introduced uncertainty, delaying the project's design and implementation. If the current plan is maintained, construction is expected to begin in 2024. However, switching to a tunnel design would push the timeline to 2025.
- The legislative process, including amendments and approvals from the governor and executive council, has caused significant delays. The commissioner has faced repeated questions about the project's progress during executive council meetings.

---

### **Tunnel vs. At-Grade Crossing**
- **Support for the Tunnel**: Representative Daniel Popovich Miller (Windham) argued that the tunnel provides better long-term value despite higher initial costs. Representative Steve Pearson (Rockingham District 13) noted that the tunnel was part of the original design approved by federal authorities in 2020 and included in all initial bids.
- **Concerns About Reinstating the Tunnel**: Critics raised concerns about potential delays and additional costs if the tunnel were reinstated after the project had progressed.
- **Safety and Environmental Considerations**: The Department of Transportation (DOT) highlighted that both options have environmental impacts, with the at-grade crossing slightly increasing wetland disturbances. Safety concerns were raised about the at-grade crossing, particularly for pedestrians and cyclists, given the higher speed limits on the connector road.

---

### **Design-Build Process and Transparency**
- The project initially used a **design-build process**, allowing contractors to propose alternative designs, including removing the tunnel to save time and costs.
- Critics argued that the process lacked transparency and excluded key stakeholders, such as rail trail groups, from decision-making. Some stakeholders felt that public hearings were not adequately inclusive.

---

### **Economic and Development Impacts**
- Representatives from the business community, including developers of the Woodmont Commons project, emphasized the economic importance of completing Exit 4A without further delays. They warned that delays could jeopardize significant investments and job creation in the region.
- The towns of Derry and Londonderry are contractually limited to contributing $5 million each to the project, with any additional costs to be borne by the state. This financial constraint influences the feasibility of design changes.

---

### **Historical Context and Disagreements**
- The discussion has been ongoing since 1985, highlighting the prolonged nature of the issue. There is disagreement among town councils regarding the project's direction, with some opposing the current interpretation of the vote.
- In a hypothetical scenario, a representative asked whether the state would proceed with a tunnel project if the town of Derry covered the costs. The response emphasized that the Town Council prioritizes avoiding delays over specific design choices.

---

### **Motion to Retain the Bill**
- A motion was made to retain the bill and include it in the budget, allowing for further discussions with the DOT to prioritize the project. This approach aims to apply pressure on the DOT to expedite the process.
- The motion passed with a vote of 6-2, and the bill will be revisited in future budget discussions.

---

### **Next Steps**
- The committee discussed potentially including funding for the tunnel in the state budget to address cost concerns.
- However, concerns remained about the potential for delays, which could impact the overall project timeline and economic benefits.

---

### **Summary**
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing project design, funding, and legislative processes in the Exit 4A project. Key tensions included ensuring safety, minimizing costs, and avoiding delays while addressing the concerns of stakeholders, including local communities, businesses, and trail advocates. The decision to retain the bill and revisit it in budget discussions reflects an effort to prioritize the project while navigating competing priorities and prolonged disagreements.
