The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 3, 2023, covered a wide range of critical topics related to the state’s health, human services, and infrastructure. The discussions highlighted the complexities of addressing immediate needs while planning for long-term solutions, particularly in areas such as juvenile justice, behavioral health, mental health services, Medicaid IT modernization, and facility management. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC) Replacement and Juvenile Justice**
The committee focused on the design, funding, and construction of a replacement facility for the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC), which is slated for closure. Key considerations included:
- **Design and Funding**: Allocating $2 million for site evaluation and design options, with two facility size models (6-8 beds vs. 12-18 beds). An 18-bed facility was estimated to cost $21.5 million, with $1.8 million for design and analysis.
- **Timeline and Process**: The construction process is expected to take 2.5 years, with occupancy by September 2025. The committee debated whether to use a two-step process (design and construction) or a single design-build contract.
- **ARPA Funds**: Concerns were raised about using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds due to deadlines and eligibility.
- **Capacity and Flexibility**: Declining juvenile detention numbers prompted discussions about facility size and future repurposing, such as converting it into a therapeutic or psychiatric treatment facility.
- **Operational Challenges**: Severe staffing shortages and high turnover at SYSC were noted, with only 17 of 45 youth counselor positions filled. The current population is 12 juveniles, down from historical highs due to reforms and community-based alternatives.
- **Legislative Action**: House Bill 49 (HB 49) proposes extending SYSC’s closure date to June 30, 2023, and allocating $1.5 million for operational costs. Amendments were proposed to fund site evaluation and design for the replacement facility.

### **Behavioral Health Crisis Response System**
The committee reviewed the New Hampshire Rapid Response program, a behavioral health crisis system designed to provide early intervention and reduce the need for higher levels of care. Key points included:
- **Three-Pillar Model**: The system focuses on "someone to call, someone to respond, and somewhere to go," with a 24/7 contact center and 10 mobile crisis teams deployed statewide. Police involvement is rare (<2% of cases).
- **Performance and Data**: In its first year, the contact center engaged over 22,000 individuals, with 7,000 mobile deployments. Approximately 42% of deployments involved youth.
- **Crisis Apartments**: Limited crisis apartments provide short-term stays for individuals in need of support.
- **Challenges**: Staffing shortages and housing availability remain significant barriers. The committee emphasized the need for clear metrics to evaluate program effectiveness and requested detailed budget alignment with the three-pillar model.

### **Mental Health Services and Facilities**
The discussion centered on New Hampshire Hospital (NHH), Glencliff Home, and the upcoming forensic hospital project:
- **New Hampshire Hospital**: NHH, the state’s largest psychiatric facility, faces severe staffing shortages, with a 45% vacancy rate for nurses and a 65% vacancy rate for social workers. This impacts discharge planning and patient care, with 31 of 154 beds currently offline.
- **Forensic Hospital**: A 24-bed forensic hospital, co-located with NHH, is delayed until summer 2025 due to construction challenges. It will serve patients involved in the criminal justice system.
- **Glencliff Home**: Glencliff, a long-term care facility for individuals with developmental disabilities or severe mental illness, is capped at 75 of its 120 beds due to staffing shortages. It faces significant capital needs, including roofing and water system upgrades.
- **Community-Based Services**: Both NHH and Glencliff struggle with discharging patients due to a lack of community-based housing and support services. Legislators emphasized the need for increased funding for supportive housing and staffing.

### **Medicaid IT Modernization and Long-Term Supports**
The committee addressed the state’s Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) and long-term support services:
- **Medicaid IT Upgrades**: The outdated MMIS system is being replaced with a modular Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) strategy, involving 12 modules over five years for claims processing, provider management, and data analytics.
- **Procurement and Vendor Management**: The state is navigating procurement challenges, ensuring vendors meet requirements and deliver on contracts.
- **Staffing and Budget Constraints**: Low wages and staffing shortages impact project delivery, with reliance on outsourcing and rising contract costs.
- **Long-Term Supports**: The ServiceLink system is being reprocured to streamline care coordination for elderly and adult services.

### **DHHS IT Systems and Strategic Initiatives**
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) outlined its IT strategic initiatives:
- **Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI)**: Enhancing data analytics, warehousing, and visualization tools to support decision-making.
- **Behavioral Health IT**: Upgrading systems for behavioral health services, including electronic health records (EHR) and relationship management systems.
- **Child Welfare Information System**: Developing the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS) to improve case management for the Division of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).
- **Economic Stability Systems**: Expanding the New Heights system for integrated eligibility programs like SNAP, TANF, and Medicaid.
- **Future IT Needs**: Planning for AI implementations and further enhancements to data analytics and business intelligence capabilities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the state’s efforts to address critical challenges in juvenile justice, behavioral health, mental health services, and IT infrastructure. Legislators emphasized the need for strategic planning, adequate funding, and staffing solutions to ensure the continuity and quality of care for vulnerable populations. The discussions highlighted the importance of balancing immediate needs with long-term goals, leveraging federal funds, and modernizing systems to improve service delivery across New Hampshire.
