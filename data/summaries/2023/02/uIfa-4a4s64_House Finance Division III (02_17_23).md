**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting on February 17, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 17, 2023, focused on critical issues related to the state’s healthcare system, budget allocations, and strategic priorities within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The discussions spanned multiple segments, addressing healthcare delivery, workforce challenges, federal and state funding, and long-term planning for the 2024-2025 fiscal years. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

### **Healthcare System Challenges and Improvements**
1. **Direct Billing Transition**: The committee discussed transitioning to direct billing for healthcare providers, aiming for providers to bill DHHS directly instead of through area agencies. The target implementation date is July 1, 2023, with ongoing efforts to address potential limitations.
2. **Conflict-Free Case Management**: Emphasis was placed on ensuring compliance with CMS regulations by separating client services from provider direct services to prevent self-referral.
3. **State Psychiatric Facilities**:
   - **New Hampshire Hospital**: Updates included ongoing staffing challenges, particularly with nursing and social workers. The forensic facility’s opening, initially expected in mid-2024, is now delayed to mid-2025 due to construction and site remediation issues.
   - **Glencliff Home**: Staffing difficulties and the facility’s remote location were highlighted, along with a lower patient census and reduced revenue projections. A prioritized needs request of $1.1 million was discussed to address funding gaps.
   - **Hampstead Hospital**: The state’s acquisition of Hampstead Hospital and plans to convert 21 temporary full-time positions to permanent roles were outlined, though revenue projections remain uncertain.
4. **Federal Funding Concerns**: The committee raised questions about the lack of federal funding for psychiatric facilities like New Hampshire Hospital, Glencliff Home, and Hampstead Hospital, seeking clarity on eligibility issues.
5. **Systemic Issues**: The committee highlighted broader healthcare system challenges, including emergency room bottlenecks and insufficient community-based services for step-down care. Increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates was proposed to attract more healthcare professionals and expand capacity.
6. **Prevention and Community Services**: Emphasis was placed on prevention and community-based interventions, such as mobile crisis services, to reduce reliance on high-cost care and improve access to behavioral health services.

### **Budget and Funding Discussions**
1. **DHHS Budget Overview**: The committee reviewed DHHS’s budget, which is approximately 49% federally funded, 31% general funds, and 20% other funds. Key areas of focus included the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), Hampstead Hospital, and the Division of Behavioral Health.
2. **Contracting Efficiency**: The high percentage of contracting within DHHS was discussed, with comparisons made to other states. The committee emphasized the need to evaluate both contracted services and direct employees to improve efficiency.
3. **Medicaid and Federal Funding Changes**: The expiration of the Granite Advantage Healthcare Program and the Medicaid "unwind" process were highlighted. Enhanced federal matching funds (FMAP) are set to decrease, impacting the state’s budget.
4. **Personnel Costs**: A proposed 10% pay raise for state employees was discussed, including its impact on benefits and overall personnel costs.
5. **Prioritized Needs**: Various DHHS divisions presented funding requests not included in the governor’s recommended budget, such as maternal and infant home visiting programs, crisis stabilization services, and residential provider rates.
6. **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)**: The TANF program was discussed, with the committee noting a $67 million reserve and the state’s requirement to spend general funds to receive federal matching funds.
7. **Long-Term Supports and Services**: Changes to the payment system for developmental disabilities (DD) services were reviewed, including the transition to direct billing by providers rather than through area agencies.

### **Strategic Priorities and Workforce Development**
1. **Commissioner’s Roadmap**: Lori Weaver, Interim Commissioner of DHHS, outlined four strategic commitments:
   - **Workforce Development**: Addressing staffing shortages, improving retention, and providing career development opportunities.
   - **Promoting Thriving Communities**: Enhancing service access, modernizing systems, and supporting behavioral health initiatives.
   - **Organizational Value**: Focusing on quality and performance management, contract lifecycle management, and program integrity.
   - **Resource Management**: Efficiently managing resources to meet high demand.
2. **Workforce Challenges**: DHHS faces significant workforce issues, including high vacancy rates and rapid turnover. Efforts are underway to build a supportive culture and address psychological well-being to improve retention.
3. **Program Quality and Integrity**: The department is working to establish a robust framework for quality and performance management across all program areas, ensuring services meet intended outcomes.
4. **Juvenile Justice System**: Efforts are focused on keeping youth out of the criminal justice system by providing community-based services and assessments.

### **Administrative and Logistical Updates**
1. **Site Visits**: The committee considered organizing site visits to facilities like the Sununu Center and the Men’s Prison to better understand their operations and inform budget decisions.
2. **Future Plans**: DHHS plans to continue developing its infrastructure over the next decade, with a focus on long-term improvements in quality and performance management.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for careful budget analysis, efficient resource management, and strategic investments to address systemic healthcare challenges. The committee emphasized the importance of prevention, community-based services, and workforce development to improve service delivery and support vulnerable populations. Future discussions will continue to focus on aligning budget allocations with DHHS’s strategic priorities and ensuring sustainable funding for critical programs.
