**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (February 7, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 7, 2023, to discuss several key bills related to energy policy, utility planning, and telecommunications infrastructure. The meeting featured extensive debates, testimonies, and discussions on the following topics:

### **1. House Bill 281: Repeal of the Least Cost Integrated Resource Planning (LCIRP) Statute**
The committee focused on **House Bill 281**, which proposes to repeal the LCIRP statute for utilities. The bill’s prime sponsor, **Representative Fred Platt**, argued that the statute is outdated, as utilities no longer own generation assets, and planning is now largely handled by federal entities like FERC and ISO New England. He emphasized that state-level distribution planning is straightforward and does not require the extensive resource planning mandated by LCIRP.

- **Support**: **Tom Franz** (NH Department of Energy) and **Michael Licata** (Eversource Energy) supported the bill, citing the statute’s high costs, resource intensity, and redundancy in the deregulated energy market. They argued that reliability and resiliency are already addressed in other proceedings, such as rate cases.
- **Opposition**: **Don Kreis** (Consumer Advocate) opposed outright repeal, advocating for reform instead. He highlighted the importance of holistic utility planning and public input, warning that repeal could lead to infrastructure overbuilding and higher costs for ratepayers.
- **Committee Consensus**: The committee leaned toward reform rather than repeal, agreeing to continue discussions to find a balanced approach.

### **2. House Bill 298: Deployment of 5G and Wireless Facilities**
The committee discussed **House Bill 298**, which aims to give municipalities more authority over the placement of wireless facilities, ensuring compliance with safety, environmental, and historical preservation standards.

- **Support**: Proponents, including **Cecilia Doucette** (Massachusetts for Safe Technology) and **Deb Hodgman** (Stratham, NH), emphasized the need for local control, public input, and protection from health and environmental risks.
- **Opposition**: Opponents, such as the Business and Industry Association (BIA) and **Jeremy Crandall** (CTIA), argued that the bill could hinder wireless expansion, increase costs, and conflict with federal regulations under the **Telecommunications Act of 1996**.
- **Key Provisions**: The bill requires licensed engineers to certify compliance, ensures facilities do not harm sensitive areas, and allows municipalities to require liability insurance.
- **Concerns**: Ambiguity in terms like "environmental impact" and potential redundancy with federal reviews were raised. Discussions also referenced a **model ordinance** being developed by the Department of Energy to standardize requirements statewide.

### **3. House Bill 605: Increasing the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for Solar Energy**
**House Bill 605**, introduced by **Representative Reynolds**, seeks to increase New Hampshire’s RPS for solar energy, aiming for 3.5% renewable energy procurement by 2050.

- **Arguments For**: Reynolds argued that New Hampshire lags behind other New England states in renewable energy adoption. Increasing the RPS would reduce reliance on fossil fuels, lower energy costs, and enhance energy independence. He highlighted federal incentives like the Investment Tax Credit but stressed the need for state-level action.
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the cost implications, transmission and distribution costs, and the focus on solar energy. Reynolds explained that solar is scalable and feasible, with the market accounting for its intermittency.
- **Interimittency of Renewables**: Discussions addressed the need for storage technologies to manage solar energy’s variability, though current battery storage capacity remains limited.

### **4. House Bill 616: Nuclear Energy and the Renewable Portfolio Standard**
The committee debated **House Bill 616**, which proposes creating a new RPS class for fourth-generation nuclear energy.

- **Support**: Proponents argued that nuclear energy is a clean, reliable base load power source that complements intermittent renewables like solar and wind.
- **Opposition**: **Meredith Hatfield** (The Nature Conservancy) and **John Gage** expressed concerns about destabilizing the RPS and the appropriateness of including nuclear energy. They emphasized the need to focus on rapidly deployable technologies like solar, wind, and storage.
- **Policy Stability**: Stakeholders highlighted the importance of stable energy policies to support long-term investments in renewables.

### **5. House Bill 622: Disbanding the Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy Board (EESEB)**
**House Bill 622**, introduced by **Representative JD Bernardi**, seeks to disband the EESEB and transfer its functions to the Department of Energy.

- **Support**: Bernardi argued that the board’s tasks are redundant and could be managed more efficiently by the department.
- **Concerns**: **Meredith Hatfield** emphasized the need to maintain public input and suggested creating an advisory board to ensure stakeholder engagement.

---

### **6. Other Bills and Logistics**
- **House Bill 381**: The committee voted 16-4 to retain the bill, which deals with the system benefits charge. It cannot be revisited until September.
- **House Bill 385**: An amendment was introduced to require the Department of Energy to document and publicize non-residential ratepayer complaints. The amended bill passed unanimously (20-0).
- **Committee Logistics**: The chair discussed scheduling challenges due to lost committee days and the need to meet during the winter vacation week to stay on track with bill hearings and executive sessions.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Utility Planning**: Discussions on **HB 281** highlighted the need to modernize utility planning processes, with a consensus leaning toward reform rather than repeal.
- **Local Control vs. Federal Regulation**: **HB 298** underscored the tension between local control over wireless infrastructure and federal regulatory frameworks.
- **Renewable Energy**: **HB 605** and **HB 616** reflected ongoing efforts to increase renewable energy adoption, with debates on the role of solar, storage, and nuclear energy.
- **Policy Efficiency**: **HB 622** addressed the need to streamline energy efficiency programs while maintaining stakeholder engagement.

The meeting concluded with plans for further testimony, executive sessions, and potential amendments to address concerns and refine the proposed legislation.
