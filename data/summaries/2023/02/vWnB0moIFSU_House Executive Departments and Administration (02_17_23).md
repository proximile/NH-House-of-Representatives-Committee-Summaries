**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Executive Departments and Administration Meeting (02/17/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives committee meeting on February 17, 2023, focused on four key bills: **House Bill 644**, **House Bill 532**, **House Bill 258**, and **House Bill 644**. The discussions revolved around issues of licensing, regulation, public and animal safety, and occupational oversight. Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of the proceedings:

---

### **House Bill 644: Regulation of Cosmetology and Beauty Services**
This bill was discussed in two segments, addressing different aspects of cosmetology and beauty services.

1. **Initial Discussion**:
   - The bill aimed to allow cosmetologists to hire unlicensed individuals to assist with tasks like client preparation and phone management.
   - A motion to pass the bill failed with a vote of 2-3.
   - The committee then unanimously voted (5-0) to retain the bill for further consideration.

2. **Second Discussion**:
   - The bill also sought to exempt certain beauty services (e.g., blow drying, shampooing, makeup application, threading) from requiring a cosmetology license.
   - Concerns were raised about sanitation, particularly with threading and the use of unsterilized tools, which could lead to infections.
   - Provisions for renting chairs in salons were debated, with some arguing this could reduce oversight and accountability.
   - Opponents highlighted potential health risks, such as airbrushing chemicals near the eyes.
   - Supporters countered that many of these services are low-risk and commonly performed at home, making licensing unnecessary.
   - The broader issue of occupational licensing and its impact on small businesses was also discussed.

### **House Bill 532: Licensing and Regulating Music Therapists**
- The bill proposed licensing and regulating music therapists in New Hampshire.
- The committee debated the necessity of licensing, with some members arguing it would increase access to therapy services and ensure insurance reimbursement, while others viewed it as unnecessary government regulation.
- Concerns were raised about the potential harm from unlicensed practitioners and the challenges music therapists face in obtaining insurance reimbursement without a license.
- A motion to indefinitely postpone the bill (ITL) failed with a vote of 2-3.
- The committee unanimously adopted **Amendment 0480H**, which clarified the scope of practice for music therapists and addressed concerns from speech pathologists.
- The committee ultimately voted 3-2 to recommend the bill with the amendment to the full House.

### **House Bill 258: Chiropractic Care for Animals**
- The bill aimed to allow chiropractors to provide care to animals, provided they receive a referral from a licensed veterinarian.
- The Board of Veterinary Medicine opposed the bill as written, arguing that the use of human modalities on animals requires comprehensive regulation.
- Proposed amendments included requiring chiropractors to obtain a referral from a veterinarian and ensuring they have proper training or certification in animal chiropractic care.
- Concerns were raised about delays in obtaining referrals and potential suffering of animals while waiting for care.
- Some representatives argued that nationally certified animal chiropractors should not require a referral, while others emphasized the need for oversight to prevent unqualified individuals from treating animals.
- The chiropractic association supported referral requirements but opposed expanding the scope of chiropractic care to animals without proper safeguards.

   - Concerns about sanitation, health risks, and the qualifications of practitioners were recurring themes, particularly in discussions about beauty services and animal chiropractic care.

3. **Practical and Economic Considerations**:
