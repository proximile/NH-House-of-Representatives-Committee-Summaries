**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration (02/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 24, 2023, focused on two primary areas of discussion: retirement system reforms, including the introduction of a new retirement plan for state employees, and fiduciary responsibilities in state investments. The discussions highlighted efforts to modernize the state’s retirement system, address financial security for retirees, and ensure accountability in state investments.

### **Retirement System Reforms**
The conversation centered on challenges and proposed changes to the New Hampshire Retirement System, particularly the shift from defined benefit (pension) plans to defined contribution plans. Key points included:

1. **Defined Contribution vs. Defined Benefit Plans**:
   - Concerns were raised about the volatility of the stock market and the risk of retirees outliving their savings, especially if they retire during market downturns.
   - There was debate about the potential cost-shifting to taxpayers if retirees deplete their defined contribution funds and rely on state assistance.
   - The discussion explored hybrid retirement models and emphasized the importance of ensuring retirement benefits are secure and not subject to retroactive changes.

2. **Reclassification of Positions**:
   - An issue was highlighted regarding the reclassification of full-time positions to part-time to avoid pension contributions, particularly for high-ranking public employees like police chiefs, fire chiefs, and school administrators.

3. **New Retirement Plan for State Employees ("Group Three")**:
   - A bill was introduced to create a 401a defined contribution plan for new state employees hired after July 1, 2024, replacing the traditional defined benefit pension plan.
   - The plan is designed to be portable, with immediate vesting, allowing employees to take their contributions with them if they leave state employment.
   - The bill aims to address high turnover rates among new state employees, many of whom leave before vesting in the current pension system.
   - Financial implications were discussed, with assurances that new employees and their employers will continue contributing to the unfunded liability (UAAL) of the existing pension system, ensuring minimal impact on current retirees.
   - Provisions were included to allow new employees to participate in the same health insurance plan as current Group One employees.
   - The plan will be administered by the board overseeing the existing 457 plan, with initial administrative costs covered by the state and the plan expected to become self-sustaining over time.

4. **Opposition from the State Employees Association**:
   - Bob Blaisdell, representing the State Employees Association, strongly opposed the bill, arguing that it undermines the current pension system and fails to address recruitment and retention challenges.
   - He emphasized that the existing system is portable within the first 10 years and protects taxpayer dollars by only allowing employees to take their own contributions if they leave before vesting.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential impact on the financial stability of the current retirement system, particularly in terms of cash flow and supporting existing retirees.

### **Fiduciary Responsibilities in State Investments**
The committee also discussed a bill aimed at ensuring that state investments prioritize fiduciary responsibility over social or political considerations, such as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. Key points included:

1. **Focus on Financial Returns**:
   - The bill seeks to mandate that state investments prioritize financial returns above other considerations, with concerns that ESG-focused investments may yield lower returns.
   - Questions were raised about oversight and accountability, particularly regarding the state treasurer and the New Hampshire Retirement System, and whether they are adhering to fiduciary standards.

2. **Amendments and Oversight**:
   - The committee considered amendments to clarify fiduciary responsibilities and potentially establish a committee to oversee compliance.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a focus on modernizing the state’s retirement system to address financial security for retirees and recruitment challenges for new employees, while also ensuring accountability in state investments. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing financial stability, employee benefits, and taxpayer interests. The committee plans to continue discussions and seek input from stakeholders, including the state treasurer, legal experts, and employee representatives, to refine the proposed legislation.
