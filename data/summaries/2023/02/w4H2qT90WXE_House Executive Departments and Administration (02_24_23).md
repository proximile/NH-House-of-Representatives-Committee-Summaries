**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration (02/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 24, 2023, centered on critical discussions surrounding the state’s retirement systems, fiduciary responsibilities, and proposed legislative changes. The meeting was divided into two main segments: (1) broader concerns about the New Hampshire Retirement System and fiduciary duties, and (2) a detailed examination of a proposed bill (HB 0647) to create a new retirement plan for state employees, referred to as "Group Three." Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and discussions from both segments.

### **1. Retirement System Concerns and Fiduciary Responsibilities**
The first segment of the meeting focused on the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS), fiduciary obligations, and potential legislative amendments. Key highlights include:

- **Retirement Plan Structures**: Representatives discussed the differences between defined benefit (pension) and defined contribution (e.g., 401a) plans. Concerns were raised about the potential for retroactive changes to retirement benefits and the risk of cost-shifting to taxpayers.
  
- **Fiduciary Duty**: A significant portion of the debate centered on ensuring that the state treasurer and NHRS adhere strictly to fiduciary responsibilities, prioritizing maximum investment returns over other considerations like environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Questions were raised about oversight mechanisms and whether current practices align with fiduciary obligations.

- **ESG Investing**: Representatives expressed concerns that ESG investing could reduce returns and emphasized the need for legislation to ensure investments are made solely based on fiduciary duty, not social or political considerations.

- **Potential Abuses**: The committee considered amendments to address potential abuses in the retirement system, such as reclassifying full-time positions to part-time to avoid retirement contributions.

- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to invite the state treasurer and other experts to provide further insights and aimed to finalize amendments by the next meeting to clarify and enforce fiduciary responsibilities.

### **2. Proposed Bill (HB 0647): Group Three Retirement Plan**
The second segment focused on HB 0647, which proposes creating a new retirement plan for state employees hired on or after July 1, 2024. This plan, referred to as "Group Three," introduces a defined contribution (401a) model, distinct from the existing defined benefit pension plans for Groups One and Two (which include teachers, police, and firefighters). Key points of discussion included:

- **Plan Details**:
  - Employees contribute 7% of their salary, and employers contribute an amount equal to the normal cost for Group One employees (currently around 2.5%).
  - The plan is immediately vested and portable, allowing employees to retain their contributions and employer contributions if they leave state employment.

- **Rationale for the Plan**:
  - Proponents argue that the plan is more attractive to new employees, particularly given the high turnover rate among state workers. Many employees leave before vesting in the current pension system (which requires 10 years of service), and this plan ensures they retain their retirement savings.
  - The plan shifts investment risk from the state to employees, limiting the state’s financial obligations to its contributions.

- **Concerns Raised**:
  - The State Employees Association opposes the bill, arguing that defined benefit plans are more secure and preferred by employees. They cited data from other states showing that employees overwhelmingly choose defined benefit plans when given a choice.
  - Critics worry about potential cost-shifting in the future, as retirees may outlive their savings, potentially requiring state assistance.
  - Concerns were also raised about the administrative costs of setting up and managing the new plan, especially during the initial years when the fund balance is low.

- **Financial Impact**:
  - Employers will continue contributing to the unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) for existing retirees, ensuring that current pension obligations are unaffected.
  - The new plan is expected to grow over time through contributions from new hires and investment returns, but it will take several years to become self-sustaining. The state will cover administrative costs during the startup phase.

- **Tax and Retirement Implications**:
  - Employees will manage their investments, placing the burden of making sound financial decisions on them. Some legislators expressed concern about the complexity of managing retirement funds and the potential for poor investment outcomes.
  - The plan does not affect Social Security benefits, as state employees already contribute to Social Security.

- **Legislative Process**:
  - The bill has undergone multiple revisions, with ongoing discussions about clarifying language and addressing concerns. Amendments are being drafted to refine the proposal.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the tension between reducing state liabilities and ensuring retirement security for state workers. Discussions about fiduciary responsibilities underscored the importance of maximizing returns and avoiding non-financial considerations like ESG factors in state investments. Meanwhile, HB 0647 represents a significant shift in retirement benefits for new state employees, moving from a traditional pension system to a defined contribution plan. While proponents argue the plan offers greater flexibility and portability, opponents raise concerns about financial security, administrative costs, and the potential for future cost-shifting to the state. The committee plans to continue refining the bill and addressing fiduciary concerns in upcoming meetings.
