The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on February 28, 2023, centered on critical discussions about the state’s education system, focusing on funding mechanisms, program expansions, and structural reforms. The meeting featured detailed presentations and debates on the budget, the Education Trust Fund, school building aid, and the expansion of the Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) program. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Department of Education Structure and Funding**
Commissioner Frank Edelblut provided an overview of the New Hampshire Department of Education’s structure and funding. The department is organized into four divisions: Workforce Innovation, Educator Analytics and Resources, Learner Support, and Educator Support in Higher Education. These divisions oversee vocational rehabilitation, charter schools, data analytics, and credentialing functions. The department’s funding comes from general funds, federal funds, and the Education Trust Fund, which supports K-12 education, special education, career and technical education (CTE), and adult education programs.

Key funding areas include:
- **Special Education**: Funding for statewide special education aid and career and tech student organizations.
- **Adult Education**: Increased funding requested to support high school students transitioning to adult education programs.
- **School Security**: A consistent funding approach recommended for enhancing security measures, including access control and emergency response systems.

The department faces staffing challenges, particularly in special education, and has requested 13 new positions to address these gaps.

### **Education Trust Fund and Budget Adjustments**
The Education Trust Fund, which supports public school adequacy, building aid, and charter school funding, currently has a surplus of $148 million. Discussions focused on balancing the fund to avoid large surpluses and ensuring it meets the needs of public schools. Budget adjustments include moving certain expenses, such as state assessments and court-ordered placements, into the Education Trust Fund to clarify education-related costs.

### **School Building Aid and Infrastructure Funding**
The meeting highlighted significant challenges with the School Building Aid program, which has a funding cap of $50 million and a backlog of approved projects, including Concord’s $70 million project. Proposals to increase the cap to $60 million or $70 million were discussed, alongside calls for a more predictable and equitable funding model. Suggestions included:
- Establishing a **per capita allocation** based on student population.
- Creating a **sinking fund** model for long-term infrastructure planning.
- Conducting a **statewide assessment** of school buildings to prioritize critical projects.

Concerns were raised about the inefficiency of the current application-based system and the need for a smoother transition to a new funding model.

### **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) and School Choice**
The expansion of the EFA program, which allows parents to use state funds for private or alternative education options, was a contentious topic. The program is expanding to include foster care students, homeless youth, and persistently bullied students. Supporters argued that EFAs provide necessary educational choices, while opponents expressed concerns about the diversion of funds from public schools and the potential benefit to families already in private schools.

### **Education Funding Formula and Adequacy Aid**
The meeting addressed proposed changes to the state’s education funding formula, including:
- Increasing **base adequacy aid** from $3,866.18 to $4,700 per student.
- Raising **free and reduced lunch (F&R) aid** from $1,900 to $2,500.
- Phasing out the **hold harmless grant** over 10 years starting in FY 2026, ensuring no district loses funding in the short term.
- Increasing the **extraordinary needs grant** by 50% to offset funding reductions in some districts.

Uncertainties around Medicaid direct certification and SNAP eligibility expansion could add significant costs to the adequacy formula, necessitating careful budgeting and maintaining a surplus in the Education Trust Fund.

### **Adult Education and Prison Programs**
Adult education programs, including Granite State High School for inmates, were discussed as critical tools for reducing recidivism. The importance of funding these programs was emphasized, alongside proposals for a pilot preschool initiative.

---

### **Proposed Changes in House Bill 2 (HB2)**
The governor’s budget proposal includes significant changes to the education funding system, such as:
- Removing the third-grade reading aid component.
- Adjusting additional grants for charter schools and phasing out the stabilization grant over 10 years.
- Reducing excess swept funds by $8 million while allowing communities to retain their swept funds.

These changes aim to increase base adequacy aid, ensure long-term financial stability, and address declining enrollment trends. However, concerns were raised about the need for public hearings and transparency, given the complexity and potential long-term impacts of the proposed reforms.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s education funding system, highlighting the need for:
1. **Predictable and Equitable Funding**: Establishing consistent funding formulas for school building aid and adequacy programs.
2. **Long-Term Planning**: Addressing infrastructure backlogs and enrollment declines through sustainable funding models.
3. **Balancing Priorities**: Ensuring adequate funding for public schools while expanding alternative education options like EFAs.
4. **Transparency and Public Input**: Engaging stakeholders and conducting thorough vetting of proposed changes to the funding formula.

Overall, the discussions reflected a commitment to addressing immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for a more equitable and sustainable education system in New Hampshire.
