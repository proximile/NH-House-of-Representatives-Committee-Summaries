The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 8, 2023, covered a wide range of topics related to healthcare, consumer protection, cannabis legalization, and emerging technologies. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Healthcare and Insurance**

1. **Healthcare Funding and Compliance**:
   - Representatives discussed challenges in funding healthcare initiatives, particularly for Medicare and self-insured individuals. Concerns were raised about limited funding pools and federal regulations affecting program feasibility.
   - **Ambulance Service Billing**: A bill to address direct payments to ambulance services was retained, with discussions on exploring federal grants as an alternative to legislative solutions.
   - **Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)**: A bill setting standards for PBMs, focusing on contract transparency and consumer protection, was considered for retention.
   - **Hospital Price Transparency**: A bill aimed at improving hospital price transparency was debated, with some questioning its necessity given existing federal laws. Concerns about duplication of efforts and the burden on hospitals were highlighted.
   - **Health Insurance Coverage for PFAS Care**: A bill mandating health insurance coverage for preventative care related to PFAS exposure was discussed. The bill referenced CDC guidelines, which have not yet been formally adopted, leading to debates about its necessity and scope.

2. **Prescription Drug Affordability and Healthcare Systems**:
   - **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB)**: The role of the PDAB in addressing drug costs and pharmaceutical pricing transparency was discussed. The bill was retained for further study.
   - **All-Payer Healthcare System**: A bill proposing the study of an all-payer healthcare system, modeled after Maryland and Pennsylvania, was discussed. The committee voted to establish a study committee to explore its feasibility in New Hampshire.
   - **Interstate Compact for Universal Healthcare**: A proposal for an interstate compact among New England states to create a unified healthcare system was retained for further discussion. The goal is to leverage bulk purchasing power to negotiate lower prices for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals.
   - **Health Insurance Mandates and Costs**: Members debated the impact of health insurance mandates on premiums and deductibles, emphasizing the need for greater transparency and affordability in healthcare.

3. **New Hampshire Comprehensive Health Information System (NH CHIS)**:
   - Jason Aziz, Director of Health Economics at the New Hampshire Insurance Department, presented on NH CHIS, an all-payer claims database established in 2012. The database collects medical, dental, and prescription claims data to inform health policy, assess provider network adequacy, and support legislative commissions.
   - **NH Health Cost Website**: The free website provides cost and quality comparisons for over 250 medical, dental, and prescription services. However, concerns were raised about price variability and the practical value of the site.
   - **Price Transparency and Future Goals**: Aziz highlighted federal price transparency laws and the need to expand the list of shoppable services. Future goals include improving price transparency and reconciling posted rates with actual claims data.
   - **Challenges and Limitations**: Representatives noted the challenges in accurately pricing complex medical procedures and the limitations of the database. Aziz emphasized that the site provides estimates, not definitive costs.

### **Consumer Protection and Emerging Technologies**

1. **PFAS in Food Packaging (House Bill 242)**:
   - The bill seeks to reduce exposure to PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," by prohibiting their use in food packaging. Testimony highlighted the dangers of PFAS, including links to cancer, immune problems, and thyroid disease.
   - Concerns were raised about enforcement, the financial burden on small businesses, and the need for clear labeling and certification of PFAS-free packaging.
   - The committee discussed amendments to address enforcement and fiscal concerns, particularly around municipal oversight and certification requirements.

2. **Freeze-Dried Foods (House Bill 280)**:
   - The bill proposes to allow homestead food operators to sell freeze-dried fruits and vegetables under cottage law. Testimony highlighted the safety and nutritional benefits of freeze-drying, while concerns were raised about the consistency and safety of home equipment.
   - The committee considered potential amendments to allow freeze-dried foods under cottage law while ensuring safety through licensing and process evaluations.

3. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) (House Bill 645)**:
   - The bill addresses the establishment of DAOs as legal entities in New Hampshire. DAOs are blockchain-based organizations that operate democratically and transparently, using smart contracts to manage decision-making and resource allocation.
   - Discussions included the technical aspects, governance, economic benefits, and challenges of DAOs, including consumer protection, legal liability, and taxation.
   - The Department of Revenue raised concerns about the bill’s implications for taxation, particularly the pass-through taxation of DAO profits to members. Amendments were called for to address these concerns.

### **Cannabis Legislation**

1. **Tax Structures and Cultivation Taxes**:
   - Members discussed the importance of clarifying tax consequences for potential investors in the cannabis industry. There was debate over implementing a weight-based tax on cannabis cultivation, with examples from Alaska and Maine cited.
   - Proponents argued that a cultivation tax would provide stable revenue, especially as market prices drop over time. However, concerns were raised about the potential burden of high per-pound taxes if market prices decline.
   - A 5% retail tax was proposed as a simpler alternative to cultivation taxes, with discussions on refining tax structures and addressing concerns about revenue stability and market impacts.

2. **Legalization and Regulation (House Bill 639)**:
   - The bill proposes the legalization and regulation of cannabis in New Hampshire. Key provisions include the creation of a Liquor and Cannabis Commission to oversee the industry, with emphasis on preventing monopolies and ensuring economic opportunities are broadly distributed.
   - **Taxation and Economic Impact**: Significant debate centered on the taxation structure, with suggestions including decoupling cannabis taxes from the rooms and meals tax and proposing a 5% tax rate.
   - **Public Health and Safety**: Provisions were discussed to address public health concerns, including funding for substance abuse education, prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. The bill also includes penalties for consuming cannabis while driving and restrictions on public consumption.
   - **Interstate Commerce Considerations**: The potential legalization of interstate cannabis commerce was discussed, with concerns about its impact on local cultivation taxes and the need for regulatory adjustments.
   - **Removal of Certain Provisions**: The committee decided to remove provisions related to home cultivation and annulment of past cannabis-related convictions from the bill. The annulment issue was deferred to future sessions due to political considerations.
