### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (02/03/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 3, 2023, covered a wide range of legislative topics, including tribal recognition, constitutional conventions, federal taxation, gun control, and environmental accountability. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Tribal Recognition (HCR 7)**
The meeting focused extensively on **House Concurrent Resolution 7 (HCR 7)**, which seeks state recognition for the **Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation**. The resolution sparked a contentious debate, with arguments both in support of and opposition to the measure.

- **Support**: Proponents, including **Representative Sherry Gould** (a member of the Nulhegan Band) and **Chief Don Stevens**, emphasized the tribe’s historical and cultural ties to New Hampshire. They argued that recognition would allow the state to access federal resources for Native American programs and improve relationships with state agencies. Supporters also highlighted the importance of historical justice and reconciliation.
  
- **Opposition**: Critics, including representatives from the **Kowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki People**, raised concerns about the lack of proper vetting and historical documentation. They argued that the resolution could undermine the sovereignty of other Abenaki bands and lead to expanded territorial claims or special privileges. Ethical concerns were also raised about Representative Gould’s involvement, with some suggesting a potential conflict of interest.

- **Calls for a Broader Process**: Opponents urged the committee to establish a formal recognition process that includes all Abenaki bands in New Hampshire rather than recognizing tribes individually through resolutions. They emphasized the need for rigorous historical and genealogical documentation, similar to Vermont’s recognition process.

### **2. Constitutional Conventions (HB 392, HB 269, HCR1)**
The committee discussed several bills and resolutions related to **Article 5 Conventions**, which allow states to propose constitutional amendments.

- **HB 392**: This bill aims to regulate the selection and conduct of delegates in Article 5 conventions, ensuring accountability to the state legislature and the public. Key debates centered on whether delegates should be elected or appointed, with proponents arguing that elected delegates are more democratic and accountable.

- **HCR1**: The committee debated a resolution to apply for a Convention of States under Article 5. Supporters argued it is a constitutional and non-violent way to address federal overreach, while opponents expressed concerns about unintended consequences and the potential for a "runaway convention."

- **HB 269**: This bill, which relates to the authority of New Hampshire delegates at policy-making conventions, was postponed for further review to reconcile its relationship with HB 392.

### **3. Federal Taxation (HR 16)**
The committee discussed **HR 16**, a resolution posing three questions to the IRS regarding the federal income tax. The sponsor challenged the legality and basis of income taxation, arguing that the 16th Amendment did not grant new taxing powers but merely clarified existing ones. The resolution seeks transparency and accountability from the IRS, with the sponsor likening federal claims on individual earnings to a form of "slavery."

### **4. Gun Control and Second Amendment (HR8)**
The committee debated **HR8**, a resolution urging Congress to regulate semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. The discussion centered on the Second Amendment, with opponents arguing that such regulations infringe on individual rights, while supporters emphasized the need to address gun violence, particularly school shootings. The motion to pass the resolution failed with 8 yes votes and 9 no votes.

### **5. Environmental Accountability (HCR 5)**
The committee considered **HCR 5**, a resolution urging legal action against multinational fossil fuel companies for harms caused by disinformation campaigns about the effects of fossil fuel combustion. Supporters argued that such action is necessary, drawing parallels to historical cases like the tobacco and opioid industries. Opponents raised concerns about the economic impact and the role of misinformation in the industry’s profits. The motion passed with a vote of 10-8.

### **6. Other Key Resolutions**
- **American Marshall Plan (HR9)**: This resolution proposed a federal plan to rebuild impoverished communities and strengthen climate resilience infrastructure. Opponents criticized it as unnecessary spending, and the motion to kill the bill passed with 11 yes votes and 8 no votes.
  
- **DC Statehood (HR10)**: The committee debated HR10, supporting statehood for the District of Columbia. Opponents suggested alternatives like merging with Maryland, and the motion to kill the bill passed with 10 yes votes and 8 no votes.
  
- **Puerto Rico Self-Determination (HR13)**: HR13 affirmed support for Puerto Rico’s right to self-determination regarding statehood, independence, or remaining a territory. The motion to pass the resolution succeeded with 17 yes votes and was placed on the consent calendar.

### **7. National Guard Activation (HB229)**
The committee discussed **HB229**, a bill limiting the authority to activate the New Hampshire National Guard without an official declaration of war. The motion to retain the bill for further work passed, with members agreeing on the need for refinement.

### **8. Social Security and Medicare (HR7)**
The committee introduced **HR7**, a resolution affirming support for Social Security and Medicare. The discussion highlighted the programs' importance as safety nets and the need to ensure their solvency, particularly by raising the cap on taxable income for wealthier individuals.
