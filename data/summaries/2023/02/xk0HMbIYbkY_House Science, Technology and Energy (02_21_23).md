### **Key Discussions and Bill Outcomes**

#### **Energy-Related Bills**
1. **House Bill 159**: Pertaining to the default service rate for electricity, this bill was retained for further examination. A subcommittee, led by Representative McWilliams, was formed to delve deeper into its implications.
   
2. **House Bill 458**: This bill, which relates to participation in net energy metering by small hydroelectric generators, was also retained. The committee opted to wait for progress on a similar bill in the Senate before taking further action.

3. **House Bill 509**: The committee voted to retain this bill, which involves phasing out the minimum electric renewable portfolio standard. The sponsor requested retention to allow for additional work on the bill.

4. **House Bill 81**: After a motion to retain the bill failed, it was passed and will move forward. Representative Thomas was tasked with writing the committee report.

5. **House Bill 616**: This bill, which includes a controversial proposal to add nuclear energy to New Hampshire’s renewable portfolio standard, was retained. Some committee members expressed concerns about the inclusion of nuclear energy.

6. **House Bill 622**: An amendment to eliminate the Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy Board (EESEB) and replace it with an annual meeting with the Department of Energy failed. The committee ultimately voted to retain the bill.

7. **House Bill 219**: An amendment to re-codify certain public utility statutes rather than repeal them was adopted unanimously. The bill passed unanimously (20-0) and will proceed to the House floor.

8. **House Bill 523**: This bill aimed to raise the net metering cap from 1 to 5 megawatts. The motion to declare it "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) failed with a tie (10-10), and the bill will proceed to the House floor without a committee recommendation.

9. **House Bill 524**: Addressing the allocation of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) funds, the motion to ITL also failed with a tie (10-10). The bill will go to the House floor without a committee recommendation.

10. **House Bill 631**: This bill proposed requiring utilities to offer smart meter gateway devices. The motion to ITL failed (10-10), and a subsequent motion to retain the bill for further work passed (13-7).

11. **House Bill 161**: Aiming to allow customer generators to participate in group net metering arrangements, the motion to ITL failed with a tie (10-10). The bill will proceed to the House floor without a committee recommendation.

#### **Technology and AI-Related Discussions**
1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A representative highlighted the rapid evolution of AI and the challenges of keeping up with its advancements. Concerns about AI bias, the limitations of current control methods, and the concept of "explainable AI" were discussed. The conversation underscored the difficulty of understanding how AI systems make decisions and the need for ethical guidelines.

2. **House Bill 556**: This bill seeks to promote software freedom by transitioning state agencies from proprietary software to free and open-source software (FOSS). It also addresses AI ethics, data portability, and the expansion of open government data standards. 
   - **Support**: Representative Eric Gallagher argued the bill would reduce dependency on big tech companies and improve software transparency. Dennis Goddard (Oracle Corporation) supported the bill, emphasizing the societal need to address open-source software and AI ethics.
   - **Opposition**: Dennis Goulet (Commissioner, Department of Information Technology) opposed the bill, stating that many provisions are already addressed by the Information Technology Council (ITC). He raised concerns about the support model for open-source software, cost, and feasibility.
   - **AI and Automation**: The committee explored the use of AI and robotic process automation (RPA) in state agencies, particularly for addressing staffing shortages. Goulet mentioned that the ITC would discuss AI at its next meeting and pilot RPA projects soon.

### **General Observations**
- **Net Metering Policy**: A recurring theme was the debate over net metering, with some members advocating for immediate changes and others preferring to wait for the Public Utilities Commission’s (PUC) study to conclude.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Several members emphasized the importance of funding energy efficiency programs to reduce consumer bills and dependence on fossil fuels.
- **Retention of Bills**: The committee retained a significant number of bills (8 out of 12) for further work, prompting concerns about the workload for the fall session.
- **Cautious Approach**: The committee consistently emphasized the need for further study, public input, and alignment with ongoing state initiatives, reflecting a careful approach to complex legislative changes.

### **Key Takeaways**
- The meeting underscored the challenges and opportunities in balancing innovation, cost-effectiveness, and ethical considerations in energy and technology policy.
- While there was strong support for promoting renewable energy and open-source software, concerns about feasibility, cost, and alignment with existing initiatives were prominent.
- The discussions highlighted the need for clear policies on AI, open-source software, and data management, as well as the importance of addressing biases and ethical concerns in AI systems.

The committee concluded the public hearing and moved into an executive session to discuss additional bills, setting the stage for continued deliberation on these critical issues.
