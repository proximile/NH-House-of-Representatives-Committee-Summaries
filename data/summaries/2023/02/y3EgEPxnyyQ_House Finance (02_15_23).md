**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting (02/15/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on February 15, 2023, focused on the state budget, financial management, and key policy priorities. The discussions emphasized fiscal responsibility, strategic investments, and addressing critical needs across education, healthcare, infrastructure, and public safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **Budget Overview and Financial Management**
- **Revenue and Surplus**: The state anticipates a $330 million surplus for fiscal year 2023, with over $500 million in total surplus funds. Revenue projections are conservative, with a slight decrease of 0.5% expected in the coming years. The state’s strong cash reserves ($2.5 billion) and increased interest earnings due to rising interest rates contribute to financial stability.
- **Long-Term Vision**: Governor Sununu emphasized sustainable budgeting, focusing on current surpluses and future revenue projections to ensure fiscal stability.
- **Tax Reforms**: The governor proposed eliminating the outdated communications tax, which taxes phone calls, citing its declining relevance and burden on citizens.

### **Education Funding and Reform**
- **Education Funding Formula**: The governor proposed simplifying the state’s complex education funding formula by increasing base aid per student, adjusting for inflation annually, and consolidating funding streams into a single “extraordinary needs” grant for poorer towns. A 10-year “hold harmless” provision was suggested to phase out outdated funding mechanisms gradually.
- **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**: The budget proposed doubling funding for EFAs, which have seen high demand for alternative education options. Concerns were raised about accountability, with some suggesting the Department of Education should oversee these funds.
- **Charter Schools and Small Districts**: Adjustments were made to ensure equitable funding for charter schools and small districts, with Representative Moody’s bill highlighted as a significant opportunity.
- **School Building Aid**: The budget includes $75 million for school building aid, addressing infrastructure needs.

### **State Employee Compensation and Workforce Challenges**
- **Pay Raises**: A 10% pay raise for state employees effective July 1, 2023, and an additional 2% raise in July 2024 were negotiated to address high vacancy rates and improve retention. These raises are part of broader efforts to manage inflationary pressures and workforce shortages.

### **Healthcare and Medicaid**
- **Medicaid Rates**: A 3.1% increase in Medicaid rates was proposed, though concerns were raised about whether this is sufficient for some providers. Funding for mental health services and the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) was also discussed.
- **Secure Forensic Hospital**: Delays in constructing a secure forensic hospital due to construction issues were noted, with ongoing efforts to address funding and timeline challenges.
