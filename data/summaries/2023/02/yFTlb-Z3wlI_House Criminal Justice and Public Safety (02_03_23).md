### **Key Bills Discussed and Voted On**

#### **Driver’s License Penalties (HB 201 and HP 201)**
- **HB 201**: The bill proposed reducing penalties for driving without a license, changing the first offense from a Class B misdemeanor to a violation. Concerns were raised about public safety and the appropriateness of the current penalties. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).
- **HP 201**: A similar bill aimed to change penalties for driving without a license, with first-time offenders receiving a violation instead of a misdemeanor. Concerns about financial and immigration implications, particularly for undocumented individuals, were discussed. The motion to pass the bill failed, and a report with no recommendation was ordered.

#### **False Accusations Against Law Enforcement (HP 291)**
The bill addressed false accusations against law enforcement officers, with arguments that such accusations waste resources and could be handled under existing civil law. The committee unanimously recommended the bill as ITL.

#### **Constitutional Training for Police (HP 302)**
The bill proposed mandatory constitutional training for police officers, but it was noted that such training is already provided by the Police Standards and Training Council. The committee unanimously recommended the bill as ITL, deeming it unnecessary.

#### **Fentanyl Test Strips (HB 287 and HB 470)**
These bills aimed to provide fentanyl test strips to prevent drug overdoses. Recognizing the urgency of the issue, the committee decided to merge the best parts of both bills and scheduled a full committee work session to finalize the combined legislation, with the goal of passing it this year.

#### **Firearm Rights Restoration (HP 144)**
The bill sought to restore firearm rights for certain non-violent felons. The committee decided to retain the bill and form a subcommittee to create a detailed list of offenses for which rights could be restored. The subcommittee will work on this after the crossover deadline in April.

#### **Bail Reform Bills**
Multiple bills related to bail reform were discussed, with the committee deciding to retain several for further review. The goal is to consolidate them into a comprehensive piece of legislation, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful and systemic approach to address concerns with the current bail system.

#### **HB 504 – Adult Parole Board**
The committee voted to pass HB 504, which involves the appointment of a previous adult parole board, amends stipends, and makes appropriations. The bill aims to address issues with the parole board's ability to meet and function effectively.

#### **HB 643 – Cannabis Legalization**
The committee voted to indefinitely postpone (ITL) HB 643, which proposed the legalization of cannabis. Concerns were raised about unintended consequences, public safety, and the potential for corruption. Some members expressed support for legalization but opposed state-run cannabis stores.

#### **HB 160 – Female Toplessness**
The committee discussed HB 160, which would override local ordinances prohibiting female toplessness. The bill sparked debate about local control, discrimination, and the role of the state in setting standards. The committee voted to ITL the bill, with some members advocating for a more uniform approach across municipalities.

#### **HB 392 – Article 5 Convention Calls**
Representative Jody Knoll introduced HB 392, which deals with Article 5 convention calls and delegate instructions. The bill addresses concerns about efforts to rewrite the Constitution and the influence of money in politics.

### **Procedural Discussions and Next Steps**
Throughout the meeting, there were procedural discussions about retaining bills, writing minority reports, and the timing for completing reports. The committee emphasized the importance of balancing public safety, individual rights, and practical implementation in their decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting showcased a comprehensive approach to addressing criminal justice and public safety issues, with a focus on thoughtful deliberation, systemic reform, and balancing diverse perspectives. Key decisions included retaining bills for further review, recommending bills as ITL, and scheduling work sessions to refine and consolidate legislation. The committee’s efforts reflect a commitment to addressing urgent issues like fentanyl overdoses while carefully considering the implications of broader reforms such as bail reform and firearm rights restoration.
