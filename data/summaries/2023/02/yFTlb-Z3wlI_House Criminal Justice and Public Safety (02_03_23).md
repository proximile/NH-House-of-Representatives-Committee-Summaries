### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (02/03/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on February 3, 2023, to discuss and vote on several bills related to criminal justice, public safety, and social equity. The meeting, delayed due to weather, began with the Pledge of Allegiance led by Representative Fenney. Below is a consolidated summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

#### **Key Bills and Decisions**

1. **HB 201**  
   - The committee voted on whether the bill should pass (OTP). The motion failed with a 10-10 tie, resulting in no recommendation. Representative Stone was tasked with writing a report on the bill.

2. **HB 291 and HB 470 (Drug Safety Testing)**  
   - HB 291 was retained for further study with a 19-1 vote. The committee plans to reconcile it with HB 470 through a work session to create a unified product. A subcommittee was appointed to address this urgent issue.  
   - Initially, a motion to retain HB 470 was made but was withdrawn to allow a full committee work session to merge it with HB 291.

3. **HB 302 (Police Training)**  
   - The committee unanimously voted (22-0) to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill, deeming it unnecessary as the mandated training was already being provided by the police academy.

4. **HB 144 (Firearm Rights Restoration)**  
   - The committee voted unanimously (22-0) to retain the bill. A subcommittee was appointed to develop a detailed list of offenses that could allow the restoration of firearm rights, with work to begin after the crossover deadline in April.

5. **HB 292 (Penalties for Board Members)**  
   - The committee unanimously voted (20-0) to ITL the bill, finding it unnecessary and problematic due to its imposition of personal penalties on board members for illegal meetings.

6. **Toplessness Bill**  
   - The committee debated a bill to override local ordinances prohibiting female toplessness, which is already legal statewide in New Hampshire.  
   - Opponents argued it sends the wrong message to youth, while supporters emphasized equality and municipal autonomy.  
   - The bill passed with a vote of 14-6, with a minority report to be written.

7. **Driver’s License Penalty Bill**  
   - The committee discussed reducing the penalty for driving without a license from a Class B misdemeanor to a violation for first-time offenders, while maintaining harsher penalties for repeat offenses.  
   - Supporters highlighted disproportionate impacts on immigrants, teenagers, and low-income individuals, while opponents raised public safety and insurance concerns.  
   - The bill was defeated with a 10-10 tie, as the motion for "inexpedient to legislate" failed.

8. **HB 38 (Bail Reform)**  
   - The committee voted to retain the bill to allow more time for refinement and collaboration with stakeholders, including the courts, ACLU, and bail commissioners. The goal is to consolidate related bills into comprehensive legislation by the fall.

9. **HB 318 (Eliminating Bail Commissioners)**  
   - The committee voted to retain this bill as part of broader bail reform efforts.

10. **HB 504 (Parole Board Stipends)**  
    - After initial consideration of an ITL motion, the committee shifted to an OTP motion. The bill addresses stipends and appointments for the parole board, focusing on ensuring adequate coverage and funding.

11. **HB 643 (State-Run Cannabis Stores)**  
    - The committee voted to ITL this bill, citing concerns about unintended consequences such as public consumption, addiction, and corruption in state-run systems. Some members supported legalization but opposed state-run stores, favoring a more liberty-minded approach.

12. **HB 16 (Judicial Discretion in Sentencing)**  
    - The committee discussed the importance of judicial discretion, with Representative Harriet Gathright arguing against lawmakers prescribing specific sentencing actions.
