**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (February 7, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 7, 2023, to discuss a wide range of revenue-related topics, including state taxes, federal funds, tobacco settlement agreements, and various other revenue sources. The meeting featured presentations from multiple state agencies and detailed discussions on revenue forecasting, budget planning, and fiscal management. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points covered across the five segments:

---

### **1. Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) and Tobacco Taxes**
- **MSA Payments**: The Department of Justice (DOJ) discussed the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), highlighting the unpredictability of payments due to factors like cigarette sales volume, inflation, and disputes by tobacco companies. Estimated payments for 2023 are around $42 million, with historical variances of $5-10 million. The first $40 million of MSA payments is allocated to the Education Trust Fund, with any excess going to the General Fund.
- **Tobacco Taxes**: Tobacco tax revenue, primarily from "Tech stamps," saw a significant increase during fiscal years 2020 and 2021 due to Massachusetts' ban on flavored tobacco, which drove sales to New Hampshire. However, a slight decline in revenue was observed in fiscal year 2022, attributed to increased health consciousness and workplace smoking restrictions post-COVID-19.

### **2. Business Taxes and Revenue Trends**
- **Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**: The BPT rate is 7.5% for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2023, while the BET rate is 0.55% of the enterprise value tax base. Business taxes are the state’s largest revenue source, contributing $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2022. Corporate filers, particularly Water’s Edge filers, dominate BPT revenue, while proprietorships make up the largest number of filers but contribute less.
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Challenges in predicting revenue were emphasized due to reliance on estimated payments and the lack of detailed information until returns are filed. The state also has a significant credit carryover ($300 million), which poses a potential liability during economic downturns.

### **3. Other Revenue Sources**
- **Abandoned Property**: The Abandoned Property Division collected over $27 million in cash and $2.8 million in shares of stock in fiscal year 2022, with $6.6 million returned to rightful owners. Unclaimed property escheats to county treasuries or the general fund after three years.
- **Interest on Surplus Funds**: The state generates income from investing surplus funds, with $17.2 million in interest earnings in 2022 and an estimated $35 million in 2023. Investments include CDs, U.S. Treasuries, and mutual funds.
- **Miscellaneous Revenues**: The "Other" revenue category includes indirect cost reimbursements, post-retirement benefits recovery, and one-time items, making it difficult to budget consistently.

### **4. Federal Funds and Grants**
- **American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)**: The state received $994 million in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF), with 94% allocated to agencies but only 22% expended as of December 31, 2022. Funds must be obligated by December 31, 2022, and spent by 2026.
- **Medicaid Recoveries**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) discussed Medicaid recoveries, including child support payments, fraud recoveries, and third-party liability. Recoveries have decreased due to the shift from fee-for-service to managed care.
- **Estate Recoveries**: The DHHS Estate Recovery Unit recovers funds from deceased Medicaid recipients’ estates, averaging $1.5 million annually.

---

### **5. Fish and Game Department and License Revenues**
- **Fish and Game Revenue**: License fees are the primary revenue source for the Fish and Game Department, with a sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic as people sought outdoor activities. Revenue has since declined as life returned to normal.
- **Saltwater Licenses**: The committee discussed the consolidation of saltwater license revenues with other license revenues, noting that separating them was deemed unnecessary.

---

### **6. Tax Policy and Administration**
- **Market-Based Sourcing and Single Sales Factor**: New Hampshire shifted to market-based sourcing for sales of services and intangibles, effective December 31, 2021. The single sales factor apportionment, effective December 31, 2022, taxes businesses based solely on sales in New Hampshire.
- **Meals and Rooms Tax**: The 8.5% tax on meals, room rentals, and motor vehicle rentals generated $121 million for the Municipal Revenue Fund in fiscal year 2023. Short-term rentals, particularly through online platforms, saw a 25% year-over-year increase in revenue.
- **Non-Profit Organizations**: Non-profits without 501(c)(3) status are subject to BET, while those with 501(c)(3) status are exempt.

---

### **7. Search and Rescue Operations**
- **Safe Hiking Pass**: The safe hiking pass helps cover variable search and rescue costs but does not fully cover personnel expenses. The committee discussed the authority to charge for rescues in cases of recklessness or negligence.

---

### **8. Revenue Estimates and Budget Planning**
- **Revenue Forecasting Process**: The committee emphasized the importance of collaboration and caucusing to reach consensus on revenue estimates. They planned to finalize estimates by the end of February, with presentations from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and the governor’s budget director.
- **Economic Updates**: The committee expressed interest in updated economic data, particularly regarding job growth and its impact on business enterprise taxes.

---

### **9. Audits and Oversight**
- **Managed Care Organizations**: The state is auditing managed care organizations to ensure they are not overbilling, particularly regarding the medical loss ratio.
- **Single Audit Process**: The annual single audit tracks federal financial awards and expenditures to ensure accountability.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of revenue forecasting and the challenges of managing diverse revenue streams, including taxes, federal funds, and investments. The committee emphasized the need for accurate data, collaboration, and oversight to ensure fiscal responsibility and effective budget planning. Discussions also underscored the significant role of corporate taxes, federal recovery funds, and tobacco-related revenues in New Hampshire’s financial landscape.
