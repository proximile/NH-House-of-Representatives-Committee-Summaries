### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (02/09/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 9, 2023, addressed several critical legislative items, focusing on funding, operational challenges, and the sustainability of state facilities. The discussions centered on **Senate Bill 1 (SB1)**, **House Bill 527 (HB 527)**, and the **Sununu Youth Services Center**, with a strong emphasis on Medicaid reimbursement rates, facility closures, and the need for comprehensive budgeting. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Sununu Youth Services Center (SB1)**

1. **Proposed Replacement Facility:**
   - SB1 proposes funding and planning for a replacement facility for the Sununu Youth Services Center, which is set to close on March 1, 2023.
   - The Senate unanimously passed SB1, but the House committee expressed concerns about the lack of clarity on the facility's location, proposed capacity (6-12 or 12-18 beds), and the $15 million funding cap, which many felt was insufficient due to inflation and rising costs.

2. **Site Evaluation and Funding:**
   - The committee debated the allocation of funds for site evaluation and design options. A proposed amendment suggested reducing the initial $2 million budget to $400,000 for site evaluation, focusing on determining the best location and conceptual design options.
   - Representative Norgren highlighted the flexibility of the Hampstead site, emphasizing its suitability due to its size, location, and existing infrastructure compared to other locations like Manchester or Concord.
   - The committee discussed creating a commission to oversee the evaluation process, ensuring compliance with RSA 1449. The commissionâ€™s role would be advisory, with no decision-making authority.

3. **Employee Concerns and Next Steps:**
   - Representative Norgren expressed concerns about the impact of delays on employees, stressing the need for timely decisions to provide stability and improve retention.
   - The committee agreed to recommend the amended proposal to the full House, prioritizing extending the closure deadline and appropriating funds for continued operations. Further discussions on related bills (SB 49 and SB 527) were postponed to a future work session.

### **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates for Assisted Living Facilities (HB 527)**

1. **Current Issues:**
   - The current Medicaid reimbursement rate of **$58.66 per day** for **804-licensed assisted living facilities** (residential care facilities with 16 beds or fewer) is insufficient to cover operational costs, leading to the closure of several small, family-run facilities.
   - Residents are forced to contribute most of their Social Security or retirement income, leaving them with as little as **$72 per month** for personal expenses.

2. **Proposed Amendment:**
   - HB 527 seeks to increase the reimbursement rate to **$115 per day** for 804-licensed facilities, helping them remain financially viable and continue providing care for Medicaid patients, many of whom are elderly or have mental health needs.
   - The bill clarifies that it applies specifically to 804-licensed facilities, which provide a higher level of care (e.g., medication management, transportation) compared to 805-licensed facilities (continuum of care with more nursing services).

3. **Workforce and Financial Challenges:**
   - Facilities face staffing shortages due to low wages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher reimbursement rates would enable facilities to pay competitive wages and retain staff.
   - The fiscal impact of the bill is expected to be minor, as it targets a limited number of 804-licensed facilities. The proposed increase would help these facilities remain operational without significantly affecting the state budget.

4. **Broader Medicaid Rate Review:**
   - Several representatives and stakeholders emphasized the need to review Medicaid rates across all sectors (e.g., nursing homes, mental health services) during the budget process, rather than addressing this issue in isolation.

### **General Budget and Funding Concerns**

1. **Funding and Operational Challenges:**
   - The committee discussed the urgency of addressing funding and operational challenges for various state facilities, including nursing homes and youth services.
   - Inflation, rising costs, and workforce shortages were recurring themes, with calls for increased funding and sustainable reimbursement rates.

2. **Community and Stakeholder Input:**
   - The committee emphasized the importance of involving local communities and stakeholders in decisions about facility locations and operations.

3. **Key Decisions and Next Steps:**
   - The committee conducted a straw vote on SB1, with 3 members supporting it and 5 opposing it as written. There was consensus on the need to amend the bill to address funding and site selection issues.
   - Further discussions on amendments to SB1 and HB 527 were scheduled, with a focus on addressing funding gaps and ensuring sustainable operations for state facilities.

### **Overall Themes and Conclusions**

1. **Urgency vs. Process:**
   - The meeting highlighted the tension between the need to act quickly to avoid facility closures and the desire to follow a disciplined, thorough process for site selection and funding.

2. **Funding Challenges:**
   - Inflation, rising costs, and workforce shortages were central to the discussions, with a strong emphasis on the need for increased funding and sustainable reimbursement rates.

3. **Community and Stakeholder Involvement:**
   - The committee underscored the importance of involving local communities and stakeholders in decisions about facility locations and operations to ensure transparency and buy-in.

The meeting concluded with the committee adjourning to finalize amendments and prepare for the next steps in the legislative process, emphasizing the need for comprehensive budgeting and timely decision-making to address the state's pressing facility and funding challenges.
