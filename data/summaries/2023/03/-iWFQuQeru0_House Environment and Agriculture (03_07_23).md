### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (March 7, 2023)  

The New Hampshire House Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on March 7, 2023, to address critical environmental and agricultural issues, including landfill siting, groundwater protection, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) legislation. The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to balancing environmental protection with practical considerations, fostering bipartisan collaboration, and engaging stakeholders. Here’s a detailed summary of the discussions and outcomes:  

#### **Key Bills and Discussions**  

1. **HB 56: Landfill Siting and Groundwater Protection**  
   - The committee debated **HB 56**, which proposes **surface water setback rules** for landfill siting to safeguard groundwater.  
   - Proponents argued the bill provides clear, **pro-business guidelines** for siting landfills, while critics raised concerns about its **"one-size-fits-all" approach** and the need for **site-specific analysis**.  
   - A key amendment addressed the **hydraulic conductivity of soils**, requiring a **minimum five-year setback** for landfills from surface water bodies.  
   - Technical disagreements arose over using a single measurement of hydraulic conductivity to determine landfill eligibility, with some members fearing it could exclude viable sites.  
   - The **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** expressed concerns that the bill’s prescriptive language could limit their flexibility in rulemaking.  
   - The committee emphasized the importance of **groundwater monitoring** and suggested a **two-year study** to refine landfill siting criteria.  
   - The bill resulted in a **10-10 tie vote**, meaning the committee made **no recommendation** for or against it.  

2. **HB 253: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Study**  
   - The committee discussed **HB 253**, which establishes a **committee to study EPR** for waste management.  
   - An amendment was introduced to clarify the study committee’s composition and focus on reducing the **tax burden on municipalities** from solid waste disposal.  
   - There was debate over whether the committee should **"propose"** or **"suggest"** legislation, with the committee ultimately choosing **"suggest"** to allow for flexibility.  
   - The study committee will examine EPR laws in other states, territories, and international jurisdictions, and solicit input from industry stakeholders.  
   - The amendment passed unanimously (**20-0**), and the committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill, placing it on the **consent calendar**.  

#### **Guest Presentation: Council of State Governments (CSG)**  
- Former committee chairs **Tara Sad** and **Bob Heffner** from the **Council of State Governments (CSG)** presented on **agriculture and rural affairs** policy in the Northeast.  
- They highlighted the importance of **regional collaboration** on issues like labor shortages, farm bill negotiations, and specialty crops.  
- Committee members were invited to attend upcoming **CSG conferences** in **Toronto** and **Baltimore**, focusing on labor issues in agriculture and processing.  

#### **Committee Dynamics and Past Legislation**  
- The committee reflected on its history of **bipartisan collaboration**, noting that environmental and agricultural issues are typically **non-partisan**.  
- Past challenges with **landfill siting**, **GMO labeling**, and **animal cruelty bills** were discussed, emphasizing the committee’s role in balancing environmental protection with economic interests.  

#### **Personal Updates and Adjournment**  
- Representative **Germano** shared that **Representative Partial**, the sponsor of HB 253, had suffered a **heart attack** after the last House session and was recovering at home. Members were encouraged to reach out to him.  
- The meeting concluded with thanks to the committee for their diligence and adjournment.  

#### **Key Themes**  
1. **Environmental Protection vs. Practicality**: The committee grappled with balancing stringent environmental protections with the practicalities of landfill siting and waste management.  
2. **Technical Challenges**: Disagreements over technical aspects, such as hydraulic conductivity and groundwater flow, highlighted the complexity of the issues.  
3. **Stakeholder Input**: The importance of involving stakeholders, including DES and industry experts, was emphasized.  
4. **Legislative Flexibility**: Efforts were made to ensure the language in the bills allowed for flexibility in implementation and future adjustments.  

Overall, the meeting underscored the committee’s focus on **environmental protection**, **waste management**, and **agricultural policy**, with a strong emphasis on **bipartisan collaboration** and **community engagement**.
