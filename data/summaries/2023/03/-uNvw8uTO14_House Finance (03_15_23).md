### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting (March 15, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on March 15, 2023, for a comprehensive session focused on key legislative issues, including juvenile justice reform, budget considerations, and the allocation of state funds. The meeting highlighted significant debates, amendments, and decisions across multiple bills, with a particular emphasis on the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC), Medicaid reimbursement rates, retirement system funding, and infrastructure projects. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Juvenile Justice Reform and the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)**

1. **Key Discussions**:
   - **Treatment vs. Incarceration**: The committee emphasized the importance of prioritizing therapeutic, trauma-informed care over incarceration for juveniles, especially for non-violent or low-level offenses. Advocates stressed the need for a facility focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment.
   - **Out-of-State Placements**: Concerns were raised about sending juveniles to out-of-state facilities, such as Mill Creek in Arkansas, which lack adequate oversight and therapeutic approaches. There was strong advocacy for keeping juveniles in-state to ensure better treatment and community connections.
   - **Staffing and Budget**: Proposed staffing ratios (e.g., one-to-eight staff-to-youth) were criticized as inadequate and potentially unsafe. Many argued for increased investment in staffing and therapeutic services to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes.
   - **Historical Context**: The history of abuse and recidivism at SYSC was referenced, underscoring the need for a fundamentally different approach in the new facility.

2. **Amendments**:
   - **Amendment 767**: Proposed a new facility with 12 to 18 beds, trauma-informed care, and operational changes. It limited commitments to the most serious offenses, such as murder and sexual assault.
   - **Amendment 892**: Added language to ensure consistency in the Juvenile Justice Act regarding detention and commitment criteria.
   - **Amendment 804**: Focused on funding and operational aspects, aligning with the Senate’s SB1. It was defeated (12-13) despite support from advocates and the department.

3. **Voting and Next Steps**:
   - **Amendment 892** was adopted, addressing funding and site selection for the new facility.
   - The committee emphasized the need for further refinement of the amendments, particularly through **House Bill 120**, retained by the Children and Family Law Committee.

### **Budget and Fiscal Responsibility**

1. **Challenges**:
   - The committee acknowledged the impact of inflation (12.7% over two years) and population growth (1.5%) on the budget, making it difficult to limit increases.
   - The governor’s proposed budget was noted to be significantly below these figures, raising concerns about meeting state needs.

2. **Efficiency in Government**:
   - Members highlighted the importance of improving efficiency through technology, such as the "business one-stop" initiative for business licensing, to reduce redundancies and streamline processes.

3. **Division Updates**:
   - Each division provided updates on their progress, with most expressing confidence in meeting deadlines despite some disagreements.
