The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 10, 2023, centered on detailed budgetary discussions and appropriations for various state initiatives, with a particular focus on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and its Division of Economic Stability. The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing immediate needs with long-term fiscal responsibility, addressing critical areas such as Medicaid, workforce development, child care, and economic stability programs.

### Key Budgetary Discussions and Appropriations:
1. **Budget Adjustments and Fund Transfers**: The committee debated transferring funds between budget classifications (e.g., Class 10 to Class 12) and converting certain positions from classified to unclassified. Concerns were raised about the necessity of statutory authorization for such conversions and the long-term implications for the budget.

2. **County Cap on Long-Term Care Services**: The committee discussed capping county billings for long-term care services at $134.5 million in 2024 and $137.2 million in 2025, reflecting a 2% annual increase. Some members proposed freezing the cap at 2023 levels, requiring an additional $18.5 million in funding.

3. **Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)**: Members reviewed a $20.5 million appropriation for MMIS maintenance, questioning whether it should be part of the operational budget (HB1) or a separate one-time expenditure (HB2). There was confusion about the distinction between ongoing operational costs and one-time upgrades.

4. **Medicaid Unwinding and Continuous Enrollment**: The committee discussed appropriating funds for the unwinding of Medicaid continuous enrollment, a process tied to the end of federal pandemic-era policies. Questions arose about the expected reduction in Medicaid spending and the need for additional funds to manage the transition.

5. **Choices for Independence (CFI) Program**: Members considered funding for the CFI program, which supports independent living for seniors. Concerns were raised about low provider rates and the difficulty of hiring staff, prompting discussions about whether funds should be used for rate increases or additional services.

6. **Use of FY23 Surplus Funds**: The committee explored using FY23 surplus funds for various initiatives, including audits of the integrated eligibility system and moving a district office. There was debate about whether these expenditures should be included in HB1 (operational budget) or HB2 (one-time expenses).

7. **Revenue Estimates and Budget Balancing**: Members discussed the governor’s budget, which had a $131 million shortfall in revenue estimates compared to House projections. They also considered the implications of moving surplus funds from FY23 to future years, emphasizing the need to balance short-term needs with long-term fiscal responsibility.

### Division of Economic Stability:
1. **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**: The committee discussed reviewing Medicaid reimbursement rates to ensure no disruptions in the coming years, with plans for a comprehensive rate-setting process in the next budget.

2. **Child Development and Head Start**: The Bureau of Child Development and Head Start Collaboration was highlighted, emphasizing its role in providing child care assistance to low-income families, supporting child care providers, and collaborating with federal Head Start programs. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of Head Start, with a request for updated research on its outcomes.

3. **Child Support Services**: The Bureau of Child Support Services was discussed, focusing on its role in enforcing child support orders, assisting families, and reducing the need for public assistance. The program’s cost-effectiveness and tools for enforcement were highlighted.

4. **Employment Supports**: The Bureau of Employment Supports, which administers the New Hampshire Employment Program (NHEP), was reviewed. The program assists TANF recipients in gaining employment through skills training, education, and connections with employers. The committee questioned the rationale for placing this function under DHHS rather than the Department of Labor.

5. **TANF Funding**: The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program was discussed, including its role in supporting economic stability and the department’s efforts to meet federal spending requirements.

### IT Systems and Workforce Challenges:
1. **IT Systems and New Heights**: The committee discussed the New Heights IT system, which supports eligibility processes across various DHHS programs. The system is undergoing continuous enhancements to replace legacy systems and improve efficiency. The department is working on integrating long-term supports and services, as well as COVID-related reporting, into the system.

2. **Workforce Challenges**: The department highlighted ongoing workforce challenges, including high vacancy rates (up to 20% in some areas) and the need for more efficient service delivery. The discussion also touched on the importance of shifting to more person-centric models of service delivery.

### Program Metrics and Outcomes:
1. **Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for TANF Funding**: The committee discussed the need to meet a $32 million MOE requirement for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding. Failure to meet this requirement could result in future penalties, including reduced federal funding. The committee explored how certain programs, even if not directly related to healthcare, could contribute to this MOE by addressing social determinants of health.

2. **Program Metrics and Outcomes**: There was a focus on tracking the effectiveness of programs, particularly in terms of moving individuals from public assistance to self-sufficiency. The committee emphasized the need for better metrics to evaluate the impact of these programs.

### Specific Budget Items:
1. **Budget Appropriations**: The committee reviewed multiple sections of the budget, including:
   - $200,000 for vehicle and equipment replacement at New Hampshire Hospital.
   - $1.5 million for hiring IT consultants to manage projects and streamline business processes.
   - $125,000 to replace a legacy database for food stamp eligibility reviews.
   - $410,000 for replacing network switches, routers, and wireless access points at HHS district offices.
   - $3 million annually for 2024 and 2025 to meet the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) maintenance of effort requirement.

2. **Concerns Over IT Consultant Funding**: Some members expressed discomfort with allocating funds for IT consultants without tying them to specific projects or deliverables. They suggested integrating these costs into project-specific budgets.

3. **Child Care Funding**: A provision from the previous budget allowing the use of TANF Reserve funds to address child care waitlists was revisited. Members considered reinstating this language in HB2 to provide clarity and reassurance to the child care community.

### Conclusion:
The meeting concluded with a plan to resume discussions on Monday morning, focusing on unresolved sections of the budget. Members were encouraged to provide additional input or questions before the next session. Overall, the meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to balance budgetary priorities, ensure efficient use of funds, and address critical needs in areas like IT infrastructure, health services, and family assistance programs. The discussions underscored the importance of tracking program outcomes, maintaining flexibility in budget management, and addressing workforce and service delivery challenges within DHHS.
