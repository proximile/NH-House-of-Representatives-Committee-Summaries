- **Key Issues**:
  - Concerns about inconsistencies in well water testing across the state and the importance of standardized testing for public health.
  - PFAS testing was contentious, with some arguing for its inclusion while others felt it should be addressed separately due to evolving EPA guidelines.
  - The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) supported the bills, emphasizing the need for consistent messaging and outreach.

  - **Supporters**, including Representative Bordes, argued that faster boats create less wake, reducing shoreline erosion, and highlighted economic benefits for high-performance boating.

  - Environmental groups, such as the Loon Preservation Committee and NH Audubon, opposed the bill, citing threats to wildlife, including loons, and safety risks for biologists and volunteers working on the lake.
  - Camp directors, like Bob Strodel, opposed the bill due to safety risks for campers and staff.
- **Public Testimony**:
  - Numerous residents, business owners, and professionals testified against the bill, citing safety, environmental, and economic concerns.
  - Speakers highlighted past accidents, the family-friendly nature of the lake, and the potential harm to tourism and local businesses.
- **Outcome**:
  - Representative Ryan moved to **ITL** the bill, citing overwhelming opposition from constituents, marine patrol, Coast Guard captains, lake residents, property owners, and businesses.
  - The committee unanimously voted to ITL the bill, with all 20 present members agreeing to place it on the consent agenda.
