**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting on March 20, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 20, 2023, focused on detailed budget discussions, amendments, and funding allocations for various state programs and services. The meeting addressed critical issues such as Medicaid rate increases, developmental disabilities funding, workplace violence prevention, and social-emotional learning programs. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **1. Medicaid and Healthcare Funding**
- **Medicaid Rate Increases**: A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to addressing Medicaid rate increases, particularly for nursing homes and other healthcare providers. The committee debated whether to implement these changes all at once or phase them in, with concerns raised about administrative burdens and provider shortages. The committee leaned toward a phased approach to prioritize critical areas first.
- **Developmental Disabilities**: The committee discussed allocating $25 million in general funds to fully fund the developmental disabilities waitlist, as mandated by RSA 171a. Concerns were raised about provider shortages and the ability to deliver services despite available funding. The committee also explored reallocating unused funds from the current biennium to the next.
- **Choices for Independence (CFI)**: Funding for the CFI program, which supports independent living for elderly and disabled individuals, was discussed. The committee examined the overlap between CFI funding and Medicaid rate increases and how to balance funding for existing services versus rate adjustments to attract more providers.

### **2. Workplace Violence Prevention and Healthcare Safety**
- **Healthcare Facility Workplace Violence Prevention Program**: The committee considered amendments to this program, which aims to address workplace violence in healthcare settings. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) cited resource constraints, leading to a recommendation to suspend the program for the biennium. An amendment was introduced to allow the private sector to proceed with the program while the state participates as resources permit. The Nurses Association supported the amendment, emphasizing the need for collaboration and data collection.
- **Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC)**: Discussions included staffing challenges, safety measures, and the potential use of scanning equipment to reduce trauma for detained youth. The committee also explored the impact of federal Medicaid rules that would soon allow coverage for detained youth, potentially reducing costs.

### **3. Social-Emotional Learning and Youth Programs**
- **Choose Love Program**: The committee debated funding for the "Choose Love" program, a social-emotional learning initiative that has expanded to various state departments. Some members questioned its redundancy with existing programs, while others highlighted its success in reducing aggressive behaviors. The committee ultimately voted to retain the program but agreed to revisit the decision.
- **Juvenile Peer-to-Peer Grief Support Program**: There was debate over deleting a $1.5 million allocation for this program, with some members advocating for more information before making a decision.

### **4. Family Planning and Nutrition Programs**
- **Family Planning Services**: The committee discussed funding allocations for family planning services, with amendments proposed to correct federal funding allocations and incentivize new vendors. Concerns were raised about the executive council's reluctance to approve contracts with certain providers.
- **WIC Supplemental Nutrition Program**: Representative Waller requested details on how additional funding for the WIC program would be used to impact childhood wellness.

### **5. Budget Amendments and Adjustments**
- **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB)**: The committee reviewed amendments to HB1 and HB2, focusing on funding mechanisms, civil penalties, and the board's budget. There was debate over whether fees should be replaced with general funds, based on legal interpretations.
- **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)**: The committee considered reducing TANF funding from $3 million to $2.5 million annually to mitigate risks and align with budget constraints.
- **Family Resource Centers**: The committee debated deleting a $2 million allocation for Family Resource Centers but decided to hold the decision for further discussion.

### **6. Implementation Challenges and Next Steps**
- **Implementation of Rate Changes**: The Medicaid director, Henry Littman, explained the complexities of implementing rate increases, noting the need for at least a quarter to update the system and the potential for phased rollouts to prioritize critical areas.
- **Time Constraints**: Due to time constraints, the committee planned to reconvene the next day to finalize discussions and votes on pending amendments and budget items.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance budgetary constraints with the need to adequately fund essential services, particularly in the areas of developmental disabilities, Medicaid, and healthcare safety. Discussions also reflected the challenges of addressing provider shortages, implementing rate changes, and navigating political and administrative hurdles. The committee planned to revisit unresolved issues in subsequent meetings, ensuring a thorough and strategic allocation of resources to meet pressing needs.
