The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee met on March 27, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on a wide range of budgetary and policy issues, primarily focusing on **HB1** (the operating budget) and **HB2** (the trailer bill containing policy changes and funding details). The meeting spanned several key areas, including retirement adjustments, education funding, Medicaid reimbursement rates, public health, and workforce development. Here is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting:

### **Retirement and Pension Adjustments**
- **House Bill 571 (Retirement Adjustments)**: A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Group Two retirees was proposed, with a one-time contribution to address rising costs. Representative McGuire introduced a sliding scale for benefits based on time served, with a maximum benefit of $3,000.
- **HB 436**: This bill restores pension benefits for certain state employees, primarily corrections officers, at an annual cost of $25 million over 10 years, funded by the restored Communications Services Tax.
- **Unfunded Liability**: A $50 million payment toward the state’s unfunded pension liability was included, aimed at reducing future costs for municipalities and the state.

### **Budget Adjustments and Amendments**
- **Budget Cuts**: Significant cuts were made to address a $145 million overage, including reductions in funding for programs like **Invest New Hampshire** (cut by $15 million) and the removal of a $40 million appropriation for a new men’s state prison.
- **Tax and Revenue Changes**: The committee proposed increasing the bonding authority for the Department of Environmental Services from $3 million to $30 million. The **Communications Services Tax** was restored, while the **Interest and Dividends Tax** will sunset two years earlier (January 2025).
- **Education Trust Fund Reforms**: Changes were proposed to shift certain expenditures (e.g., special education, building aid) back to the general fund, reducing the allocation of business taxes to the trust fund from 50% to 22.5%. This reallocation will redirect approximately $222 million in FY24 and $225 million in FY25 to the general fund.

### **Education Funding**
- **Adequacy Funding**: The committee supported the governor's plan to increase the base and Free and Reduced Lunch (FNR) funding, accelerating funding for needier towns with an additional $20 million per year ($40 million for the biennium).
- **Extraordinary Need Grants**: The governor's plan included extraordinary need grants up to $650, but the committee increased this to $3,750 for qualifying towns with lower property valuations.
- **Hold Harmless Provision**: The committee ensured that no municipality would receive less funding than in the previous biennium, though future reductions in hold harmless grants were noted.
- **Charter Schools**: An amendment was introduced to allow public charter schools to apply for school building aid, similar to traditional public schools, which was unanimously adopted (25-0).

### **Public Health and Medicaid**
- **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**: The committee approved a framework for rate increases but acknowledged it fell short of the providers' requested amounts. Concerns were raised about whether the allocated amounts were sufficient to prevent provider shortages and system degradation.
- **Medicaid Expansion**: A proposal to include Medicaid expansion in HB2 was discussed, with a two-year sunset clause added. Some members advocated for making it permanent, while others supported the sunset provision.
- **ER Boarding Crisis**: The committee emphasized addressing the emergency room (ER) boarding crisis, aiming to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates to improve capacity and alleviate this issue.
- **PFAS Contamination**: Funding was approved for a phase three feasibility study to investigate increased kidney cancer rates in the Merrimack area due to PFAS contamination.

### **Workforce and Child Care**
- **Child Care and Workforce Issues**: Funding for child care services and eligibility adjustments were discussed to support workforce development and avoid waitlists.
- **Occupational Licensing**: The committee removed controversial licensing changes proposed by the governor, deferring them to the **Edna Committee** for further review.
- **National Guard**: Funding was allocated for the **National Guard’s recruiting and incentive programs**.

### **Environmental and Waste Management**
- **Environmental and Waste Management**: Funding was allocated for **PCB contamination remediation**, **food waste reduction**, and a new position within the Department of Environmental Services to manage food waste.
- **Hazardous Waste Cleanup**: Positions were added to address hazardous and solid waste management.

### **Other Provisions**
- **Liquor Commission**: The committee required the Liquor Commission to provide advance notice before closing stores, emphasizing transparency.
- **Sununu Youth Services Center**: Funds were allocated for body scanners to replace strip searches for juveniles entering the facility, emphasizing trauma-informed care.
- **Christa McAuliffe Memorial Fund**: The fund received $100,000 after initially being removed from the budget.
- **Special Injury Fund**: This fund, which helps small employers with workers’ compensation claims, was removed from the budget.

### **Votes and Amendments**
- The committee voted 15-10 to accept the HB2 amendments presented by Division Three, despite some members’ concerns about inadequate Medicaid funding.
- Several amendments were proposed and voted on, with varying outcomes. The committee emphasized the importance of balancing different priorities to achieve a budget that serves the state's needs.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee planned to continue discussions on HB1 the following day, including potential additional amendments.
- Members expressed a willingness to consider further amendments to HB2 during the final briefing.

Overall, the meeting highlighted ongoing debates over Medicaid funding, workforce support, and public health issues, with a focus on balancing limited resources with critical needs. The committee adopted several amendments unanimously, reflecting a collaborative approach to addressing these challenges.
