**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting – House Finance Division I (March 2, 2023)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on March 2, 2023, covered a wide range of topics, including budget appropriations, employee benefits, judicial programs, renewable energy policy, and fiscal management. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **1. Budget and Public Services Funding**
The meeting emphasized the critical need for increased funding across various state programs to address systemic challenges and ensure effective service delivery.

- **Public Defender Program**:  
   - The public defender program requested its largest-ever budget increase of over $3 million annually to address high staff turnover, increased caseloads, and pandemic-related backlogs.  
   - Concerns were raised about the underpayment of contract attorneys and the difficulty of retaining legal professionals due to low compensation.  
   - The possibility of creating a second public defender program was proposed to better distribute caseloads and reduce reliance on contract attorneys.  

- **Judicial Council Programs**:  
   - The Judicial Council sought additional funding for **CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates)**, which handles 92% of new child protection cases, and non-CASA guardians, who manage the remaining cases.  
   - Funding requests also included support for **indigent defense**, contract and assigned counsel, and ancillary services like interpreters and mental health evaluations.  
   - The Council highlighted staffing shortages and the growing complexity of cases, particularly with the surge in electronic evidence.

### **2. Employee Benefits and Retiree Support**
Several bills addressing employee benefits and retiree compensation were discussed, with a focus on fairness and fiscal responsibility.

- **House Bill 571 – Unused Vacation Time**:  
   - The bill would require employers with 15 or more employees to pay out unused vacation time upon termination if the employee leaves in good standing or is laid off.  
   - Proponents argued that unused vacation time is earned compensation, while opponents raised concerns about the fiscal impact on businesses.  

- **Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) for Retirees**:  
   - Arthur Beaudry, representing the New Hampshire State Permanent Firefighters Retirement Association, testified in support of House Bill 571, which would grant COLAs to retirees who have been retired for over 10 years.  
   - The fiscal impact of the bill was estimated at $84 million, but the need to support retirees, especially those in public safety roles, was emphasized.  
   - Amendments, such as tapering COLAs or making them temporary, were suggested to reduce costs.

### **3. Renewable Energy Policy and REC Sweeping**
The discussion on **House Bill 234** focused on ending the practice of **REC sweeping**, where utilities claim unclaimed Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) from small solar producers to meet their Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) obligations.

- **Impact on the Renewable Energy Fund (REF)**:  
   - REC sweeping has reduced the REF’s funding by about two-thirds since 2013, undermining its ability to support renewable energy projects.  
   - The REF, funded through alternative compliance payments (ACPs), provides grants for projects that would otherwise be financially unviable.  

- **Arguments for and Against the Bill**:  
   - Proponents argued that REC sweeping unfairly benefits utilities and violates the intent of the RPS, while opponents questioned its fiscal impact and potential rate increases for consumers.  
   - The Department of Energy remained neutral on the bill.  

- **Outcome**:  
   - A motion to retain the bill for further discussion was voted down, and a subsequent motion to kill the bill (ITL) passed, ending its progress.

### **4. Fiscal Management and Budget Challenges**
The representatives acknowledged the complexities of balancing policy decisions with financial realities and the need for prudent budget management.

- **Education Trust Fund**:  
   - Criticism was directed at the current allocation of funds to the Education Trust Fund, with proposals to adjust percentages from business taxes and meals and rooms taxes to free up resources for other state needs.  

- **Budget Cuts and Revenue Shortfalls**:  
   - Lower-than-expected revenue projections necessitated budget cuts, with particular attention to past overspending and unutilized funds in departments like Health and Human Services (HHS).  

- **Future Steps**:  
   - The committee emphasized the need for careful consideration of revenue estimates and potential amendments to ensure fiscal responsibility.

### **5. Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the importance of addressing critical funding needs for public services, improving employee benefits, and supporting retirees while balancing fiscal responsibility. Discussions on renewable energy policy and budget management underscored the challenges of aligning policy goals with financial constraints. The committee decided to retain several bills for further consideration, particularly as they awaited revenue estimates to assess fiscal impacts. Amendments were proposed to reduce costs and ensure equitable treatment of workers, retirees, and small energy producers. Overall, the meeting reflected a commitment to addressing systemic issues while maintaining fiscal prudence.
