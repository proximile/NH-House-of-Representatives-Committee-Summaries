**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives House Finance Division I Meeting (March 17, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 17, 2023, covered a wide range of topics, including state budgeting, energy policies, professional licensing reforms, and operational challenges. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **1. State Budget and Operational Priorities**
The meeting focused on critical budgetary and operational needs, including:
- **LIHEAP and Weatherization Programs**: The Department of Energy highlighted the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Weatherization Assistance Program, which is receiving significant funding increases. Temporary positions were requested for weatherization but not for LIHEAP.
- **Pay Raises and Employee Compensation**: The committee reviewed pay raises for state employees, including classified (unionized) and unclassified (leadership) positions. The discussion emphasized the impact of inflation and challenges in filling vacancies.
- **ERP System Upgrade**: The Department of Administrative Services requested $7.8 million to upgrade the state’s outdated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, essential for financial and HR operations. The total cost is estimated at $25 million, with $15 million already approved from ARPA funds.
- **Parking and Maintenance Funding**: A $50,000 allocation for state employee parking and $3.5 million for maintenance funding were discussed, addressing operational challenges in downtown areas and deferred maintenance.
- **Legislative Branch Budget**: The legislative branch budget was briefly mentioned, with plans for further review by the facilities committee on March 24th.

### **2. Energy Policies and Ratepayer Advocacy**
The committee addressed energy-related issues, focusing on protecting New Hampshire ratepayers and improving energy policy representation:
- **Ratepayer Advocacy**: The Consumer Advocate’s Office requested funding for an additional staff member to focus on regional electric matters, particularly involving ISO New England and NEPOOL, to prevent unfair transmission costs.
- **Regional Energy Advocacy Fund**: A $250,000 fund was proposed to support technical expertise in challenging federal and regional energy policies that could negatively impact New Hampshire ratepayers.
- **Federal Funding Utilization**: The Department of Energy is leveraging federal infrastructure funds (IIJA and IRA) to support energy initiatives, including fuel assistance programs.

### **3. Licensing and Regulatory Reforms**
The meeting included extensive discussions on professional licensing reforms, particularly through **House Bill 2 (HB2)** and **House Bill 655 (HB655)**:
- **Repealing or Consolidating Licenses**: Proposals included repealing or consolidating licenses for professions such as licensed nursing assistants (LNAs), Foresters, Landscape Architects, and Natural Scientists. Concerns were raised about scope of practice and supervision requirements.
- **Advisory Boards**: Several regulatory boards were proposed to transition to advisory roles, with the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) taking over disciplinary and regulatory functions. This shift aims to streamline operations and reduce antitrust risks.
- **Universal Licensure Recognition**: HB2 aims to codify universal licensure recognition, allowing individuals licensed in other states to obtain New Hampshire licenses quickly, based on similar criteria.
- **Public and Professional Input**: Stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, massage therapists, and Foresters, emphasized the need for public protection and professional standards. Some representatives expressed concerns about the speed and scope of the proposed changes.

### **4. State Library, Historic Sites, and Public Television**
The committee discussed funding for cultural and historical institutions:
- **State Library**: The need for climate-controlled storage to preserve valuable documents was highlighted, along with efforts to make the library more accessible to the public.
- **Bureau of Historic Sites**: A proposal to shift funding back to the general fund from the Parks fund was discussed.
- **Public Television Funding**: Representative McGuire proposed removing $500,000 in annual funding for New Hampshire Public Television, arguing it was unnecessary given the abundance of media content.

### **5. Massage Therapy and Forestry Licensing**
Specific licensing issues were addressed:
- **Massage Therapy Establishments**: Concerns about sex and labor trafficking through massage therapy establishments were raised. Current laws lack proactive inspection and regulation capabilities.
- **Forester Licensing**: The Timberland Owners Association supported retaining Forester licensing, emphasizing its importance for consumer protection and compliance with tax and current use policies.

---

### **6. Efficiency and Technology**
Efforts to improve efficiency in state operations were discussed:
- **Licensing Portal**: The OPLC is implementing a new licensing portal, expected to be fully operational by FY25, to streamline processes.
- **Virtual Meetings**: Allowing virtual meetings for licensing boards was proposed to increase participation, with data showing higher attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

---

### **7. Concerns and Recommendations**
The meeting highlighted several concerns and recommendations:
- **Pace of Changes**: Some representatives expressed concerns about the rapid pace of licensing reforms and the lack of thorough public input.
- **Advisory Board Model**: While the advisory board model was supported for efficiency, concerns about transparency and fairness were raised, particularly for smaller professions.
- **Cost Savings**: Proposed changes in HB2 could result in significant cost savings (e.g., $950,000), but questions remained about how these savings would be managed.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing operational efficiency, public protection, and professional standards. Key priorities included upgrading critical IT infrastructure, addressing energy policy challenges, and reforming professional licensing structures. The committee emphasized the need for careful deliberation, stakeholder input, and strategic planning to ensure effective and fair outcomes. Decisions on many proposals, including HB2 and HB655, were deferred to future meetings for further review.
