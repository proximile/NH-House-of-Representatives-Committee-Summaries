### Comprehensive Summary of NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on Cannabis Legislation (March 13, 2023)

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee held a public hearing on **House Bill 639**, which proposes the legalization, taxation, and regulation of recreational cannabis in the state. The discussion also touched on **House Bill 494**, addressing fertilizer registration and database maintenance in relation to cannabis cultivation. Key themes emerged across the five segments, focusing on taxation, regulation, public safety, revenue allocation, and the challenges of transitioning from a therapeutic to an adult-use cannabis market.

---

#### **1. Taxation Structure and Revenue Allocation**
- **Taxation Model**: The bill proposes a **15% tax at the cultivation level**, aiming to simplify enforcement and ensure upfront revenue collection. This approach contrasts with taxing at multiple stages (e.g., retail or distributor levels). Some representatives suggested alternative models, such as a **weight-based tax (per ounce)** or a **retail sales tax**, to provide more stable revenue and avoid price fluctuations.
- **Competitiveness**: The proposed tax rate is **half that of neighboring states** like Maine, intended to keep costs low and eliminate the black market. Concerns were raised that a 15% tax might still be too high, with suggestions to lower it to **8%** to encourage legal purchases.
- **Revenue Allocation**: Funds would first address the **state’s unfunded pension liability**, with potential surpluses allocated to education, public safety, and municipalities. However, some questioned whether education would ever receive funding due to the size of the pension liability.
- **Vertical Integration**: The taxation of vertically integrated businesses, which control cultivation, manufacturing, and retail, was flagged as a challenge. Questions arose about how to ensure fair taxation across such entities.

---

#### **2. Regulation and Licensing**
- **Regulatory Oversight**: The **Liquor Commission** would oversee cannabis regulation, leveraging its existing infrastructure to avoid creating a new regulatory body. Licensing would apply to cultivators, manufacturers, and retailers, with fees based on the costs of regulation.
- **Municipal Control**: The bill allows municipalities to **opt out** of allowing cannabis sales. Some representatives suggested changing this to an **opt-in model** to ensure local control.
- **Interstate Commerce**: The inevitability of interstate cannabis commerce was discussed, with calls to prepare for potential federal rulings that may invalidate state residency requirements. The bill proposes extending the cultivation tax to importers to ensure equal taxation of all cannabis products.
- **Tracking System**: A **seed-to-sale tracking system** was emphasized to monitor cannabis products and ensure compliance, particularly in preventing the diversion of products to the black market.

---

#### **3. Public Safety and Enforcement**
- **Law Enforcement Concerns**: The **New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police** opposed the bill, citing potential increases in law enforcement costs and public safety concerns, such as impaired driving and youth access.
- **Current Enforcement Costs**: The ACLU highlighted that New Hampshire spends **$2.6 million annually** on marijuana possession arrests alone. Legalization could reduce these costs and redirect resources.

---

#### **4. Therapeutic vs. Adult-Use Cannabis**
- **Transition Challenges**: The bill addresses the transition of the state’s **therapeutic cannabis program** to include adult-use cannabis. Therapeutic cannabis would remain untaxed, but concerns were raised about how adult-use retailers could exempt therapeutic patients from taxation.
- **Business Viability**: Therapeutic cannabis providers (ATCs) would be allowed to transition to for-profit entities to compete with larger companies. However, small businesses expressed concerns about being overshadowed by out-of-state or multinational corporations.

---

#### **5. Quality Control and Public Health**
- **Lab Testing**: Independent lab testing for cannabis products was emphasized to ensure safety and quality. Concerns were raised about contaminants in cannabis, whether grown indoors or outdoors, and the need for rigorous testing.
- **Public Health Initiatives**: A portion of cannabis revenue was proposed to fund substance misuse education, prevention, and treatment. Public awareness campaigns before legalization were also suggested to mitigate potential harms.

---

#### **6. Fertilizer Registration and Database (HB 494)**
- **Fertilizer Regulation**: The bill proposes a fertilizer registration program, with concerns raised about the limited testing of samples (only 2 out of 5,000). A new database for tracking fertilizer registrations was deemed essential, with setup costs covered by the general fund and maintenance costs funded through fees.
- **Technical Issues**: The bill has technical and syntactical errors that need correction, and a work session was proposed to address these issues.

---

#### **7. Revenue Estimates and Industry Structure**
- **Revenue Projections**: Estimates ranged from **$15 million to $59 million annually**, depending on the tax rate and market conditions. The committee acknowledged the complexity of projecting revenue in a new industry.
- **Industry Structure**: The bill aims to create a **regulated cannabis market** that aligns with New Hampshire’s low-tax philosophy. However, concerns were raised about the lack of explicit support for small businesses and the potential for the Liquor Commission to set rules that favor larger companies.

---

#### **8. Next Steps**
- **Work Session**: The committee plans to hold a work session to delve deeper into the bill’s details, inviting stakeholders from various agencies to provide further input.
- **Deadline**: The committee is under pressure to finalize the bill by **March 30, 2023**.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of legalizing cannabis in New Hampshire, balancing the need for revenue generation with public safety, regulatory oversight, and the protection of small businesses. The committee emphasized the importance of keeping taxes low to compete with the black market, ensuring quality control, and preparing for future challenges such as interstate commerce. The bill aims to create a sustainable and regulated cannabis industry while addressing the state’s financial and public health priorities.
