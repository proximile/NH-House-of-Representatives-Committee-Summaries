### **House Bill 82: Employment Protections for Therapeutic Cannabis Users**

#### **Key Discussions:**
1. **Therapeutic vs. Recreational Cannabis**:
   - Lawmakers emphasized the distinction between therapeutic and recreational cannabis use, noting that therapeutic cannabis is intended to manage symptoms of medical conditions without causing intoxication.

2. **Employment Protections**:
   - The bill aims to prevent employers from denying employment or taking disciplinary action solely based on a positive THC test or possession of a therapeutic cannabis card. However, it does not protect employees from being disciplined for impairment or poor performance at work.

3. **Impairment Concerns**:
   - Significant discussion centered on the difficulty in proving cannabis impairment, as current tests cannot distinguish between recent use and past use. This poses challenges for law enforcement and employers in determining if someone is impaired at work.

4. **Employer Rights**:
   - The bill does not restrict employers from taking action against employees who are impaired or violate workplace policies. Employers retain the right to enforce rules against cannabis use or possession at work without written permission.

5. **Federal Law Conflicts**:
   - Provisions were included to ensure the bill does not conflict with federal laws or regulations, particularly in industries with federal contracts or licensing obligations.

6. **Case Law and Accommodations**:
   - New Hampshire case law already requires employers to consider accommodations for therapeutic cannabis use, as it is recognized as a legitimate therapy in the state. The bill aims to formalize these protections and reduce the need for employees to sue employers for adverse actions.

7. **Workers' Compensation and Liability**:
   - Discussions revolved around how workers' compensation claims might be affected if an employee tests positive for cannabis. The Department of Labor would need to determine if impairment caused an injury, and employers could face challenges if insurance carriers deny claims based on cannabis use.

8. **Carve-Outs for Specific Occupations**:
   - Consideration was given to carve-outs for certain occupations, such as truck drivers, construction workers, and bus drivers, where safety concerns might justify excluding therapeutic cannabis users. However, there was caution against making the language too specific, as it could create loopholes.

9. **Policy Goals**:
   - Lawmakers expressed support for the therapeutic cannabis program, acknowledging its benefits for patients while addressing concerns about potential abuse and workplace safety.

10. **Political Context**:
    - The chairman noted the political sensitivity of the issue, referencing the recent passage of recreational marijuana legislation in the House. He cautioned that a negative committee report might be overridden on the House floor, urging the committee to craft a well-thought-out bill.

#### **Outcome**:
- The committee acknowledged the need for further work to balance employee protections with employer rights and safety concerns. No final decision was made, but the discussion highlighted the complexity of the issue.

### **House Bill 232: Implementing OSHA Standards in the Public Sector**

#### **Key Discussions:**
1. **Gap Analysis**:
   - The committee discussed the need for a comprehensive gap analysis to compare current New Hampshire Department of Labor rules with proposed OSHA 1910 standards. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, expressed concerns about compliance costs and training requirements.

2. **Study Commission Proposal**:
   - There was a suggestion to form a study commission to involve stakeholders in researching and recommending future legislation. However, the committee leaned toward retaining the bill to continue working on it directly, avoiding delays associated with forming a commission.

3. **Retaining the Bill**:
   - The subcommittee voted unanimously to retain the bill, allowing more time to address concerns, conduct further analysis, and work with stakeholders. The effective date of the bill was proposed to be extended to summer 2024 to provide sufficient time for implementation.

4. **Concerns and Commitments**:
   - Members acknowledged the importance of OSHA standards for public safety but emphasized the need for clarity on costs and implementation. They expressed commitment to working with stakeholders to ensure the bill’s success.

#### **Outcome**:
- The subcommittee decided to retain **House Bill 232** to allow more time for analysis and stakeholder input.

### **Overall Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of integrating therapeutic cannabis into workplace policies while addressing safety, legal, and insurance concerns. It also highlighted the complexities of implementing OSHA standards in the public sector, emphasizing the need for thorough analysis and stakeholder collaboration. Both bills were retained for further discussion and refinement, reflecting the committee’s commitment to crafting balanced and effective legislation.
