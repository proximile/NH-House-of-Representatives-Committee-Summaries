**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on School Building Aid (March 10, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 10, 2023, to discuss critical issues surrounding **school building aid**, focusing on **House Bill 452** and broader funding mechanisms for school construction and renovation projects. The meeting highlighted the complexities of funding large and small-scale projects, the need for equitable and sustainable solutions, and the legislative process for refining the state’s approach to school building aid. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and proposals from the meeting:

---

### **Key Challenges and Concerns**
1. **Funding Inequities and Limitations**:  
   - Representatives emphasized the difficulty in funding large-scale projects, such as the $170 million Concord project, while smaller projects, like secure vestibules, struggle to compete for limited resources.  
   - Concerns were raised about the **prorated funding model**, which often leaves smaller projects underfunded and discourages districts from pursuing necessary renovations.  

2. **Project Prioritization**:  
   - The current system for ranking school construction projects was debated, with questions about whether schools lower on the list should automatically move up when higher-ranked projects are completed.  
   - Some districts assume they won’t receive funding and, as a result, do not pursue essential projects.  

3. **Eligibility and Funding Formulas**:  
   - The eligibility criteria, including **cost per square foot per pupil**, were scrutinized for fairness.  
   - Representatives questioned whether the current system adequately supports smaller projects and explored alternative funding models, such as distributing prorated shares of available funds to all applicants.  

4. **Timeline Issues**:  
   - The existing timeline for building aid grants was described as "pinched," causing delays in project approvals and construction starts.  
   - Proposed amendments to HB 452 aimed to shift the application submission date from **July 1st** to **April 1st, 2025**, to better align with fiscal years and school district planning cycles.  

5. **Charter Schools and Public Academies**:  
   - **Charter schools** are currently prohibited from applying for building aid, despite a provision in HB 452 that would grant them **30% of eligible construction costs**.  
   - The exclusion of **public academies** from building aid was also discussed, raising questions about equity and financial capacity.  

6. **Donations and Grants**:  
   - A contentious issue was the requirement that **donations, grants, and other funds** be subtracted from the total project cost, reducing the state’s contribution.  
   - **Superintendent Deborah Taylor** of SAU 7 (Colebrook) testified, urging the committee to allow donations to directly offset local taxpayer contributions rather than reducing the overall project cost. She highlighted the economic challenges faced by her district and the risk to **CTE (Career and Technical Education) programs** due to space constraints.

### **Proposed Solutions and Amendments**
1. **Alternative Funding Models**:  
   - One representative proposed a new funding model where all applicants receive a prorated share of available funds, which could help smaller projects compete.  
   - Another suggestion was to spread funding over the lifetime of a bond (e.g., 20 years) rather than providing **80% upfront** and **20% upon completion**, though concerns were raised about the impact on property-poor districts.  

2. **Amendments to HB 452**:  
   - The committee discussed amending the bill to clarify timelines, funding mechanisms, and eligibility criteria.  
   - Proposed changes included adjusting deadlines, allowing **federal grants, energy rebates, and other funds** as part of the local match, and striking the section that requires subtracting donations from project costs.  

3. **Long-Term Sustainability**:  
   - Representatives emphasized the need for a **long-term, sustainable funding formula** for school building aid. Suggestions included studying other states' models, exploring alternative revenue sources (e.g., sales tax, lottery funds), and conducting a **statewide facility condition assessment** to better plan for future needs.  

4. **Legislative Coordination and Transparency**:  
   - The committee acknowledged the need for a **transition plan** to address the backlog of school construction projects and ensure a smoother process moving forward.  
   - Suggestions included forming a **working group**, leveraging the Department of Education’s expertise, and holding work sessions to gather input and refine ideas.  
   - Transparency and collaboration were stressed as essential to developing effective solutions.

### **Broader Systemic Issues**
1. **Inequities in the Current System**:  
   - The discussion highlighted the disparities between districts applying for large projects (e.g., $170 million) and those seeking smaller amounts (e.g., $13 million).  
   - There was a call for a more **equitable distribution** of funds and a reconsideration of the scoring system used to rank projects.  

2. **Role of the School Building Authority**:  
   - The committee debated the role of the **School Building Authority** in verifying project rankings and financial feasibility, suggesting a need for clearer guidelines and responsibilities.
