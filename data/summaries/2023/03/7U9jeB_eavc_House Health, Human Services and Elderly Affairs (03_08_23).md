**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (March 8, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on March 8, 2023, to discuss and vote on a wide range of bills related to health care, developmental disabilities, mental health, and elder affairs. The meeting highlighted complex issues surrounding federal compliance, stakeholder engagement, budget management, and the balance between innovation and regulation in health care. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Federal Compliance and Developmental Services Redesign**
1. **CMS Compliance Deadline (July 1, 2023)**:
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is working to meet federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements, particularly around direct billing and conflict-free case management. Concerns were raised about the tight timeline and potential service disruptions, with stakeholders advocating for a potential waiver extension to allow more time for implementation.

2. **Two-Tiered Waiver System**:
   - A two-tiered waiver system, recommended by the Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) report, was paused due to stakeholder concerns. The committee discussed revisiting this system in 2024 as part of a pilot program under **House Bill 608**, which focuses on tiered waivers, reimbursement rates, and IT system improvements.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - The department emphasized ongoing engagement with over 200 stakeholders, including individuals, families, providers, and area agencies, to ensure transparency and address concerns. The Quality Council’s role in decision-making processes was also highlighted, with amendments to **House Bill 238** enhancing community involvement in rulemaking and contract bidding.

4. **Budget Management and Workforce Issues**:
   - **House Bill 642** addressed chronic underfunding in developmental services by providing tools for DHHS to manage budgets and redirect unused funds. The committee retained the bill for future consideration, focusing on removing salary caps for direct care workers to improve workforce retention.

### **Health Care Legislation**
1. **Reproductive Health Care**:
   - **House Bill 582**, which aimed to collect data on induced terminations of pregnancy, was amended to limit personal information collection to CDC guidelines. The bill ultimately failed, with concerns about data privacy and its usefulness.
   - **House Bill 615**, requiring independent audits of reproductive health care facilities, was deemed "inexpedient to legislate" due to its duplicative nature.

2. **Direct Payments and Health Care Innovation**:
   - **House Bill 69** proposed allowing direct payments and membership-based health care facilities to promote transparency and competition. While an amendment to clarify third-party payments failed, the bill was recommended to pass, despite concerns about its impact on rural hospitals.

3. **Medical Cannabis and Nursing Shortages**:
   - **House Bill 3431** clarified language around medical cannabis cultivation and licensing, passing with an amendment.
   - **House Bill 215** allowed licensed nursing assistants to administer medication, addressing labor shortages in nursing homes, and passed unanimously.

### **Mental Health and Minor Autonomy**
1. **Minors’ Access to Therapy**:
   - **House Bill 114**, which would allow minors aged 16 and older to seek therapy without parental consent, sparked debate over parental rights and state involvement in professional practices. The bill was defeated, with concerns about overreach and the maturity of minors.

2. **Mental Health Treatment and Parental Rights**:
   - Discussions around **House Bill 114** highlighted the need to balance minors’ mental health needs with parental involvement, particularly for vulnerable youth.

### **Emerging Medical Technologies and Public Health**
1. **Committee on Emerging Medical Technologies**:
   - **House Bill 323** proposed establishing a committee to expand access to clinical trials, address barriers to emerging technologies, and ensure patient safety. The committee would also explore compassionate care programs and the economic impact of medical innovation in New Hampshire.

2. **Lead Testing in Children**:
   - **House Bill 342** required daycare providers and schools to document lead testing in children, with an amendment ensuring no penalties for non-compliance by parents. The bill passed unanimously.

---

### **Transparency and Accountability**
1. **Public Transparency Advocacy**:
   - **Bill 454** passed unanimously, ensuring reports from a public transparency advocate become part of the public record.

2. **Study of the Board of Medicine**:
   - **Bill 322** was retained for further consideration, proposing a committee to study the New Hampshire Board of Medicine.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Federal Compliance**: The committee prioritized meeting CMS requirements by July 1, 2023, while addressing stakeholder concerns and exploring pilot programs for future improvements.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Ensuring meaningful community input in decision-making processes was a recurring theme, particularly in developmental services and health care legislation.
- **Workforce and Budget Challenges**: Bills like **HB 642** and **HB 215** aimed to address workforce retention and budget management in health care and developmental services.
- **Innovation vs. Regulation**: Discussions around emerging technologies and direct payment models highlighted the need to balance innovation with patient safety and equitable access.
- **Parental Rights and Minor Autonomy**: Bills like **HB 114** underscored the tension between minors’ mental health needs and parental involvement.
