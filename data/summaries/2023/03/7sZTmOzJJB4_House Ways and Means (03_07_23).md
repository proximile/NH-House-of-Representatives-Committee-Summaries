The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee held a meeting on March 7, 2023, to discuss several key pieces of legislation, including **House Bill 607**, **House Bill 486**, and **House Bill 445**. The discussions focused on charitable gaming regulations, toll collection and reciprocity agreements, and the funding structure of the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**. Here is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

---

### **House Bill 607: Charitable Gaming Regulations**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 607**, which proposes changes to the state’s charitable gaming regulations. Key points included:

1. **Charitable Gaming Overview**:  
   - New Hampshire’s charitable gaming model, established about a decade ago, allows charities to operate gaming rooms offering games like Blackjack, roulette, and poker. Historic horse racing (HHR) machines were recently introduced, doubling the number of days charities can operate.  
   - These gaming rooms generate significant revenue for local organizations.

2. **Proposed Changes**:  
   - **Licensing Terms**: The bill proposes extending licensing terms for game operators from one year to three years, with adjusted fees.  
   - **Fee Structure**: Fees for game operator employers would be $750 for three years ($250 annually), and charity fees would also be adjusted.  
   - **Max Bet Increase**: The maximum bet in charitable gaming rooms would increase from $10 to $25, aligning with scratch ticket pricing.  
   - **Operational Streamlining**: The bill aims to clarify roles and licensing requirements for primary game operators (now called "game operator employers") and reduce administrative burdens.  

3. **Concerns and Considerations**:  
   - **Revenue Impact**: Concerns were raised about potential revenue losses due to reduced licensing fees.  
   - **HHR Facility Limits**: The bill proposes capping HHR facilities at 15 to prevent oversaturation, particularly in border towns like Salem.  
   - **Background Checks**: The frequency of criminal background checks for operators would be reduced from annually to every three years.  
   - **Recruitment and Retention**: The bill addresses challenges in recruiting and retaining workers in the charitable gaming industry.  

4. **Future Steps**:  
   - The committee acknowledged the need for further data and analysis to understand the fiscal impact of the proposed changes.  
   - There was a suggestion to retain the bill for further study to address unresolved questions and ensure clarity.

### **House Bill 486: Toll Collection and Reciprocity Agreements**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 486**, which deals with vehicle registration and reciprocal toll collection enforcement agreements. Key points included:

1. **Toll Collection and Fines**:  
   - The discussion focused on the proportionality of fines for toll evasion, with some arguing that a $50 fine after multiple notices was too low.  
   - There was debate about the fairness of suspending vehicle registrations for violations committed in another state.  

2. **Reciprocity Agreements**:  
   - New Hampshire has reciprocal agreements with states like Massachusetts, where drivers can have their registrations suspended for unpaid tolls in another state.  
   - These agreements benefit New Hampshire, as many Massachusetts drivers use its roads.  

3. **System Integrity and Automation**:  
   - Concerns were raised about corruption in toll collection systems, particularly in Massachusetts, but representatives emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity of the turnpike fund.  
   - Automation of toll collection systems was seen as a way to improve efficiency and reduce errors.  

4. **Legislative Process**:  
   - The bill was deemed **inexpedient to legislate**, as it would disrupt the current toll collection and enforcement system.  
   - The committee concluded that the current process, which involves multiple notifications over 150 days before registration suspension, effectively targets habitual violators rather than occasional offenders.

### **House Bill 445: Funding for the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**
The committee also reviewed **House Bill 445**, which proposes changes to the funding structure of the OPLC. Key points included:

1. **Purpose of the Bill**:  
   - The OPLC is a self-funded agency that relies on licensing fees. Currently, excess funds at the end of the biennium lapse into the general fund, creating funding gaps.  
   - The bill proposes a **non-lapsing fund** with a **$5 million cap** to allow the OPLC to retain funds for operational expenses, capital expenditures (e.g., software updates, lease costs), and to smooth out revenue fluctuations.  

2. **Support and Concerns**:  
   - **Representative Jordan Ulery**, the bill’s sponsor, highlighted bipartisan support for the bill, which resulted from a commission examining the OPLC’s funding challenges.  
   - **Lindsay Courtney**, the OPLC’s Executive Director, testified in support, emphasizing that the agency does not receive general funds and has lost significant amounts (e.g., $3.6 million in 2022) due to lapsing funds.  
   - Representatives raised questions about the rationale for the fund, equity in licensing fees across professions, and how the bill aligns with other legislation like **House Bill 2**.  

3. **Next Steps**:  
   - An amendment (Amendment 032H) was introduced to cap the non-lapsing fund at $5 million.  
   - The committee tentatively scheduled an **executive session** to address outstanding questions and continue discussions.

### **Conclusion**
The March 7, 2023, meeting of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee highlighted the complexities of balancing operational efficiency, revenue considerations, and public interest in various legislative proposals. Key takeaways included:

- **House Bill 607** aims to streamline charitable gaming regulations while addressing concerns about revenue, oversaturation, and worker retention.  
- **House Bill 486** was deemed inexpedient, as the current toll collection and enforcement system was found to be effective, with automation efforts already underway.  
- **House Bill 445** seeks to provide financial stability for the OPLC by creating a non-lapsing fund, addressing funding gaps and operational challenges.  

The committee plans to continue discussions in executive sessions to refine these bills and ensure they meet the needs of the state and its residents.
