The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee met on March 30, 2023, to discuss and vote on several bills. Key discussions and outcomes included:

1. **Prison Matron Position**: The committee discussed the outdated role of a prison matron, with Representative Rhodes noting that women have progressed and no longer need separate identification from male officers. The motion passed unanimously.

2. **SB 29 and SB 38**: These bills were discussed and passed without further debate, with unanimous support.

3. **SB 182**: The committee debated whether to pass or retain a bill related to interlock devices. Representative Rhodes argued for passing it, emphasizing the need for clarity and consistency. The motion to pass was approved unanimously.

4. **SB 209**: A contentious debate arose over whether to pass or retain this bill, which overlapped with a similar House bill. Representative Rhodes and others argued that the House version was superior and that the Senate version should be killed. The committee ultimately voted not to recommend the bill, with a split vote of 10-10.

5. **SB 245**: This bill, related to hotel guest records, was temporarily recessed to allow for further amendments and discussions. The committee planned to revisit it the following week.

6. **SB 76**: The committee passed this bill with an amendment that clarified language regarding medical examiner procedures. The motion passed unanimously.

7. **HB 251**: Initially, there was a motion to kill the bill due to time constraints, but after discussion, the committee decided to pass it, recognizing the importance of studying parole board issues. The motion passed unanimously.

8. **SB 268**: This bill, concerning pre-hospital treatment for operational canines, was passed with an amendment that clarified the language. The motion passed unanimously.

The committee also addressed several other bills, including SB 81 (interlock devices) and SB 244 (false reports of alarm), which were deferred to the following week. The meeting concluded with administrative tasks, including assigning reports and preparing for the next session.
