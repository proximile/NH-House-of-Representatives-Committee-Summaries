**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (March 20, 2023 - Afternoon Session)**

The afternoon session of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I on March 20, 2023, featured extensive discussions on retirement benefits, legislative amendments, budget adjustments, and regulatory reforms. The meeting highlighted efforts to simplify complex systems, ensure fairness, and address fiscal responsibilities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **Retirement Benefits and Pension Calculations**
1. **Accidental Death Benefits**:
   - The committee debated the formulas for calculating accidental death benefits for state employees. Group One benefits are based on average final compensation, while Group Two benefits are based on earnable compensation. This distinction, in place since the 1960s, led to discussions about simplifying or standardizing the approach.
   - Representative Cambro proposed a lump sum payment (e.g., $85,000 or $100,000) for any death, arguing that all lives have equal value. However, it was clarified that current benefits are paid monthly.
   - Representative Sweeney proposed an annual benefit of $60,000 for future cases, doubling the current average of $30,000. This compromise was generally accepted by the committee.

2. **Pension Calculations**:
   - Discussions focused on the "compensation over base" formula, which affects how overtime and additional compensations are factored into pensions. The committee considered changing the calculation period from three to five years to prevent pension spiking.
   - House Bill 436 was amended to extend the calculation period, though concerns were raised about the accuracy of current methods, prompting the need for expert legal input.

3. **Public Safety and Pension Benefits**:
   - The fairness and adequacy of pension benefits for public safety employees, particularly those who die in the line of duty, were discussed. The committee considered adjustments to ensure benefits are equitable, especially for employees who may not have vested in the pension system.

### **Budget Adjustments and Funding Programs**
1. **Invest New Hampshire Program**:
   - The program, initially funded by ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funds, was proposed to be reduced from $30 million to $15 million. The focus shifted from loans to developers to grants for municipalities, aligning with the state's workforce housing priorities.

2. **Affordable Housing Fund**:
   - Administered by NH Housing, the fund was proposed to be reduced from $25 million to $20 million, with the expectation that the Senate might restore some funding later in the budget process.

3. **General Budget Discussions**:
   - The committee reviewed funding for workforce development, victim assistance funds, and other state programs. Strategic reductions were proposed in areas where funds could be better allocated or programs streamlined.

### **Regulatory Reforms and Occupational Licensing**
1. **Licensing Boards and OPLC (Office of Professional Licensure and Certification)**:
   - The reorganization of licensing boards, particularly the Allied Health Professionals Board, was discussed. The goal was to eliminate redundant layers of regulation and streamline the licensing process.
   - Concerns were raised about unintended consequences, such as impacts on Medicare reimbursement and the need for local communities to issue licenses for hawkers and peddlers.

2. **Athlete Agents Licensing**:
   - The licensing of athlete agents was debated, with a proposal to remove the license due to its limited use. However, there was consideration of transferring the associated board to the OPLC if the license was retained.

3. **Occupational Licensing**:
   - The committee considered removing several non-controversial or redundant licenses, retaining only those with significant public support or deemed essential. Public input was acknowledged as a critical factor in these decisions.

### **Procurement and Legislative Process**
1. **ERP System Procurement**:
   - Representative Jody Grimbulis raised concerns about the Department of Administrative Services' plan to upgrade the state’s ERP system without competitive procurement. He suggested issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Information (RFI) to explore options from other vendors.

2. **Legislative Process and Amendments**:
   - Representatives expressed concerns about the complexity and volume of issues being addressed, particularly with tight deadlines for reviewing and approving amendments. The session highlighted the challenges of balancing policy decisions with fiscal responsibilities.

### **Next Steps**
The committee adjourned with plans to reconvene the next morning at 9:30 AM to continue discussions on retirement bills, other pending amendments, and budget considerations. The meeting underscored the intricate balance between policy-making, regulatory efficiency, and financial responsibility, with a focus on ensuring fair and effective governance.
