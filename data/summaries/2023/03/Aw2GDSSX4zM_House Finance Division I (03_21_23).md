  - Introduced **pension caps** (e.g., 100% of salary for some groups, $125,000 for others), raising concerns about retroactive application for employees hired before 2009, potentially violating **Article 23** of the NH Constitution (protecting vested benefits).

  - Concerns were raised about financial sustainability, particularly in light of the accelerated repeal of the **Interest and Dividends (IND) tax**.
