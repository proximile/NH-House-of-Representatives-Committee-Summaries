**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 21, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 21, 2023, covered a wide range of budget discussions and decisions, focusing on funding allocations for transportation, education, higher education, and other state priorities. Key topics and outcomes from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Budget Adjustments and Funding Transfers**
1. **Highway Fund and General Fund Transfer**:  
   - The committee discussed transferring $10 million from the General Fund to the Highway Fund to support equipment purchases and telematics, which were not included in the governor’s recommended budget.  
   - The Department of Transportation requested additional funding for these items, prompting the committee to consider appropriating the necessary funds.

2. **Surplus Allocation**:  
   - Concerns were raised about being overdrawn on the surplus, and the committee planned to tally up all divisions' work to address the issue. Discussions about surplus allocation were deferred to a later meeting.

### **Education Funding**
1. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**:  
   - The committee debated reducing the EFA allocation from $60 million to $40 million over the biennium and reallocating the $20 million to school building aid. This was a contentious issue, with some members advocating for increased support for public school infrastructure.  
   - Skepticism was expressed about the basis for the $30 million annual EFA estimate, with members questioning whether it was a guess rather than a calculated figure.

2. **Charter School Funding**:  
   - The committee approved an amendment to increase charter school funding, bringing the base aid plus additional grants to $9,000 per student.

3. **Adequacy Funding**:  
   - Proposal 10, which passed, included a $4,700 base aid per pupil, with additional funding for reduced lunch, special education, and English language learners. The proposal also included a 2% annual increase for adequacy components and a 5% biennial increase for the maximum extraordinary needs grant.

4. **Education Trust Fund (ETF) Reforms**:  
   - The committee debated amendments to return the ETF to its original purpose of funding educational adequacy. The proposal involved shifting certain programs (e.g., special education, building aid, and charter school funding) from the ETF to the general fund.  
   - A $224 million annual shift from business taxes to the general fund was proposed to prevent ETF surpluses and ensure other general fund priorities are not shortchanged.

5. **School Building Aid**:  
   - A revised amendment for school building aid aimed to provide long-term sustainability funding. However, concerns about the effectiveness and timeline of the proposed model led to the amendment being referred to the House Education Committee for further review.

### **Higher Education Funding**
1. **University System of New Hampshire (UNH)**:  
   - UNH President Jim Dean and CFO Kathy Provencher presented key funding requests:  
     - **Interoperability Lab and Blockchain Project**: The House voted to fund the governor’s recommendation for this workforce pipeline initiative.  
     - **Tuition Freeze**: An additional $2 million was approved to keep tuition flat for in-state students through fiscal year 2026, marking six years of flat tuition.  
     - **Whittemore Center Renovation**: The committee approved $6 million in state support for the renovation of this significant venue, leveraging private donor contributions.

2. **National Student Tracker Amendment**:  
   - An amendment to allocate $150,000 from the surplus for the National Student Tracker was approved. This tool tracks post-secondary enrollment and graduation data, with discussions emphasizing data privacy and usage.

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Bail Condition Notification System**:  
   - A proposal to allocate $1 million for a bail condition notification system was discussed. Some members expressed discomfort with funding the system without more details or direct involvement from the Department of Safety.

2. **Fish and Game Surplus**:  
   - No changes were made to the Fish and Game Surplus statement.

3. **Technical Adjustments**:  
   - The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) was authorized to make technical and mechanical changes to HB one and two to reflect the division’s intent.
