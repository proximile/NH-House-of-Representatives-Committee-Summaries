**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 20, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 20, 2023, centered on critical budget discussions and funding proposals across education, infrastructure, and community services. The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing fiscal responsibility with addressing immediate and long-term needs. Key topics and debates included:

### **Education Funding**
1. **Adequacy Formula and Governor’s Budget**: The committee reviewed proposals to adjust the adequacy formula, which determines state funding for schools. The governor’s budget proposed a base adequacy rate of $4,700 per pupil, with additional funding for special education and English language learners. Proposals ranged from maintaining this plan (Proposal 1) to redistributing funds more aggressively to support property-poor and high-need districts (Proposals 6–9). Some members favored a middle ground (Proposals 3–5) to balance equity and broad support.

2. **Targeting Aid to High-Need Schools**: There was significant debate about shifting funds from the base adequacy rate to components like the extraordinary needs grant to better support economically struggling districts. Concerns were raised about concentrating too much funding in cities like Manchester, Nashua, and Concord, potentially leaving other towns with minimal additional support.

3. **Extraordinary Needs Grant**: Proposals included increasing the extraordinary needs grant by $20 million annually (totaling $40 million over the biennium) to address funding gaps in high-need districts. Discussions also touched on the catastrophic aid formula for special education, which requires districts to cover significant costs before receiving state aid.

4. **Education Trust Fund (ETF)**: Representative Weiler proposed shifting revenues from the Education Trust Fund to the General Fund, raising concerns about the legality and long-term implications of such a transfer. Some members argued for preserving the ETF for future needs, especially given the potential for a recession.

5. **Special Education Funding**: There was a suggestion to reallocate funds from the base budget to special education, recognizing its universal need across the state.

### **Higher Education and Workforce Development**
1. **Community College System (CCS)**: Proposals included funding workforce credential programs and tuition resets to support students, particularly in technical fields. The CCS Chancellor advocated for more control over retirement planning for new hires to manage long-term expenses.

2. **University System of New Hampshire (USNH)**: Funding requests included $5 million for partnerships with Keene State and Plymouth State, as well as support for the Interoperability Lab and Whittemore Center at UNH. Members expressed support for addressing long-neglected needs in higher education but emphasized clarity on available funds.

### **Infrastructure and Community Services**
1. **Highway Fund and Budget Adjustments**: Updates on the highway fund balance included requests for additional funds for winter maintenance and potential transfers from the general fund to the highway fund.

2. **School Building Aid**: Discussions focused on funding for school construction projects, including adjustments to the governor’s budget and the potential impact on towns like Concord and Litchfield. The debate included whether to continue stabilization grants for certain districts.

3. **Fish and Game Funding**: Requests were made to shift some Fish and Game Department costs to the general fund, citing broader responsibilities beyond hunting and fishing licenses.

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Credit Card Fees**: The Department of Safety requested funding to cover credit card fees for DMV transactions, sparking debate about why the DMV doesn’t charge a convenience fee like other entities. Similar discussions arose regarding municipalities covering or passing on credit card processing fees.

2. **Retirement System**: Significant debate centered on allowing new CCS hires to opt out of the state retirement system, with concerns about the fiscal impact on the system and the need for employee choice.

3. **Northern Border Alliance Program**: Funding for this program was reconsidered due to pushback and questions about its necessity.

4. **Homeland Security and Emergency Management**: A request for $112,000 in General Funds to support new positions was discussed, with some members favoring federally matched funds.

### **Legislative Process and Future Considerations**
1. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Impact**: Members acknowledged the governor’s 10-year plan to gradually increase funding for high-need districts but debated whether to accelerate this process for immediate relief.

2. **Uncertainty and Caution**: There was recognition of uncertainty about the overall budget, particularly regarding surplus funds and potential amendments. Some advocated for cautious spending until clearer guidance on available funds is provided.

3. **Next Steps**: The committee planned to reconvene the next day to finalize decisions on key issues like education adequacy, school building aid, and the Education Trust Fund.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing competing funding priorities, addressing inequities in school funding, and ensuring fiscal sustainability. Representatives grappled with the complexity of budget negotiations, weighing immediate needs against long-term obligations while striving to support education, infrastructure, and community services across New Hampshire.
