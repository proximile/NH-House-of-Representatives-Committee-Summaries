**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (March 24, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on March 24, 2023, to address a wide range of financial and operational issues across state departments. The meeting highlighted key challenges, budgetary concerns, and progress updates, with a particular focus on the New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC). Here are the main points discussed:

### **New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC)**

1. **Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund**:  
   The NHLC's transfer to the Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund for fiscal year 2022 was understated by $1.2 million due to an incorrect calculation based on fiscal year 2020's gross profit instead of fiscal year 2021, as required by statute. The NHLC plans to seek a statutory revision to align its practices with the law and ensure proper funding in the future.

2. **Next-Gen System**:  
   The NHLC's major IT modernization project, the Next-Gen system, has faced significant delays and cost overruns, with $20 million already spent. The project is nearing completion, with performance testing and post-go-live support underway. The NHLC requested additional funding for maintenance and support in the upcoming fiscal years. Lawmakers expressed concerns about the transparency and progress of the project, requesting detailed timelines and milestones.

3. **Audit Findings**:  
   The NHLC addressed prior audit findings, with four out of seven issues fully resolved and three in the process of being remediated. The NHLC emphasized its commitment to transparency and compliance with audit recommendations.

4. **Budget and Funding**:  
   Lawmakers raised concerns about the NHLC's budget requests, particularly in light of the delays and challenges with the Next-Gen system. The NHLC defended its cautious approach, prioritizing the stability of its revenue-generating operations over rushing the project.

5. **Statutory Compliance and Legislative Changes**:  
   The NHLC discussed its efforts to comply with statutory requirements and its intention to seek legislative changes to align its practices with current operational needs.

### **Other Key Departmental Discussions**

1. **Department of Education**:  
   Commissioner Frank Edelblut and CFO Tammy Valencourt discussed the continuation of the system of care work beyond the federal grant period. They mentioned plans to seek no-cost extensions and reapply for the grant, with appropriation requests included in the budgeting process.

2. **Department of Energy**:  
   The committee discussed the acceptance of $16 million in federal funds for energy assistance. The average benefit per household was noted to be just under $2,000, with the funds expected to help approximately 8,400 additional households.

3. **Department of Administrative Services**:  
   Commissioner Charlie Arlinghaus and Director Karen Ranchimacki addressed the repurposing of funds for building envelope improvements, life safety, paving, and interior space enhancements. They clarified that ventilation improvements were still a priority and that separate ARPA items were being managed.

4. **Department of Health and Human Services**:  
   The committee discussed short-term staffing contracts and the challenges of reopening beds at New Hampshire Hospital due to staffing shortages and recent damage from a burst sprinkler head.

5. **Department of Safety**:  
   The committee reviewed the significant cost of credit card fees at the DMV and discussed the possibility of implementing a convenience fee for credit card transactions.

6. **Department of Transportation**:  
   The committee addressed the variability in winter maintenance costs and the impact of recent storms on the department's budget. They also discussed the use of environmentally sensitive materials for road maintenance.

7. **Judicial Council**:  
   The committee approved items related to the Judicial Council without extensive discussion.

8. **Department of Corrections**:  
   Commissioner Helen Hanks discussed the need for additional funds to cover contracted medical provider services for the current fiscal year. They expressed confidence in the budget numbers for the upcoming year.

### **Audit Reports**

The committee reviewed and accepted several audit reports, including performance audits for the Weatherization Assistance Program, management letters for the Lottery Commission, and the Liquor Commission. The audits highlighted areas for improvement in information management, risk assessment, and internal controls.

### **Future Meetings**
