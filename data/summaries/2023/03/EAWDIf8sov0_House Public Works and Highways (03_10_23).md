The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on March 10, 2023, addressed a wide range of topics related to public works, infrastructure, environmental services, and capital budget requests. The meeting featured presentations and discussions from various state departments and agencies, focusing on critical infrastructure needs, staffing challenges, and funding priorities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points covered:

---

### **1. Prison Facilities and Corrections**
- **Prison Utilization**: Concerns were raised about the underutilization of a prison facility, with the Federal Bureau of Prisons moving individuals there. Discussions included the ideal size for a new prison and the importance of accurate forecasting to avoid overcapacity issues. The National Guard is assisting with staffing, and training is set to begin soon.
- **Department of Corrections (DOC) Projects**:  
  - **New Men’s Prison**: A $50 million project to replace the aging Concord facility (built in 1878) is in the planning phase, with a timeline of 6-8 years. The current facility faces significant maintenance challenges, including broken locks, doors, and fire suppression systems.  
  - **Radio System Upgrade**: Transitioning from an outdated analog system to a digital system to improve safety and communication.  
  - **Kitchen Renovation**: The existing kitchen is in poor condition, with water leaks, broken tiles, and outdated equipment. Immediate repairs are needed to meet health and safety standards.  
  - **Sewer Line and Grinder Replacement**: Addressing issues with the "Muffin Monster" sewer grinder, requiring additional funding due to increased costs.

- **IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) requested funds for IT upgrades, including digitizing historical documents, upgrading air monitoring stations, and improving cybersecurity measures.  
- **Groundwater Monitoring and Dam Repairs**: DES emphasized the need for funding to expand the groundwater monitoring network and for dam repairs and reconstruction to prevent failures.  
- **State Revolving Loan Funds (SRF)**: Extensive discussions focused on leveraging federal infrastructure funds for clean water and drinking water projects. However, final awards were lower than expected, impacting the budget request.  
- **Winnipesaukee River Basin Wastewater Treatment Facility**: DES requested funds to replace force mains in the basin, which serves 10 communities. The project will be funded through an SRF loan, with costs passed on to participating communities.  
- **ARPA Funds**: Significant American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds have been allocated for water, wastewater, and dam projects, with some potential reallocation if not fully utilized by municipalities.

### **3. Veterans Home Updates**
- **Overview**: The New Hampshire Veterans Home, operational since 1890, is a 250-bed long-term care facility currently housing 129 veterans. The facility faces staffing shortages, limiting its capacity to 131 veterans, with a goal of increasing to 225 beds.  
- **Current Projects**:  
  - Building-wide sprinkler system upgrade.  
  - Parking lot repair and expansion.

- **General Fund Requests**:  
  - Matching funds for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) projects ($1.19 million) and Transit Authority projects ($570,000).  
  - A miscommunication in the governor’s budget led to an overestimation of FAA matching funds, prompting a request for reallocation.  
- **Railroad Infrastructure**: Repairs to railroad bridges, culverts, and deteriorated ties are critical for safety and compliance with Federal Railroad Administration standards.  
- **Highway Fund Requests**:  
  - Replacing salt and sand sheds ($2 million).
