**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (03/13/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 13, 2023, focused on detailed discussions of budgetary and legislative matters, particularly concerning Medicaid, healthcare services, and funding requests for fiscal years 2024 and 2025. The committee addressed a range of issues, from Medicaid reimbursement rates to the use of surplus funds, while emphasizing transparency, targeted funding, and the distinction between policy and budget items. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points across all segments:

---

### **Medicaid and Healthcare Funding**
1. **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates (HB 527):**
   - The committee voted to retain HB 527, which addresses Medicaid reimbursement rates for certain assisted living facilities. Concerns were raised about its alignment with Senate Bill 86 and its compatibility with the state budget. The bill’s language, both original and amended, was deemed to require further refinement.

2. **Medicaid Provider Rates:**
   - The committee reviewed a $17 million annual increase to raise Medicaid provider rates by 3.1%. Discussions emphasized the need for more targeted increases in areas like behavioral health and post-acute care to address critical service gaps.

3. **Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS):**
   - A $20.5 million request for MMIS operating costs was discussed, with 75% of the $45 million annual cost federally funded. The committee debated whether to classify this as an ongoing operational expense (HB1) or a one-time cost (HB2) and stressed the importance of transparency for future budget cycles.

4. **Foster Care and Children’s Services:**
   - A request to increase foster care rates was discussed to make them more consistent and competitive, though specific percentage increases were not detailed. Funding for children’s residential treatment rates and Hampstead Hospital expenses was also prioritized.

### **Budget Adjustments and Funding Requests**
1. **Technical Adjustments:**
   - The committee approved a block of non-controversial technical adjustments, including the acceptance of federal grants and reallocation of funds within state accounts.

2. **Use of FY23 Surplus Funds:**
   - The committee explored using surplus funds from FY23 to cover expenses in FY24 and FY25. Suggestions included footnoting HB1 to reflect the use of surplus funds and ensuring clear documentation for future budget cycles.

3. **Family Resource Centers and Meals on Wheels:**
   - A $1 million allocation for Family Resource Centers’ infrastructure support was reviewed, along with a $3.4 million addition to HB2 for Meals on Wheels to maintain current service levels, replacing ARPA funds used in the current biennium.

4. **Sununu Center and Family Planning Services:**
   - Discussions included funding for the Sununu Center and family planning services. Members sought more detailed information on certain requests, such as the prescription drug affordability board (PDAB) and its fee structure, which was criticized for resembling a tax.

### **Consulting and IT Projects**
1. **IT and Consulting Funding:**
   - Two consulting-related funding requests ($1.5 million and $2 million) were discussed to support IT projects, including incident management systems, housing services for mental health, and automated federal reporting for Medicaid. The committee debated whether these should be classified as one-time expenses (HB2) or ongoing operations (HB1).

2. **Contracting and Staffing Challenges:**
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) explained its reliance on contracted IT consultants due to staffing shortages. Federal matching funds were available for some projects, with varying match rates (50% for one project and 66/34 for another).

---

### **Policy vs. Budget Items**
1. **Policy Appropriateness:**
   - The committee debated the inclusion of policy items in HB2, particularly those without associated funding. Sections 282 and 283, which required hospitals to allocate resources to specific clinical priorities, were considered more suitable for a health and human services policy committee rather than the budget.

2. **External Input:**
   - The committee sought input from external stakeholders, such as the Hospital Association, to understand the implications of budget decisions on healthcare services, particularly in areas like Medicaid rates and hospital discharge processes.

### **Next Steps and Scheduling**
1. **Rescheduled Meetings:**
   - Due to canceled meetings and an impending snowstorm, the committee rescheduled its work session for Friday morning. Members aimed to finalize decisions by the following Monday, with a focus on completing core budget work before addressing additional funding requests.

2. **Executive Session:**
   - The committee considered voting on HB 527 and discussed the logistics of their upcoming executive session.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to address complex budgetary issues, ensure proper funding for critical services, and refine legislative proposals ahead of upcoming deadlines. Key themes included:
- **Transparency:** Ensuring clarity in funding mechanisms and proper categorization of expenses for future budget cycles.
- **Targeted Funding:** Prioritizing funding for mental health services, children’s treatment rates, and Medicaid provider rates to address critical needs.
- **Distinction Between Policy and Budget:** Debating the appropriateness of including policy items in the budget and ensuring they are addressed by the relevant committees.
