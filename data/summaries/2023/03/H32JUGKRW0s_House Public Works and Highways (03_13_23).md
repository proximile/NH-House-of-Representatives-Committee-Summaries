**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (March 13, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on March 13, 2023, to discuss and evaluate a wide range of capital projects, funding allocations, and infrastructure initiatives. The meeting centered on House Bill 25 (HB 25), which addresses the status of various state-funded projects, including their continuation, lapses, or extensions. Key discussions and decisions from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **1. Project Reviews and Funding Decisions**
The committee reviewed numerous capital projects across state agencies to determine which should continue, lapse, or be extended. Projects were assessed based on their completion status, urgency, and alignment with state priorities. Key highlights include:

- **Lapsed Funds**: Several completed or unnecessary projects were identified for lapses, with funds returned to the general fund or reallocated to other priorities. Examples included the State Library Roof project ($58,165) and a burglar alarm system project ($170,000).
- **Extensions Requested**: Many ongoing projects, delayed due to pandemic-related disruptions, supply chain issues, or procurement challenges, required extensions. Agencies requested that funds for these projects not lapse to ensure their completion.
- **Repurposing Funds**: The committee explored repurposing funds from lapsed projects for other critical needs, such as $1.4 million for Glencliff Wastewater Treatment improvements to avoid compliance violations.
