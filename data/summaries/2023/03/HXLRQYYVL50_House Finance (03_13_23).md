**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Finance Committee, March 13, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on March 13, 2023, to discuss **HB1** (the state budget) and **HB2** (enabling legislation for budget changes). The meeting featured extensive public testimony addressing critical issues such as Medicaid funding, workforce shortages, professional licensing, housing, mental health, education, and public safety. Here are the key themes and takeaways:

### **1. Medicaid and Healthcare Funding**
- **Medicaid Expansion and Mental Health**: Advocates highlighted the success of Medicaid expansion in providing access to mental health services. Parents and providers emphasized the need for fully funding mental health treatment to ensure care for vulnerable populations, including children and individuals with severe disabilities.
- **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**: Multiple speakers, including representatives from nursing homes, home health care agencies, and developmental disability services, called for significant Medicaid rate increases (e.g., 15%) to address workforce shortages, rising costs, and the sustainability of programs like the Choices for Independence (CFI) waiver.
- **Behavioral Health and Hospital Discharge Challenges**: Testimony revealed difficulties hospitals face in discharging patients to appropriate care settings due to staffing shortages. Advocates urged targeted Medicaid rate increases in behavioral health and long-term care to alleviate these issues.

### **2. Workforce Shortages**
- **Direct Support Professionals**: Direct support professionals and family members shared stories of the challenges posed by low wages and staffing shortages in caregiving roles. They emphasized the need for increased funding to attract and retain qualified workers in critical sectors.
- **State Police and Healthcare Workers**: Representatives from the State Police Troopers Association and healthcare organizations highlighted the impact of low wages on staffing shortages, calling for wage increases to retain skilled personnel.

### **3. Professional Licensing and Regulatory Boards**
- **Opposition to Licensing Reforms**: Professionals from various fields, including landscape architects, psychologists, court reporters, midwives, and natural resource scientists, opposed proposed changes in HB2 that would merge or eliminate licensing boards. They argued these changes would undermine public safety, dilute expertise, and reduce accountability.
- **Nursing Licensure**: The New Hampshire Nurses Association opposed provisions to remove licensure requirements for nursing assistants and reduce the Board of Nursing’s size, warning that these changes would weaken standards for nursing practice and education.

### **4. Housing and Homelessness**
- **Affordable Housing**: Advocates called for increased funding for affordable housing programs to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis, which negatively impacts workforce development and healthcare staffing.
- **Homeless Services**: Testimony emphasized the need for additional funding for homeless services to support vulnerable populations and reduce emergency room boarding.

### **5. Education and Workforce Development**
- **Child Care Funding**: Multiple speakers stressed the importance of funding child care services to support working families and the economy.
- **Public Education Funding**: Advocates highlighted the reliance on local property taxes and disparities between wealthier and poorer districts, urging increased state funding to fulfill the constitutional obligation of providing an adequate education.
- **UNIQUE College Savings Plan**: Opponents of changes to the UNIQUE College Savings Plan argued it would reduce scholarships for New Hampshire students.

### **6. Public Health and Safety**
- **Alcohol Fund**: Recovery and prevention organizations called for full funding of the Alcohol Fund, which allocates 5% of gross alcohol sales to substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery programs.
- **Workplace Violence in Healthcare**: Testimony highlighted the need for immediate implementation of a workplace violence program in healthcare settings, citing high rates of violence and risks to staff and patients.
- **Immigration and Law Enforcement**: The New Hampshire Immigrant Rights Network opposed the creation of the Northern Border Alliance program in HB2, arguing it would misuse taxpayer funds for federal immigration enforcement and divert local law enforcement from their primary duties.

### **7. Second Injury Fund**
- **Opposition to Abolition**: Multiple speakers, including representatives from workers’ compensation defense firms, opposed the elimination of the Second Injury Fund, which supports employers who hire injured workers. They argued the fund is crucial for protecting both employers and workers and is funded solely by employers and insurance companies.

### **8. Personal Stories and Advocacy**
- **Caitlyn’s Story**: A heartfelt testimony highlighted the resilience of Caitlyn, a young woman with disabilities who aspires to open her own ballet studio for disabled individuals. The story underscored the importance of recognizing individuals with disabilities as real people with aspirations and contributions.

### **Next Steps**
The committee acknowledged the extensive public input and planned to review detailed recommendations on HB2 revisions and continue working on the budget over the coming weeks. The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing New Hampshire’s pressing issues, including workforce shortages, housing, mental health, and support for vulnerable populations. Public testimony played a significant role in shaping the committee’s deliberations and priorities.
