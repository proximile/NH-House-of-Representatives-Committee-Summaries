The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 10, 2023, centered on two major themes: **retirement plan reforms for state employees** and **changes to professional licensing and board structures** through **House Bill 2 (HB2)**. The discussions were marked by extensive debates, amendments, and concerns about balancing efficiency, employee benefits, public safety, and financial sustainability.

### **Retirement Plan Reforms**
The meeting focused on two bills proposing changes to state employee retirement plans, particularly the transition from a **defined benefit (DB) pension plan** to a **defined contribution (DC) plan** for certain employee groups.

1. **House Bill 559**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill introduces a DC plan for **Group 1 employees** (non-police, non-fire, non-teachers) hired after July 1, 2024. Employees would contribute 7% of their salary, with the state contributing 2.8%. This plan allows employees to take their retirement savings with them immediately, unlike the DB plan, which requires 10 years of vesting.
   - **Debate**:
     - **Supporters** argued that the DC plan aligns with modern retirement trends, offers flexibility, and benefits employees who leave before vesting. They also highlighted its potential as a recruitment and retention tool, especially for younger workers.
     - **Opponents** raised concerns about eroding trust in the retirement system, the lack of disability and survivor benefits, and the potential for employees to exhaust their savings and rely on state assistance. They also questioned whether the bill addresses root causes of turnover, such as pay and career advancement.
   - **Amendments**: The amendment removed provisions allowing existing employees to opt into the DC plan due to potential IRS compliance issues. It also clarified that the state would continue paying into the **Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL)** for existing obligations.
   - **Outcome**: The committee moved to pass the amended bill, pending further legal and IRS compliance reviews.

2. **House Bill 457**:
   - **Amendment**: The amendment codifies the state treasurer’s fiduciary duty and mandates quarterly reports to ensure compliance. It passed unanimously, with representatives emphasizing the importance of clear fiduciary responsibilities in managing retirement funds.

3. **Key Concerns**:
   - **Cost Shifting and Financial Impact**: There were concerns about the DC plan shifting investment risk to employees and its long-term fiscal impact on the **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**.
   - **Retention and Recruitment**: The debate highlighted the DB plan’s role in incentivizing long-term employment versus the DC plan’s appeal to mobile workers.
   - **Inflation and COLA**: Representatives discussed the need for cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) to protect retirees’ purchasing power.

### **Professional Licensing and Board Reforms (HB2)**
The meeting also addressed **House Bill 2**, which proposes significant changes to professional licensing and the consolidation of various boards. Key discussions included:

1. **Board Consolidations**:
   - **Podiatry**: The Board of Podiatry strongly opposed merging with the Board of Medicine, arguing it would dilute expertise and reduce accountability for specialized care.
   - **Mental Health Practice**: The merger of the Board of Mental Health Practice with the Board of Psychology was flagged for removal due to its complexity and potential to undermine previous legislative efforts.
   - **Other Boards**: Midwifery, naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, and Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) expressed concerns about transitioning to advisory roles, fearing it would reduce professional autonomy and public safety.

2. **Licensing Changes**:
   - **Landscape Architects, Foresters, Wetland Scientists, and Soil Scientists**: Representatives recommended retaining their licenses and merging their boards into a single technical board with the Board of Professional Engineers.
   - **Fire Control and Mechanical Licensing Board**: Concerns were raised about oversight shifting to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).

3. **Process and Feedback**:
   - **Public Hearings**: The Finance Committee is expected to hold public hearings, but stakeholders expressed concerns about the rushed process and lack of detailed examination.
   - **Professional Input**: Representatives emphasized the need for clear language and careful consideration of HB2’s impact on various professions, balancing efficiency with expertise and public safety.

4. **Outcome**:
   - The committee recommended removing certain sections from HB2 and further reviewing contentious areas, such as the Board of Mental Health Practice and LNAs. Subcommittees were suggested to handle disciplinary actions within consolidated boards.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of transitioning to a DC retirement plan and restructuring professional licensing boards. Key themes included:
- **Balancing Flexibility and Stability**: Discussions emphasized the need to balance employee benefits, financial sustainability, and trust in the retirement system.
- **Public Safety and Expertise**: Stakeholders from various professions stressed the importance of maintaining specialized boards to ensure accountability and public safety.
- **Process and Transparency**: Representatives called for thoughtful consideration, clear language, and stakeholder input to address the far-reaching implications of HB2 and retirement plan reforms.

The meeting concluded with amendments to both retirement bills and recommendations for further review of HB2, reflecting the committee’s commitment to addressing these complex issues with care and diligence.
