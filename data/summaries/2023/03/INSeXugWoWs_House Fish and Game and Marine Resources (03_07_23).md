**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Fish and Game and Marine Resources Meeting (03/07/23):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 7, 2023, focused on **House Bill 442**, which proposed allowing recreational scuba divers to harvest lobsters and address the cleanup of derelict fishing gear in coastal waters. The bill and its amendment sparked extensive debate among legislators, commercial lobstermen, scuba divers, environmental advocates, and the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHF&G). Key points from the discussions include:

---

### **Key Provisions of the Bill and Amendment**
1. **Recreational Lobster Harvesting by Scuba Divers**:
   - The bill proposed allowing New Hampshire resident scuba divers to harvest up to three lobsters per day by hand during a designated four-week period between April and September, with a cap of 100 licenses.
   - Lobsters would need to be measured on the ocean floor and meet legal size and sex requirements.
   - Supporters argued this would align New Hampshire with other Atlantic states, provide a sustainable recreational activity, and have minimal impact on lobster populations.

2. **Cleanup of Derelict Fishing Gear**:
   - The bill aimed to close a legal loophole preventing divers from removing abandoned or derelict fishing gear, which contributes to marine pollution and "ghost fishing."
   - Divers would be allowed to identify, report, and assist in the cleanup of ghost gear, leveraging their ability to locate and remove trash efficiently.

### **Supporters’ Arguments**
- **Environmental Benefits**: Supporters, including Representative Chris True and scuba diver David Coyle, emphasized the ecological benefits of removing derelict gear and the negligible impact of recreational lobster harvesting.
- **Economic and Recreational Opportunities**: Proponents highlighted the potential for divers to assist commercial fishermen in recovering lost traps and the educational value of recreational lobster harvesting.
- **Precedent from Other States**: Success stories from Massachusetts and Maine, where recreational lobster diving and gear cleanup are allowed, were cited as evidence of the practice’s sustainability and environmental benefits.

### **Opponents’ Arguments**
- **Commercial Lobstermen**: Commercial lobstermen, including Jim Tatone and Michael Flanagan, expressed concerns about the sustainability of lobster populations, the potential disturbance of juvenile lobsters, and the added regulatory burden on their $34 million industry.
- **Enforcement Challenges**: NHF&G opposed the bill, citing unfunded mandates, unenforceable provisions, and ambiguous language. Colonel Kevin Jordan highlighted the impracticality of enforcing underwater measurements and the potential for illegal activity.
- **Safety and Practicality**: Opponents raised concerns about the safety of divers operating in areas with heavy boat traffic and the difficulty of designating and navigating specific diving zones without reliable GPS.

### **Key Concerns and Debates**
1. **Sustainability**: Opponents questioned whether recreational lobster harvesting would harm lobster populations, particularly juveniles exposed to predation.
2. **Enforceability**: The bill’s provisions were criticized as unclear and difficult to enforce, with concerns about the practicality of underwater measurements and the lack of resources for NHF&G.
3. **Financial Impact**: Representatives expressed concern about the financial burden of implementing new registration systems and enforcing regulations, noting NHF&G’s existing unfunded mandates.
4. **Derelict Gear Cleanup**: While there was broad agreement on the need to address derelict gear, some questioned the scale of the problem in New Hampshire compared to other states and the feasibility of cleanup efforts.

---

### **Legislative Process and Outcomes**
- The committee acknowledged the complexity of the bill, which combined two distinct issues—derelict gear cleanup and recreational lobster diving—and considered separating them into two bills.
- The amendment to the bill passed with a vote of 13-7, as did the underlying bill. A minority report will be prepared by Representative Harvey, while a majority report will be written by Representative Smith with assistance from Representative Hill.
- The committee plans to organize field trips to Owl’s Brook and survey potential boat ramp sites to gather more information.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted a divide between proponents of the bill, who saw it as an opportunity to enhance environmental stewardship and provide recreational opportunities, and opponents, who viewed it as a potential threat to the commercial lobster industry and a source of unenforceable regulations. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with many calling for further review, clarification, and potential revisions to address concerns about sustainability, enforceability, and financial impact. The committee’s next steps will focus on refining the bill and gathering additional insights through field trips and stakeholder collaboration.
