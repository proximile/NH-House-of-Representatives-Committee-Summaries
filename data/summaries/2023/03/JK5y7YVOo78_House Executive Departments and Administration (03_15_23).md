The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 15, 2023, covered a wide range of legislative discussions, focusing on bills and resolutions related to indigenous affairs, licensing reform, social work licensure, cultural recognition, and inclusivity. Here’s a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Indigenous Affairs and House Bill 390**
**House Bill 390 (HB 390)** and its proposed amendment sparked significant debate regarding the **New Hampshire Commission on Native American Affairs** and the recognition of **Abenaki tribes**. The bill aimed to restructure the commission, reduce its size, and allocate seats to Vermont-based Abenaki tribes. However, it faced strong opposition from indigenous leaders, stakeholders, and community members, including the **Kawasaki band of the Penacook Abenaki**. Critics argued that the bill:
- **Disenfranchised New Hampshire’s indigenous population** by prioritizing Vermont tribes.
- **Excluded diverse indigenous voices** and failed to consult local communities.
- Risked **fiscal responsibility** by potentially allowing Vermont tribes to access New Hampshire’s federal and state funds.
- Threatened **paper genocide** and the erasure of indigenous identity in the state.

Testimonies from indigenous leaders, such as **Denise and Paul Puleo**, highlighted their contributions to education, culture, and environmental projects in New Hampshire. The committee ultimately voted **16-3** to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** the bill, effectively killing it due to its exclusionary and potentially harmful impact.

### **Licensing Reform and House Bill 2**
**House Bill 2 (HB 2)** proposed significant changes to streamline New Hampshire’s licensing and regulatory processes. Key provisions included:
- **Merging Licensing Boards**: Combining boards with similar functions, such as the **Advisory Board of Reflexology** with the **Advisory Board of Massage Therapy**, and the **Board of Medicine** with the **Board of Podiatry**, to reduce redundancy.
- **Transition to Advisory Models**: Moving certain boards to an advisory model, similar to Vermont’s approach, to reduce administrative burdens while maintaining oversight.
- **Reduced Workloads**: Eliminating the requirement for boards to review every application at monthly meetings unless defects are present.

The committee also discussed transferring boards, such as the **Boxing and Wrestling Commission**, to the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**, though concerns were raised about the appropriateness of licensing event-based activities. The meeting was briefly interrupted due to a quorum issue, but the discussion highlighted efforts to modernize and improve efficiency in licensing processes.

### **Social Work Licensure Compact and House Bill 428**
**House Bill 428 (HB 428)** introduced **conditional licenses** for social workers, mental health counselors, and marriage and family therapists working toward independent licensure. A proposed amendment sought to establish a **Social Work Licensure Compact**, enabling multi-state practice for social workers licensed in member states. Proponents argued that the compact would:
- **Increase Workforce Mobility**: Address shortages and improve access to mental health services.
- **Reduce Administrative Burdens**: Eliminate duplicative licensing requirements, particularly for military families who frequently relocate.
- **Enhance Continuity of Care**: Support clients in border states.

Concerns were raised about the **broad authority** of the compact commission, including fee-setting and oversight. The committee retained the bill for further discussion, emphasizing the need to address workforce shortages while ensuring accountability.

### **Cultural Recognition and House Bill 96**
**House Bill 96 (HB 96)** proposed designating May 3rd as **"Old Man of the Mountain Day"** to honor the iconic rock formation that collapsed in 2003. Supporters, including **Matt Leahy** and **David Nielsen**, highlighted the Old Man’s historical and cultural significance to New Hampshire’s identity and tourism. However, the bill faced opposition from those concerned about **statutory clutter**, with some arguing that memorializations should not require legislative action. The committee debated the merits of statutory recognition, reflecting broader discussions about preserving cultural and historical legacies.

### **Inclusivity and House Resolution 11**
**House Resolution 11 (HR 11)** aimed to declare New Hampshire a **"welcoming community"**, celebrating the contributions of immigrants and their economic impact on the state. Proponents, including **Representative Mangaputi**, highlighted initiatives in Nashua, such as sister city relationships and immigrant-owned businesses, that bolstered the local economy. However, critics argued the resolution was redundant, as New Hampshire already promotes inclusivity through existing laws and policies. The resolution was ultimately **ITL’d** after a **10-9** vote against **OTP (Ought to Pass)**.

### **Compassion and Reflection in HCR 2**
**House Concurrent Resolution 2 (HCR 2)** sought to promote **compassion and forgiveness** within the legislature, addressing toxic behavior and encouraging personal growth. **Representative Partial** emphasized it as a reflective moment rather than enforceable legislation. However, the resolution was **ITL’d** after debate over its necessity and effectiveness.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Inclusivity and Indigenous Rights**: The rejection of HB 390 underscored the importance of inclusivity and consultation with New Hampshire’s indigenous communities.
2. **Licensing Efficiency**: HB 2 reflected efforts to modernize licensing processes, reduce redundancy, and improve oversight.
3. **Workforce Mobility**: The Social Work Licensure Compact aimed to address workforce shortages and enhance access to mental health services.
4. **Cultural Legacy**: Debates over HB 96 highlighted the tension between statutory recognition and preserving cultural icons.
5. **Economic and Social Contributions**: Discussions on HR 11 emphasized the positive impact of immigrants on New Hampshire’s economy and demographics.
6. **Legislative Reflection**: HCR 2 served as a reminder of the need for compassion and forgiveness in legislative processes.

The meeting concluded with a focus on ensuring inclusivity, efficiency, and public protection in legislative decisions, while addressing the diverse needs and concerns of New Hampshire’s communities.
