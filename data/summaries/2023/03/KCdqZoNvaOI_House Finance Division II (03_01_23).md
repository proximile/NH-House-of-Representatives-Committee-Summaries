The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 1, 2023, focused on budget presentations, funding requests, and operational updates from various state departments, with an emphasis on public safety, emergency services, and conservation efforts. Key discussions and decisions are summarized below:

### **New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHF&G)**
1. **Budget Overview**: The NHF&G commissioner presented a budget highlighting a $2 million annual increase in transfer payments to the Trails Bureau. Rising costs in personnel, equipment, fuel, and maintenance, particularly for hatcheries and outdated computer systems, were addressed.
2. **Technological Upgrades**: Modernization efforts include launching an online turkey registration program, updating hatchery reporting systems, and plans for an online deer registration program and licensing software updates to prevent convicted poachers from purchasing licenses.
3. **Funding Requests**: Additional funding was requested for the AOT program ($139,000) and to fill two conservation officer positions ($171,000 annually). These officers are critical for search and rescue operations and enforcing outdoor recreation laws.
4. **Search and Rescue**: Colonel Kevin Jordan emphasized the strain on officers due to increased search and rescue calls, highlighting the need for more staff to reduce overtime and physical/emotional tolls. The department relies on volunteers, supported by donations and insurance.
5. **Hike Safe Card Program**: This voluntary program generated $200,000 last year, covering half the cost of rescues and serving as a deterrent to reckless hiking.
6. **Public Safety and Education**: Efforts include educating the public about avalanche risks and dangerous weather conditions through public service campaigns and signage.
7. **K-9 Units**: Five canine units, funded entirely through donations, are highly effective in search and rescue operations.
8. **Wildlife and Conservation**: Monitoring of wildlife diseases (e.g., avian influenza, chronic wasting disease) and the wild boar population is ongoing. Collaboration with other state agencies addresses issues like invasive species and environmental permits.

### **Department of Safety**
1. **Budget Overview**: The Department of Safety’s FY 2024 budget is $249.3 million, increasing to $250.5 million in FY 2025. The budget addresses rising costs in salaries, benefits, equipment, and IT infrastructure.
2. **Fleet Management**: Funding shortages and supply chain issues have delayed vehicle replacements, leading to high maintenance costs. The budget includes funding for 70 replacement vehicles in FY 2024 and 76 in FY 2025.
3. **IT and Cybersecurity**: Significant investments are being made in IT systems and cybersecurity, supported by federal funds.
4. **State Police**: The State Police division’s budget is $114 million for FY 2024, increasing to $113.4 million in FY 2025. The division has 578 full-time positions, with 21 unfunded, including 17 troopers. Recruitment and retention challenges are being addressed with referral bonuses and pay raises.
5. **DMV Operations**: The DMV requested $32.5 million for FY 2024 and $33.1 million for FY 2025. Funds will support IT system maintenance, security enhancements, and opening a new substation in Plymouth.

### **Public Safety and Emergency Services**
1. **State Police and Forensic Labs**: New positions, including criminalists for forensic biology and toxicology labs, are needed to handle increased demand for DNA and drug testing and digital evidence from body and cruiser cameras.
2. **Homeland Security and Emergency Management**: Increased funding is requested for disaster response and recovery, including COVID-19-related expenses and radiological emergency preparedness.
3. **Emergency Services and Communications**: Funding is needed for overtime and operational costs to ensure uninterrupted 911 services and updated technology.

3. **Fee Adjustments and Budget Flexibility**: Discussions included proposals to adjust fees for motor vehicle records and other services, emphasizing the need for flexibility in setting fees through rulemaking rather than statute.

### **Future Initiatives and Collaboration**
1. **Drone Technology**: NHF&G is exploring the use of drones for wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts, pending FAA regulations and budget approvals.
2. **Interagency Collaboration**: NHF&G works closely with other state agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Services, to address issues like invasive species and environmental permits.
