### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (March 15, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on March 15, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several key bills, with a primary focus on House Bills 607, 639, 494, and 445. The meeting highlighted the complexities of regulating charitable gaming, addressing operational funds, and ensuring alignment with state laws. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the session:

---

#### **House Bill 607: Charitable Gaming and Electronic Games**
House Bill 607, which pertains to charitable gaming and electronic games, was a central topic of discussion. Key points included:

1. **Scope and Intent**: The bill is not a moratorium on charitable gaming but specifically targets one electronic game introduced in the previous biennium. Its intent is to pause and review the impacts of this game before further implementation.

2. **Concerns About Licensing and Market Dynamics**: Some representatives raised concerns that limiting the number of gaming licenses could be protectionist, favoring existing license holders over new or local operators. There was a strong emphasis on prioritizing qualified New Hampshire operators.

3. **Potential Monopoly**: There were worries that the bill's wording could inadvertently allow a single large operator to dominate the market by acquiring others, effectively creating a monopoly.

4. **Section 18 and Historic Horse Racing**: The discussion addressed Section 18 of the bill, which would repeal provisions related to historic horse racing eligibility in 2024. The repeal would take effect 60 days after the bill's passage.

5. **Amendment and Vote**: Representative Doucet moved an amendment (2023-1024h) to address technical issues identified by the Lottery Commission, including references to RSA 541a. The amendment passed unanimously (19-0). However, Representative Ames expressed concerns about Section 18, which limits historic racing facilities to entities already in business as of May 1, 2020. Despite these concerns, the bill passed with a vote of 12 to 7, with one absent. A minority report was expected to be filed by Representative Ames.
