### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (03/06/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 6, 2023, focused on a range of topics, including election equipment, departmental operations, and budgetary matters, with a particular emphasis on **House Bill 2 (HB2)**. The discussions highlighted both immediate concerns and long-term planning across various state departments and commissions.

#### Election Equipment and Voting Systems
1. **Ballot Counting Devices**: The current ballot counting machines are nearing the end of their functional life. The state is preparing to test next-generation devices from three manufacturers—Dominion, ES&S, and Clear Ballot—in upcoming town elections. The new technology will use digital scanning, enabling more accurate audits by capturing images of every ballot.
2. **Funding and Costs**: Towns are responsible for funding their own election equipment, though there have been proposals to use state funds to assist with these costs. The state has managed funds efficiently, but there is a need for uniformity in how towns are supported.
3. **Election Portal and Voting Machines**: Updates on HAVA (Help America Vote Act) funds and the need for new voting machines were discussed, with a focus on ensuring the integrity and efficiency of future elections.

#### Department of State Operations
1. **Budget and Staffing**: The Secretary of State's office reviewed its budget, highlighting increases in rent and fluctuations in federal funding. The department has added six new employees, primarily in IT and business analyst roles, to improve efficiency and manage transitions due to retirements.
2. **Vital Records and IT Projects**: The vital records division is undergoing a significant IT improvement project, which has led to increased expenditures.
3. **Ombudsman Role**: The Right to Know Ombudsman, appointed by the governor, is administratively attached to the department. This role has a significant budget line and is responsible for its own operations.
4. **Boxing and Wrestling Commission**: The commission, currently attached to the Secretary of State's office, oversees a few events monthly, including some larger events like WWE matches. There are plans to move the commission to the OPLC (Office of Professional Licensure and Certification).

#### House Bill 2 (HB2) Discussions
1. **Rescheduling of Public Employees Labor Relations Board**: The session was rescheduled to March 8th, and the focus shifted to reviewing HB2.

7. **Revenue Sharing Suspension**: The ongoing suspension of revenue sharing with municipalities was debated, with some representatives advocating for its reinstatement.

9. **Reorganization of Licensing Boards**: Several licensing boards were proposed to be moved or abolished, with no objections from the Department of State.

#### Other Key Discussions
1. **Electric Utility Restructuring**: Cleanup from the creation of the Department of Energy and references to offshore wind were addressed.
