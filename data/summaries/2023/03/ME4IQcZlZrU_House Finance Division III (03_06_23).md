**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Finance Division III Meeting (March 6, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Finance Division III meeting on March 6, 2023, addressed several key bills and issues, focusing on public health, immigration, Medicaid, and data privacy. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 614: PFAS Contamination and Cancer Registry Study**
- **Purpose**: This bill proposes a $500,000 feasibility study to investigate the link between PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination and kidney cancer in Merrimack, NH, where elevated kidney cancer rates have been observed.
- **Background**: The study builds on previous research phases conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which identified higher kidney cancer rates in the area. The feasibility study aims to determine if a full epidemiological study (phase four) is warranted.
- **Testimony**: Representative Rosemary Rung, speaking on behalf of the prime sponsor, emphasized the importance of understanding PFAS's health impacts. DHHS officials, including Michelle Roberge and Whitney Hammond, detailed the study's scope, which includes community engagement and data analysis.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned why the study focuses solely on kidney cancer and not other cancers linked to PFAS. DHHS clarified that kidney cancer showed the strongest statistical significance and scientific evidence of a link to PFAS exposure.
- **Next Steps**: If funded, the study will involve contracting a research organization, recruiting participants, and analyzing data to assess risk factors and potential causation.

#### **HB 282: Waiving the Five-Year Medicaid Waiting Period for Immigrants**
- **Purpose**: This bill seeks to waive the five-year waiting period for Medicaid eligibility for lawfully residing immigrant children and pregnant women, aligning New Hampshire with 35 other states that have adopted this federal option.
- **Background**: Under the 1996 federal welfare reform law, immigrants must wait five years to access Medicaid. The 2009 CHIP Reauthorization Act allowed states to waive this waiting period for certain groups.
- **Testimony**: Representative Joe Shapiro argued that the bill supports families, improves public health, and addresses workforce shortages. He shared a story of an immigrant family denied healthcare in New Hampshire but supported in Texas, where the waiver is in place.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives expressed concerns about potential abuse of public benefits and the state’s capacity to handle increased Medicaid costs. Shapiro and DHHS officials clarified that the bill targets a small population (about 300 people) and would not significantly impact the state budget.
- **Next Steps**: If passed, New Hampshire would amend its Medicaid State Plan to implement the waiver. DHHS noted that the process could take six months to a year, depending on federal approval.

#### **HB 565: Extending Postpartum Medicaid Benefits**
- **Purpose**: This bill proposes extending postpartum Medicaid benefits from 60 days to 12 months to address maternal mortality and improve health outcomes.
- **Background**:
  - The U.S. has a high maternal mortality rate compared to other wealthy countries, with 40% of postpartum deaths in NH occurring between 43 days and one year after childbirth.
  - This federal option, created by CMS, has been adopted by about 35 states.
  - The bill targets mothers who lose Medicaid coverage after two months because their income exceeds the eligibility threshold (196% of the federal poverty level for pregnant women).
- **Benefits**:
  - Supports mothers and families by ensuring access to healthcare, contraception, breastfeeding support, and management of conditions like postpartum depression, gestational diabetes, and substance use disorders.
  - Prevents adverse childhood experiences by ensuring mothers receive necessary care, which can have long-term positive effects on children.
- **Cost**: The fiscal note indicates a biennial cost of $336,000, primarily for providing care to new recipients, not administration.
- **Discussion**:
  - Concerns were raised about the potential for Medicaid expansion and its long-term financial impact.
  - Supporters emphasized the bill’s potential to strengthen families and reduce long-term healthcare costs.

#### **HB 91: Data Privacy and Security in Health and Human Services**
- **Purpose**: This bill establishes a governance structure for data privacy and security within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and introduces privacy impact assessments (PIAs) for IT systems.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Governance Board**: Includes the DHHS commissioner and the Department of Information Technology commissioner to oversee privacy and security issues.
  - **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Evaluate IT systems for data security, encryption, storage, and deletion, with risk mitigation plans.
  - **New Positions**: Two new roles (IT security and privacy experts) are proposed to support these efforts.
- **Cost**: The fiscal note includes funding for the two positions, with job classifications adjusted to ensure competitive recruitment.
- **Discussion**:
  - The bill formalizes ongoing efforts to improve data privacy and security, particularly in light of NH’s 2018 constitutional amendment on privacy rights.
  - The department expressed support, noting that the bill would enhance their ability to manage data securely and comply with privacy standards.
  - Questions were raised about the recruitment timeline and the practical implementation of PIAs.

### **Other Discussions**
- **Waiver Process**: DHHS Medicaid Director Henry Lipman explained the complexities of obtaining federal waivers, noting that requests for policy exceptions (like HB 282) can take longer than leveraging existing policies.
- **Upcoming Bills**: The committee planned to discuss **House Bill 527** and other scheduled bills in subsequent meetings.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **HB 614**: Focuses on understanding PFAS contamination's health impacts through a feasibility study, with strong support from DHHS and local representatives.
- **HB 282**: Aims to provide healthcare access to immigrant children and pregnant women by waiving the five-year Medicaid waiting period, with arguments centered on public health, workforce needs, and human dignity.
- **HB 565**: Seeks to extend postpartum Medicaid benefits to improve maternal health outcomes, supported as a pro-life measure by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester.
- **HB 91**: Establishes a governance structure for data privacy and security within DHHS, enhancing the department’s ability to manage data securely and comply with privacy standards.
- **Concerns**: All bills faced questions about scope, cost, and potential unintended consequences, but proponents emphasized their limited impact and alignment with broader public health and economic goals.

The meeting concluded with reminders about upcoming meetings and house sessions, highlighting the committee’s ongoing efforts to address critical public health and administrative issues.
