**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (03/30/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on March 30, 2023, to discuss several key bills aimed at addressing workforce shortages, healthcare access, and regulatory challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Senate Bill 149: Regulation of Nursing Staffing Agencies**
- **Issue**: Nursing homes and healthcare facilities are grappling with a severe staffing crisis, exacerbated by the reliance on temporary staffing agencies that charge exorbitant rates, leading to unsustainable financial burdens.
- **Challenges**:
  - Facilities report spending millions on agency staffing, with costs increasing tenfold in some cases.
  - Agencies engage in exploitative practices, such as upcharging for COVID cases, bidding wars, and last-minute cancellations.
  - Full-time staff are leaving for agency jobs due to higher pay and flexibility, worsening the staffing shortage.
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - The bill mandates registration of staffing agencies with the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and prohibits unethical practices like double-booking staff or recruiting on healthcare premises.
  - It does not impose cost controls or wage caps but seeks to introduce transparency and basic operational standards.
- **Concerns**:
  - Some representatives questioned whether the bill would reduce costs or might discourage agencies from operating in New Hampshire.
  - The bill’s limited scope was noted, as it does not address the broader staffing crisis.
- **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review.

### **Senate Bill 126: Telehealth Services for Inmates**
- **Issue**: Inmates face limited access to mental health and psychiatric care, and transporting them for treatment poses safety risks.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - The bill allows telehealth services for inmates, enabling access to out-of-state specialists without requiring in-person visits.
  - It aims to reduce transportation risks and improve timely access to care.
- **Support**: The Department of Corrections endorsed the bill, citing difficulties in recruiting psychiatric providers for correctional settings.
- **Corrections**: A representative from the New Hampshire Society of Physician Assistants requested language adjustments to accurately reflect the term “physician assistant.”
- **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (14-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

### **Senate Bill 150: Family Mediator Certification Board**
- **Purpose**: To amend the composition of the Family Mediator Certification Board to address quorum issues and streamline operations.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Reduces public members from two to one and family mediators from five to three.
  - Removes positions for marital masters and mental health professionals.
  - Reduces annual meetings from 12 to six and adjusts quorum requirements.
- **Background**: The board has struggled to meet due to a lack of quorum, with 11 out of 12 meetings canceled in 2022.
- **Outcome**: Amendments will be refined to address quorum calculations.

- **Key Provisions**:
  - Adds a dentist with anesthesia permits to the board.
  - Requires additional qualifications for oral surgeons treating young children.
  - Proposes creating an anesthesia committee to oversee dental anesthesia practices.
- **Concerns**:
  - Critics argued that stricter requirements could delay care, increase costs, and create access issues, especially for Medicaid patients.
  - Supporters emphasized patient safety, citing physiological differences and potential risks for young children.
- **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further refinement.

### **Senate Bill 44: Workforce Shortage in Substance Use and Mental Health Treatment**
- **Purpose**: To address the shortage of drug and alcohol use professionals and improve access to treatment for individuals with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Expands licensing requirements for Master Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselors (MLADCs) to include mental health disorders.
  - Streamlines the licensing process and removes subjective barriers.
  - Allows MLADCs to continue treating patients even if the primary diagnosis shifts between substance use and mental health disorders.
- **Workforce Challenges**: New Hampshire faces a chronic shortage of professionals in these fields, limiting access to treatment.
- **Support**: Stakeholders highlighted the bill’s potential to align licensing standards with national requirements and improve treatment continuity.
- **Amendments**: Minor wording changes were proposed, and the criminal justice degree provision was removed due to curriculum concerns.
- **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review.
