**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (March 30, 2023)**

The NH House of Representatives Education Committee convened on March 30, 2023, to discuss several key bills and issues related to education funding, school safety, administrative transparency, educational standards, and the role of social media in schools. The meeting featured extensive debates, testimonies, and discussions on the following topics:

---

### **1. Senate Bill 155 (SB 155): Transparency in School Administrative Unit (SAU) Budgets**
- **Purpose**: SB 155, introduced by Senator Kevin Avard, proposes requiring SAUs to present their annual budgets as separate warrant articles from school operating budgets. The goal is to increase transparency and voter control over administrative costs, particularly in light of rising SAU budgets despite declining student enrollment.
- **Support**: Proponents, including Representative Sellers and the School District Governance Association, argued that separating SAU budgets would enhance transparency and accountability, allowing voters to make more informed decisions about administrative spending.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including school administrators and superintendents, contended that the bill would create unnecessary administrative burdens and confusion, especially in multi-district SAUs. They emphasized that SAU budgets are already transparent and that the bill could complicate budgeting processes and voting logistics.
- **Complexity of Multi-District SAUs**: Representatives from multi-district SAUs highlighted the challenges of implementing the bill, noting the need for clarity and consistency in the legislation.
- **Proposed Amendments and Further Work**: Paul Deschane proposed an amendment to address disproportionate financial burdens on certain communities. Several speakers called for further refinement of the bill, suggesting the formation of a working group to address its complexities and unintended consequences.

### **2. Senate Bill 39 (SB 39): Criminal History Checks for School Transportation Monitors**
- **Purpose**: SB 39 aims to reinstate criminal history checks for school transportation monitors (paid individuals who supervise students on buses). This requirement was previously under the Department of Education but was inadvertently removed when oversight shifted to the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which lacks authority over monitors.
- **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the scope of the bill, including whether it applies to volunteers and how it aligns with existing background check policies. The Department of Education clarified that the bill focuses on paid monitors. Questions about liability for bus companies that hire monitors were also discussed.
- **Outcome**: The committee closed the hearing on SB 39 without further amendments.

### **3. Senate Bill 109 (SB 109): School Safety and Coordination with Law Enforcement**
- **Purpose**: SB 109 clarifies that law enforcement can share records with school districts for disciplinary matters involving students, even if there are pending criminal or juvenile cases. The bill ensures compliance with federal privacy laws (FERPA) and excludes medical records.
- **Discussion**: The bill was prompted by an incident where a school district could not obtain crucial information from law enforcement. The committee acknowledged the bill’s importance in improving school safety but noted its narrow focus on disciplinary actions. Questions were raised about its applicability to incidents outside school hours or involving other states’ law enforcement.
- **Broader Safety Concerns**: Representatives referenced recent school shootings, including the tragedy in Nashville, and emphasized the need for better communication and safety measures. Some members suggested expanding the bill to address broader school safety issues.

### **4. Senate Bill 213 (SB 213): Social Media Use in Schools**
- **Purpose**: SB 213, presented by Senator David Waters, seeks to amend existing social media policies in schools to allow students to use platforms like LinkedIn for career development and credentialing under teacher supervision and with parental consent. The bill also addresses the use of online curriculum platforms for Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs.
- **Concerns**: Participants raised concerns about the potential for social media companies to exploit student data and the need to ensure student privacy and parental control.

---

### **5. House Bill 109 (HB 109): Communication on School Safety and Violence**
- **Purpose**: HB 109 aims to improve communication between law enforcement and schools regarding threats to school safety. It would allow law enforcement to proactively share information with schools about potential threats.
- **Discussion**: Law enforcement officials highlighted current limitations in sharing information due to existing legislation. Concerns were raised about the scope of the bill, including whether it permits proactive communication from law enforcement to schools or only allows schools to request information. There was also debate about the bill’s applicability to both public and private schools.

---

### **6. Senate Bill 77 (SB 77): School Placement and Manifest Educational Hardship**
- **Purpose**: SB 77 seeks to clarify language in existing statute (RSA 193.3) regarding school placement for students under "manifest educational hardship." The bill would allow local school boards to place students in private schools if it is deemed in the student’s best interest, consistent with U.S. Supreme Court rulings that prohibit excluding religious schools from state programs.
- **Concerns**: Participants debated whether the bill opens the door to school choice and the use of public funds for private school placements. Superintendents and school administrators expressed concerns about the potential for misuse and the broader implications for public education. There was also discussion about the need for consistent terminology (e.g., "private" vs. "non-public" schools) across statutes.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Transparency vs. Administrative Burden**: The debate over SB 155 highlighted the tension between increasing transparency and creating additional administrative burdens for SAUs.
2. **School Safety**: Multiple bills (SB 109, HB 109) focused on improving communication between law enforcement and schools to address safety concerns, with discussions on the scope and limitations of these measures.
3. **Educational Standards and Funding**: The committee reviewed challenges in managing SAU budgets, implementing educational standards, and addressing changes in statewide assessments.
4. **Role of Technology**: SB 213 sparked discussions about the evolving role of social media and online platforms in education, with a focus on student privacy and parental control.
5. **Public vs. Private School Funding**: SB 77 raised broader questions about the use of public funds for private school placements and the implications for public education systems.
