### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (March 8, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 8, 2023, covered a wide range of budgetary, legislative, and administrative topics. The discussions focused on fiscal year 2024 and 2025 budgets, funding requests, program reorganizations, and specific legislative bills. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) Budget**
Lindsey Stepp, Commissioner of the DRA, presented the department’s operating budget for FY 2024 and 2025. Key highlights include:
- **Budget Overview**: The DRA’s budget is primarily funded through the general fund, with additional support from the education trust fund and agency income. The department operates with 156 authorized positions and maintains a cost-effective tax collection system, with a cost of collection at just over 0.5%.
- **Revenue Information Management System (RIMS)**: The DRA requested funding for RIMS consultants to support the system post-implementation. While the governor’s budget funds six consultants for 2024 and five for 2025, the DRA had requested eight. The department aims to transition support to internal staff over time.
- **Staffing and Vacancies**: With a 15% vacancy rate, the DRA requested funding for two unfunded positions to address retirements and knowledge transfer. The governor’s budget did not fund these positions, but the department is considering reclassifying vacant roles to meet staffing needs.
- **Multi-State Tax Auditors**: The DRA requested funding for two revenue-generating multi-state tax auditors, expected to bring in $3 million over the biennium. While the governor did not fund these positions, representatives expressed interest due to their high return on investment.
- **Flood Control Reimbursements**: The budget includes funds for flood control reimbursements to municipalities. Massachusetts and Connecticut share the cost, though Massachusetts has a history of delayed payments. Recent settlements have addressed outstanding payments up to 2022.
- **Low and Moderate Hardship Grants**: Funding for hardship grants increased due to changes in income limitations and maximum relief amounts, resulting in higher payouts. The governor’s budget allocates $1.5 million annually for these grants.
- **Other Budget Items**: The budget includes funding for employee training, out-of-state travel, state vehicle maintenance, and postage for taxpayer communications. The DRA also highlighted the need to replace aging state vehicles and equipment.

### **Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) and Tax Repeals**
- **RIMS Debt Service**: The State Treasurer proposed moving RIMS debt service into the DRA budget, but stakeholders opposed this due to funding risks. RIMS debt is partially funded by the general fund and partially by revenue uplift, but there is uncertainty about consistent funding.
- **Communication Services Tax Repeal**: The committee debated repealing the Communication Services Tax, which has declined in revenue due to technological changes (e.g., fewer landlines and increased data usage). The tax generates $25–30 million annually but has decreased from its peak of $40–45 million. Repealing it would require adjustments in auditing and collection processes, particularly for e911 surcharges.

### **Environmental and Infrastructure Funding**
- **Superfund Site Remediation**: Additional remediation work for Superfund sites, particularly in Merrimack, was discussed, though it remains uncertain whether the area will become a Superfund site.
- **Winnipesaukee River Basin Project**: Increased funding was requested to address rising utility and chemical costs for wastewater treatment facilities. The project is funded by user fees from 10 member communities.
- **Orphan Landfills**: Funding requests were made for the maintenance and monitoring of two orphan landfills in Danbury and Berlin, which lack responsible parties.
- **PCB Contamination Study**: A fund for PCB contamination studies was proposed, focusing on sediment and water quality impacts. The fund would be sourced from a portion of a settlement with Monsanto.
- **Cyanobacteria Mitigation**: A $25 million capital appropriation for cyanobacteria mitigation was discussed, but the committee considered retaining the bill for further study due to its complexity.

### **Program Reorganization and Administrative Changes**
- **Pollution Prevention (P2) and Small Business Technical Assistance Programs**: These programs were moved from the Commissioner’s Office to the Air and Waste Divisions, with no impact on the overall budget.
- **Coastal Resiliency Infrastructure Program**: Funds were reallocated between budget classes due to anticipated price increases, maintaining a zero-sum budget impact.
- **State Air Permit Program**: A $250,000 adjustment in general funds was made to address a budgeting system idiosyncrasy.
- **Small Business Development Center (SBDC)**: The SBDC requested an increase in appropriation from $390,000 to $500,000 to hire a full-time business advisor for the biotech industry.
- **Invest New Hampshire Program**: The program, which addresses affordable workforce housing, was discussed, with a $30 million request under HB2 for a second round of capital grants.
- **Office of Regulatory Review and Reduction in Government Efficiency**: A $750,000 allocation was proposed for this new office, primarily for salaries and administrative support.

### **Legislative Bills and Budget Adjustments**
- **Budget Cuts**: The committee discussed the need to cut approximately $130 million from the budget, potentially by not passing some bills or reducing allocations in HB2. The rainy day fund was also considered, with discussions about whether to add more to it, which would require further cuts elsewhere.
- **House Bills**:
  - **HB 212**: Focuses on funding for PFAS investigation, testing, and monitoring, with a $2 million allocation.
  - **HB 230**: Allocates $400,000 for an agricultural electronic data processing system.
  - **HB 300**: Prohibits the disposal of certain food waste, with strong stakeholder support.
  - **HB 347**: Establishes a superior court land docket, with amendments to increase the number of judges and include technical details in HB2.

### **Public Employee Labor Relations Board (PELRB)**
Doug Ingersoll, Executive Director of the PELRB, provided an overview of the board’s operations, including its role in collective bargaining, representation elections, and contract administration. The board manages approximately 660 bargaining units across the state, with 86% of contracts being current. The PELRB also discussed budget increases for legal files software, network equipment upgrades, and HR support services.

### **General Budget Adjustments and Federal Funding**
- **ARPA Funds**: The availability and use of ARPA funds were discussed, with a focus on infrastructure projects and the remaining $70 million in State Fiscal Recovery Funds (SFRF).
- **Department of Environmental Services (DES) Budget**: The DES highlighted significant increases in federal funding for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, including loans, grants, and contracts for clean water, drinking water, and PFAS remediation.
