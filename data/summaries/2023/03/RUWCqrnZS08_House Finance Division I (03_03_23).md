### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (March 3, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 3, 2023, covered a wide range of legislative topics, including environmental protection, waste management, judicial efficiency, retirement system reforms, and public employee benefits. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Environmental and Public Health Initiatives**
1. **Water Quality and Cyanobacteria Mitigation**:
   - **Phosphorus Pollution and Cyanobacteria Blooms**: The meeting highlighted the severe economic and health impacts of cyanobacteria blooms caused by phosphorus pollution in lakes. Alum treatment, which locks phosphorus in sediments, was noted as effective but costly (up to $500,000 per treatment). A proposed $25 million fund would address water quality issues, including lake treatments, septic system improvements, and public education on cyanobacteria risks.
   - **Lake Winnipesaukee**: As a key economic driver, contributing over $17 billion annually to the region, the lake’s health is critical to property values and tourism. Municipalities and lake associations lack the capital for mitigation projects, prompting calls for a hybrid grant-loan program modeled after the PFAS mitigation fund.

2. **PFAS Remediation**:
   - **PFAS Response Fund**: The existing PFAS Remediation Loan Fund has $22 million remaining, primarily for loans to water systems. Discussions focused on expanding the fund’s scope to include investigation, testing, and monitoring of PFAS in soil, fish, and air. Concerns were raised about the lack of human health studies and the justification for stringent PFAS standards (e.g., 12 parts per trillion). The committee retained the bill (HB 276) for further discussion, with plans to rename it the PFAS Response Fund and broaden its use.

### **Waste Management and Food Waste Diversion**
1. **House Bill 300 – Prohibiting Disposal of Certain Food Waste**:
   - This bill aims to divert food waste from landfills by requiring large generators to find alternative uses, such as composting or energy production. Representatives from Waste Management and the New Hampshire Food Bank supported the bill, citing environmental and economic benefits. The committee moved to retain the bill for further discussion, particularly regarding budget implications.

2. **House Bill 462 – Appropriation to the Solid Waste Management Fund**:
   - The bill proposes $2 million for waste management initiatives, including composting and food waste diversion. Funds would support grants to municipalities and private entities for infrastructure development. The committee retained the bill, with plans to incorporate it into the state budget.

### **Judicial Efficiency and Technology Modernization**
1. **House Bill 347 – Establishing a Superior Court Land Use Docket**:
   - This bill proposes a specialized docket to handle land use cases more efficiently. Discussions included the potential phasing out of the Housing Appeals Board (HAB) in favor of the new docket. The committee moved to retain the bill and include it in the budget, with potential adjustments based on a performance audit of the HAB.

2. **House Bill 230 – Modernizing Technology in the Department of Agriculture**:
   - The bill seeks to modernize outdated technology systems in the Department of Agriculture with a $360,000 investment. The committee retained the bill for consideration in the budget.

### **Retirement System and Public Employee Benefits**
1. **House Bill 250 – Accidental Death Benefits**:
   - This bill proposes increasing accidental death benefits for Group 2 members (police and firefighters) from 50% to 100% of their annual compensation if they die in the line of duty. The committee retained the bill for further discussion, citing fairness concerns.

2. **House Bill 436 – Group 2 Retirement Adjustments**:
   - The bill addresses changes made to the retirement system in 2011, proposing to spread the retirement chart into nine tiers instead of five and cap pensions at 125% of average final compensation. The bill aims to improve recruitment and retention in emergency services, which face severe labor shortages. The committee supported the bill as a conservative fix to past issues.

3. **Retirement System Funding**:
   - A bill proposing a $25 million annual appropriation over 10 years to restore 95% of benefits for employees hired between 2001 and 2011 was discussed. Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact, including potential increases in employer contribution rates for municipalities. The committee voted to retain the bill for further review.

### **Legislative Procedures and Amendments**
1. **Amendment to Remove $100 Per Day Payment**:
   - Representative McGuire proposed an amendment to remove a $100 per day payment for delegates attending an Article 5 convention, citing unnecessary expenses. The amendment was passed.

2. **House Bill 269 – Limiting NH Delegates’ Authority**:
   - This bill limits the authority of NH delegates to policy-making conventions. It was recommended to pass without fiscal impact, with a proposed amendment to remove delegate pay.

### **Key Outcomes**
- **Environmental Funding**: Bills addressing PFAS remediation, cyanobacteria mitigation, and food waste diversion were retained for further consideration, with a focus on incorporating them into the state budget.
- **Retirement System Reforms**: Bills aimed at restoring fairness and improving recruitment in the retirement system were retained, with ongoing discussions about fiscal impacts.
- **Judicial and Technology Modernization**: Bills to improve judicial efficiency and modernize technology systems were retained for budget inclusion.
- **Legislative Procedures**: Amendments to reduce unnecessary expenses and clarify delegate authority were passed.

The meeting underscored the intersection of environmental, economic, and legislative priorities, with a strong emphasis on fiscal responsibility, fairness, and long-term sustainability.
