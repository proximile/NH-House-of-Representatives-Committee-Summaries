**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (March 1, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 1, 2023, focused on critical issues related to behavioral health, housing, homelessness, opioid response, and workforce challenges. The discussions underscored the urgent need for increased funding, better coordination, and systemic solutions to address these pressing concerns. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points across all segments:

### **Behavioral Health and Mental Health Services**
1. **Mental Health Workforce Crisis**: Community mental health centers highlighted a severe shortage of mental health clinicians due to low Medicaid reimbursement rates, making it difficult to attract and retain staff. A $28 million increase in funding was requested to address wage disparities and improve workforce stability.
2. **Childrenâ€™s Behavioral Health**: The Bureau for Children's Behavioral Health, established in 2016, provides wraparound support for families and children through programs like Fast Forward and TREK. These programs have reduced the need for inpatient care and positively impacted the juvenile justice system.
3. **System of Care**: New Hampshire has developed an integrated system of care for children and families, combining community-based services, residential treatment, and care coordination. This system has significantly reduced the number of children in acute care settings, such as Hampstead Hospital.
4. **Youth Behavioral Health**: The committee discussed the increasing behavioral health needs among youth, attributing potential causes to factors like smartphone use, family structure changes, and the pandemic. Emphasis was placed on prevention, building resilience, and addressing systemic issues.

### **Housing and Homelessness**
1. **Housing Programs and Funding**: Representatives expressed concerns about the adequacy of funding for housing programs, especially for vulnerable populations like the chronically homeless, individuals with disabilities, and victims of domestic violence or human trafficking. Increased funding for shelter programs and support services was emphasized.
2. **Residential Housing Support**: A proposal was discussed to raise the daily rate for residential housing support from $232.79 to a range of $265 to $374 per day to address rising costs of 24-hour care. A $1.5 million one-time capital appropriation was also requested to offset costs for new housing units.
3. **Federal Housing Programs**: Concerns were raised about the "Housing First" federal program, which limits the ability of organizations to remove individuals from housing even if they continue to engage in harmful behaviors, such as drug use.
4. **Affordable Housing Shortage**: The committee addressed the shortage of affordable housing and its impact on homelessness, discussing programs like supportive housing and rapid re-housing.

### **Substance Misuse and Opioid Response**
1. **State Opioid Response (SOR) Funding**: The State Opioid Response grant provides $28 million annually to address opioid and methamphetamine use disorders. The discussion highlighted the complexities of managing federal "stovepipe" funding and the challenges in providing appropriate housing for individuals with severe mental illnesses and opioid use disorders.
2. **Rise of Xylazine**: The rise of xylazine, a veterinary drug mixed with fentanyl, was highlighted as a concerning trend affecting overdose responses.

### **Workforce and Budgetary Challenges**
1. **Workforce Shortages**: Significant workforce shortages in mental health and behavioral health services were discussed, with wages and supportive work environments identified as critical factors. Efforts to recruit and retain workers, including collaborations with universities and colleges, were mentioned.
2. **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**: The committee discussed the need for a comprehensive review of Medicaid reimbursement rates across various services to address immediate funding needs and plan for long-term solutions.
3. **Budgetary Concerns**: The committee reviewed various budget items, including funding for residential treatment providers, Medicaid rates, and the need for increased reimbursement to contractors to address wage issues.

### **Coordination and Future Plans**
1. **Integration of Services**: The Division of Behavioral Health aims to provide a continuum of care, integrating services across prevention, crisis intervention, outpatient treatment, and inpatient care. The Bureau of Homeless Services was recently moved into the Division of Behavioral Health to better address housing needs.
2. **Transparency and Accountability**: There is a need for better transparency and integration in the budgeting process to demonstrate the impact of investments. Future plans include restructuring the accounting system to improve transparency and accountability.
3. **Research and Evidence-Based Solutions**: The committee emphasized the importance of research to understand the underlying causes of behavioral health trends and to develop effective, evidence-based solutions. Public education and prevention strategies were highlighted.

### **Next Steps and Scheduling**
1. **Committee Leadership**: Representative Stringham was acknowledged for his expertise in Medicare reimbursement issues and was asked to lead Division III in navigating critical budget fixes.
2. **Future Meetings**: The committee planned to reconvene on March 6th for a full committee meeting and division meeting to address bills, with additional agency presentations scheduled for the following week. A meeting on Town Meeting Day (March 14th) was also discussed.
3. **Sununu Center Tour**: Members were reminded of an upcoming tour of the Sununu Center on March 3rd.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing behavioral health, homelessness, and workforce challenges in New Hampshire. The committee expressed a commitment to evidence-based approaches, preventive measures, and increased funding to improve outcomes for vulnerable populations.
