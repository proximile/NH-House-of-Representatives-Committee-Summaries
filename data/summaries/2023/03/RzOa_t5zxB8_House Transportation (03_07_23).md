The New Hampshire House Transportation Committee meeting on March 7, 2023, focused on several bills related to transportation and vehicle regulations. Here’s a summary of the key discussions and decisions:

1. **House Bill 54 (Antique Car Inspections)**: The committee voted to pass the bill with an amendment that changes the inspection date from April to May to avoid winter weather issues. The motion to pass as amended was approved 17-3.

2. **House Bill 55 (Driver Education)**: The committee voted to retain the bill for further study, with a unanimous 20-0 vote. The bill aims to allow parents to teach driver education to their 16-18-year-old children, but the committee felt it needed more scrutiny.

3. **House Bill 93 (Seasonal Speed Limits)**: The committee voted 11-9 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), effectively killing it. The bill would have allowed municipalities to reduce speed limits seasonally, but concerns were raised about its broad application and potential impracticality.

4. **House Bill 137 (Boating Safety)**: The committee unanimously voted 20-0 to pass the bill, which addresses boating safety requirements and establishes a committee to study boat registration fees. It was seen as a housekeeping measure to align state and federal laws.

5. **House Bill 198 (Driver’s License Transfer Requirements)**: The committee split 10-10 on a motion to pass the bill, which would modify new resident driver’s license transfer requirements. A subsequent motion to recommend ITL also failed 10-10, so the bill will move to the House floor without a committee recommendation.

6. **House Bill 222 (Mandatory Seat Belt Use)**: The committee voted 11-9 to recommend the bill as ITL. The bill would have required seat belt use in motor vehicles, but concerns about personal freedom and the effectiveness of such laws led to its rejection.

7. **House Bill 370 (Aftermarket Tinting for Medical Conditions)**: The committee unanimously voted 20-0 to retain the bill for further study. The bill addresses aftermarket window tinting for drivers with medical conditions, and the committee felt more clarity was needed.

8. **House Bill 537 (Front Windshield Tinting)**: The committee unanimously voted 20-0 to retain the bill for further study. The bill would permit front windshield tinting, and the committee wanted more time to consider its implications.

9. **House Bill 570 (Real ID Compliant Driver’s Licenses)**: The committee unanimously voted 20-0 to retain the bill for further study. The bill addresses Real ID compliant driver’s licenses, and the committee wanted to ensure proper safeguards were in place before moving forward.

The meeting concluded with the chair thanking the committee members for their work and noting that the committee had addressed the majority of its workload for the year. The chair also mentioned plans to coordinate with the Senate Transportation Committee regarding potential bills from the Senate.
