The NH House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 8, 2023, covered a wide range of topics related to healthcare, mental health services, budget appropriations, and legislative proposals. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and points:

### **Mental Health and Healthcare Services**
1. **New Hampshire Hospital (NHH)**:
   - NHH, the state’s acute inpatient psychiatric facility, is operating at full capacity (154 patients) but faces significant staffing shortages, with vacancy rates of 39% for RNs, 30% for mental health workers, and 60% for social workers. Two units are unavailable due to water damage, further limiting capacity.
   - The forensic hospital project, expected to open in mid-to-late 2025, was discussed. The $42 million operational funding request was zeroed out in the governor's budget, but NHH is comfortable with the timeline.
   - The PATH (Philbrook Adult Transitional Housing) program, a 16-bed transitional housing program, was highlighted for its stability and success, though challenges remain in discharging patients due to limited community resources.

2. **Hampstead Hospital**:
   - Hampstead Hospital, providing psychiatric care for children, reported reducing its waitlist for beds to zero, attributed to increased staffing and improved collaboration with the state’s integrated system of care.
   - The hospital operates under a state-owned, privately managed model, with a contract with Wellpath Recovery Solutions up for renewal.

3. **Glencliff Home**:
   - Glencliff Home, a facility for individuals with mental health and developmental disabilities, faces staffing challenges, a waitlist for admissions, and infrastructure maintenance issues.
   - Plans for a psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF) are underway, with construction expected to launch in 2023.

### **Budget and Financial Concerns**
1. **New Hampshire Veterans Home (NHVH)**:
   - The NHVH, serving veterans with a 250-bed facility, is operating at a capacity of 225 due to staffing challenges. The budget is funded by general funds (47%), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (29%), and resident room and board (24%).
   - Recruitment and retention of clinical and non-clinical staff remain significant issues, with an internal Licensed Nursing Assistant (LNA) training program helping to address shortages.

2. **Sununu Youth Services Center**:
   - The center occupies 150 acres with 13 buildings, some of which are underutilized. The state is considering the future of the property, including potential sale or repurposing.

3. **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**:
   - Both Glencliff and Hampstead are transitioning from paper-based systems to electronic health records to improve coordination of care. The state has requested funding for a unified EHR system across its 24/7 facilities.

### **Legislative Proposals and Program Discussions**
1. **House Bill 2 (HB2)**:
   - Sections 282-284 of HB2 require hospitals to provide designated receiving facility (DRF) beds for involuntary emergency admissions. The New Hampshire Hospital Association expressed concerns about mandating DRF beds as a condition of licensure, arguing that the issue requires broader systemic investments.
   - There is opposition to a provision in HB2 that would require every hospital to operate a DRF based on their size, with critics arguing it doesn’t make operational sense due to staffing shortages.

2. **Juvenile Peer-to-Peer Grief Support Program**:
   - A new $1.5 million appropriation for this program was discussed, with the committee requesting more information on its rationale, eligibility, and effectiveness.

3. **Recovery Friendly Workplace Initiative**:
   - A $2 million appropriation for the Granite United Way's administration of this initiative was discussed, with the committee questioning why this is a General Funds request rather than being funded through the Governor's Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs.

4. **Student Assistance Programming**:
   - A $1.5 million appropriation for student assistance programs across the state was considered, with the committee questioning the rationale for this General Funds request.

### **Staffing and Operational Challenges**
1. **Staffing Shortages**:
   - Significant staffing shortages were highlighted across hospitals and healthcare settings, particularly in mental health facilities. The state’s inability to compete with private hospitals in terms of pay was cited as a major factor.

2. **Facilities Management**:
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) manages 26 leased facilities, including district offices and institutional campuses. Significant turnover in facilities management staff has led to a loss of institutional knowledge, with efforts underway to rebuild infrastructure and address maintenance needs.

### **Future Plans and Strategic Realignment**
1. **Space Management**:
   - The department is actively managing office space, especially in district offices, to accommodate staff returning to work post-pandemic. The challenge is balancing the need for in-person client services with remote work options.

2. **Lease Management**:
   - The department is reviewing leases for district offices, such as Laconia and Claremont, to optimize space utilization and reduce costs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the ongoing challenges in New Hampshire’s healthcare system, particularly in mental health services, and the state’s efforts to address staffing shortages, improve infrastructure, and enhance patient care. The committee emphasized the need for detailed information and justification for various appropriations and program changes, planning to continue discussions on remaining sections of HB2 in future sessions.
