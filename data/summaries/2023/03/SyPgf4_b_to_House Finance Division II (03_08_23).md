### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 8, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 8, 2023, covered a wide range of topics, including education funding, state budget priorities, public safety, transportation, and workforce development. The discussions reflected a focus on balancing fiscal responsibility with the need to address critical state needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all four segments:

---

### **1. Education Funding and School Building Aid**
- **Education Funding Formula (House Bill 529)**: Members debated the proposed 529 formula, which aims to allocate education funding based on valuation per student. Concerns were raised about the complexity of the formula and the accuracy of free and reduced lunch (FNR) data used to determine aid. Alternatives, such as using Medicaid data, were suggested to better target districts in need. The "hold harmless" provision, ensuring no district receives less funding than the previous year, was also discussed.
- **School Building Aid**: The committee reviewed the governor’s proposal to allocate $75 million from the education trust fund for school building aid. Some members opposed this, arguing that building aid should be separate from the trust fund, which was intended for educational adequacy. Retroactive building aid for districts that undertook projects during a moratorium was also debated, with consensus against it.
- **SNAP and FNR Eligibility**: Changes in SNAP eligibility (from 185% to 200% of the federal poverty level) were expected to increase the number of students eligible for free and reduced lunch, potentially adding $10-20 million in adequacy funding costs over two years.
- **Civics Education**: A proposal to create a civics book for New Hampshire schools was discussed, with some concerns about legislative involvement in curriculum decisions.

- **University System of New Hampshire (UNH) Projects**: 
  - **Whittemore Center Renovations**: UNH requested $30 million for renovations to the 28-year-old facility, emphasizing its role in recruitment, competitiveness, and revenue generation through concerts and events. The project is a public-private partnership, with $9 million from donations and $13 million from the university.
  - **Blockchain Quality Assurance Center**: UNH sought a $1.5 million state investment to establish a center for blockchain technology validation, which would also serve as a workforce development initiative.
- **Education Trust Fund**: There was debate about reducing the amount of business taxes allocated to the education trust fund to increase flexibility in general fund spending.
- **Retained Bills**: The committee supported a $50,000 appropriation for the Department of Safety to update its contact notification system.

- **Highway Fund Revenue**: The Department of Transportation (DOT) reported a $4.2 million increase in fiscal 2023 revenues, leading to higher payments to cities and towns.
