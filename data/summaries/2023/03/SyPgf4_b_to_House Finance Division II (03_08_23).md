The **New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting** held on **March 8, 2023**, featured extensive discussions on education funding, infrastructure upgrades, technological advancements, border security, and law enforcement initiatives. The meeting emphasized strategic budget allocations, fairness in funding formulas, and long-term sustainability across various state projects. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **Education Funding and School Aid**
1. **Education Funding Formula Adjustments**:  
   - The committee reviewed **HB 529**, which proposes changes to the education funding formula, including enhancements for special education.  
   - The governor’s proposal to eliminate **stabilization grants** and introduce a **“hold harmless” provision** was debated. This provision ensures no town receives less funding than under current law, addressing concerns about towns like Manchester and Farmington facing significant funding reductions.  
   - Discussions highlighted the complexity of the formula and the need for a fairer, more transparent method of allocating funds, particularly for less wealthy communities.

2. **School Building Aid**:  
   - The governor’s proposal to allocate **$75 million from the Education Trust Fund** for school building aid was scrutinized. Some members argued this should be handled by the **Capital Budget Committee** instead.  
   - Retroactive funding for building aid was debated, with concerns raised about fairness, as towns had undertaken projects knowing about building aid moratoriums.

3. **Free and Reduced Lunch Program**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the accuracy of data used to determine eligibility for the **Free and Reduced Lunch (F&R) program**, particularly due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
   - Alternative metrics, such as Medicaid numbers, were proposed to ensure more accurate funding allocations.

### **Infrastructure and Technological Advancements**
1. **UNH Whittemore Center Upgrades**:  
   - **Allison Rich**, UNH’s Director of Athletics, presented a **$30 million proposal** to renovate the 28-year-old Whittemore Center. The upgrades aim to enhance athletic competitiveness, improve recruiting, and provide a better student-athlete experience. Funding will come from a **public-private partnership**, including philanthropic donations and university funds.

2. **Blockchain Quality Assurance Center**:  
   - **Jeff Lepak**, Director of UNH’s Interoperability Lab, discussed plans to establish a **Blockchain Quality Assurance Center**. The center will support blockchain technology development and testing, with initial state funding to kickstart operations. It is expected to become self-sustaining through corporate funding after three years.

### **Transportation and Infrastructure**
1. **Department of Transportation Proposals**:  
   - Proposals included eliminating the **Rail Appeals Board**, establishing a revolving fund for **oversized/overweight permit fees**, and clarifying toll discounts for New Hampshire E-ZPass users.  
   - Amendments to the **State Transportation Improvement Program** were discussed to streamline planning processes.

2. **Highway Fund and Budget Adjustments**:  
   - Updates included setting aside **$30 million** for potential education funding increases due to changes in SNAP eligibility and budgeting for increased payments to cities and towns based on prior years’ toll and motor vehicle fee collections.

### **Law Enforcement and Border Security**
1. **Northern Border Security**:  
   - The committee addressed increased illegal crossings along New Hampshire’s **58-mile northern border** and the need for enhanced state and federal collaboration.  
   - A new **Northern Border Alliance Program** was introduced to fund overtime patrols and support law enforcement agencies within a 25-mile radius of the Canadian border, modeled after the federally funded **Operation Stone Garden**.

2. **Body Worn and Dashboard Camera Fund**:  
   - An additional **$1.5 million** was proposed to fund grants for local police departments to adopt body and cruiser cameras, covering up to 50% of costs, with a cap of **$50,000 per entity**. This initiative aims to promote transparency and accountability in law enforcement.

3. **Substance Abuse and Emergency Response**:

### **Budgetary Priorities and Legislative Bills**
1. **Education Trust Fund**:  
   - The origin and purpose of the **Education Trust Fund** were revisited, with emphasis on its role in defending against lawsuits like the **Claremont case**. The fund is not intended to accumulate large surpluses but to address legal challenges related to inadequate education funding.

2. **Legislative Bills**:  
   - The committee reviewed several bills, including **HB 560**, which allocates **$50,000** for the Department of Safety to update its contact notification system. Other bills addressed community college funding, retirement system changes, and **telecommunication uses of state highway systems**.
