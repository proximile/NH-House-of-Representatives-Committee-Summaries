The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House Finance Committee on March 29, 2023, where members discussed and reviewed the state budget. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Budget Overview**: Michael Keane, the Legislative Budget Assistant, provided a detailed briefing on the state's financial status, focusing on the General Fund, Education Trust Fund, and other budgetary components. The House Finance Committee's proposals were compared to the governor's budget, highlighting differences in revenue estimates, expenditures, and surplus projections.

2. **Surplus and Fund Balances**: The committee reviewed surplus statements, noting a balanced spending plan with a General Fund balance of $44 million, which would transfer to the Rainy Day Fund, bringing its total to approximately $203.9 million. The Education Trust Fund also showed positive balances, with adjustments made to account for revenue shifts and program funding.

3. **Revenue and Expenditure Adjustments**: The committee discussed significant revenue and expenditure adjustments, including a $300 million shift from the Education Trust Fund to the General Fund to support programs like School Building Aid. Medicaid rates and other divisions saw increases, with overall expenditures offset by corresponding reductions.

4. **Pay Raises**: The budget included pay raises for state employees, totaling approximately $225 million across all funds, with $100 million from the General Fund.

5. **Legislative Amendments**: The committee reviewed amendments to House Bill 1 (the operating budget) and House Bill 2 (the budget trailer bill). These amendments reflected changes adopted during committee discussions and would be integrated into the final budget if approved.

6. **Concerns and Negotiations**: Some committee members expressed concerns about specific budget items, such as funding for Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs) and School Building Aid. Representative Heath requested a delay in the vote to allow for further negotiations, citing unresolved issues.

7. **Continuing Resolution Discussion**: The committee discussed the possibility of a continuing resolution if a budget agreement wasn't reached. This would involve maintaining previous funding levels, but the specifics would depend on negotiations between House, Senate, and the governor.

8. **Recess and Next Steps**: The committee decided to recess until the following morning to allow time for further negotiations and to ensure all members could participate in the final vote.

Overall, the meeting focused on balancing the budget, addressing funding priorities, and resolving disagreements among committee members.
