**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (03/13/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 13, 2023, covered a wide range of legislative and budgetary discussions, focusing on retirement system reforms, fiscal strategies, and funding allocations for critical state services. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and decisions:

---

### **Retirement System and Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)**
1. **House Bill 571 (HB571)**: The committee debated **cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)** for retirees within the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS), particularly addressing disparities between **Group One** (teachers, municipal employees) and **Group Two** (firefighters, police). Group Two retirees, who do not receive Social Security, have historically received fewer COLAs, leading to financial inequities. The bill’s estimated cost of **$84 million** raised concerns about affordability and fairness, as it excluded Group One retirees.  
   - **Proposed Amendments**: Representative McGuire suggested converting the permanent COLA into a **one-time payment** of around **$10 million**, which was seen as a more feasible and equitable solution.  
   - **Historical Context**: Testimony highlighted that Group Two retirees have received only **two COLAs in the last 19 years**, while Group One retirees have benefited more frequently. Past legislative decisions, such as the **Social Security offset** in the 1980s, were noted as contributing factors to the NHRS’s unfunded liability.  
   - **Future Considerations**: The committee emphasized the need for a sustainable mechanism for ongoing COLAs and the importance of balancing fairness to retirees with fiscal responsibility.

### **Budget Strategy and Fiscal Concerns**
1. **Budget Shortfalls and Projections**: The committee reviewed the state’s fiscal health, noting a **$70.4 million shortfall** for fiscal year 2023, which would require drawing from the rainy day fund. However, projections for 2024 and 2025 showed positive balances, indicating potential recovery.  
2. **House Bill 50 (HB50)**: The committee discussed amendments to address the unfunded liability of the NHRS by adding money to the liability instead of returning it to towns. This approach aims to reduce long-term costs for municipalities. The committee recommended passing the bill in the House and including it in the budget (HB2) for leverage in negotiations with the Senate and governor.  
3. **Tax Policy**: To attract bipartisan support for the budget, the committee proposed accelerating the sunset of the **interest and dividends tax** to 2025 while retaining the **communications tax** to offset lost revenue. This strategy aimed to appeal to Republicans by eliminating a tax and to Democrats by maintaining a long-term revenue source.

### **Key Bills and Funding Allocations**
1. **Workers’ Compensation and Second Injury Fund**: Peter Bragdon, representing Comp Sigma, emphasized the importance of retaining the **Second Injury Fund**, which helps self-insured companies manage workers’ compensation costs. The committee agreed this issue deserved a standalone policy debate rather than being tucked into the budget.  
2. **Other Notable Bills**:  
   - **HB311 (Buco Bucks)**: Already included in the budget.  
   - **HB384**: Funding adjusted from $25 million to $22.5 million by reallocating funds from the legislative budget.  
   - **HB506 (Rail Chill Box Tunnel)**: Funding and potential amendments discussed.  
   - **HB347 (Additional Judge)**: Retained with the intention of adding language to HB2.  
   - **HB379 (Indigent Tenant Evictions)**: Adds language to eviction notices about available legal services, with no fiscal impact.  
   - **HB436 (Retirement System Changes)**: Retained for further review due to its significant financial impact ($250 million over time).  
   - **HB504 (Adult Parole Board)** and **HB462 (Hospitals)**: Retained for inclusion in the budget.

### **Infrastructure, Environmental, and Social Services Funding**
1. **Prison Funding**: Concerns were raised that the allocated **$10 million** for prison design work might be insufficient compared to the **$25 million** initially discussed. The committee considered increasing the funding to **$20 million**.  
2. **PCB and PFAS Remediation**: The committee discussed allocating funds for **PCB** and **PFAS** remediation in water systems, with a suggestion to leave **$6 million** unspent for potential future needs.  
3. **Victim Assistance Fund**: The committee considered increasing the portion of funds from penalty assessments and court fees used for administrative costs from **15% to 30%**, allowing more resources for crime victims.  
4. **Business Finance Authority**: A proposal to increase the state-backed borrowing cap from **$115 million to $200 million** was discussed, with concerns raised about potential risks and the need for more information on current loans and defaults.

### **Transparency and Governance**
1. **Liquor Commission**: An amendment was proposed to require the Liquor Commission to notify the fiscal committee and Governor’s Council **in advance** of store closures, rather than after the fact.  
2. **Parking Issues**: The committee addressed parking challenges for state employees, including the need for additional parking spaces and associated costs.  
3. **Non-Budget Measures**: The committee discussed improving scheduling transparency for legislative sessions to attract bipartisan support.
