### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Charter School Dissolution (HB 550)**
- **Amendment 0624h**: The committee discussed and passed an amendment to HB 550, which replaces the original bill with language establishing a study committee to address the dissolution of charter schools. The amendment aims to clarify the handling of assets and records when a charter school dissolves, ensuring a structured process for such events.

- **Proposal**: HB 267 seeks to mandate more frequent criminal background checks for school employees, including periodic checks beyond the initial hiring process.
- **Concerns**: Members raised issues about feasibility, funding, and potential unfunded mandates for school districts. There were also concerns about bias, cost, and the definition of "group" for background checks.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to retain the bill for further study and refinement to address these concerns.

#### **3. Public Comment in School Board Meetings (HB 427)**
- **Amendment 0741h**: The committee discussed an amendment to HB 427, which revises public comment rules by allowing input on non-agenda items and limiting comment periods to 30 minutes (with speakers capped at three minutes).
- **Debate**: Some members supported the inclusion of non-agenda items to ensure transparency and public participation, while others expressed concerns that it could lead to irrelevant or divisive topics.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed as amended, with additional discussions about balancing local control and state oversight.

#### **4. Incentive Grants for School Improvement (HB 552)**
- **Amendment**: The committee debated an amendment to HB 552, which proposes incentive grants for schools showing improvement in standardized test scores. The amendment reduced total funding from $1 million to $500,000 and capped individual school awards at $25,000.
- **Concerns**: Members raised concerns about potential disparities in funding distribution and the risk of schools using funds for non-academic purposes.
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed, but the bill was ultimately voted to go to the full House without recommendation.

#### **5. Minimum Standards for Public School Approval (HB 371)**
- **Proposal**: HB 371 seeks to establish a commission to review and recommend changes to minimum public school standards.
- **Debate**: Supporters argued the commission would enhance transparency and accountability, while critics noted that the existing Legislative Oversight Committee already has the authority to address these issues.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **10-10** on both ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) and OTP (Ought to Pass) motions, leaving the bill without a recommendation.

#### **6. Prohibition on Discrimination by the State Board of Education (HB 451)**
- **Proposal**: HB 451 aims to expand protections against discrimination in educational settings, particularly for students in taxpayer-funded programs like vouchers.
- **Debate**: Discussions focused on the scope of protected classes, including race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Concerns were raised about the inclusion of "religious Creed" and whether private and religious schools should adhere to anti-discrimination standards when accepting public funds.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **10-10** on both ITL and OTP motions, leaving the bill without a recommendation.

#### **7. Non-Academic Surveys in Schools (HB 204)**
- **Proposal**: HB 204 proposes minor changes to prohibit schools from surveying students about their emotional states without parental consent.
- **Debate**: Proponents argued it helps differentiate schools from mental health facilities, while opponents expressed concerns about limiting teachers' ability to identify and address student issues.
- **Outcome**: The bill was debated extensively, with some members supporting it and others advocating for retaining it for further refinement.
