### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on Cannabis Legalization and Taxation (March 27, 2023)

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on March 27, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 639**, which focuses on the legalization, regulation, and taxation of cannabis. The meeting centered on crafting a taxation framework, addressing revenue allocation, and ensuring the bill aligns with public health, market competitiveness, and financial sustainability goals. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Taxation Framework and Rates**
The committee engaged in extensive debate over **where to impose the tax** (wholesale vs. retail level) and the **appropriate tax rate**:
- **Wholesale Level Taxation**: Some members favored taxing cannabis at the wholesale level to align with New Hampshire’s tax philosophy of avoiding sales taxes and keeping taxes invisible to consumers. Proposals ranged from **1% to 15%**, with a compromise emerging around **12.5% to 13%**.
- **Retail Level Taxation**: Others advocated for taxing at the retail level using a **gross receipts tax model**, arguing it would generate more revenue and align with practices in other states.
- **Revenue Concerns**: There were concerns about whether an **8% wholesale tax rate** would suffice to cover operational costs (estimated at $4 million annually for the Liquor Commission) and fund other state needs, such as education, public safety, and substance abuse prevention.
- **Black Market Impact**: Some representatives emphasized the importance of a **lower tax rate** to undercut the black market, while others countered that legalization alone might not eliminate illegal sales.

#### **2. Revenue Allocation and Funding**
The committee discussed how cannabis tax revenue would be distributed and used:
- **Proposed Allocation**: Revenue would be allocated as follows:
  - 50% to education.
  - 30% to retirement systems.
  - 10% to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
  - 5% to public safety.
  - 5% to other targeted programs.
- **Public Education Campaigns**: HHS highlighted the need for upfront funding ($500,000) for a public education campaign on cannabis risks, targeting specific populations and promoting safe usage. This funding would be repaid from future cannabis revenues.
- **Startup Costs**: Appropriations were proposed to cover the Liquor Commission’s startup costs, including software, office space, and staffing.

---

#### **3. Amendments and Technical Adjustments**
The committee reviewed and merged several amendments to refine the bill:
- **Amendment 1228**: Debated renaming the **Liquor and Cannabis Commission** to avoid conflating cannabis with liquor, but this did not gain strong support.
- **Dual Use Certificates**: Changes were made to streamline dual-use licensing fees, with some arguing that the initial $100,000 fee was too burdensome and could hinder market entry.
- **Merged Amendments**: Amendments 1227, 1223, and 1217 were consolidated into a single committee amendment, which included adjustments to appropriations, tax language, and funding allocations. A straw vote approved the merged amendment.

---

#### **4. Implementation and Review**
The committee emphasized the importance of flexibility and ongoing evaluation:
- **Implementation Timeline**: Proposals to reduce the timeline for implementing cannabis regulations from **18 months to 12 months** received broad support.
- **Periodic Review**: Members proposed requiring the Liquor Commission to regularly review and adjust the tax rate based on market conditions and revenue needs.

---

#### **5. Policy Goals and Concerns**
The discussions highlighted the complexity of balancing multiple policy objectives:
- **Public Health and Safety**: Ensuring cannabis regulation supports education, prevention, and treatment programs was a priority.
- **Market Accessibility**: Reducing barriers to market entry, such as high licensing fees, was seen as critical to fostering a competitive legal market.
- **Tax Relief**: Some members emphasized the potential for cannabis revenue to provide modest property tax relief by offsetting state education funding obligations.

---

#### **6. Committee Votes and Next Steps**
- **Straw Polls**: The committee conducted straw polls on key aspects of the bill, including support for the amendment, tax rate, and tax location. Results were mixed, with no clear consensus on the tax rate or location.
- **Final Vote**: The committee voted **16-4** to recommend **HB 639** as **Ought to Pass as Amended**, with a **Minority Report** indicating opposition to certain aspects of the bill.
- **Crossover Deadline**: The committee aimed to finalize majority and minority reports ahead of the **April 6 crossover deadline**, when the bill would move to the Senate.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of crafting a cannabis tax policy that balances revenue generation, market competitiveness, and public health concerns. While the committee made progress in refining the bill, significant disagreements remain, particularly regarding the tax rate and location. The discussions highlighted the need for ongoing collaboration and flexibility as New Hampshire moves toward cannabis legalization.
