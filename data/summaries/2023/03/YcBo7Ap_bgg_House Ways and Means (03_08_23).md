The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee held an executive session on March 8, 2023, to review several bills. The session began with an announcement that House Bills 607 and 445 would not be addressed that day but would be moved to the following week for more thorough discussion. The committee then proceeded to discuss and vote on various bills:

1. **House Bill 15**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain the bill for further analysis, citing the need for more information on state revenue.
2. **House Bill 100**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain the bill, as they required more time for analysis regarding the repeal of the interests and dividends tax.
3. **House Bill 133**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain the bill, needing more information before making a decision on repealing the communication services tax.
4. **House Bill 192**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain the bill, requiring further analysis on the rate and exemptions of the interest and dividends tax.
5. **House Bill 220**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain the bill, which would establish a committee to study the regulatory structure of charitable gaming. There was discussion about overlapping with a Senate bill and the difference between a committee and a commission.
6. **House Bill 450**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain the bill, which would remove the net operating loss deduction limit on taxable income under the business profits tax, citing the need for more detailed analysis.
7. **House Bill 486**: The committee voted 18-2 to recommend that the bill be "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL). The bill aimed to change vehicle registration and toll collection enforcement agreements. Opponents argued that the current system is effective and that the proposed changes would be costly and potentially harmful.
8. **House Bill 510**: The committee voted 15-5 to recommend ITL for the bill, which would remove the tax exemption for premium cigars. Supporters of ITL argued that the exemption supports local businesses and that removing it would drive sales online, potentially killing the industry. Opponents of ITL argued that it sends the wrong message to exempt one form of tobacco from taxation.

The session concluded with announcements about future meetings, including a public hearing on House Bill 639 and the next executive session scheduled for March 15, 2023. Committee members were reminded to submit their blurbs (brief summaries of their positions) to the house clerk as soon as possible.
