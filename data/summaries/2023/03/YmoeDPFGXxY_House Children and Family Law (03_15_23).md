The New Hampshire House of Representatives Children and Family Law Committee meeting on March 15, 2023, focused on several key bills and amendments related to family court procedures, parental rights, child welfare, and LGBTQ+ youth protections. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **House Bill 475: Rules of Evidence in Family Court**
The primary focus of the meeting was **House Bill 475**, which aims to establish the right for both parties in Family Court proceedings to submit evidence and testimony, ensuring a fairer and more balanced process. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to address concerns that Family Courts often allow only one party to present evidence, leading to life-altering decisions based on incomplete information. It aims to reduce stress and anxiety for families by promoting transparency and fairness.
- **Debate on Judicial Discretion**: Critics argued the bill could undermine judges' ability to control courtroom proceedings, potentially leading to irrelevant evidence and delays. Proponents emphasized the need for fairness, especially for parties without legal representation.
- **Testimonies**: Representative Lisa Post, the billâ€™s prime sponsor, highlighted the importance of allowing both parties to present evidence. Richard Head, representing the judicial branch, opposed the bill, citing concerns about court efficiency. Citizens shared personal experiences of being denied the opportunity to present evidence in Family Court.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to retain the bill (15 yeas, 1 nay) for further discussion and potential amendments.

### **House Bill 10: Parental Rights and School Responsibilities**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 10**, which addresses parental rights and the role of schools in matters related to student identity, particularly gender identity. Key points included:
- **Amendment**: An amendment changed the language from "in the district" to "in the state" regarding employment restrictions for individuals with certain offenses. The amendment passed, and the bill was modified.
- **Parental Rights vs. Student Privacy**: Supporters emphasized parents' right to know about their children's activities, including name changes and gender identity. Opponents argued the bill could harm LGBTQ+ youth by forcing schools to disclose sensitive information to potentially unsupportive or abusive parents.
- **Mandated Reporting**: Concerns were raised about the bill undermining teachers' roles as mandated reporters and the potential chilling effect on student-teacher trust.
- **Outcome**: The motion to pass the bill (OTP) was approved, but a subsequent motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill was also considered, reflecting ongoing disagreement.

### **House Bill 618: Wage Garnishment for Child Support**
The committee discussed **House Bill 618**, which addresses wage garnishment for child support payments. An amendment was proposed but not moved forward. The bill was retained (15 yeas, 1 nay) to allow further discussion and resolution of unresolved issues.

### **House Bill 499: Admission of Evidence in Family Court**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 499**, which focuses on the admission of evidence in Family Court proceedings. An amendment (Amendment 619) was discussed, but the bill was retained (15 yeas, 1 nay) for further review and potential alignment with other retained bills.

### **House Resolution 14: Family Court System Committee**
The committee discussed **House Resolution 14**, which proposes creating a committee to address issues in the family court system. An amendment was passed to form a committee of 11 legislators and 5 public members to gather testimony from individuals affected by the system. The committee voted 16-0 to pass the amendment and the bill as amended.

### **House Bill 438: Rights of Representation in Family Court**
The committee debated **House Bill 438**, which would allow a support person to accompany individuals in Family Court proceedings. Concerns were raised about potential overreach by support persons and the impact on judicial procedures. The amendment failed with an 8-8 vote, and the original bill was moved to interim study (ITL) with a 16-0 vote.

### **House Bill 417: Definition of Child Abuse**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 417**, which sought to redefine child abuse, particularly in cases involving transgender children and medical treatments like hormone therapy. Members expressed concerns about labeling parents as criminals for seeking medical care for their children. The committee voted 16-0 to move the bill to interim study (ITL).

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted the tension between ensuring fairness and transparency in Family Court proceedings and maintaining judicial efficiency. Discussions also emphasized the need to balance parental rights with the protection of vulnerable youth, particularly LGBTQ+ students. Several bills were retained for further discussion, reflecting the complexity of the issues and the need for careful consideration and refinement. The committee underscored the importance of supporting individuals navigating the family court system, especially those without legal representation.
