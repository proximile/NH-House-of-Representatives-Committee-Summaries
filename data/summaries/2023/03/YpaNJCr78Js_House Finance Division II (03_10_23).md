**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 10, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 10, 2023, covered a broad range of topics, including state employee compensation, education funding, workforce development, healthcare shortages, and legislative processes. The discussions highlighted ongoing challenges in recruiting and retaining state employees, the complexities of budgeting, and strategies to support education and workforce development in the state.

### **State Employee Compensation and Hiring Challenges**
- **Classification and Compensation**: The state’s employee classification system, particularly for the Department of Transportation and Health and Human Services (HHS), was discussed. Employees are hired at specific salary steps, but budget discrepancies arise when hires are made at higher steps than budgeted. For example, an administrator was hired at a step resulting in a $35,000 difference from the budget. Family plan benefits further increase costs.
- **Vacancy Rates**: Departments face significant hiring challenges, with vacancy rates as high as 20% overall and 58% in special education within the Department of Education. Lower state salaries compared to the private sector and school districts exacerbate recruitment difficulties.
- **Budget Adjustments**: Cumulative hiring decisions have led to higher costs than budgeted, necessitating a request for an additional $800,000 over the biennium to cover these expenses, equivalent to hiring 10-15 more employees.

### **Education Funding and Accountability**
- **Education Trust Fund**: The education trust fund, currently overfunded, was a focal point. Strategies to reduce contributions to the fund were discussed, including moving the assessment program to it. This program is crucial for evaluating school districts' ability to provide adequate education.
- **Extraordinary Needs Grants**: Accountability plans tied to these grants, which target schools with high free and reduced lunch percentages and low equalized valuations, were debated. These plans, added as an amendment, have been confusing and burdensome for school districts. The committee considered suspending or repealing these requirements to reduce administrative burdens.
- **Public School Infrastructure Fund**: The fund, established in 2018, supports school safety, infrastructure, and broadband projects. The Department of Education has $21 million in unfunded requests and is seeking an additional $5 million annually to address safety and infrastructure needs.

### **Workforce Development and Student Debt Relief**
- **Workforce Development Program**: The governor’s Workforce Development Student Debt Relief Program aims to attract and retain workers in high-demand fields such as healthcare and biotech by offering student debt relief after three years of employment in New Hampshire. The program is funded by reallocating 50% of the revenue from Fidelity 529 plans, with no new cost to taxpayers.
- **Healthcare Workforce Shortages**: The critical shortage of healthcare workers, particularly registered nurses and licensed nursing assistants, was discussed. A proposal to provide student loan forgiveness for healthcare workers committing to work in New Hampshire for three years was debated as a strategy to narrow the wage gap with Massachusetts and retain talent.
- **529 Plan and Scholarships**: The New Hampshire 529 plan, the fourth largest in the country, funds scholarships for state residents attending state institutions. The commission overseeing the plan has increased award amounts and expanded eligibility criteria, expecting to provide scholarships to over 10,000 students in fiscal year 2024.

### **Legislative Processes and Amendments**
- **House Bills 430 and 626**: Both bills related to Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs) were deemed **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)**. HB 430 proposed requiring one year of public school attendance before EFA eligibility, while HB 626 sought to transfer EFA administration from a third-party organization to the Department of Education. Both bills faced opposition for limiting parental choice and increasing administrative burdens.
- **Gender-Neutral Bathrooms and Menstrual Products**: The committee debated removing language related to gender-neutral bathrooms and requiring schools to provide free menstrual hygiene products. Concerns were raised about waste and misuse, with suggestions to modify the language for better implementation.

### **Public Transportation and Infrastructure**
- **Public Transportation Funding**: The committee reviewed a request to increase funding for public transportation services, particularly for medical and senior transportation, which is underfunded by federal reimbursements. They considered adding $1.8 million to the budget to meet the requested $2.75 million total.

### **Future Discussions and Amendments**
- **Upcoming Schedule**: The committee outlined a busy schedule for the following week, including work sessions, public hearings, and potential weather-related disruptions.
- **Repeal of Defunct Advisory Council**: The committee unanimously voted to repeal the Advanced Manufacturing Education Advisory Council, which had not met for some time and was deemed duplicative of other entities' work.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of state budgeting, the challenges of recruiting and retaining employees, and the importance of strategic investments in education and workforce development. The discussions highlighted the need for careful consideration of legislative amendments, fiscal responsibility, and the balancing of competing priorities to address the state’s most pressing needs.
