**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (March 7, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 7, 2023, focused on budget discussions, legislative bills, and program reviews related to health and human services, particularly for elderly, disabled, and vulnerable populations. The meeting was divided into four segments, each addressing specific topics and bills. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Division of Long-Term Supports and Services (LTSS) Budget Work Session**
The session began with opening remarks by Representative Maureen Mooney, Vice Chair of Division III, who introduced the agenda focused on the LTSS division within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Nathan White, DHHS Chief Financial Officer, and Melissa Hardy, LTSS Division Director, provided an overview of the division’s mission, services, and budget. Key highlights included:

- **Mission and Services**: LTSS supports individuals with disabilities, older adults, and families through programs like home-delivered meals, Adult Protective Services (APS), and Medicaid waivers.
- **Accomplishments and Challenges**: 
  - Distributed $25 million in ARPA funding to bolster the direct care workforce.
  - Addressed federal compliance issues, including electronic visit verification (EVV) requirements.
  - Workforce shortages remain a critical challenge, with 35% of individuals not receiving services due to staffing gaps.
  - Rate studies for provider services, last updated in 2007, are underway.
- **Budget Details**: 
  - The governor’s recommended budget was reviewed, with discussions on APS, home and community-based services, and the Choices for Independence Medicaid waiver.
  - A 3% rate increase for providers was proposed, but concerns were raised about its adequacy to address workforce challenges.
- **Meals on Wheels and Congregate Meals**: The cost per meal is $8.11, with no rate increase proposed for the next biennium. Additional funding is needed to sustain services.

### **2. Legislative Bills: House Bill 527 and Senate Bill 86**
The committee discussed two key bills:

- **Senate Bill 86**: This bill appropriates funds but lacks specific rate details. An amendment is being prepared to propose an $80 per day rate for mid-level care in certain facilities, though calculations are still ongoing.
- **House Bill 527**: The committee closed the work session on this bill after productive discussions. The bill proposes changes to Medicaid reimbursement rates for small assisted living facilities (see Segment 4 for details).
- **Executive Session Planning**: Representative Edwards requested scheduling an executive session for five bills, tentatively planned for March 13, 2023.

### **3. Elderly and Adult Services, Medicaid, and Support Programs**
The committee reviewed budgets and programs supporting elderly, disabled, and vulnerable populations. Key discussions included:

- **Meals on Wheels and Congregate Meals**: The program serves hundreds of thousands of meals annually, with 30,000-31,000 individuals eligible for services.
- **Social Services Block Grant (SSBG)**: The committee examined this federal grant, which funds programs like Meals on Wheels.
- **County Cap and Nursing Home Payments**: Discussions focused on the county cap system limiting counties’ Medicaid contributions for nursing home patients.
- **Medicaid Quality Incentive Payment (MQIP) and Pro Share**: These programs supplement nursing home payments through taxes on net patient service revenues.
- **CFI Waiver Program**: The Choices for Independence waiver supports individuals transitioning from nursing homes to community living.
- **Acquired Brain Disorder Services**: Budget increases were noted due to higher demand for residential and day services.
- **Children’s In-Home Support Waiver**: This program supports children with developmental disabilities, allowing them to stay at home rather than in institutional care.
- **Guardianship Services**: Contracts with the Office of Public Guardian and Tri-County Guardianship Services were reviewed.
- **Infant Toddler Program and Special Medicaid Services**: Federal IDEA Act funds and account renumbering were discussed.

### **4. House Bill 527: Medicaid Reimbursement Rates for Assisted Living Facilities**
The committee focused on HB 527, which proposes increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for small assisted living facilities (16 beds or less) with at least 50% Medicaid occupancy. Key points included:

- **Amendment Discussion**: The bill was amended to clarify that it applies to Hep 804 licensed facilities.
- **Fiscal Impact**: DHHS noted that applying the proposed $115 daily rate to all Hep 804 and 805 facilities would significantly increase costs. They recommended a uniform percentage increase across all levels of care.
- **Current Rates and Licenses**: Medicaid reimbursement rates for assisted living facilities range from $56.88 (standard care) to $95.41 (dementia level 2). Hep 804 facilities provide standard assisted living, while Hep 805 facilities offer additional medical services.
- **Regional Comparisons**: New Hampshire’s rates are lower than those in neighboring states like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Connecticut.
- **Industry Challenges**: Stakeholders emphasized financial struggles and staffing shortages, advocating for broader Medicaid rate increases.
- **Process for Rate Changes**: Any rate adjustments require public notice, state plan amendments, and federal approval.
- **Unmet Needs**: The state does not track individuals waiting for residential care beds, leading to delays in care.
- **Legislative Recommendations**: Comprehensive Medicaid rate increases were suggested to address systemic challenges.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to address workforce shortages, comply with federal requirements, and ensure adequate funding for critical services. Discussions on LTSS, Medicaid, and legislative bills underscored the need for systemic solutions to support elderly, disabled, and vulnerable populations in New Hampshire. The committee plans to continue its work with an executive session scheduled for March 13, 2023, and further budget deliberations in the coming weeks.
