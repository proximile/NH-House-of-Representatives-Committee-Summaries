The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 7, 2023, focused on critical budget and policy issues related to Medicaid reimbursement rates, long-term supports and services (LTSS), and the challenges faced by nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other programs serving vulnerable populations. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Medicaid Reimbursement and Nursing Homes**
The committee extensively discussed Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes and assisted living facilities, particularly those with 16 beds or fewer and at least 50% Medicaid occupancy. Key points included:
- **Bed Tax and Federal Matching Funds**: Nursing homes pay a "bed tax" based on net patient service revenues, which draws federal matching funds. However, there is a gap between when facilities pay the tax and when they receive payments. The committee examined how rate increases could affect this gap.
- **Rate Increases vs. Cost Increases**: If rate increases exceed cost increases, the payment gap may shrink, but the reverse is also true. The state has been leveraging methodologies like Certified Public Expenditure (CPE) and Intergovernmental Transfers (IGT) to maximize federal funding.
- **Assisted Living Facilities**: Representative Horrigan introduced an amendment to HB 527 to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for small assisted living facilities (Hep 804 license type) with at least 50% Medicaid occupancy. Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact, as expanding the rate increase to all such facilities could cost an estimated $10.6 million. The committee emphasized the need for structural changes in how Medicaid rates are set, potentially requiring negotiations with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

### **Long-Term Supports and Services (LTSS) Budget**
The Division of LTSS, led by Representative Maureen Mooney in the absence of Chairman Jess Edwards, presented its budget overview and challenges:
- **Mission and Structure**: LTSS supports individuals across the lifespan, from children with special healthcare needs to aging adults, through three bureaus: Elderly and Adult Services, Family-Centered Services, and Developmental Services.
- **Key Outcomes**: The division aims to strengthen Adult Protective Services (APS), improve response times, and promote healthy aging through programs like home-delivered meals and Alzheimer's support.
- **Funding and Workforce Challenges**: The division distributed $25 million in ARPA funding to support the direct care workforce but faces significant staffing shortages. A new rate study is underway, with draft rates expected by the end of 2023. The budget includes a 3% rate increase for providers, but concerns were raised about its adequacy.
- **Federal Compliance**: The division is working to comply with federal electronic visit verification (EVV) requirements by January 2024 and address CMS corrective action plans for developmental services.
- **Waitlist and Service Delivery**: While all individuals on the developmental disabilities waiver are funded, only 65% are receiving services due to workforce shortages and lack of providers. The division estimates a $55 million lapse in funds for FY24, with potential shortfalls in FY25 if HB2 provisions allowing fund carryover are not maintained.

### **Program-Specific Discussions**
The committee reviewed several Medicaid waiver programs and other initiatives:
- **Choices for Independence (CFI) Waiver**: This program supports elderly and disabled individuals in staying in their homes rather than institutional care. Despite claims of no waitlist, significant unmet needs exist due to staffing shortages.
- **Children in Home Support Waiver**: This program helps children with disabilities stay at home, and the committee highlighted its cost-effectiveness compared to institutional care.
- **Acquired Brain Disorder Services Waiver**: This supports individuals with brain injuries, and testimony emphasized the need for increased funding to address service gaps.
- **Meals on Wheels and Nutrition Services**: Temporary federal funding increases supported rate hikes for home-delivered and congregate meals, but without continued funding, rates or services may need to be reduced. The cost per meal is currently $8.11, with no proposed rate increase for the next biennium.

### **Assisted Living Facilities and HB 527**
The committee held detailed discussions on HB 527, which focuses on Medicaid reimbursement rates for assisted living facilities:
- **Classification and Rates**: The discussion highlighted disparities in rates for standard care versus dementia care levels (Hep 804 and Hep 805 classifications). DHHS recommended a uniform percentage increase across all levels of care rather than setting all rates at a fixed amount.
- **Comparative Analysis**: New Hampshireâ€™s rates were compared to those in neighboring states like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Connecticut, with New Hampshire generally lagging behind.
- **Stakeholder Input**: Testimony from stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Association of Residential Care Homes, emphasized the need for across-the-board rate increases to address financial struggles, particularly for facilities with high Medicaid occupancy.
- **Legislative Process**: The committee discussed the procedural steps required to implement rate changes, including public notice and CMS approval. The tight deadline for voting on HB 527 was noted, with an executive session planned for further consideration.

### **Automation, Efficiency, and Cross-Program Coordination**
The committee explored ways to improve efficiency and address systemic challenges:
- **Automation**: Efforts are underway to automate manual processes, such as Excel-based systems, to expedite payments and reduce administrative burdens for providers.
- **Staffing and Recruitment**: The division has seven open positions and is actively recruiting, but workforce shortages remain a significant issue.
- **Cross-Program Coordination**: Concerns were raised about potential duplication across funding streams for similar services, such as Meals on Wheels. The committee emphasized the need for tracking and transitioning clients between programs to ensure efficient use of funds.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of Medicaid reimbursement rates, workforce shortages, and the need for increased funding to ensure access to care for vulnerable populations. The committee considered amendments and legislative actions to address these issues while balancing fiscal constraints. Key priorities include modernizing systems, complying with federal requirements, and ensuring transparency and efficiency in service delivery. The discussions highlighted the critical role of legislative support in addressing the challenges faced by nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and LTSS programs.
