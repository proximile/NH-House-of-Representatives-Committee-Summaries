The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee meeting on March 7, 2023, focused on two key bills: **House Bill 609 (HB609)**, which proposes reforms to the energy facility siting process, and **House Bill 142 (HB142)**, which addresses issues related to the Burgess Biopower plant in Berlin. The discussions highlighted the tension between streamlining energy infrastructure development and preserving environmental protections, public participation, and economic considerations.

### **House Bill 609: Energy Facility Siting Reforms**
HB609 proposes transferring authority for energy facility siting from the **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)** to the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**. The bill aims to address inefficiencies in the current SEC process while maintaining environmental safeguards and public input. Key points from the debate include:

1. **Current SEC Challenges**:  
   - The SEC, a part-time committee with diverse membership, faces inefficiencies such as scheduling conflicts, lack of institutional knowledge, and sparse technical expertise.  
   - These issues lead to delays, increased costs, and hesitancy among developers, deterring energy projects and federal funding.  

2. **Proposed Reforms**:  
   - Shifting siting responsibilities to the PUC, which has full-time commissioners and staff, is expected to professionalize and expedite the process.  
   - The bill retains public participation through hearings and interventions but centralizes decision-making with the PUC.  

3. **Environmental and Public Participation Concerns**:  
   - Opponents, including the **Appalachian Mountain Club**, **Sierra Club**, and **The Nature Conservancy**, argue that the bill weakens environmental protections and reduces public involvement.  
   - Critics highlight the SEC’s diverse expertise, which includes state agencies and public members, as essential for addressing environmental, cultural, and economic impacts.  

4. **Stakeholder Perspectives**:  
   - **Supporters**: Industry groups like the **Business and Industry Association (BIA)**, **Eversource**, and labor unions (e.g., **New Hampshire AFL-CIO**, **IBEW**) emphasize the need for a streamlined, predictable process to attract investment, create jobs, and meet energy demands.  
   - **Opponents**: Environmental organizations and some representatives stress the importance of balancing efficiency with robust public input and environmental safeguards.  

5. **Fee Structure and Fiscal Impact**:  
   - Questions were raised about the fee structure, particularly the higher fees for renewable energy projects (solar and wind) compared to non-renewable projects.  
   - Concerns about the **Department of Energy (DOE)**’s capacity to handle additional responsibilities were addressed, with testifiers expressing confidence in the DOE’s ability to manage the workload.  

6. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee plans to consider amendments to address concerns about public participation, environmental protections, and the fee structure.

### **House Bill 142: Burgess Biopower Plant**
HB142 focuses on the Burgess Biopower biomass plant in Berlin, which plays a critical role in the region’s economy and energy generation. Key issues include:

1. **Plant’s Role and Contributions**:  
   - Burgess Biopower was developed to support renewable energy, provide economic stability, and offer price stability in energy markets.  
   - It is the largest property taxpayer and water/sewer user in Berlin, helping revitalize the community after the closure of the Fraser paper mill.  

2. **Cumulative Reduction Factor (CRF) Issue**:  
   - The CRF, a clause in the plant’s **Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)** with Eversource, compares Burgess’s stable energy price to fluctuating market prices, creating financial risk.  
   - The CRF has reached its cap of $100 million, with the current balance at around $148–150 million, raising concerns about the plant’s financial sustainability.  

3. **Request for Legislative Support**:  
   - Stakeholders, including Berlin Mayor Paul Grenier, urged the committee to support HB142 to resolve the CRF issue and ensure the plant’s long-term operation.  
   - Potential co-location partnerships, such as a biochar facility, were highlighted as opportunities for additional economic benefits.  

4. **Economic Impact**:  
   - The plant supports 240 jobs and generates $70 million in annual economic activity, making it a critical economic driver for the North Country region.  

5. **Concerns and Questions**:  
   - Some representatives questioned the fairness of renegotiating the PPA terms and whether the plant can remain cost-effective.  
   - The **Department of Energy** opposed the bill, citing risks to ratepayers and the need to avoid targeted subsidies.  

6. **Next Steps**:  
   - The hearing was recessed until March 13 for further testimony, with a goal of finalizing decisions on the bill by March 16.

### **Key Themes and Overall Implications**
1. **Efficiency vs. Thoroughness**:  
   - Proponents of HB609 argue that streamlining the siting process will attract energy projects and reduce costs, while opponents stress the importance of a thorough, inclusive review process.  

2. **Environmental and Public Participation**:  
   - Both bills raised concerns about balancing energy development with environmental protections and public input.  

3. **Economic Impact**:  
   - The economic benefits of energy projects, including job creation and local economic activity, were weighed against potential costs to ratepayers and communities.  

4. **Regulatory Oversight**:  
   - The role of the SEC and PUC in ensuring fair and efficient energy facility siting and operation was a central point of debate.

### **Conclusion**
The discussions reflect the complex interplay between energy policy, environmental protection, and economic development. While HB609 aims to improve the efficiency of the energy siting process, concerns about reduced public participation and environmental safeguards remain. Similarly, HB142 highlights the importance of the Burgess Biopower plant to the North Country’s economy but raises questions about financial sustainability and ratepayer costs. The committee faces the challenge of balancing these competing interests as it considers amendments and final decisions on both bills.
