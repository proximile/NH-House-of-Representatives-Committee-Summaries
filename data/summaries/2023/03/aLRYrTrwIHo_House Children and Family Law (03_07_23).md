The New Hampshire House of Representatives Children and Family Law Committee convened on March 7, 2023, to discuss several critical bills, with a particular focus on **House Bill 417 (HB 417)** and **House Bill 10 (HB 10)**, both of which center on parental rights, transgender youth, and the role of schools and healthcare providers. The meeting also addressed other bills related to child support, family law, and parental responsibilities. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

### **House Bill 417: Gender-Affirming Care and Parental Rights**
1. **Opposition to HB 417**: The bill, which seeks to redefine child abuse to include gender-affirming care for minors, faced strong opposition from medical professionals, mental health counselors, and advocates. They argued that gender-affirming care is essential, evidence-based medical care that improves mental health outcomes and reduces risks of depression, self-harm, and suicide among transgender youth.
   
2. **Medical and Professional Perspectives**: Representatives from organizations like the ACLU and NAMI emphasized that gender-affirming care is supported by major medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association. They highlighted the rigorous, multi-disciplinary process involved in providing such care, which includes parental consent and collaboration with medical professionals.

3. **Parental Rights and Government Overreach**: Parents of transgender children expressed concern that the bill would criminalize them for seeking necessary medical care for their children. They argued that decisions about medical treatment should remain between families and their doctors, not be dictated by the government.

4. **Impact on Transgender Youth**: Testimonies highlighted the high rates of suicide and mental health struggles among transgender youth, particularly when they lack access to supportive care. Speakers stressed that denying gender-affirming care would exacerbate these issues and harm vulnerable children.

5. **Concerns About DCYF**: Representatives from the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) opposed the bill, stating that it would overburden an already strained system and force them to investigate families providing necessary medical care.

6. **Calls to Retain or Kill the Bill**: Many speakers urged the committee to vote the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), arguing that it is unnecessary, harmful, and based on misinformation about gender-affirming care.

### **House Bill 10: Parental Rights and School Transparency**
1. **Parental Rights vs. School Policies**: HB 10 aims to ensure that parents are informed about their children's education, extracurricular activities, and health-related matters, including gender identity and mental health. Proponents argued that parents have the fundamental right to oversee their children's education and well-being.

2. **Concerns About Student Safety**: Opponents of the bill expressed concerns that forcing schools to disclose sensitive information (e.g., LGBTQ+ identity) to parents could endanger transgender and gender non-conforming students, particularly those who might face abuse or rejection at home. They emphasized the importance of schools being safe spaces for students to explore their identities.

3. **Legal and Ethical Issues**: Testimony included arguments that the bill singles out transgender students for different treatment, potentially violating constitutional rights. Concerns were raised about the bill's vague wording and the penalties it imposes on educators, including the potential loss of teaching licenses.

4. **Impact on Teacher-Student Relationships**: Opponents worry that the bill could erode trust between students and teachers, making schools less safe for children who may not feel comfortable sharing sensitive information with their parents.

5. **Parental Opt-Out**: The bill allows parents to opt their children out of sex education and HIV/AIDS instruction, which critics argued limits students' access to vital health information.

### **Other Key Bills and Discussions**
1. **House Bill 185 (Parental Rights and Responsibilities)**: The committee discussed HB 185, which addresses parental rights and responsibilities based on shared parenting and access to a child's records. Concerns were raised about unclear legal terms and the potential for increased conflict in contentious divorces. The committee ultimately voted to retain the bill for further review.

2. **House Bill 583 (Termination of Child Support)**: The committee discussed HB 583, which deals with the termination of child support, focusing on cases where children are in special education programs or other approved state programs. An amendment extending child support for children in special education programs until age 22 passed unanimously.

3. **House Bill 548 (Child Support Arrearages)**: The committee reviewed HB 548, which aims to prevent individuals from being penalized for minor child support arrearages due to rounding errors in payments. The committee voted to pass the amendment and the bill as amended, but further clarification on federal vs. state regulations was requested.

### **Overall Themes and Conclusions**
- **Parental Rights vs. Child Safety**: The meeting highlighted deep divisions over the balance between parental rights and child safety, with particular focus on the rights of transgender youth and the role of schools in supporting vulnerable students.
  
- **Impact on Transgender Youth**: Testimonies from parents, medical professionals, and advocates underscored the life-saving importance of gender-affirming care and the dangers of criminalizing it. Opponents of HB 10 emphasized the potential harm to LGBTQ+ youth by forcing schools to disclose sensitive information to parents.

- **Legal and Ethical Concerns**: Legal experts raised concerns about the constitutionality of the bills, particularly regarding equal protection and parental rights. Ethical considerations were also discussed, particularly in relation to the role of educators and medical professionals in supporting children.

- **Need for Clear Language and Alignment with Existing Laws**: Committee members emphasized the importance of clear language, alignment with existing laws, and consideration of the best interests of children and families in all legislative efforts.

The meeting reflected a contentious debate over parental rights, child safety, and the role of schools and healthcare providers in supporting transgender youth and other vulnerable populations. The outcome of these discussions will have profound implications for education, child welfare, and healthcare in New Hampshire.
