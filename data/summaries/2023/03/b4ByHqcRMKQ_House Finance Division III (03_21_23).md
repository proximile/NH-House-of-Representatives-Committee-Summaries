**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (March 21, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 21, 2023, focused on critical budgetary and policy discussions, primarily centered around Medicaid rate increases, healthcare funding, and other essential services. The committee worked to balance fiscal responsibility with the need to support vulnerable populations and address workforce shortages. Key discussions and decisions included:

### **Medicaid Rate Increases and Budget Allocations**
1. **Rate Adjustments**: The committee agreed on a 3.1% across-the-board rate increase for most Medicaid services, effective January 1, excluding hospitals that voluntarily opted out. This adjustment aimed to address provider shortages and ensure adequate healthcare delivery.
2. **Budget Reallocations**: The committee reduced the appropriation for section 257 from $17 million to $12 million annually, freeing up $5 million per year for other rate increases or services. Discussions also included reallocating funds to address workforce shortages and ensure flexibility in funding between bienniums.
3. **Amendment 1154H**: A significant proposal sought $175 million ($75 million in the first year and $100 million in the second year) to address service gaps and provider shortages, including ambulance services and adult medical day care.

### **Medicaid Expansion and Sunset Clause**
1. **Two-Year Extension**: The committee debated extending Medicaid expansion until December 31, 2025, rather than making it permanent. This two-year sunset clause aimed to allow for future review and adjustments while providing stability for providers.
2. **Provider Concerns**: Providers expressed challenges with short-term funding cycles, particularly in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, which hindered long-term planning and investment in facilities like residential treatment centers.
3. **Contract Procurement**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) raised concerns about the impact of a two-year sunset on Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) contracts, which require longer-term commitments to attract competitive bids.

### **Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Services**
1. **Funding Reductions**: The committee discussed reducing general funds for behavioral health contracts by 60%, from $12.4 million annually, raising concerns about the impact on providers and potential loss of federal matching funds.
2. **CFI Program**: The Choices for Independence (CFI) program saw discussions on maintaining its $15.1 million budget without reductions, despite workforce shortages. The committee also considered reallocating $28.4 million in general funds for developmental disability (DD) services.

### **Child Care and Family Support**
1. **Reimbursement Rates**: Amendments proposed increasing child care reimbursement rates to the 75th percentile based on a two-year-old market rate survey, using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reserve funds to cover the estimated $2.9 million annual cost.
2. **Family Eligibility**: Another amendment aimed to increase family eligibility for child care assistance to 85% of the median income, with an estimated cost of $7 million annually. Discussions included making this change permanent or implementing a sunset clause.
3. **Safety Net**: A third amendment proposed a safety net allowing the department to request TANF funds if the child care budget is depleted, ensuring no waitlist or removal of families from the program.

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB)**: The committee approved an amendment creating a permanent unclassified executive director position for the PDAB, with a budget of $250,000 per year, sunsetting after two years. Voluntary contributions from organizations like AARP and New Futures were also allowed.
2. **Sununu Youth Services Center**: The committee discussed acquiring a full-body scanner for the Sununu Youth Services Center, with an estimated cost of $250,000 to $300,000, covering installation, training, and initial maintenance.
3. **Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Coalitions**: Funding for regional SUD coalitions was reduced from $625,000 to $200,000 per organization to align with budgetary constraints.

### **Process and Collaboration**
1. **Structured Approach**: The committee emphasized a structured approach to rate increases, allowing flexibility for DHHS to implement adjustments effectively. Discussions included phased allocations to enable early implementation where feasible.
2. **Straw Votes**: Straw votes were conducted to confirm support for maintaining the CFI budget, reducing section 257 appropriations, and approving key amendments.
3. **Timing and Deadlines**: The committee worked to finalize amendments and funding structures by Friday, March 24, to meet legislative deadlines. Members acknowledged the complexity of balancing the budget and the need for quick decisions.

### **Overall Budget Concerns**
The committee faced challenges in aligning funding with the governor’s revenue projections, making difficult decisions to prioritize critical programs while managing limited resources. Discussions highlighted the importance of transparency, accountability, and collaboration in ensuring that budget adjustments support essential services without negatively impacting federal funding or state operations.

In summary, the meeting underscored the committee’s efforts to address healthcare, behavioral health, child care, and other critical needs while navigating fiscal constraints. The decisions reflected a balance between fiscal responsibility and the need to support vulnerable populations and essential services.
