### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (03/08/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on March 8, 2023, to discuss and vote on a range of bills and amendments. The meeting covered topics including professional licensing, emergency management, anti-discrimination legislation, and rulemaking processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **Professional Licensing and Certification (HB 655 and Related Bills)**

1. **House Bill 655**:
   - **Amendments**: The bill was split, with repeal portions moved to **House Bill 2**. The remaining provisions aimed to codify the organizational structure of the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** and streamline licensing and disciplinary procedures.
   - **Concerns from Boards**: Professional boards (e.g., Board of Medicine, Board of Nursing, Dental Board) raised concerns about the bill’s impact on their ability to review applications, investigate complaints, and maintain standards. Some boards opposed the bill, while others sought clarifications.
   - **OPLC’s Role**: OPLC representatives explained that the amendment formalizes existing practices, creating a consistent framework for licensing and disciplinary processes. They emphasized that most boards already delegate licensing authority to OPLC.
   - **Public and Practitioner Impact**: Legislators expressed concerns about the rushed process and potential disruption to practitioners and the public, calling for thorough stakeholder input.
   - **Outcome**: The committee recommended the amendment to HB 655 and planned further discussion on repeal portions in a Friday work session.

2. **House Bill 644**:
   - The bill addressed licensing requirements for low-risk beauty services (e.g., shampooing, eyebrow threading). The motion to pass the bill failed on a tie vote, and the committee voted to retain it for further review.

3. **House Bill 507**:
   - The bill aimed to strengthen occupational licensing compliance. A motion to pass failed on a tie vote, and a subsequent motion to inexpedient to legislate (ITL) also failed, leaving the bill with no recommendation.

#### **Emergency Management and Response (HB 127 and HB 84)**

1. **House Bill 127**:
   - **Current Law vs. HB 127**: Under current law, the governor can declare and renew a state of emergency indefinitely without legislative approval. HB 127 proposes a 21-day initial declaration, renewable three times (totaling 84 days), after which the legislature must vote to extend it.
   - **Constitutional Concerns**: Supporters argued that prolonged emergency powers infringe on the separation of powers, while opponents worried about delays in emergency response.
   - **Outcome**: The committee moved to pass the bill (OTP), emphasizing the need for legislative oversight after 84 days.

2. **House Bill 84**:
   - The bill proposed creating a **Municipal Emergency Response Team** to assist towns during natural disasters, inspired by the slow response to flooding in Acworth in 2021. Representative Amir moved to ITL the bill, arguing that existing structures were sufficient. The motion passed.

#### **Anti-Discrimination and State Investments (HB 339)**

1. **House Bill 339**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill prohibits the state from contracting with or investing in companies participating in the **Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)** movement against Israel.
   - **Arguments in Favor**:
     - Protects New Hampshire’s trade relationship with Israel and aligns with anti-discrimination principles.
     - Ensures fiduciary responsibility by prioritizing returns over political considerations.
   - **Arguments Against**:
     - Interferes with investment strategies and sets a precedent for political interference in financial decisions.
     - Suppresses free speech, as boycotts are a form of protected political expression.
   - **Legal Considerations**: Proponents cited court rulings that economic boycotts are not protected speech, while opponents referenced historical uses of boycotts for social justice.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted to ITL the bill, citing concerns about political agendas influencing state investments.
