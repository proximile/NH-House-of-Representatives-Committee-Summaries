The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on March 6, 2023, addressed a range of critical issues, including the use of federal ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funds, personnel and compensation reforms, and the replacement of the Sununu Youth Services Center. The discussions underscored the complexities of managing state finances, legal compliance, and operational efficiency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered across the three segments:

### **ARPA Funds and Facility Construction/Renovation**
1. **ARPA Funds Usage**: The committee debated the legality and appropriateness of using ARPA funds for the construction of a new juvenile facility, as opposed to a jail, which is explicitly prohibited. Uncertainty about the legality of this use prompted requests for clarity from the Attorney General. Concerns were raised about potential lawsuits, citing a case in Maine where ARPA funds were challenged for similar purposes.
2. **Amendments and Funding**: Multiple amendments (e.g., 0738, 0757) were discussed to address funding and operational details for the juvenile facility. The committee considered whether to proceed with a comprehensive bill or break it into sections for separate voting. The deadline for ARPA fund usage (December 2025) allowed time for thorough review and public input.
3. **Financial Appropriations**: The committee discussed appropriating $21.6 million for the replacement of the Sununu Youth Services Center, based on estimates from the Department of Public Works. There was debate about whether to allocate this funding in the current budget or the next biennium budget, with concerns about potential double-counting of funds.

### **Personnel and Compensation Reforms**
1. **Governance and Collective Bargaining**: The state has 14 unions, up from two historically, and a tentative collective bargaining agreement includes a 10% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) followed by a 2% increase. The legislatureâ€™s role in funding these agreements was clarified, emphasizing that while they cannot alter contracts, they can choose to fund or not fund them.
2. **Job Classification System**: The state is transitioning from 1,400 job classifications to 200, grouped into 22 major occupational categories. This reform aims to simplify and standardize the system, making it easier to manage.
3. **Recruitment and Retention**: The state is facing challenges in attracting and retaining talent, particularly in 24/7 facilities like corrections and healthcare. Initiatives include eliminating degree requirements as barriers to employment, enhancing online recruitment, and offering ARPA-funded retention incentives. High turnover rates were noted, with fewer than 50% of employees reaching their 10th anniversary.

### **Sununu Youth Services Center Replacement**
1. **Operational Costs**: The current facility incurs significant expenses for utilities and overtime due to staffing shortages. The new facility is expected to reduce operational costs through a co-located model, sharing services with nearby hospitals, and reducing the size of the campus.
2. **Facility Design**: The new facility will shift from an incarceration model to a trauma-informed, mental health-focused approach. Design options include a 6-12 bed facility or an 18-bed facility with staffing for 12.
3. **Union and Salary Issues**: Challenges with converting hourly positions to salaried ones were discussed, given the unionized nature of state employees. Implementing merit-based pay increases within the current union framework was also highlighted as a difficulty.
4. **Historical Context**: Previous legislative efforts, such as SB1, which detailed plans for the replacement, were referenced. However, these plans were not fully adopted by the House.

### **Procedural and Coordination Efforts**
1. **Transparency and Public Input**: The committee emphasized the importance of transparency, suggesting that documents be posted for public review before final decisions are made. A public hearing on a non-germane amendment addressing broader policy issues related to the Sununu Center was planned.
2. **Coordination with Other Committees**: There was discussion about involving other committees, such as Criminal and Family Law, to address policy changes related to the facility, rather than overloading the Finance Committee with non-germane amendments.
3. **Next Steps**: The committee decided to postpone a straw vote until all amendments could be reviewed together. Representatives were encouraged to work with the Office of Legislative Services (OLS) to create a unified document for clearer comparison and decision-making.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the challenges of using federal funds for state projects, modernizing personnel systems, and ensuring the financial and operational viability of critical facilities like the Sununu Youth Services Center. The discussions emphasized the need for legal clarity, transparency, and coordinated efforts across committees to address these complex issues effectively.
