---

#### **1. Transition to New Refrigerants**
The meeting began with a focus on the transition to new refrigerants, emphasizing safety, cost, and implementation timelines. Key points included:

- **Transition Plan**: The need for a safe and smooth transition to new refrigerants, ensuring compliance with safety standards. The cost of refrigerant was noted to be minimal, typically 1% of the total cost of new equipment.
- **New Refrigerants**: Multiple classes of new refrigerants are entering the market, many manufactured in the U.S.
- **Implementation Timeline**: Urgency to implement the transition within 60 days rather than waiting until July 1, 2024, to allow manufacturers sufficient lead time to adjust supply chains.
- **Potential Shortages**: Concerns about equipment and refrigerant shortages in New Hampshire if the transition plan is not approved.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Discussion on aligning with federal regulations, including adopting a later version of the federal standard to list all refrigerants.
- **Fire Marshal and Building Code Review**: Involvement of the Fire Marshal and Building Code Review Board to address concerns and ensure the transition does not impede progress.
