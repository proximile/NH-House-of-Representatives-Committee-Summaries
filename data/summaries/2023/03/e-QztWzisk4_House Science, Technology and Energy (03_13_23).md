### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (March 13, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on March 13, 2023, to discuss several key bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 609 (HB 609)** and **House Bill 142 (HB 142)**. The meeting also addressed other bills, including **HB 556**, **HB 257**, and **HB 139**, with extensive debates, public testimony, and amendments. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **House Bill 609: Restructuring the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)**

**Objective and Proposed Changes**  
HB 609 aims to streamline the energy facility siting process by restructuring the **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)**, transferring some responsibilities to the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**, and introducing public members to the PUC. The bill seeks to address inefficiencies in the SEC process, such as delays in project approvals and difficulties achieving quorums. An extensive amendment (2023-0931h) was under review, which proposed significant changes, including:
- **Public Members**: A pool of five public members appointed by the governor, with two participating in each proceeding.
- **Application Fees**: Simplified and revised fees, with adjustments capped at 5%.
- **Public Counsel**: Optional appointment of an Assistant Attorney General to represent the public in proceedings.
- **Transition Rules**: Existing SEC rules remain in effect until amended or replaced through a formal rule-making process.

**Key Concerns and Debates**  
1. **Public Input and Transparency**:  
   - Critics argued that HB 609 reduces public participation and oversight, shifting authority to agencies like the PUC and the **Department of Energy (DOE)**, which operate with less transparency.  
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of public access to the proposed amendment, raising questions about transparency.

2. **Efficiency vs. Oversight**:  
   - Supporters, including **Mark Sanborn** (Assistant Commissioner, NH Department of Environmental Services), emphasized that the bill would streamline the process and attract renewable energy projects.  
   - Opponents, such as **Neil Kirk** (former representative) and **Timothy Duggan** (Thornton resident), warned that the bill could lead to rushed or inadequate reviews, undermining environmental and public health protections.

3. **Northern Pass Legacy**:  
   - Some speakers, including **Fred Ward** (Stoddard resident), expressed fears that the bill could revive controversial projects like the **Northern Pass**, which was blocked by the SEC after extensive public opposition.

4. **Fiscal Note and Funding**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of a fiscal note, making it difficult to assess the financial impact of the bill. The Department of Energy committed to providing an estimate by the following morning.

**Outcome**  
The committee voted **20-0 to retain HB 609**, meaning it will be revisited later in the legislative session. The committee agreed to hold full committee work sessions to refine the bill, with sessions likely starting in September or October.

#### **House Bill 142: Burgess Biopower and Biomass Energy**

**Objective and Proposed Changes**  
HB 142 addresses the financial challenges of the **Burgess Biopower plant** in Berlin, NH, which has accrued over $150 million in over-market costs under its **Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)**. The bill includes an amendment (0939H) that forgives $100 million of the debt but requires the company to handle future accruals under the PPA terms.

**Key Concerns and Debates**  
1. **Financial Sustainability**:  
   - Critics questioned the plant’s long-term viability and expressed frustration with repeated bailouts.  
   - **Meredith Hatfield** (The Nature Conservancy) opposed forgiving $50 million of the debt, advocating instead for ratepayers to recover the funds.

2. **Economic and Environmental Impacts**:  
   - Supporters, including **Jason Stock** (New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association), emphasized the plant’s importance for Berlin’s economy, forest health, and the wood industry.  
   - The biomass plant provides a critical market for low-grade wood, supports logging capacity, and offers energy diversity, acting as a hedge against natural gas price volatility.

**Outcome**  
The amendment passed **18-2**, and the bill was approved as amended by the same margin.

#### **Other Bills Discussed**

1. **House Bill 556 (IT Council and AI Ethics)**:  
   - The bill directed the Information Technology Council to consider open-source software and advise on AI ethics for state agencies.  
   - Concerns were raised about the compatibility and security of open-source software and the rapid pace of AI development.  
   - The committee voted **20-0 to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL)**.

2. **House Bill 257 (Amendment 0924H)**:  
   - The bill was amended to clarify language and adjust certain provisions, including a 30-day advance warning requirement.  
   - The subcommittee unanimously agreed on the changes, and the bill passed **20-0 as amended**.

3. **House Bill 139 (Shared Electrical Generation)**:  
   - The bill aimed to allow neighboring municipalities to share electrical generation requirements, but disagreements arose over extending this ability to housing authorities and quasi-public entities.  
   - A motion to ITL the bill resulted in a **10-10 tie**, so the bill will proceed to the House floor without recommendation.

#### **Key Themes and Next Steps**

1. **Efficiency vs. Public Participation**:  
   - The discussions highlighted a divide between those prioritizing efficiency in energy project approvals and those advocating for robust public participation and oversight.

2. **Economic and Environmental Balance**:  
   - The debates underscored the complexity of balancing energy policy, economic interests, and environmental sustainability, particularly in rural communities.

3. **Transparency and Fiscal Responsibility**:  
   - Concerns about transparency, fiscal notes, and funding mechanisms were recurring themes, with calls for greater clarity and accountability.

4. **Future Work Sessions**:  
   - The committee planned to hold multiple full committee work sessions to refine HB 609 and address unresolved issues, including quorum definitions, public counsel roles, and fiscal notes.

### Conclusion  
The meeting highlighted the challenges of modernizing energy policy while ensuring public input, economic benefits, and environmental protections. The committee’s decisions to retain HB 609 and amend HB 142 reflect ongoing efforts to balance these competing priorities, with further work sessions planned to address the complexities of the proposed changes.
