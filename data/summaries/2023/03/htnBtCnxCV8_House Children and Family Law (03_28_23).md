### **Key Legislative Initiatives**

1. **Senate Bill 179: Eliminating the Use of Seclusion as Punishment or Discipline**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prohibit the use of seclusion (involuntary solitary confinement) as a form of punishment or discipline in schools and treatment facilities, particularly for children with disabilities or trauma histories.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Seclusion is **traumatizing and disproportionately affects children with disabilities and children of color**.  
     - The bill promotes **therapeutic alternatives** like co-regulation and Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) to address behavioral issues proactively.  
     - Testimonies highlighted the psychological harm caused by seclusion, with parents sharing personal stories of its negative impact on their children’s mental health and education.  
     - The bill clarifies that seclusion should **only be used in emergencies** to ensure safety, not as a disciplinary measure.  
     - The **Office of the Child Advocate** and other stakeholders supported the bill, emphasizing its alignment with trauma-informed care principles.  

2. **Senate Bill 206: Prohibiting Corporal Punishment in Child Daycare Agencies**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to close a legal loophole that allows daycare workers to use corporal punishment on children without consequences.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill expands the definition of endangerment to include corporal punishment, classifying it as abuse under childcare regulations.  
     - Testimonies included a parent’s account of her 3-year-old son being subjected to corporal punishment at a daycare facility, with no legal recourse available.  
     - The bill received **unanimous support** from the committee, reflecting a commitment to protecting children from abuse in childcare settings.  

3. **Senate Bill 172: Expanding TANF Benefits to Fictive Kin Caregivers**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill allows non-related legal guardians (fictive kin) to receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits, similar to biological relatives.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Guardians shared testimonies about the financial challenges of raising children not biologically related to them, emphasizing the need for support.  
     - The bill aims to **strengthen kinship care** and reduce barriers for caregivers, preventing children from entering the foster care system.  
     - It uses **federal TANF funds**, ensuring no impact on the state’s general fund.  
     - The committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill for passage.  

4. **Senate Bill 43: Clarifying Needs Assessments for Juvenile Minors**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill streamlines the needs assessment process for New Hampshire juvenile minors, excluding out-of-state children.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - It emphasizes the effectiveness of diversion programs in addressing underlying issues like trauma and mental health, keeping children out of the criminal justice system.  
     - The goal is to ensure assessments are conducted efficiently without creating backlogs.

### **Judicial System Challenges and Processes**

1. **Judicial Workload and Caseload Management**  
   - **Key Challenges**:  
     - A **weighted caseload study** identified a need for 17.32 additional judges to manage the current workload, particularly in the Family Division.  
     - Judges are overburdened, often working nights and weekends to handle cases.  
     - **COVID-19** exacerbated staffing shortages, with court staff vacancies remaining high due to non-competitive wages.  
   - **Case Prioritization**:  
     - Cases involving child abuse, neglect, and juvenile delinquency are prioritized, while divorce and parenting cases without statutory deadlines face delays.  
     - Judges use **suasponte hearings** to keep cases moving when there is a lack of activity.  

2. **Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution**  
   - Mediation is highly encouraged in family law cases, particularly for parenting disputes, as it reduces the need for court intervention.  
   - **Guardians ad Litem** (GALs) are used less frequently due to cost and the emphasis on mediation, though they remain available for complex cases.  

3. **Judicial Training and Evaluation**  
   - Judges receive ongoing training, though resources are limited.  
   - Judicial evaluations are conducted every three years using an electronic survey system, with results shared with the governor’s office and the legislature.  

4. **Rules of Evidence in Family Court**  
   - The Family Division operates with flexibility in applying the Rules of Evidence, making the process more accessible for **self-represented litigants**, who constitute a significant portion of cases.

- **Judicial Efficiency and Resource Needs**: The judicial branch faces significant challenges due to **staffing shortages** and **high caseloads**, particularly in the Family Division. Efforts to improve efficiency include prioritizing cases, encouraging mediation, and requesting additional judges and staff.
