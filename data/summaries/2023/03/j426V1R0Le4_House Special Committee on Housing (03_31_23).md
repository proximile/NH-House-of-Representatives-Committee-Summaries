**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Housing Meeting (03/31/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing convened on March 31, 2023, to address the state’s growing housing crisis, focusing on affordability, density, regulatory challenges, and potential legislative solutions. The meeting featured presentations from local officials, scholars, and housing experts, who discussed the root causes of the housing shortage, the impact of zoning regulations, and strategies to increase housing supply and affordability. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **1. The Housing Crisis in New Hampshire**
New Hampshire faces a severe housing affordability crisis driven by several factors:
- **Influx of Residents**: The state has seen an influx of people from neighboring states like Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut, increasing demand and driving up housing prices.
- **Limited Housing Supply**: The state’s housing stock is growing at only two-thirds of the national rate, exacerbating affordability issues.
- **Challenges for Locals**: Young people and long-time residents struggle to afford homes, and the strong housing market has led to smaller, affordable units being upgraded and sold at higher prices.

---

### **2. Zoning and Regulatory Barriers**
Zoning regulations and local control over development were identified as significant barriers to housing production:
- **Restrictive Zoning**: Only 16% of buildable land in New Hampshire is available for small-lot single-family homes, and two-family homes are the most restricted housing type, with 70 jurisdictions prohibiting duplexes entirely.
- **Lot Size Minimums**: Large lot size requirements limit the availability of starter homes and increase land costs.
- **Parking Requirements**: Excessive parking minimums consume land that could be used for housing.
- **Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**: Many municipalities impose restrictive requirements on ADUs, such as mandatory parking spaces or lengthy approval processes.
- **Historical Development Patterns**: Zoning codes often conflict with historical development patterns, particularly in older New England towns.

### **3. Legislative Solutions and State-Level Action**
The committee explored various legislative solutions to address housing affordability:
- **State Preemption**: Scholars from the Mercatus Center argued for state-level intervention to preempt overly restrictive local zoning regulations, citing property rights, fairness, and statewide housing needs as justifications.
- **Streamlining Permitting**: Simplifying permitting processes and reducing bureaucratic barriers could encourage development.
- **Fiscal Policy**: Aligning fiscal incentives to support housing production, such as reducing impact fees or offering tax incentives for affordable housing.
- **Zoning Reforms**: Legalizing ADUs, reducing lot size minimums, and allowing higher-density housing like duplexes and fourplexes were highlighted as effective reforms.
- **Transfer of Development Rights**: Programs like Dover’s transfer of development rights encourage density in certain areas while preserving open space.

### **4. Local Success Stories: Dover, NH**
Christopher Parker, Deputy City Manager of Dover, shared the city’s approach to housing affordability:
- **Legislative Changes**: Dover implemented ADU regulations, transfer of development rights, and incentives for smaller, deed-restricted units.
- **The “Five L’s” of Housing Costs**: Parker identified land, lumber, labor, lending, and legislative factors as drivers of housing costs, with legislative changes being the most cost-effective solution.
- **HUD Fair Market Restrictions**: Dover introduced a program allowing developers to build units restricted to HUD fair market values in exchange for reduced development costs, leading to successful projects like The Cottages.
- **Infrastructure Challenges**: Increased density has stressed water and sewer infrastructure, but Dover has maintained impact fees and upfront cost estimates for developers to fund necessary upgrades.

### **5. The New Hampshire Zoning Atlas**
The committee introduced the **New Hampshire Zoning Atlas**, a collaborative project to catalog and analyze zoning regulations across the state:
- **Findings**: The atlas revealed that only 7.8% of land in the Manchester region is available for development when combining zoning data with building footprint data.
- **Policy Implications**: The atlas is a tool for identifying restrictive zoning practices and advocating for reforms to increase housing supply and affordability.
- **Public Access**: The atlas will be maintained and updated annually, with public input to ensure accuracy.

---

### **6. Broader Housing Reforms and Examples from Other States**
The committee discussed housing reforms in other states as potential models for New Hampshire:
- **Single Staircase Buildings**: States like Washington, Virginia, and California are allowing single staircase buildings with higher fire safety standards to increase density on narrow lots.
- **Bipartisan Support**: States like Arizona, Washington, Colorado, and Montana have made significant strides in zoning reform, with bipartisan support for ADUs, duplexes, and streamlined permitting.
- **Conservation Easements**: Pairing conservation easements with up-zoning in other areas could offset the loss of developable land.

---

### **7. Addressing Homelessness and Economic Growth**
Increasing housing supply is seen as critical to addressing homelessness and supporting economic growth:
- **Homelessness**: Moderating rent increases through increased housing supply can make housing more affordable across income levels.
- **Economic Impact**: Employers, including hospitals, struggle to attract workers due to the lack of affordable housing, highlighting the need for housing solutions to support economic growth.

---

### **8. Next Steps and Legislative Recommendations**
The committee outlined potential next steps to address the housing crisis:
- **Streamlining Permitting**: Revisiting state mandates like ADU and workforce housing laws to reduce barriers to development.
- **Funding Affordable Housing**: Increasing funding for affordable housing initiatives and incentivizing municipalities to encourage development.
- **Public Engagement**: Using the Zoning Atlas to inform public discussions and advocate for zoning reforms.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for creative legislative solutions, increased density, and collaboration with developers to address New Hampshire’s housing affordability crisis. Key takeaways include the importance of state-level action to balance local control with statewide housing needs, the potential of zoning reforms to increase housing supply, and the role of tools like the New Hampshire Zoning Atlas in informing policy changes. The committee plans to continue discussions on legislative solutions to promote more inclusive and flexible zoning practices, ensuring that housing becomes more affordable and accessible for all residents.
