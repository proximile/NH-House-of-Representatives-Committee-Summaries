**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (March 1, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 1, 2023, addressed a wide range of bills related to health, human services, and elderly affairs. The discussions centered on workforce development, patient autonomy, reproductive rights, sexual assault victim support, and systemic issues in developmental disability services. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

---

### **Workforce Development in Healthcare**
1. **House Bill 215**:  
   - **Purpose**: Allows the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to adopt rules permitting licensed nursing assistants (LNAs) who complete additional training to pass medications to participate in a tuition reimbursement program under the State Medicaid plan.  
   - **Discussion**: Representative Mark Pearson, the prime sponsor, emphasized the bill’s potential to address workforce shortages in long-term care facilities by encouraging LNAs to expand their skills and reduce the burden on higher-trained staff. The program’s estimated cost is $20,000, supporting 100 individuals. DHHS and the New Hampshire Association of Counties supported the bill, though funding would need to be addressed separately.

2. **House Bill 136**:  
   - **Purpose**: Requires DHHS to bring final proposed rules related to the prescription drug monitoring program before a multi-disciplinary advisory council for a roll-call vote, with the outcome presented to the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR).  
   - **Discussion**: Representative Erica Leon presented the bill, which aims to increase transparency and collaboration in the rulemaking process. DHHS representatives testified that they could operate under the new requirements.

### **Sexual Assault Victim Support**
3. **House Bill 378**:  
   - **Purpose**: Mandates healthcare providers to inform and offer toxicology tests to sexual assault victims, regardless of whether a sexual assault evidence collection kit (rape kit) is warranted.  
   - **Discussion**: The bill sparked significant debate. Supporters argued it empowers victims by giving them access to resources, especially in cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault. Opponents, including healthcare providers and law enforcement, raised concerns about logistical challenges, unintended legal consequences, and the strain on forensic labs. Police Chief Alex Lee supported the intent but opposed the specific language, emphasizing the need for case-by-case evidence collection. The committee will weigh these perspectives to determine the bill’s future.

### **Patient Autonomy and Reproductive Rights**
4. **House Bill 277**:  
   - **Purpose**: Ensures medical freedom and autonomy for individuals aged 18 and older, particularly regarding elective surgeries and reproductive health decisions.  
   - **Discussion**: Testimonies highlighted systemic issues in the medical community, where women seeking sterilization for medical reasons often face dismissal or denial based on assumptions about future reproductive desires. Representative Ellen Reed shared her personal struggle with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the challenges she faced in obtaining a hysterectomy. The bill includes provisions to prevent doctors from denying medically necessary sterilization based on perceived future reproductive desires, while allowing referrals to other providers for voluntary procedures. Legal protections were also included to shield doctors from liability when performing sterilization with informed consent.

5. **CACR8 (Constitutional Amendment on Birth Control Access)**:  
   - **Purpose**: Explicitly guarantees the right to access birth control in the state constitution.  
   - **Discussion**: Representative Dan Hines, the prime sponsor, emphasized the amendment’s preventative nature, ensuring access to contraceptives cannot be denied in the future. The amendment does not mandate free birth control but safeguards the right to access it. Concerns about unintended consequences, such as funding mandates, were addressed by clarifying that the amendment focuses on access, not provision.

### **Developmental Disability Services**
6. **House Bill 642**:  
   - **Purpose**: Addresses wage caps and outdated legacy budgets in the developmental disability services system.  
   - **Discussion**: The bill seeks to eliminate wage caps for Direct Support Professionals (DSPs), who are often underpaid compared to entry-level jobs, leading to workforce shortages. It also aims to update legacy budgets that haven’t been adjusted since the 1990s, failing to account for inflation and longer lifespans of individuals with disabilities. Stakeholders, including area agency leaders and family members, testified in support, emphasizing the urgent need to modernize the system. Concerns about potential waitlists were addressed by redirecting unspent funds. The bill was presented as a long-overdue solution to systemic issues in the developmental disability services system.

### **Key Themes**
- **Workforce Shortages**: Bills like HB 215 and HB 642 aim to address critical workforce shortages in healthcare and developmental disability services by providing training incentives and competitive wages.  
- **Patient Autonomy**: HB 277 and CACR8 focus on ensuring individuals’ rights to make informed decisions about their bodies, particularly in reproductive health and sterilization.  
- **Victim Support**: HB 378 highlights the importance of empowering sexual assault victims with access to resources while balancing practical and legal considerations.  
- **Systemic Reform**: HB 642 underscores the need to modernize outdated systems and budgets to better serve individuals with disabilities and their caregivers.

The meeting highlighted the legislature’s focus on addressing systemic issues in healthcare, protecting patient autonomy, and supporting vulnerable populations.
