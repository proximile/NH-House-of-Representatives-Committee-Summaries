### **Legislative Discussions and Votes**  
1. **Article 5 Convention Stipend**:  
   The committee debated and passed Amendment 0752H, which eliminated a $100 daily stipend for New Hampshire legislators attending an Article 5 convention. Members argued that existing travel reimbursements made the stipend unnecessary.  

2. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**:  
   HB 430, which proposed requiring one year of public school attendance before accessing EFAs, sparked significant debate. Opponents argued it created barriers for families, while supporters emphasized oversight and fiscal responsibility. After a close 13-12 vote, the bill was retained.  

3. **Retained Bills**:  
   Several bills were moved to be retained as they were included in the state budget. These included:

   - HB 282 (Medicaid expansion for children and pregnant women)  
   - HB 565 (postpartum Medicaid coverage)  
   - HB 614 (kidney cancer study funding)  
   These bills passed with unanimous or near-unanimous votes.  

4. **Education-Related Bills**:  
   The committee reviewed and voted on several education-focused bills, including:  
   - HB 492 (providing education laws to committees)

   - HB 542 (academic research analyst position)  
   Most were retained or passed with minimal opposition.  

5. **Budget-Included Bills**:  
   Bills already incorporated into the budget, such as HB 420 (dual enrollment funding) and HB 571 (cost-of-living adjustments for retirees), were moved to be retained.  

6. **Division III Updates**:  
   Division III presented updates on retained bills like HB 91, HB 282, HB 565, and HB 614, confirming their inclusion in the budget.  

### **Budget Finalization (HB1 and HB2)**  
The committee focused on finalizing the state budget, particularly House Bills HB1 and HB2, with key discussions and decisions including:  

1. **House Bill 2 (HB2) Amendments**:  
   - **New Heights Integrated Eligibility System**: Funding was allocated for an audit to ensure compliance as the system expands.  
   - **Medicaid Funding**: Discussions centered on federal matching funds and significant allocations for Medicaid services. Some funds were moved from HB2 to HB1 for operational clarity.  
   - **County Property Tax Relief**: Funds were allocated to counties to reduce property tax burdens.  
   - **Food Protection**: Funding was approved for overtime pay during summer months to ensure food safety.  
   - **Home Visiting Program**: Funds from a defunct nutrition program were reallocated to support maternal and infant home visiting services.  

2. **System of Care Funding**:  
   A contentious debate arose over funding for the system of care for children in residential facilities. The committee approved a 60% funding increase, acknowledging it was insufficient but necessary due to budget constraints.  

3. **Ambulance Services**:  
   A technical issue with ambulance service funding was addressed by adding flexibility for the Department to implement rate increases when sufficient funds are available.  

4. **Other Funding Allocations**:  
   - **New Hampshire Hospital PPE**: Additional funds were approved for increased PPE usage.  
   - **Hampstead Hospital**: A $4.4 million allocation was approved to support the state-owned hospital.

### **Future Plans**

Additionally, a meet-and-greet event with the Community College System of New Hampshire was announced for March 28th.  

### **Key Themes**  
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to balancing competing priorities within the state’s financial constraints. Efforts were made to streamline processes, ensure oversight, and allocate resources to essential services while addressing operational and technical challenges. Most bills and amendments were retained or passed with broad support, reflecting a focus on fiscal responsibility and critical state needs.
