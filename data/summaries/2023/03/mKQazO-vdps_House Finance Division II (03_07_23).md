The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 7, 2023, focused on a wide range of education-related bills, with discussions centering on funding, equity, accountability, and the provision of essential services for students. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points and themes discussed across all segments:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Special Education and Mental Health Services**:
   - **House Bill 521**: This bill addresses the funding for children with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) requiring residential treatment for behavioral health issues. Currently, local school districts bear the cost for these students, while the state covers those without IEPs. The bill proposes shifting this financial responsibility to the state, estimating an additional $2 million annually. The committee retained the bill for further consideration and potential incorporation into the budget.
   - **House Bill 540**: This bill introduces a weighted funding formula for special education, categorizing students based on the intensity of services needed (e.g., less than 80% of the day, more than 80%, and residential placements). The goal is to better align funding with actual costs and reduce the burden on local districts. The committee retained the bill for further review due to the need for more detailed data.

2. **Education Funding and Equity**:
   - **House Bill 529**: This bill aims to distribute approximately $100 million to school districts with the lowest property tax bases and highest concentrations of low-income families. It replaces a one-time reduction in the statewide education property tax (SWEPT) and uses a sliding scale based on fiscal capacity disparity and free and reduced-price lunch eligibility. The bill includes accountability measures requiring districts receiving over $50,000 to submit usage plans. The committee discussed the need for sustainable funding and the challenges faced by rural districts.
   - **House Bill 272**: This bill proposes increasing per-pupil funding for chartered public schools to $9,000, up from the current $7,300–$7,500 range. The increase aligns with the governor’s proposed adequacy aid boost.

3. **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**:
   - **House Bill 364**: This bill revises the transportation funding formula for CTE programs, which are currently underfunded by approximately $2.2 million. The proposed changes would better reflect actual costs by considering the number of trips and type of vehicle used. The committee unanimously approved a motion to allocate $2.2 million in the budget and adopt the new formula by July 1, 2025.

4. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)**:
   - **House Bill 430**: This bill aims to ensure EFA funds are directed to students currently enrolled in public schools, aligning with the program’s original intent. Exceptions are made for kindergarten and first-grade students.
   - **House Bill 626**: This bill proposes transferring the administration of the EFA program from a private contractor to the New Hampshire Department of Education to improve cost efficiency and oversight. Concerns were raised about the contractor retaining 10% of program funds, which some legislators deemed excessive.

5. **Medicaid Direct Certification for School Meals**:
   - **House Bill 601**: This bill focuses on Medicaid direct certification for school meals, which could increase adequacy funding by $22 million to $42 million in fiscal year 2026. The bill includes an opt-out provision for families, which could impact funding. The committee considered incorporating this into the budget with minimal immediate financial impact.

### **Key Themes and Concerns**

1. **Funding Inequities and Challenges**:
   - Discussions highlighted the significant disparities in education funding, particularly for rural and low-income districts. Legislators emphasized the need for targeted aid to address fiscal capacity disparities and ensure equitable access to resources.
   - Special education funding emerged as a critical issue, with calls for a more structured and weighted approach to better align state support with actual costs.

2. **Accountability and Transparency**:
   - Multiple bills included accountability measures, such as requiring districts to submit detailed plans for how additional funds would be used. Legislators stressed the importance of ensuring that funds are spent effectively and transparently.
   - Concerns were raised about the increasing number of non-teaching staff in schools despite declining enrollments, prompting calls for better resource management and accountability.

3. **Program Administration and Efficiency**:
   - The EFA program’s administration by a private contractor drew scrutiny, with proposals to bring it under state control to reduce costs and improve oversight.
   - The Medicaid direct certification program was seen as a way to streamline access to free and reduced-price meals, though questions remained about implementation costs and family opt-out rates.

4. **Legislative Process and Future Work**:
   - The committee retained several bills for further review, recognizing the need for additional data and refinement before final decisions could be made.
   - Legislators emphasized the importance of aligning education funding with long-term, sustainable strategies, moving away from temporary measures like stabilization grants.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the complexities of education funding in New Hampshire, with a strong focus on equity, accountability, and the need for targeted support for vulnerable student populations. Legislators grappled with the financial implications of various proposals, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decisions and sustainable funding mechanisms. The committee’s discussions reflected a commitment to addressing systemic inequities while ensuring that state funds are used effectively to support all students.
