The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on March 29, 2023, to discuss several key bills and issues related to mental health, healthcare accessibility, veterans' services, and legislative updates. The meeting focused on improving systems, ensuring sustainable funding, and streamlining processes to enhance care and support for vulnerable populations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Mental Health and Crisis Intervention Services (Senate Bill 85)**
The committee prioritized discussions on **Senate Bill 85**, which addresses mental health and crisis intervention services in New Hampshire. Key components of the bill include:
1. **Sustainable Funding for Mental Health Services**: The bill establishes a study commission to identify long-term funding solutions for mental health and crisis intervention programs, particularly the **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**. Current funding, a mix of federal and state sources, is set to expire in 2023, necessitating urgent action.
2. **Elimination of Pre-Authorization Requirements**: The bill removes pre-authorization requirements for behavioral health crises, including substance use disorders, ensuring parity with physical health emergencies and expediting access to care.
3. **Mobile Crisis Teams and Community-Based Care**: Mobile crisis services, provided in settings like homes and schools, are now classified as emergency services, reducing reliance on emergency rooms. However, concerns were raised about incentivizing emergency room use over community-based care.
4. **Testimonies and Personal Stories**: 
   - **Holly Stevens (NAMI NH)** emphasized the critical need for sustainable funding and highlighted the role of mobile crisis teams in diverting individuals from emergency rooms.
   - **Nicole Schief** shared her family’s struggles with her daughter’s mental health, advocating for more mobile crisis units and better access to trauma treatment, which often requires out-of-state placements due to limited local resources.
5. **Insurance and Telehealth**: Discussions explored the role of commercial insurance in covering crisis services and whether telehealth could be a viable funding avenue. The Insurance Department confirmed that community-based mental health crisis services are now included in emergency services, eliminating pre-authorization requirements.
6. **Provider Reimbursement and Staffing Challenges**: Low Medicaid reimbursement rates and high staff turnover in community mental health agencies were identified as significant barriers to accessing care.

### **Healthcare Accessibility and Legislative Updates**
The committee also addressed several other bills aimed at improving healthcare accessibility and streamlining processes:
1. **Senate Bill 35**: Introduced by Senator Cindy Rosenwald, this bill adds two FDA-approved RSV vaccines to the list of vaccines adults can receive in pharmacies, making vaccinations more convenient and cost-effective.
2. **Senate Bill 83**: Introduced by Senator Suzanne Prentice, this bill allows nurse practitioners (APRNs) to sign forms within their scope of practice, eliminating the need for a physician’s signature in many cases. This aims to reduce delays, lower costs, and align New Hampshire law with current practices.
3. **ADA Accommodations and Meeting Accessibility**: The committee discussed accommodating individuals with disabilities by counting virtual attendance as in-person for those requiring ADA accommodations and reimbursing transportation costs for community members attending meetings.

### **Veterans' Healthcare and Mental Health Services (Senate Bill 174)**
The committee focused on **Senate Bill 174**, which seeks to streamline veterans’ access to healthcare and mental health services:
1. **Repeal of Redundant Statutes**: The bill repeals two unfunded statutes (RSA 126-A:81 and 82) deemed unnecessary due to existing collaborative efforts between the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Department of Military Affairs and Veterans Services (DMAVS), and other entities like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and community health centers.
2. **Current Systems and Challenges**: Witnesses highlighted ongoing efforts to address veterans’ needs, including contracts with organizations like Easter Seals and the "Ask the Question" campaign, which trains providers in military culture to ensure culturally competent care. Veterans face similar healthcare access challenges as the general population but have additional resources like VA centers.
3. **Reporting Requirements**: The bill requires DHHS and DMAVS to report to the oversight committee on veterans' access to care.
4. **Unanimous Support**: The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill, agreeing it was a necessary update to existing statutes.

### **Housekeeping Bill (Senate Bill 30)**
The committee briefly discussed **Senate Bill 30**, a housekeeping bill requested by the New Hampshire Council on Developmental Disabilities. The bill updates state statutes to align with federal requirements, allowing for more council members and ensuring at least 60% of the council comprises individuals with developmental disabilities or their guardians.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing critical issues in mental health, healthcare accessibility, and veterans' services. Key themes included the need for sustainable funding, reducing bureaucratic barriers, and ensuring equitable access to care. The committee adjourned with plans to reconvene the following week, emphasizing the urgency of these legislative efforts.
