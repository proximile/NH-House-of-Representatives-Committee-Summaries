The NH House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on March 29, 2023, focused on voting and discussing amendments to two key bills, **HB1a** and **HB2a**, which are part of the state budget process. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Quorum and Procedural Matters**:  
   The meeting began with the acknowledgment of a quorum and a mention of Representative Bean, who was absent due to illness but wished to remain isolated. The committee then resumed its work on the budget.

2. **Voting on Amendments**:  
   - **HB1a Amendment 1244H**: The committee voted to accept the amendment, with a roll call vote resulting in **15 to 10** in favor. The amendment was adopted, and the bill was moved to pass as amended.  
   - **HB2a Amendment 1247H**: Similarly, the committee voted to adopt this amendment, with a **15 to 10** vote in favor. The bill was then moved to pass as amended.

3. **Discussion and Debate**:  
   - **Support for the Budget**: Several representatives, including Representative Leishman, praised the budget for addressing some critical issues like **retirement COLAs (Cost of Living Adjustments)**, **food waste**, **elderly services**, and **state employee pay raises** (a 10% raise in the first year and 2% in the second year, totaling a 12% raise over two years). They also highlighted the inclusion of language to prevent a waiting list for developmental disability (DD) services and the ability for fiscal committees to allocate funds as needed.  
   - **Concerns and Opposition**: Some representatives, like Representative Walnut and Stringham, expressed concerns about unresolved issues, including **Medicaid reimbursement rates**, **education funding formulas**, and **tax-related matters**. They voted against the bills, hoping for further negotiations and improvements in the coming days.  
   - **Bipartisan Efforts**: Representatives acknowledged the bipartisan work done on the budget, with both Republicans and Democrats contributing to the process. However, some felt that certain areas, like Medicaid expansion, should be addressed separately rather than being included in the budget.

4. **Final Votes**:  
   - **HB1a**: Passed as amended with a **14 to 11** vote.  
   - **HB2a**: Passed as amended with a **14 to 11** vote.

5. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee acknowledged the need for further negotiations on unresolved issues before the budget moves to the Senate. Representative Walnut was tasked with writing the Minority Report for both HB1a and HB2a.

6. **Adjournment**:  
   The meeting concluded with thanks to the committee members and an announcement about cake from a community college culinary arts event.

Overall, the meeting highlighted both the progress made on the budget and the ongoing challenges that need to be addressed before final approval.
