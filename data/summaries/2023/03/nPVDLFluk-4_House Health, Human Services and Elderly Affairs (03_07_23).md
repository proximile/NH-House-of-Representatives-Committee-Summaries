   - They highlighted the high rates of suicide and mental health struggles among transgender youth, arguing that restricting access to care would exacerbate these issues.
   - Critics warned that the bill would force healthcare providers to provide negligent care, harm patient trust, and potentially drive medical professionals out of New Hampshire.

   - Transgender individuals and their families shared emotional testimonies about the life-saving impact of gender-affirming care. Parents recounted how access to care allowed their children to thrive emotionally and mentally.
