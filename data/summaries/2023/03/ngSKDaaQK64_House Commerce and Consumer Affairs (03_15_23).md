### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (03/15/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on March 15, 2023, to discuss several bills related to healthcare, insurance, and digital currency. The meeting highlighted confusion over legislative language, concerns about patient safety, and debates over the implications of digital currencies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Healthcare Bills: Confusion, Patient Safety, and Funding Mechanisms**

1. **House Bill 130**:
   - **Objective**: The bill initially aimed to repeal a specific commission but was amended to address concerns about its funding mechanism and penalties.
   - **Key Concerns**: Gel Carr raised issues about the appropriateness of the commission’s current funding structure. The amendment does not repeal the commission but modifies its funding to address these concerns.
   - **Outcome**: The bill advanced past the committee stage and will move to the Senate for further review. Senator Donna Soucy, the sponsor of the original commission, is expected to work on it in the Senate. There was debate about whether the amendment negated previous changes and whether the bill should be retained or moved forward. Some members expressed hesitation about repealing the commission entirely.

2. **House Bill 513**:
   - **Objective**: This bill focuses on reimbursement rates for medical treatments, particularly cancer treatments and infusions, and aims to align payments with pharmacy benefits rather than medical benefits.
   - **Key Concerns**:
     - **Brown Bagging and White Bagging**: The bill addressed the delivery methods of specialty drugs, including "brown bagging" (patients receiving medications at home and bringing them to providers) and "white bagging" (medications delivered directly to clinics). Concerns were raised about patient safety, medication storage, and delivery logistics.
     - **Unintended Consequences**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Hospital Association testified that the bill could lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for patients and issues with rate-setting.
     - **Legislative Clarity**: Many representatives expressed confusion about the bill’s language and intent, particularly regarding provisions that reflected existing practices. Suggestions were made to streamline the bill by removing redundant sections.
   - **Outcome**: The committee debated whether to retain the bill for further refinement to address concerns about funding, patient safety, and clarity. No final decision was made during this session.

### **Specialty Drug Delivery Methods and Healthcare Bill Language**

- **Delivery Methods**: The committee discussed three methods of delivering specialty drugs:
  1. **Buy-and-Bill**: The most expensive method, where healthcare providers purchase and administer medications.
  2. **White Bagging**: Medications are delivered directly to clinics.
  3. **Brown Bagging**: Medications are delivered to patients, who bring them to providers.
- **Legislative Challenges**: Representatives expressed frustration over the complexity and confusion surrounding healthcare bills, particularly regarding the language around "brown bagging" and "white bagging." Concerns were raised about patient safety, timely delivery, and the clarity of reimbursement policies. One bill was deemed not ready for "prime time" due to its unclear language and potential unintended consequences.

### **Digital Currency and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)**

1. **House Bill 584 (UCC Article 12)**:
   - **Objective**: The bill aimed to update the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to address digital assets and currencies.
   - **Key Concerns**:
     - A contentious amendment was proposed to remove a section defining "money" that could include digital currencies issued by intergovernmental organizations or agreements between countries.
     - Some representatives opposed the inclusion of digital currencies, citing concerns about undermining the U.S. dollar and Congressional control over the money supply.
   - **Outcome**: The amendment passed, but the bill was moved to the regular calendar due to a lack of unanimous consent.

2. **Debate on Digital Currency**:
   - The discussion highlighted concerns about the implications of digital currencies, including private currencies and central bank digital currencies, on monetary sovereignty. Some representatives opposed any recognition of digital currencies outside the U.S. dollar.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Funding Mechanisms**: Both HB 130 and HB 513 raised concerns about funding structures and their appropriateness.
- **Patient Safety**: Discussions around HB 513 emphasized the potential risks of brown bagging and white bagging, including medication errors and improper storage.
- **Legislative Clarity**: Representatives and stakeholders expressed confusion about the language and intent of the bills, particularly HB 513, and called for clearer drafting.
- **Partisan Concerns**: There were hints of partisan divides, particularly around whether to retain or move forward with certain bills.

### **Overall Outcome**

The committee debated whether to retain or advance the bills, with some members advocating for further refinement to address concerns about funding, patient safety, and clarity. No final decisions were made on key bills like HB 513 and HB 584, and further discussions were expected. The meeting underscored the challenges of addressing complex issues like healthcare reimbursement and digital currency regulation while ensuring legislative clarity and safeguarding public interests.
