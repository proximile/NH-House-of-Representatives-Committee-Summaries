**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (03/15/23):**

The meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee on March 15, 2023, featured discussions on several key bills, with a focus on funding mechanisms, patient safety, and the regulation of digital assets. The session began with a brief and somewhat fragmented exchange, during which the speaker indicated that a Commerce bill would be the only item on the regular calendar and noted that the session was concluding. The speaker also referenced a motion and expressed disapproval of an older version of the bill, though the dialogue was repetitive and unclear, suggesting an informal or partial discussion.

The committee then delved into detailed deliberations on three significant bills:

1. **House Bill 130**: Originally intended to repeal a commission, the bill was amended to address funding mechanisms and penalties. Concerns were raised about the proposed funding approach, prompting a debate over whether to retain the bill for further review or pass it with amendments. The committee ultimately voted to retain the bill, allowing the Senate to address the funding concerns.

2. **House Bill 513**: This bill focused on the reimbursement of specialty drugs and addressed the practices of "brown bagging" (patients receiving medication at home and bringing it to a hospital) and "white bagging" (medication sent directly to the hospital). Committee members discussed issues related to patient safety, cost transparency, and the clarity of the bill's language. After thorough deliberation, the committee voted to retain the bill for further refinement.

3. **House Bill 584**: This bill sought to amend the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) concerning digital assets. A particularly contentious provision defined "money" to include digital currencies issued by intergovernmental organizations. An amendment was proposed to remove this provision, which the committee approved. The bill was then passed as amended, though it was moved to the regular calendar due to opposition from one member.

Throughout the meeting, the committee engaged in thoughtful debates on complex issues, balancing concerns about funding, patient safety, and the evolving landscape of digital assets. Decisions to retain, amend, or pass bills were made based on committee consensus, reflecting a commitment to thorough and collaborative policymaking.
