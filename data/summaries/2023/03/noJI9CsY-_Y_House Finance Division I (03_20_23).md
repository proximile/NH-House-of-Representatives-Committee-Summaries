**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (03/20/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I convened on March 20, 2023, to address a wide range of budgetary, legislative, and fiscal matters. The meeting was marked by detailed discussions, amendments, and decisions aimed at balancing competing priorities while ensuring fiscal responsibility. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **Budgetary Adjustments and Funding Priorities**
1. **Budget Amendments and Non-Controversial Elements**:  
   - The division reviewed and removed certain sections from the budget, focusing on non-controversial items. Specific agencies and recommendations from the Secretary of State’s office were discussed, with an emphasis on streamlining funding for essential services.

2. **Funding Mechanisms and Tax Policy**:  
   - Members debated the economic impact of taxes, particularly the **Interest and Dividends Tax**, which was criticized for discouraging savings and capital formation. A proposal to restore the **Communications Services Tax (CST)** to fund **House Bill 436** was considered, with some members opposing the trade-off between CST and tax cuts.  
   - To offset the CST increase, the Interest and Dividends Tax would be phased out by January 1, 2025, instead of 2027, creating a compromise that funds retirement benefits while delivering a tax cut.

3. **Essential Services and Efficiency**:  
   - Funding priorities included the **Small Business Development Center**, **Human Rights Commission**, and **Judicial Council**, with concerns raised about the cost-effectiveness of contract attorneys versus full-time employees.  
   - The **Department of Justice** requested funding for programs addressing elder scams, including a transportation attorney and a witness specialist program, which received general support.

4. **Consultants and IT Projects**:  
   - The high cost of consultants for IT and other projects was a recurring concern. Members emphasized transitioning to in-house expertise to reduce long-term costs and improve efficiency, particularly in the **Department of Information Technology (DoIT)** and **Liquor Commission**.

### **Legislative and Retirement System Discussions**
1. **House Bill 250**:  
   - This bill, concerning accidental death benefits, was amended to apply to both group one and group two employees, with a cap on total payments at $85,000. The amendment was unanimously approved.

2. **House Bill 436 (Retirement Benefits)**:  
   - The bill addresses retirement benefits for Group 2 (police and fire), proposing significant changes to pension calculations, including reverting to a 2.5% multiplier.  
   - An amendment was introduced to reduce costs by capping pensions at $120,000 without an annual escalator and removing compensation-related provisions. The committee deferred further discussion to allow for more analysis of the bill’s fiscal impact.

3. **Business Finance Authority (BFA)**:  
   - James Wallace, Executive Director of the BFA, requested an increase in the BFA’s contingent credit limit from $115 million to $200 million to support New Hampshire businesses, particularly during crises like COVID-19.  
   - The BFA operates without state taxpayer dollars, relying on fees and reserves. While some members proposed a lower limit of $150 million to account for inflation, the original $200 million proposal was retained after the motion to lower the limit failed.

### **Public Television and State Library Funding**
- **Representative McGuire** proposed an amendment to remove $1 million in funding for **New Hampshire Public Television**, arguing it was an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds. The amendment was modified to restore $250,000 to the **State Library**, bringing its funding to $1 million. The amendment passed, reducing funding for public television while increasing support for the library.

### **Future Meetings and Consensus-Building**
- The division planned to reconvene the next day at 9:30 AM to continue discussions on pending bills and retirement-related issues. Throughout the meeting, members stressed the need for consensus and compromise to pass a balanced budget, emphasizing strategic trade-offs to address critical needs while ensuring fiscal responsibility.
