The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 8, 2023, covered a wide range of legislative, ethical, and procedural discussions across multiple segments. The meeting emphasized thorough deliberation, ethical standards, and collaborative decision-making. Below is a cohesive summary combining all four segments:

### **Legislative and Ethical Discussions**

1. **Work Sessions and Ethics Participation**:  
   Members debated the structure of work sessions, considering full committee or subcommittee formats. There was an option to involve the Ethics Committee in these sessions to ensure ethical considerations were addressed.

2. **House Bill 157 (HB 157)**:  
   The Ethics Committee decided not to take a policy position on HB 157, which deals with harassment jurisdiction, and opted to retain the bill for further discussion.

3. **Recall Elections (CACR3)**:  
   The committee voted "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) on CACR3, which proposed enabling legislation for recall elections. Members argued that New Hampshire's existing election process is sufficiently responsive, making recall elections unnecessary.

4. **Legislator Compensation (CACR4)**:  
   The committee voted ITL on CACR4, which sought to increase legislators' salaries. Concerns were raised about transforming the legislature from a citizen body to a professional one, as well as the financial implications of such a change.

5. **Collective Bargaining for Legislative Staff (HB 134)**:  
   The committee voted ITL on HB 134, which aimed to establish a collective bargaining agreement for legislative staff. Members opposed the bill, citing concerns about eliminating individual merit-based rewards and noting that staff did not request such an agreement.

6. **Silver Coin Payment (HB 245)**:  
   The committee voted ITL on HB 245, which proposed paying legislators in silver coins. Members highlighted the impracticality and constitutional issues associated with this payment method.

7. **Self-Governance Resolution (HCR6)**:  
   The committee voted ITL on HCR6, a resolution condemning violence against self-governing individuals. Members felt the resolution was too broad and could inadvertently protect unjustifiable actions.

### **Ethics and Recusal Procedures**

1. **Recusal and Voting Procedures**:  
   Members discussed the logistics of recusal, including how conflicts of interest are recorded and the process for declaring a conflict to avoid voting. Emphasis was placed on ensuring recused members are not called to vote and are marked appropriately in the system.

2. **Ethics Committee’s Role**:  
   The Ethics Committee’s oversight of conflicts of interest was highlighted. Members stressed the need for a more thoughtful decision-making process for recusal, rather than rushed decisions during floor votes.

3. **Historical Context**:  
   Past incidents, such as legislators benefiting financially from legislation, underscored the need for clearer recusal rules. Proposed amendments, including the **Gordon Amendment**, **Sheen Amendment**, and **Nutting-Wong Amendment**, aimed to define conflicts of interest and recusal requirements more precisely.

4. **Scope of Recusal**:  
   The committee debated whether recusal should apply only to legislators and their immediate households or extend to financially dependent individuals outside the household. The consensus leaned toward limiting recusal to household members to avoid overly broad interpretations.

5. **Practical Challenges**:  
   Legislators acknowledged difficulties in implementing recusal rules, such as last-minute decisions during floor votes. Suggestions included creating decision-making tools like laminated guides or decision trees to assist legislators.

6. **Technical Limitations**:  
   The current voting system does not easily accommodate electronic declarations of recusal, requiring physical paperwork. Updating the system would require significant resources.

### **Procedural Matters and Committee Work**

1. **Timing of Actions**:  
   Certain tasks, such as setting up summer retain buildings, were deferred until the budget process was completed.

2. **Committee Work**:  
   There was a suggestion to form a subcommittee to address specific ethics-related issues and return with recommendations. The committee of the whole was noted as effective in handling such work.

3. **Communication and Collaboration**:  
   Members were encouraged to communicate and ask questions as they worked together. Leadership committed to sharing updates on progress.

4. **Senate Bills**:  
   Uncertainty surrounded the assignment of Senate bills to House committees. The speaker’s office acted as a filter, directing bills to appropriate committees, though no direct pipeline existed for certain topics like transportation.

5. **Consent Calendar**:  
   No items were pulled off the consent calendar, indicating the House might not need further action on the floor.

### **Overall Themes**

The meeting highlighted the importance of thorough discussion, ethical standards, and procedural clarity. Members operated in a cooperative and non-partisan manner, emphasizing the need for clear guidelines on conflicts of interest and recusal. The committee focused on refining legislation to ensure it was effective, enforceable, and well-understood, while also addressing practical challenges in the legislative process. The meeting concluded with a commitment to continued collaboration and communication as legislative work progressed.
