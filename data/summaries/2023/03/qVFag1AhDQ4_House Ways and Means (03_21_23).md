**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on March 21, 2023**

On March 21, 2023, the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened to discuss **House Bill 639**, focusing on the legalization, regulation, and taxation of cannabis. The committee aimed to finalize amendments by March 27 to meet legislative deadlines. Key areas of discussion included the tax structure, revenue allocation, market dynamics, regulatory costs, and public health considerations.

### **Taxation Structure and Rate**
The central debate revolved around the **taxation level** (wholesale vs. retail) and the **appropriate tax rate**. Proposals ranged from **8% to 15%**, with arguments for lower rates to **undercut the black market** and remain **competitive with neighboring states** like Maine (16.1%) and Massachusetts (17.7%). Some representatives argued that a 15% wholesale tax might result in a lower effective retail tax (around 4-5%) due to markups, while others advocated for retail taxation to capture the full market value.

The committee also considered **taxing at both levels**, similar to Illinois, which generates equal revenue from cultivator and retail taxes. **Joseph Mullica**, Chairman of the New Hampshire Liquor Commission, suggested taxing at the manufacturing/growing level, with retail prices set by the market, drawing parallels to the state’s liquor model.

### **Market Dynamics and Revenue Concerns**
Discussions highlighted the **volatility of wholesale cannabis prices**, as seen in Michigan, where prices dropped significantly over a short period. The committee explored ways to **generate sufficient revenue** to cover regulatory costs while avoiding overburdening **small growers** and **local farmers**. Comparisons were made to the **craft beer industry**, where small producers thrive by offering unique products.

There was also debate about **vertically integrated businesses**, which grow, manufacture, and sell cannabis internally. The challenge was determining how to apply taxes fairly when products move between different segments of the same company. The bill delegated **rulemaking authority** to the Liquor Commission to address valuation issues.

### **Revenue Allocation**
The committee discussed **allocating cannabis revenue** to key areas such as **education**, **property tax relief**, **public safety**, and **substance abuse prevention and recovery**. There was a focus on reducing the burden of the **"swept tax"** (a property tax used for education funding) and addressing the state’s **unfunded retirement liabilities**. However, some argued that cannabis revenue would have a minimal impact on retirement funding and suggested reallocating those funds to education.

### **Regulatory Costs and Operational Challenges**
Estimates for the **first year of operation** were around **$7 million**, covering costs such as setting up a standalone system for tracking and licensing, hiring inspectors, and ensuring compliance. While ongoing costs were expected to decrease, there were concerns about **initial deficits** as the industry ramps up.

### **Public Health and Safety**
Some representatives proposed **higher taxes on high-THC products** to address **public health concerns**, mirroring Illinois’s approach of taxing cannabis-infused products at 20% and high-THC flower at 25%. There was also support for funding a **public education campaign** about cannabis effects, particularly targeting **youth** and **vulnerable adults**, before sales begin.

### **Interstate Commerce and Future Considerations**
The committee considered the **potential for interstate cannabis sales** in the future and how the tax structure should accommodate this possibility, ensuring New Hampshire can capture revenue from out-of-state products.

### **Amendments and Next Steps**
The committee worked on refining the bill’s language to clarify the tax structure, potentially shifting from a fixed 15% tax to a more flexible approach. Amendments were proposed to address **technical and policy issues**, including changes to the tax rate, revenue allocation, and operational funding. The committee planned to reconvene on March 27 to finalize amendments and continue deliberations.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the **complexities of cannabis legalization**, balancing the need for **revenue generation**, **market competitiveness**, **regulatory clarity**, and **public health considerations**. Representatives sought to craft a tax structure that aligns with market realities while ensuring the state benefits financially from legalized cannabis.
