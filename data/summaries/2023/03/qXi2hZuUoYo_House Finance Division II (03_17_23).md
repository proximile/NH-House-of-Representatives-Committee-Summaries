### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 17, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 17, 2023, focused on critical discussions around **education funding reform**, **school building aid**, and **budgetary allocations**. The deliberations highlighted significant concerns about equity, efficiency, and sustainability in the state’s education and funding systems. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points from the six segments:

---

#### **1. School Building Aid Reform**
- **Current System Issues**: The existing school building aid system was criticized for being slow, inequitable, and inefficient. Only three out of 17 projects on the list have been approved, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars unallocated. The process often takes years, and even approved projects may fail to gain local voter support.
- **Proposed Changes**: A new proposal seeks to decentralize control by allocating $300 per student annually directly to local school districts for capital projects (e.g., new buildings, renovations, repairs). Charter schools would also be included, except for virtual schools like VLACS.
- **Concerns**:
  - **Equity**: Critics argued that the $300 per student formula might disadvantage poorer districts, as it could take decades to accrue sufficient funds for major projects.
  - **Emergency Needs**: Questions arose about how emergencies (e.g., roof repairs) would be addressed under the new system.
  - **Transparency and Control**: Representatives emphasized the need for voter oversight in capital expenditures.
  - **Transition Challenges**: Uncertainty surrounded how projects already in the queue would transition to the new system.
  - **Charter Schools**: Concerns were raised about accountability, especially if charter schools close after receiving funds.
- **Comparative Analysis**: A hypothetical example showed that the current system, which covers 30-60% of project costs upfront, would take 19-38 years to replicate under the proposed formula.
- **Calls for Further Study**: Representatives stressed the need for detailed analysis, modeling, and public input, suggesting the study of systems in other states (e.g., Kentucky, Virginia) and addressing unresolved issues like emergency funding and safety standards.
- **Defense of the Proposal**: Proponents argued that local control would yield better results, moving away from a system that “picks winners and losers” and providing consistent funding to all districts.

#### **2. Education Funding Formula**
- **Governor’s Proposal**: The governor’s plan included increases to base and free/reduced lunch aid, the repeal of third-grade reading funding, and an annual 2% CPI adjustment. It also proposed phasing out stabilization grants over 10 years, replacing them with a hold harmless provision to ensure no district loses funding.
- **Counter-Proposal (Proposal One)**: This alternative suggested reducing the base and free/reduced lunch aid increases and reallocating funds to targeted aid components, such as fiscal capacity disparity aid and extraordinary needs grants. It also proposed a slower phase-out of stabilization grants (5% annually).
- **Targeted Aid**: Both proposals emphasized targeting aid to needier districts based on free/reduced lunch rates, equalized valuation, and a blend of both.
- **Budgetary Constraints**: The committee debated the trade-offs between broad-based funding increases (e.g., base adequacy) and targeted aid, acknowledging the difficulty of balancing the needs of wealthier and poorer districts within the state’s budget constraints.
- **Long-Term Considerations**: Representatives discussed the impact of demographic changes, such as declining student populations, on education funding and capital costs.

#### **3. Equity and Fairness in Funding**
- **Stabilization Grants vs. Hold Harmless**: There was strong support for phasing out stabilization grants, which are based on outdated 2006 data, and replacing them with a hold harmless provision. However, concerns were raised about the timeline for this transition, with some advocating for a faster reduction to avoid perpetuating inequities.
- **Base Adequacy Funding**: Representatives agreed on increasing the base adequacy funding but debated the exact amount. Some suggested further increases to better support schools in needier communities.
- **Medicaid and FNR Data**: The committee discussed using Medicaid data to supplement or replace free/reduced lunch (FNR) data for determining aid, as FNR numbers are currently underreported due to the pandemic.
- **Legal Considerations**: Members acknowledged ongoing litigation regarding constitutional adequacy requirements and stressed the need to ensure the funding formula meets the needs of all districts.

#### **4. Budgetary and Legislative Issues**
- **Surplus and Funding Requests**: The committee reviewed the state’s surplus, noting significant funding requests across divisions that may exceed available resources. They discussed the implications of using the general fund and rainy day fund to cover shortfalls, particularly for education and highway funds.
- **Agency Requests**: Various state agencies presented additional funding requests, many of which were not included in the initial budget. The committee acknowledged that some requests might not be feasible given current financial constraints.
- **Legislative Amendments**: The committee considered amendments related to education funding, including changes to career and technical education programs, computer science initiatives, and civics education.
- **Retirement System**: There was a discussion about moving community college employees hired after January 2024 from the state retirement system to a defined contribution plan, with a request for more information on the financial implications.

#### **5. Long-Term Vision and Next Steps**
- **Sustainability and Equity**: Members emphasized the importance of creating a sustainable and equitable funding system that addresses the needs of all students, regardless of their community’s wealth. There was a focus on moving away from temporary fixes (like stabilization grants) and toward a more permanent solution.
- **Hybrid Proposal**: A hybrid approach was discussed, blending elements of the governor’s plan with other proposals to balance the needs of wealthier and needier districts while addressing the surplus in the Education Trust Fund.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to reconvene for further analysis and discussion, particularly regarding the town-by-town impacts of different funding proposals. The goal was to finalize the budget while ensuring fiscal responsibility and addressing the state’s educational priorities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of reforming New Hampshire’s education funding and building aid systems. While there was broad agreement on the need for greater equity, transparency, and local control, significant challenges remain in balancing competing priorities, addressing budgetary constraints, and ensuring long-term sustainability. The committee’s discussions reflected a commitment to finding a “sweet spot” that increases base funding, targets aid to the neediest communities, and phases out outdated funding mechanisms, all while managing the state’s financial resources responsibly.
