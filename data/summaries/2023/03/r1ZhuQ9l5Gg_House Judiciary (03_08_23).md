The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee met on March 8, 2023, to discuss a range of bills, with a significant focus on reproductive rights, education, and housing. The meeting reflected deep ideological divisions on these issues, particularly around abortion and educator accountability, as well as efforts to balance individual rights with legal and ethical considerations.

### **Reproductive Rights and Abortion:**
The committee debated several abortion-related bills, highlighting the ongoing controversy over reproductive rights in the wake of the *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization* decision. Key discussions included:

1. **Constitutional Amendment (CACR2)**: A proposed amendment to protect reproductive freedom, including contraception, sterilization, and abortion, failed in a tied vote. Proponents argued it would safeguard reproductive autonomy, while opponents worried about leaving decisions to the courts and potential unintended consequences.

2. **House Bill 88**: This bill aimed to codify the right to abortion before 24 weeks but also failed in a tied vote. Supporters emphasized clarity and protection post-*Dobbs*, while opponents questioned its necessity and legal implications.

3. **House Bill 224**: This bill sought to repeal criminal penalties for doctors performing abortions post-24 weeks under the Fetal Life Protection Act. Opponents argued penalties are necessary for enforcement, while proponents feared it would deter medical professionals. The motion to repeal also ended in a tied vote.

4. **House Bill 271**: This bill aimed to repeal the Fetal Life Protection Act entirely, citing its controversial passage in a budget bill without a full policy hearing. It also failed in a tied vote.

5. **House Bill 346 (Born-Alive Infant Protection Act)**: This bill, requiring medical care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion, received broad support and was recommended for consent with an 18-1 vote.

6. **House Bill 562 (Informed Consent for Abortion)**: This bill would require patients to be informed of all options, including adoption, before undergoing an abortion. The committee voted to recommend further study, citing enforcement challenges.

7. **House Bill 591 (Fetal Heartbeat Abortion Ban)**: This bill, which would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected (around 5-6 weeks), was retained for further study despite moral support, as it was unlikely to pass in the current political climate.

### **Education and Educator Accountability:**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 533**, which proposed granting subpoena power to the Department of Education (DOE) to investigate educator misconduct under the educator code of conduct. Key points included:

1. **Support for Subpoena Power**: Proponents, including DOE representatives, argued that subpoena power is necessary to protect children and ensure thorough investigations, particularly in cases of misconduct. They noted that without it, investigations are often hindered by pushback from school districts.

2. **Opposition and Concerns**: Critics, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA) and the ACLU, raised concerns about overreach, lack of safeguards, and potential misuse of subpoena power. They warned it could lead to "fishing expeditions," chilling effects on educators, and exacerbation of the teacher shortage.

3. **Banned Concepts Law**: Some opponents feared subpoena power could be used to enforce the divisive concepts law, which the ACLU is currently challenging in court.

4. **Retention for Further Study**: The committee ultimately voted to retain the bill for further study, acknowledging the need for clearer limitations and safeguards to balance child safety with educator rights.

### **Housing Legislation:**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 261**, which would allow tenants to terminate leases early in cases of domestic violence or disabling illness. While supporters argued it protects vulnerable individuals, opponents, including landlords, raised concerns about financial burdens and the lack of clear evidence for the bill’s necessity. The bill was ultimately voted down after a tied vote.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways:**
1. **Reproductive Rights**: The discussions underscored the deep divisions over abortion legislation, with debates centering on legal clarity, medical ethics, and the balance between protecting life and ensuring reproductive autonomy.

2. **Education Accountability**: The debate over subpoena power for the DOE highlighted tensions between protecting children, ensuring educator accountability, and preventing bureaucratic overreach in a politically charged climate.

3. **Housing Protections**: The housing bill reflected efforts to balance tenant protections with landlord concerns, though the committee ultimately leaned toward caution in implementing new regulations.

4. **Civility and Collaboration**: Despite the contentious nature of the topics, the discussions were noted for their civility and productive engagement, with several bills retained for further study to allow for additional collaboration.

Overall, the meeting showcased the complexity of legislating on highly sensitive issues, with lawmakers grappling with legal, ethical, and practical implications while striving to balance competing interests.
