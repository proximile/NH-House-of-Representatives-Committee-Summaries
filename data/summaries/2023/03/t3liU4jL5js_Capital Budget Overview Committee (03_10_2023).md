The NH House of Representatives Capital Budget Overview Committee meeting on March 10, 2023, chaired by Mark McConkey, began with the nomination and election of committee leadership. Representative McConkey was unanimously elected as chair, Senator Waters as vice chair, and Representative Cloutier as clerk. 

The committee reviewed several agenda items, including:

1. **Capital Budget Overview**: Chris Shea provided an overview of RSA 23002, a compilation of statutes relevant to the committee's work, serving as a resource for understanding potential requests.

2. **Approval of Minutes**: The committee unanimously approved the minutes from the November 28, 2022, meeting.

3. **Ports and Harbors Funding Requests**:
   - **Rye Harbor Fuel Dispensing System Repairs**: Wood Anderson, operations manager for the Port Authority, presented a request to expend $82,000 from the Harbor Dredging and Pier Maintenance Fund for repairs to the recreational dock's fuel system at Rye Harbor. The request was unanimously approved.
   - **Fuel Enclosure Design Plans**: The committee also approved $13,781 for design plans for a fuel enclosure at Rye Harbor to protect the fuel system from weather and environmental damage.

4. **University System of New Hampshire (USNH) Project**:
   - **Hetzel Hall Renovation**: Catherine Provencher and Bill Janelle from USNH presented a $29 million project to renovate Hetzel Hall, a 100-year-old dormitory at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The project, funded through bonds issued by the NH Health and Education Facilities Authority (HEFA), aims to address deferred maintenance, modernize the building, and increase housing capacity. The committee unanimously approved the project.

5. **Informational Items**: The committee reviewed several informational items, including a report from the Department of Administrative Services regarding the Phil Brook Building, which now houses HHS clients.

The meeting concluded with no further business, and the committee adjourned.
