### **Key Topics and Discussions**

1. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**  
   - **HB 515**: This bill proposed minor statutory changes to maintain consistency in the EFA program, which allows families to use state funds for alternative education options. Concerns were raised about transparency, accountability, and potential fraud, with some representatives emphasizing the need for clearer oversight. The committee vote resulted in a tie (10-10), allowing the bill to move forward without a recommendation.  
   - **HB 573**: A bill to cap funding for the EFA program sparked significant debate. Supporters of the cap argued it would introduce fiscal responsibility, while opponents contended it would limit access to a popular program and potentially violate the state’s obligation to provide adequate education. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).  
   - **Local EFAs**: Another discussion centered on allowing local school districts to establish EFAs, requiring a three-fifths supermajority for adoption or repeal. Supporters argued EFAs expand educational choices, particularly for low-income families, while opponents raised concerns about accountability, discrimination, and the use of taxpayer funds for private education.  

2. **Withdrawal from Cooperative School Districts**  
   - **HB 530**: This bill addressed the process for towns or districts to withdraw from cooperative school districts, using Carroll, NH, as an example of challenges with outdated funding formulas. The bill proposed a structured withdrawal process, requiring either a majority vote from the entire cooperative or a three-fifths supermajority from the withdrawing district.  
   - **Debate**: Small districts expressed frustration about being outvoted by larger districts, leading to calls for clearer, step-by-step withdrawal instructions. Concerns were raised about financial obligations, such as bonded debt, and the impact on remaining co-op members. The committee ultimately voted to retain the bill for further study, citing the need for more clarity and input.  

3. **School Meals Program**  
   - **HB 572**: The committee debated expanding eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals to families earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level. Proponents argued that feeding hungry children is essential for their ability to learn, while opponents questioned the financial burden on New Hampshire taxpayers and the expansion of a federal program. Amendments were proposed to clarify funding sources and language.  

4. **School Vaccination Clinics**  
   - A discussion centered on allowing Manchester to decide whether to hold vaccine clinics in schools, emphasizing local control over such decisions. An amendment was proposed to reduce the prohibition period for vaccination clinics from two hours to one hour, providing more flexibility for schools.  

5. **Other Business**  
   - **HB 452**: School building aid was briefly discussed, with no significant developments.  
   - **Weather and Schedule Adjustments**: Due to an impending storm, the committee discussed adjusting the start time for the next meeting to accommodate members traveling from distant areas.  
   - **Lighthearted Notes**: The meeting included brief mentions of March Madness and scholarship news, adding a casual tone to the proceedings.
