**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (March 2, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on March 2, 2023, to discuss proposed legislation and amendments related to the transition from traditional copper landline services to modern broadband and wireless telecommunications technologies. The discussions centered on ensuring equitable access to essential communication services while addressing the challenges of technological advancement, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Key points from the meeting include:

### **Transition from Copper to Fiber and Wireless**
1. **Carrier of Last Resort (COLR) Obligations**:  
   The proposed amendment addresses the "carrier of last resort" obligation, which requires certain providers to offer landline services even in areas with alternative connectivity options (e.g., wireless or broadband). The debate focused on whether phone companies should be relieved of this obligation in areas where sufficient alternatives exist. Legislators emphasized the need to ensure that no one, especially in rural or remote areas, is left without essential phone service during the transition.

2. **Mapping and Criteria**:  
   The amendment relies on a statewide broadband map being developed by the New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs to assess connectivity. The map will determine whether a company can petition to be relieved of COLR obligations, with thresholds set at 95% of households having access to mobile or internet services. Accurate mapping, supported by the Granite State Broadband Mapping Team led by UNH, was highlighted as critical for identifying underserved areas.

3. **Notification and Public Input**:  
   The amendment includes provisions for notifying customers of potential service changes, holding public hearings, and allowing the Department of Energy (DOE) to make final decisions within a specified timeframe. There were calls to modernize public notification methods by incorporating municipal websites alongside traditional newspaper announcements.

4. **Lessons from Maine**:  
   Legislators referenced a similar bill passed in Maine in 2012, which deregulated certain municipalities and emphasized public education about alternative services. The Maine experience underscored the importance of clear communication and the challenges of public engagement during such transitions.

### **Concerns and Challenges**
1. **Equitable Access**:  
   Representatives expressed concerns about ensuring reliable and affordable access to telecommunication services, particularly for vulnerable populations in rural or underserved areas. Issues such as the impact on emergency services, affordability for low-income residents, and the readiness of certain communities for the transition were raised.

2. **Funding and Support**:  
   The DOE clarified that it currently lacks funding to support residents affected by the transition. Legislators called for clearer guidance on how the DOE should evaluate and address these issues, as well as potential fiscal impacts on the department.

### **Technological and Infrastructure Considerations**
1. **Fiber vs. Copper**:  
   The shift from copper to fiber networks was emphasized as a way to future-proof infrastructure and meet modern consumer demands. However, concerns were raised about the cost and logistics of maintaining aging copper networks.

2. **Satellite and Wireless Alternatives**:  
   The conversation touched on the reliability of satellite phones and wireless services as alternatives, particularly in areas with poor landline or cellular coverage. Flexibility in the bill was advocated to allow companies to choose whether to maintain universal service obligations or transition to newer technologies.

### **Legislative Process and Amendments**
1. **Flexibility and Future Considerations**:  
   Some legislators advocated for flexibility in the bill to accommodate future technological advancements and the needs of small telecom providers and unincorporated areas.

2. **Voting and Next Steps**:  
   The committee ultimately voted in favor of passing the bill with amendments, pending further refinement of the proposed changes. Representative Munz was tasked with incorporating feedback and finalizing the amendment for review before the bill moves forward.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of transitioning to modern telecommunications infrastructure while ensuring equitable access for all residents, particularly in rural and underserved areas. The proposed amendment aims to provide a structured process for phasing out outdated infrastructure, safeguarding consumer interests, and addressing the challenges of technological advancement. Legislators emphasized the importance of accurate mapping, public engagement, and flexible policies to balance progress with inclusivity.
