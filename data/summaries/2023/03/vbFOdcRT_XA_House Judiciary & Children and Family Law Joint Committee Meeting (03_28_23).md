The NH House of Representatives Joint Committee meeting on March 28, 2023, convened to address critical issues in the state’s judicial system, particularly focusing on family law, court administration, and resource challenges. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **Judicial System Overview and Resource Challenges**
The New Hampshire judicial system comprises the Circuit Court, Superior Court, and Supreme Court, handling over 126,000, 18,000, and 650 cases annually, respectively. A **weighted caseload study** revealed significant resource gaps, with the Circuit Court requiring 17.32 additional judges and 37 more staff positions, and the Superior Court needing 3.5 additional judges and 12 more staff positions. Staffing shortages are exacerbated by non-competitive wages, with 39 full-time and 3 part-time vacancies out of 359 positions. Entry-level wages of around $15 per hour struggle to attract and retain talent.

### **Family Division Challenges**
The Family Division handles a high volume of cases, with 85% involving at least one self-represented litigant and 30% of Supreme Court appeals originating from this division. **Case delays** are a significant issue, driven by complex financial matters, expert testimony, and judge turnover. Judges often work nights and weekends to manage caseloads, prioritizing cases with statutory deadlines, which can delay others. **Mediation and neutral case evaluation** are strongly encouraged to expedite resolutions and reduce adversarial proceedings.

### **Termination and Transition of Marital Masters**
The committee discussed the **transition of marital masters** (e.g., David Forrest, Barbara, and Phil Cross) into judicial roles following legislative amendments allowing term extensions. This transition was part of the broader creation of the Circuit Court.

### **Juvenile Diversion Programs**
Deputy Administrative Judge Ashley highlighted the success of **juvenile diversion programs**, which have significantly reduced juvenile court cases through pre-charge evaluations, keeping many children out of the judicial system.

### **Guardians ad Litem (GALs)**
The use of GALs in family law cases has decreased due to the Circuit Court’s emphasis on mediation. While still available, GALs are now primarily accessible to those who can afford their fees, as the state fund covering these costs is no longer available.

### **Judicial Conduct and Complaints**
Family law cases often generate high emotions, leading to complaints against judges, though most are non-meritorious. Judges are salaried and have no financial incentive to prolong cases. The **Judicial Conduct Committee** handles complaints, focusing on behavioral issues rather than the merits of decisions. Judges undergo regular training and evaluations every three years, though they often lack regular feedback.

### **Court Record-Keeping and Remote Hearings**
The court ensures all hearings are recorded, though outdated equipment sometimes causes issues. Parties can request audio recordings or transcripts, with costs covered for indigent parties in certain cases. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, **remote hearings** have become prevalent, with 43% of Circuit Court hearings involving at least one party participating remotely as of February 2023.

### **Rules of Evidence and Hearsay**
Judges expressed concerns about the strict application of the **Rules of Evidence** in family law cases, particularly with self-represented litigants. The court has discretion to admit hearsay and other evidence deemed reliable and relevant, especially in cases involving mental health concerns in custody decisions.

### **Su Sponte Hearings and Case Management**
Judges may call **su sponte hearings** (on their own initiative) to ensure cases stay on track, particularly when delays or inaction occur. These hearings are typically status or pre-trial conferences aimed at maintaining progress.

### **Parent-Child Reunification Therapy**
While rarely used, **parent-child reunification therapy** can be a last resort to repair strained relationships, though it is intensive and expensive.

### **Conclusion and Future Engagement**
The meeting concluded with an invitation for committee members to visit courts and observe proceedings firsthand. Judges emphasized their commitment to fairness, efficiency, and improving judicial processes in family law and court administration.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the judiciary’s ongoing efforts to address resource shortages, reduce delays, and enhance the fairness and accessibility of family law proceedings. Key strategies include mediation, judicial training, and leveraging technology, though systemic challenges like staffing and funding remain critical concerns.
