The NH House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on March 13, 2023, focused on a wide range of education funding, policy, and budget discussions, alongside considerations for environmental regulations and procedural matters. The session highlighted the committee's efforts to balance fiscal responsibility with the need for adequate funding and accountability in education initiatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Education Funding and Policy Discussions**

1. **Computer Science and STEM Programs**:
   - The committee discussed funding for computer science and STEM initiatives, including the creation of a Computer Science and STEM Administrator position. Concerns were raised about the lack of funding for this role, and discussions centered on reallocating existing funds to support it. The goal is to increase the number of certified computer science educators in New Hampshire schools, with proposed stipends for teachers pursuing certifications.

2. **Teacher of the Year Program**:
   - Changes to the Teacher of the Year program were considered, proposing to make it a fully funded position where the selected teacher would focus solely on program activities for a year. Stipends would be provided to their school district for a replacement. The program saw a record number of applicants this year, reflecting increased interest.

3. **Civics Education Commission**:
   - A $2 million appropriation was discussed for the creation of a Civics Education Commission tasked with developing a New Hampshire-specific civics curriculum and textbook. The commission would include educators, judges, and public members. Concerns about potential politicization led to amendments ensuring at least one parent of a public school student is included.

4. **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**:
   - The committee reviewed eligibility criteria for EFAs, which provide financial assistance for students to attend private or alternative schools. Discussions included expanding eligibility to disadvantaged students (e.g., those in foster care, homeless, or attending low-performing schools) without income restrictions, as well as increasing the income threshold for eligibility.

5. **Education Trust Fund (ETF)**:
   - The committee reviewed allowable uses of the ETF, including funding for charter schools, kindergarten grants, public school infrastructure, and EFAs. A significant discussion centered on allocating 1% of the ETF to the Department of Education (DOE) for administrative costs. Concerns about lack of specificity led to considerations for alternative funding mechanisms.

6. **Building Aid and Infrastructure Projects**:
   - The committee discussed challenges in allocating building aid, noting that requests exceed available funds. They prioritized projects and considered removing the $50 million cap on building aid. Updates were expected for the first five schools on the list, with an emphasis on improving data quality for decision-making.

7. **Court-Ordered Placements and Episodes of Treatment**:
   - Funding for court-ordered educational placements and episodes of treatment for students in crisis was reviewed, with cost estimates ranging from $4 to $5 million over the biennium. The committee debated whether to keep these funding streams separate for transparency or combine them into a single line item.

8. **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**:
   - Funding for CTE renovation projects, including the Sugar Hill project, was discussed. The committee emphasized the importance of ensuring these projects are funded appropriately.

### **Budget and Fiscal Considerations**

1. **Business Tax Allocation**:
   - The governor’s budget proposed reducing the allocation of business tax revenue to the ETF from 65% to 35%, shifting $150 million to the general fund. Some committee members expressed concern about this change, especially in light of potential economic downturns.

2. **Adequacy Formula for Education Funding**:
   - The committee compared the governor's proposal to simplify the education funding formula with House Bill 529, which adds fiscal capacity disparity aid. Concerns were raised about the need for additional funding beyond the governor's budget.

3. **Funding Adjustments for State Departments**:
   - The committee addressed funding adjustments for various state departments, including the Department of Safety and Fish and Game, ensuring that any additions to the budget are offset by corresponding reductions to maintain a net-zero impact.

### **Environmental Regulations**

1. **Wetlands Protection**:
   - The Department of Transportation (DOT) requested a change to the law regarding wetlands protection to streamline the process for maintaining infrastructure in prime wetlands. The committee expressed concerns about potential environmental impacts and the importance of local community input, opting to review the hearing tape and gather more information before proceeding.

### **Procedural Matters and Legislative Bills**

1. **Meeting Scheduling**:
   - The committee considered posting a meeting for Saturday, with a decision to be made by Friday based on necessity. They discussed the 24-hour posting requirement for meetings and the possibility of recessing instead of adjourning to allow flexibility for future sessions.

2. **Legislative Bills**:
   - **HB 129**: A hygiene products bill.  
   - **HB 207**: A bill related to increasing the threshold for public hearings on local school district budgets.  
   - Most other bills were retained, with plans to make recommendations on them.

3. **Upcoming Full Committee Meeting**:
   - The committee prepared for a full committee meeting on March 27, where they would present recommendations and amendments to House Bills 1 and 2. They emphasized the importance of focusing on changes made to the operating budget.

4. **Data Analyst Position**:
   - The committee supported the creation of a full-time data analyst position in the Department of Education to improve data quality and decision-making.

5. **Recodifying Education Laws**:
   - The committee considered recodifying education laws and rules, suggesting issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to gather accurate cost estimates before making a decision.
