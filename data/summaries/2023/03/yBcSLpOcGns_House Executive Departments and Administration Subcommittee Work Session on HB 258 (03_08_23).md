The transcript captures a New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee work session discussing **HB 258**, specifically focusing on **HB 655**, which involves the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and its regulatory framework. Key points include:

1. **HB 655 Amendment**: The proposed amendment removes the repeal portions of HB 655, focusing instead on recodifying OPLC's authority under RSA 310. This separation allows the committee to address the repeal sections in **HB 2** separately.

2. **Licensing and Investigations**: The amendment aims to streamline licensing and disciplinary processes, with most boards already delegating licensing authority to OPLC. Concerns were raised about ensuring boards retain oversight for complex cases, such as those involving disciplinary history or criminal background checks.

3. **Board Concerns**: Several boards, including the Board of Medicine, Board of Natural Scientists, Dental Board, and others, expressed concerns about the loss of their input in complaint investigations and the potential for OPLC to initiate investigations without board orders. The Board of Accountancy, Land Surveyors, and Professional Engineers opposed HB 655 in its original form.

4. **Historical Context**: Representative Schmidt highlighted historical issues with the Board of Mental Health Practice and the Board of Psychology, questioning the efficiency and necessity of merging or restructuring boards.

5. **Future Discussions**: The committee scheduled a follow-up session for Friday to address unresolved issues, particularly the repeal sections in HB 2 and how they interact with existing statutes.

Overall, the session focused on balancing efficiency in licensing and disciplinary processes with the need for board expertise and oversight, while addressing concerns about conflicts and historical precedents.
