The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 7, 2023, focuses on the discussion of **House Bill 82**, which pertains to employment protections for individuals using therapeutic cannabis. The meeting involved debates over amendments to the bill, particularly regarding the inclusion of hiring protections and exemptions for certain professions. Here’s a summary of key points:

1. **Amendment Discussion**:  
   - Representative Sullivan introduced an amendment to the bill, which excluded certain professions (e.g., emergency medical services, law enforcement, firefighting) from the protections.  
   - The amendment aimed to narrow the scope of the bill to address concerns about public safety and workplace safety.

2. **Concerns from Representatives**:  
   - Some representatives, including Representative Colcombe, raised concerns about the bill’s potential to restrict employers' ability to make hiring decisions based on their policies.  
   - There were worries about unforeseen consequences for employers, particularly in industries involving heavy machinery or dangerous tasks.

3. **Testimony from Business and Industry Association**:  
   - David Jewett, from the Business and Industry Association, expressed neutrality on the bill but suggested retaining it for further refinement. He emphasized the need for careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences for employers.

4. **Debate on Hiring Protections**:  
   - Representative Sullivan argued that hiring protections are essential to prevent discrimination, similar to other anti-discrimination laws.  
   - Opponents, like Representative Colcombe, argued that employers should retain the right to make hiring decisions based on their policies.

5. **Public Safety and Exemptions**:  
   - Representatives debated whether additional professions (e.g., school bus drivers, construction workers) should be exempt due to safety concerns.  
   - Concerns were raised about the difficulty of defining which jobs should be excluded and the potential for broad or vague language.

6. **Reasonable Accommodations**:  
   - The discussion touched on the concept of reasonable accommodations for employees using therapeutic cannabis, with some arguing that employers could reassign tasks to mitigate risks.  
   - Others countered that such accommodations might not always be feasible or fair to employers.

7. **Comparison to Other States**:  
   - Representative Lang noted that 25 states have similar laws and suggested New Hampshire could learn from their experiences.  
   - He argued that the bill’s potential risks were being overstated and that it could help individuals return to work.

8. **Motion to Retain the Bill**:  
   - A motion was made to retain the bill for further work, with the goal of refining it to address concerns raised during the discussion.  
   - The motion passed, and the bill will return to the full committee for additional review.

The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing employee protections with employer concerns, particularly in safety-sensitive industries. The bill’s future will depend on further refinements to address these competing interests.
