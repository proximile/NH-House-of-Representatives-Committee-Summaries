**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Finance Division III Meeting on March 17, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III convened on March 17, 2023, for a detailed and multifaceted discussion on the state’s budget, with a primary focus on Medicaid, healthcare funding, and state agency operations. The meeting addressed a wide range of budgetary and policy issues, emphasizing the need to balance fiscal responsibility with the provision of essential services. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and decisions from the meeting:

---

### **Medicaid and Healthcare Funding**
1. **Medicaid Budget and Rate Increases**:
   - The committee extensively debated Medicaid funding, including hospital reimbursements, pharmacy costs, and durable medical equipment (DME). Concerns were raised about the adequacy of the current 3.1% Medicaid rate increase, which was deemed insufficient due to inflation and staffing challenges in healthcare.
   - Proposals for targeted rate increases were discussed, with stakeholders advocating for additional funding for long-term care, mental health, and home health services. The committee considered reallocating funds to prioritize these critical areas.

2. **Hospital Reimbursements and Mental Health Beds**:
   - Hospitals’ capacity to discharge patients effectively was a key concern. The committee discussed increasing funding for long-term care and home health services to alleviate hospital strain.
   - Amendments related to hospital designation as receiving facilities for mental health patients (Items 282 and 283) were contentious. The Hospital Association opposed these amendments, arguing they would strain resources. The committee ultimately voted to remove these items from HB2.

3. **Ambulance Services**:
   - The financial struggles of ambulance services in the state were acknowledged, with several providers having recently shut down. The committee proposed increasing funding to address this issue.

4. **Developmental Disabilities and Brain Injury Services**:
   - Additional funding for services supporting individuals with developmental disabilities and brain injuries was debated. The committee considered reallocating existing funds or making new appropriations to meet these needs.

5. **Community Health Centers and Pharmacy Costs**:
   - Funding for community health centers was discussed, with an emphasis on aligning Medicaid reimbursements with Medicare rates. While pharmacy costs were a significant part of the budget, there was no immediate need for additional appropriations. However, a $3 million increase for DME reimbursements was proposed.

### **Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment**
1. **Alcohol Fund and Granite Advantage Program**:
   - The committee discussed amendments to ensure that 5% of liquor revenues remain in the Alcohol Fund, rather than being transferred to the Granite Advantage Program. This would protect funding for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs.

2. **Student Assistance Program**:
   - The deletion of a $1.5 million annual appropriation for the Student Assistance Program, which provides substance misuse counseling in schools, was debated. While the program would not be eliminated, its expansion to middle schools would be affected.

### **State Agency Operations and Personnel**
1. **DHHS Personnel Flexibility**:
   - The committee debated granting the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) flexibility to transfer funds between personnel class lines (Sections 227-228). This provision, which has appeared in past budgets, was retained in HB2 for now.

2. **Unclassified Positions**:
   - Sections 229 and 230 addressed converting classified positions to unclassified roles within DHHS, particularly in Medicaid and legal services, to better align with workload demands. The committee supported these changes.

3. **Staffing and Facility Support**:
   - The committee approved converting temporary positions to full-time roles at Hampstead Hospital and adding three facilities positions to address staffing gaps in DHHS.

### **Program Suspensions and Funding Decisions**
1. **Sununu Youth Services Center**:
   - The committee unanimously agreed to move the budget for the Sununu Youth Services Center from HB2 to HB1, citing historical funding practices and future operational uncertainties. A $10 million appropriation for constructing a replacement facility was debated, with an amendment proposed to use ARPA funds instead of general funds.

2. **Long-Suspended Programs**:
   - Several long-suspended programs, such as senior companion and foster grandparent stipends, catastrophic aid to hospitals, and graduate medical education, were reviewed. The committee considered whether to continue these suspensions or make them permanent.

3. **Meals on Wheels**:
   - The committee debated whether to maintain higher meal rates funded by ARPA money or revert to lower rates. Members considered the implications of replacing temporary federal funds with state general funds.

---

### **IT Systems and Medicaid Unwinding**
1. **IT Systems (MMIS and New Heights)**:
   - Funding for the maintenance and operations of critical IT systems like MMIS and the integrated eligibility system (New Heights) was discussed. The committee considered moving some operational costs from HB2 to HB1 for transparency and continuity.

2. **Medicaid Unwinding**:
   - The committee reviewed funding to manage the transition as the federal public health emergency ends, ensuring continued coverage for eligible individuals while disenrolling those no longer eligible.

---

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Workplace Violence Reporting Program**:
   - Section 226, which addresses workplace violence reporting in healthcare settings, was debated. The committee leaned toward allowing voluntary participation while suspending state obligations due to DHHS’s resource constraints.

2. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Funding**:
   - A request for $150,000 annually for PPE at New Hampshire Hospital was supported, acknowledging the ongoing need for PPE in healthcare settings.

3. **Foster Care Rates**:
   - The committee considered increasing foster care rates to align with the cost of raising a child, with a proposed 10% increase in the first year and 25% in the second year.

4. **Family Resource Centers**:
   - Funding for Family Resource Centers, aimed at preventing child abuse and neglect, was discussed, with some members suggesting holding the item for further review.

### **Legislative Process and Next Steps**
The committee conducted straw votes on various budget items to gauge member positions, with plans to revisit these items for final votes in subsequent sessions. Members emphasized the need for timely decisions while addressing concerns about resource allocation and healthcare capacity. The meeting concluded with a reminder of the next session at 9:30 AM on Monday and well-wishes for the weekend.
