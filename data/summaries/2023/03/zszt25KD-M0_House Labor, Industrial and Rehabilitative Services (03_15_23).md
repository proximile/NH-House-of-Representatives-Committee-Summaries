**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Meeting (March 15, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on March 15, 2023, to discuss several key bills, with a primary focus on **therapeutic cannabis employment protections**, **unemployment benefits**, and **protections for volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel**. The meeting highlighted complex debates over balancing individual rights, employer protections, and public safety.

### **Therapeutic Cannabis and Employment Protections**

The committee extensively debated a bill aimed at protecting employees who use cannabis under the state’s therapeutic cannabis program. Key points included:

1. **Bill Overview**: The bill sought to prevent employers from disciplining or discharging employees solely based on their possession of a therapeutic cannabis card or testing positive for THC. It included amendments to exclude high-risk jobs (e.g., EMS, law enforcement, firefighters) and ensure compliance with federal law.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The bill aimed to codify rights established by the New Hampshire Supreme Court (e.g., *Scott Payne v. Right-of-Way Incorporated*), which ruled in favor of workplace accommodations for therapeutic cannabis users. This would prevent individuals from repeatedly needing to go to court to enforce their rights.

3. **Concerns and Debate**:  
   - **Employer Rights vs. Employee Protections**: Some representatives argued that employers should retain the right to deny employment or terminate employees based on cannabis use, especially in safety-sensitive roles. Others emphasized the need to protect employees who use cannabis therapeutically, noting that THC can remain in the system long after use.  
   - **Safety and Liability**: Concerns were raised about the inability to accurately test for cannabis impairment, which could pose risks in workplaces involving heavy machinery or high-risk tasks. Potential increases in workers' compensation claims and employer liability were also discussed.  
   - **Federal vs. State Law**: The conflict between federal classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug and state-level therapeutic cannabis programs created challenges in aligning employment protections with federal law.  

4. **Amendments and Voting**:  
   - Representative Sullivan proposed an amendment clarifying that employers are not required to allow impairment at work and that employees cannot be disciplined solely for having a therapeutic cannabis card or testing positive for THC. The amendment passed 15-5.  
   - The amended bill initially failed in a 10-10 tie vote but was retained for further consideration with a 16-4 vote, allowing the committee to refine the bill and address concerns.

5. **Future Work**: The committee plans to hold additional meetings to refine the bill, aiming to balance the rights of therapeutic cannabis users with employer protections and safety concerns.

### **House Bill 190 FN: Unemployment Benefits**

The committee also discussed **House Bill 190 FN**, which proposed adjusting the duration of unemployment benefits based on the state’s unemployment rate. Key points included:

1. **Purpose**: The bill aimed to reduce the duration of unemployment benefits when the unemployment rate is low, modeled after a policy implemented in another state.

2. **Discussion**:  
   - The sponsor acknowledged concerns that the bill might not work in New Hampshire, as the state performs better on economic metrics than the state that implemented the policy.  
   - Opponents argued that the state’s unemployment system is already well-functioning and that reducing benefits would not address staffing shortages in critical sectors like healthcare and corrections.  

3. **Outcome**: The bill was retained for further revisions by a narrow vote of 10-9, reflecting the committee’s cautious approach to addressing long-term unemployment.

### **House Bill 182: Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Protections**

Another key discussion centered on **House Bill 182**, which aimed to protect volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel from employer discipline when responding to emergencies. Key points included:

1. **Purpose**: The bill sought to ensure that volunteers could not be disciplined or discharged for responding to emergencies, drawing parallels to protections for National Guard members.

2. **Amendments**:  
   - **Amendment 0990H**: Proposed mirroring protections for volunteer firefighters similar to those for EMS workers. It failed in a 10-10 tie.  
   - **Amendment 0979H**: Allowed employers to deny leave for emergencies if the employee’s presence was critical during a shift. It also failed in a 10-10 tie.  

3. **Discussion**:  
   - Supporters emphasized the importance of protecting volunteers who save lives and property.  
   - Opponents expressed concerns about the burden on small businesses and the potential for abuse by employees.  

4. **Outcome**: The committee voted on OTP (Ought to Pass) with no amendments, but the vote was tied 10-10, leaving the bill without a recommendation.

### **Other Bills**

The committee also briefly discussed **House Bill 232**, which aimed to replace New Hampshire’s Department of Labor health and safety standards with OSHA standards for public sector employees. The committee unanimously voted to retain the bill for further study.

### **Key Themes**

1. **Balancing Competing Interests**: The meeting underscored the committee’s efforts to balance individual rights (e.g., therapeutic cannabis users, volunteers) with employer protections and public safety concerns.  
2. **Retention for Further Study**: Several bills were retained for refinement, reflecting the committee’s cautious approach to complex labor and public safety issues.  
3. **Concerns Over Unintended Consequences**: Representatives emphasized the need to avoid creating burdens for employers or undermining the state’s existing systems, such as unemployment and workplace safety.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to addressing labor and public safety issues while navigating competing interests and legal complexities.
