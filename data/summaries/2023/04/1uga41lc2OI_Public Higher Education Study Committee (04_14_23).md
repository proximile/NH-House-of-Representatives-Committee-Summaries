**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Higher Education Study Committee Meeting (04/14/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Public Higher Education Study Committee convened on April 14, 2023, to address critical issues in public higher education, teacher preparation, and K-12 curriculum alignment. The meeting focused on three primary areas: civics education, teacher preparation programs, and the integration of higher education with K-12 needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Civics Education**
The committee emphasized the importance of strengthening civics education across all grade levels to foster informed and engaged citizens. Key points included:
- **Middle School Civics**: A proposal to integrate civics instruction into middle school (grades 6-8) history classes, equivalent to a half-credit course over three years, with an implementation date of July 2024. This allows time for teacher professional development.
- **Elementary and High School Civics**: Discussions included introducing dedicated civics instruction in elementary grades, integrated with other subjects, and a half-credit civics course in high school. The goal is to promote understanding of democratic principles, critical thinking, and civil discourse.
- **Professional Development**: New Hampshire Civics is prepared to offer training sessions to help teachers incorporate civics into their curricula. However, concerns were raised about the financial and logistical challenges schools may face in implementing these changes.
- **Nonpartisan Approach**: Amendments to the civics education bill were proposed to ensure the curriculum is nonpartisan and rooted in American constitutional democracy, with historical context, including New Hampshire’s role in early American history.

### **2. Teacher Preparation Programs**
The committee explored ways to improve teacher preparation programs to better align with K-12 educational needs. Highlights included:
- **Dual Majors and Integrated Teaching**: Institutions like Keene State College and Plymouth State University emphasized dual majors for elementary education students, combining liberal arts with education. They stressed the importance of content knowledge, pedagogy, and clinical experiences.
- **Challenges in Teacher Education**: Declining student performance in math, teacher shortages in critical areas (math, science, special education), and the impact of social-emotional and mental health issues on teaching were discussed. Standardized tests and rigid curricula were identified as barriers to addressing diverse student needs.
- **Program Improvement**: Feedback from graduates, employers, and accreditation bodies is used to enhance teacher preparation programs. Advisory committees with K-12 educators ensure alignment with state standards.
- **Math Education**: Keene State shared how removing pre-math test barriers improved student attitudes and performance, positively impacting their preparation as teachers.
- **Diversity in Teaching**: The committee expressed concern about the lack of diversity in teacher preparation programs and highlighted the need for more minority teachers to reflect the student population.

### **3. Alignment Between Higher Education and K-12**
The committee discussed strategies to ensure higher education curricula meet the needs of K-12 education, particularly in math, science, and social studies:
- **Community College System**: Representatives highlighted co-requisite remediation for math and English, which has improved student outcomes. They emphasized the need for better K-12 preparation to reduce the need for remedial courses in higher education.
- **Social Studies and Civics**: Concerns were raised about the limited focus on social studies and civics in K-12 education, as these subjects are not assessed statewide, leading to their marginalization in the curriculum.
- **Liberal Arts vs. Workforce Training**: The committee debated the value of a liberal arts education versus workforce training, emphasizing the importance of a well-rounded education that includes critical thinking and exposure to diverse perspectives, essential for civics education.

### **4. Teacher Retention and Recruitment**
The committee addressed challenges in recruiting and retaining teachers, particularly in New Hampshire, where cost of living and salaries are significant factors. Key points included:
- **Data Tracking**: There is a need for better data to understand why teachers leave the profession and to develop effective retention strategies.
- **Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)**: The importance of SEL in elementary education was highlighted, focusing on teaching students civil discourse, critical thinking, and community skills, which are foundational for civic engagement.

### **5. Legislative and Future Steps**
The committee reviewed progress on the HB 1530 bill, which facilitates the transfer of students from associate degree programs to four-year institutions, particularly in education preparation programs. They also tentatively scheduled their next meeting for May 8, 2023, to continue discussions on higher education reform, teacher preparation, and civics education.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to improving civics education, enhancing teacher preparation programs, and ensuring alignment between higher education and K-12 needs. Key priorities include providing robust professional development for teachers, addressing teacher shortages, and fostering a well-rounded education that prepares students for active and informed citizenship. The committee’s efforts reflect a broader goal of strengthening New Hampshire’s education system to support student success and civic engagement.
