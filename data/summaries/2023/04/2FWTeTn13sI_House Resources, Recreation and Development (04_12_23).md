**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting – Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee (04/12/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on April 12, 2023, to discuss several key bills related to water quality, environmental protection, and historical preservation. The meeting focused on four primary pieces of legislation: **Senate Bill 60 (SB 60)**, **Senate Bill 11 (SB 11)**, **Senate Bill 123 (SB 123)**, and **Senate Bill 56 (SB 56)**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from each bill:

---

### **1. Senate Bill 60: Omnibus Water Quality Legislation**
SB 60 is a comprehensive bill addressing various aspects of water quality regulation, with a focus on **Section 401 Water Quality Certifications**, which are required for federally permitted projects that may discharge into U.S. waters. Key provisions and discussions included:  
- **Waiver Authority**: Allows the state to waive 401 certifications for projects with minimal environmental impact, such as waterline replacements under Great Bay.  
- **Processing Timeframes**: Establishes clear timelines for state action on 401 certifications to align with federal requirements.  
- **Water Withdrawals**: Clarifies regulations for large surface water withdrawals, ensuring consistency with existing groundwater rules.  
- **Nutrient Effluent Limits**: Provides flexibility in calculating nutrient limits for wastewater treatment plants, addressing high compliance costs for communities like Rochester.  
- **Rulemaking**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) is drafting rules to support SB 60, particularly for 401 certifications and water quality standards.  
- **Committee Concerns**: Members noted the bill’s complexity and suggested breaking it into smaller pieces to prioritize urgent provisions.  
- **Next Steps**: A work session was scheduled for April 19, 2023, to review amendments and consider restructuring the bill.

### **2. Senate Bill 11: Protection of African-American Burial Sites**
SB 11 addresses the respectful handling and preservation of African-American burial grounds, acknowledging historical injustices such as the disturbance of graves for medical dissection and racial "science" in the 18th and 19th centuries. Key elements included:  
- **Provisions**: The bill requires historical institutions and museums to review collections for African-American remains and artifacts, and establishes a framework for collaboration with descendant communities.  
- **Consultation Process**: The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources will coordinate with groups like the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire and NAACP chapters.  
- **Local Flexibility**: Communities like Portsmouth and Dover, which have already established committees for this purpose, are supported under the bill.  
- **Challenges**: Identifying unmarked graves and connecting with descendants remains complex, though genealogical research and historical records can aid the process.  
- **No Fiscal Impact**: The bill avoids financial obligations by making the process consultative rather than mandatory.  
- **Support**: Strong backing was expressed by representatives from the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire, NAACP, and other organizations.  
- **Next Steps**: A work session was planned to further discuss the bill with experts like Ben Wilson from the Division of Historical Resources.

### **3. Senate Bill 123: Groundwater Quality Standards**
SB 123 focuses on correcting inconsistencies in existing statutes related to groundwater quality and providing DES with flexibility to adopt federal health advisories. Key points included:  
- **Contaminant Management**: The bill is critical for addressing contaminants like PFAS and ensuring compliance with federal standards.  
- **DES Support**: DES emphasized the bill’s importance for maintaining public health and environmental safety.

### **4. Senate Bill 56: Compensatory Payments for Resource Losses**
SB 56 expands the **Aquatic Resource Mitigation Fund (ARM Fund)** to allow developers to pay into the fund for resource losses in the coastal zone, rather than requiring on-site mitigation. Key discussions included:  
- **Purpose**: The bill provides flexibility for developers in areas like sand dunes, tidal buffer zones, and prime wetlands, where on-site mitigation is often impractical.  
- **Support**: Senator David Waters, DES, NH Department of Transportation (DOT), and Associated General Contractors of NH all endorsed the bill for its administrative clarity and environmental benefits.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - Payments are based on a formula tied to inflation and resource type.  
  - Funds must be spent within the watershed where impacts occurred, supporting projects like dam removals and shoreline restoration.  
- **Concerns**: Some committee members questioned whether developers might opt to pay into the fund even when mitigation is feasible, but DES clarified that strict avoidance and minimization standards must still be met.  
- **Environmental Impact**: The ARM Fund is nationally recognized for its effectiveness in supporting high-impact environmental restoration projects.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee expressed general support for the bill, which appears poised to move forward.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Environmental Protection**: The bills discussed emphasize balancing development with environmental stewardship, particularly through streamlined mitigation processes (SB 56) and updated water quality standards (SB 60, SB 123).  
- **Historical Preservation**: SB 11 highlights the state’s commitment to addressing historical injustices and preserving African-American heritage.  
- **Collaboration and Flexibility**: Many bills involve collaboration between state agencies, local communities, and descendant groups, with a focus on flexibility and practicality in implementation.  
- **Next Steps**: Work sessions were scheduled for SB 60 and SB 11 to further refine the legislative language and address committee concerns.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of thoughtful, collaborative approaches to environmental and historical resource management in New Hampshire.
