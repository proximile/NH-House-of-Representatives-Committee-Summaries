**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Executive Departments and Administration Meeting (04/25/23):**

The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on April 25, 2023, to discuss **SB 71**, a bill addressing the presumption of cancer among firefighters and the implementation of optional annual cancer screenings. The meeting focused on expanding cancer coverage, supporting firefighters, and exploring the feasibility of cancer screenings, balancing these goals with cost considerations and implementation strategies.

### Key Points Discussed:

1. **Expansion of Presumptive Cancer Coverage**:
   - The bill seeks to expand the presumption of cancer in firefighters under **RSA 281**, shifting the burden of proof from the claimant to the insurance carrier. Currently, only certain cancers recognized by the **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)** are presumed work-related. The bill would extend this presumption to **all cancers**, provided conditions such as 10 years of service and being cancer-free at hire are met.
   - **Jared O'Connor**, a workers' compensation attorney, explained that a presumption flips the burden of proof, requiring insurers to prove a cancer is not work-related rather than the claimant proving it is. This applies primarily in cases where medical evidence is inconclusive.

2. **Impact on Workers' Compensation**:
   - The presumption does not guarantee coverage but makes it easier for firefighters to qualify for benefits. Insurers can still deny claims if they provide evidence (e.g., genetic history, smoking) that the cancer is not work-related.
   - The practical impact on workers' compensation rates is expected to be minimal, as only a small subset of cases (those with unclear medical evidence) would be affected.

3. **Support for Firefighters**:
   - **Brian Rill**, President of the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire, emphasized that the bill demonstrates state support for firefighters, acknowledging the occupational risks they face, including exposure to **PFAS chemicals** in protective gear. He noted that there has been no significant opposition to the bill.
   - The discussion highlighted the need to expand presumptive cancer coverage for firefighters beyond the current list of seven cancers, with reports from IARC and the CDC suggesting that additional cancers should be included due to increased risks faced by firefighters.

4. **Study Commission for Cancer Screenings**:
   - A study commission is proposed to explore the implementation of optional annual cancer screenings for firefighters. This commission would examine costs, cost-sharing between the state and municipalities, necessary screenings, and successful programs in other states like New Jersey and Massachusetts.
   - Early detection and treatment through screenings could reduce long-term medical costs and claims, though there could be a slight increase in workers' compensation premiums due to expanded coverage.

5. **Comparison to PTSD Presumption**:
   - O'Connor drew parallels to the **PTSD presumption** for firefighters, which was enacted in 2021. Like the cancer presumption, it shifts the burden of proof but has not significantly increased claim approvals or costs.

### Concerns and Clarifications:
- **Representative Chris** raised questions about the burden of proof, expressing uncertainty about how insurers could prove a negative (i.e., that a cancer is not work-related). O'Connor explained that insurers rely on medical records and expert testimony to challenge claims.
- Rill and O'Connor highlighted that even with the presumption, claims can still be denied if evidence points to non-work-related causes, as seen in a recent **testicular cancer case** in Dover.

### Amendment Discussion and Next Steps:
- **Representative True** proposed amendments to adjust the Sunset date and commission composition, ensuring legislative majority. However, further refinement is needed before finalizing the amendments.
- The meeting was recessed until the next morning to allow for further research and discussion, with a focus on finalizing the legislation and amendments.

### Conclusion:
The committee acknowledged the bill's intent to support firefighters while maintaining safeguards against unwarranted claims. The discussion emphasized the procedural nature of the presumption and its limited financial impact on municipalities. The bill aims to address ambiguities in current law and provide clearer protections for firefighters facing occupational cancer risks, balancing coverage expansion with cost considerations and implementation strategies.
