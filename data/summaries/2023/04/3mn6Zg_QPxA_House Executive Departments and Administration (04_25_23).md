**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on April 25, 2023: House Executive Departments and Administration**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 25, 2023, addressed both procedural matters and substantive discussions on **SB 71**, a bill concerning firefighters' cancer presumptions and optional annual cancer screenings. The meeting began with scheduling and administrative updates, including the confirmation of one more work session scheduled for May 23rd. The committee decided to recess the work session on SB 71 until the following morning at 9:00 AM, allowing time to finalize amendments and vote on the bill.

**Key Points on SB 71:**

1. **Purpose of the Bill**:  
   SB 71 aims to expand the presumption of cancer as work-related for firefighters under RSA 281. Currently, only certain cancers recognized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) are covered. The proposed expansion would include all cancers, provided firefighters meet criteria such as 10 years of service and being cancer-free at the time of hire. Additionally, the bill establishes a commission to study the implementation of optional annual cancer screenings for firefighters.

2. **Presumption of Cancer**:  
   The bill shifts the burden of proof from the firefighter to the insurance carrier, requiring the carrier to prove that the cancer is not work-related. This mirrors the PTSD presumption for first responders, which has been in place for two years without significant financial impact on municipalities. While the presumption makes it easier for firefighters to qualify for workers' compensation, claims can still be denied if medical evidence strongly suggests the cancer is not work-related.

3. **Impact on Workers' Compensation**:  
   The bill is expected to result in a marginal increase in workers' compensation premiums, but the financial impact is anticipated to be minimal. Early cancer screenings could reduce long-term treatment costs, potentially offsetting any increased claims.

4. **Study Commission**:  
   A commission will be established to explore the implementation of a cancer screening program, including costs, cost-sharing, and administrative logistics. Other states, such as New Jersey and Massachusetts, already have similar programs, and some New Hampshire municipalities are beginning to implement screenings.

5. **Concerns and Amendments**:  
   Representative True proposed amendments to adjust the commissionâ€™s sunset date and composition, ensuring the legislature holds the majority of seats. However, the amendment was not finalized for immediate consideration. The committee agreed to revisit the bill the next morning to finalize amendments and vote on the bill.

6. **Support for Firefighters**:  
   The bill is seen as a way to demonstrate state support for firefighters, acknowledging the increased cancer risks they face due to exposure to carcinogens like PFAS chemicals in protective gear.

**Conclusion**:  
Overall, SB 71 seeks to provide firefighters with easier access to workers' compensation for cancer claims and explore the feasibility of regular cancer screenings, with minimal financial impact expected on municipalities. The committee plans to finalize amendments and vote on the bill the following day. The meeting concluded with a decision to recess the work session on SB 71 until the next morning at 9:00 AM, ensuring thorough consideration of the proposed changes.
