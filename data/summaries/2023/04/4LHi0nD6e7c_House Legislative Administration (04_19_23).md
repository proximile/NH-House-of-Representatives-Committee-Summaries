The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 19, 2023, addressed several key legislative issues, with a focus on Senate Bill 84, CACR-10, and Senate Bill 28. The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance and housekeeping announcements, followed by detailed discussions on the following bills:

### Senate Bill 84: Committee and Commission Structure
The primary focus of the meeting was Senate Bill 84, which aims to reform the structure and governance of legislative committees and commissions. Key points of discussion included:
1. **Membership Caps**: The bill proposes limiting study committees to 15 members, with a majority being legislators. This ensures that legislators drive policy decisions while incorporating input from experts and stakeholders.
2. **Administrative Attachment**: Due to the legislature's limited capacity, the bill suggests attaching commissions to executive branch agencies for logistical support, such as meeting spaces and administrative services.
3. **Expertise and Representation**: Legislators acknowledged the need for subject matter experts on commissions, particularly for technical issues like solid waste management, but emphasized the importance of maintaining legislative control over policy direction.
4. **Historical Context**: The bill builds on House Bill 1269, passed in 2022, which sought to streamline and regulate committees and commissions. The 2022 law addressed issues like oversized commissions and administrative inefficiencies and was unanimously supported.
5. **Special Committee on Commissions**: A special committee has been established to examine the broader framework of committees and commissions. The current bill is seen as a placeholder to allow further collaboration and refinement with this special committee.
6. **Retention of the Bill**: The committee was encouraged to retain the bill for further work, particularly to address questions about administrative attachment, membership caps, and the distinction between committees and commissions.

### CACR-10: Legislative Meeting Schedule Amendment
Senator Donna Soucy presented CACR-10, a proposed constitutional amendment to change the legislative meeting schedule around the governor's inauguration. Key points included:
1. **Current Schedule**: The legislature currently convenes on the first Wednesday in January, followed by the governor's inauguration on Thursday.
2. **Proposed Change**: The amendment suggests meeting only on Thursday, eliminating the mandatory Wednesday session, which Senator Soucy argued is largely ceremonial and inefficient.
3. **Cost Savings**: The change aims to streamline the process and reduce unnecessary costs, such as mileage reimbursements.
4. **Opposition**: House Clerk Paul Smith opposed the amendment, citing the historical significance and logistical considerations of the current schedule, particularly for the House of Representatives.

### Senate Bill 28: Acceptance of Portrait
Senator Regina Birdsall discussed Senate Bill 28, which allows the Joint Legislative Historical Committee to accept a portrait of Rogers Johnson, a prominent public servant. Key points included:
1. **Rogers Johnson's Legacy**: Johnson was the first African-American House Majority Whip in New Hampshire and had a distinguished career in public service, including roles in the U.S. Department of Education and various civic organizations.
2. **Support**: The bill received support from the executive director of the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights, who highlighted Johnson's significant contributions to the state.
3. **Procedural Requirements**: The bill also addressed the procedural requirements for accepting donations and displaying portraits in the State House.

### Conclusion
The meeting concluded with a brief recess before resuming to discuss further legislative matters. The discussions highlighted the balancing act between ensuring legislative oversight and incorporating external expertise, while addressing administrative challenges in managing committees and commissions.
