**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (April 18, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on April 18, 2023, to review and vote on several Senate bills related to energy policy, net metering, and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. The meeting highlighted ongoing debates about subsidies, cost-shifting, market competition, and the role of government in promoting sustainable energy solutions. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **Net Metering Expansion Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 69 (SB 69): Net Metering for Non-Profits**
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that expanding net metering to non-profits would reduce their operating costs, enabling them to better serve the community. Non-profits could form consortiums or cooperatives to participate in net metering.
   - **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about cost-shifting to ratepayers and the need to wait for the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to finalize net metering tariffs. The Department of Energy (DOE) opposed the bill, recommending clarity on tariffs first.
   - **Outcome**: Both motions to **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)** and **Ought to Pass (OTP)** failed with a 10-10 tie, sending the bill to the House floor without recommendation.

2. **Senate Bill 79 (SB 79): Net Metering for Industrial Entities**
   - **Support**: Businesses like Stonyfield and Hitchner Manufacturing testified that net metering would lower energy costs and support local infrastructure investments. Proponents emphasized the need for competition and sustainable energy to reduce reliance on traditional energy markets.
   - **Opposition**: Opponents argued the bill would subsidize for-profit entities at the expense of ratepayers and noted that businesses could already invest in renewable energy systems without net metering.
   - **Outcome**: Similar to SB 69, both ITL and OTP motions failed with a 10-10 tie, sending the bill to the House floor without recommendation.

3. **Senate Bill 68 (SB 68): Expansion of Net Metering Eligibility**
   - **Support**: Advocates highlighted the benefits of diversifying energy sources and lowering prices.
   - **Opposition**: Critics expressed concerns about unrestricted growth in net metering and its impact on ratepayers.
   - **Outcome**: The motion to **ITL** passed 19-1, and the bill was placed on the consent calendar.

#### **Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure**
**Senate Bill 52 (SB 52): Regulation of EV Charging Stations**
   - **Discussion**: The bill aimed to regulate and fund EV charging stations. Rep. Harrington opposed the bill, arguing that users should bear the costs, not ratepayers. Rep. Corman noted the bill does not mandate charges but explores funding sources, emphasizing the importance of EV infrastructure for tourism and the economy.
   - **Outcome**: Both motions to **ITL** and **OTP** failed 10-10, sending the bill to the House floor without recommendation.

---

#### **Energy Market Stabilization**
**Senate Bill 54 (SB 54): Energy Market Stability**
   - **Discussion**: The bill addresses energy market stability and its impact on community power programs. Members expressed concerns about its effects on electricity rates.
   - **Outcome**: The committee agreed to form a subcommittee to further study the bill and recessed the executive session.

#### **Other Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 225 (SB 225)**: Passed unanimously with a minor amendment and moved to the consent calendar.

6. **Senate Bill 166 (SB 166)**: Passed unanimously with an amendment allowing one to five grid modernization pilots, moved to the consent calendar.
7. **Senate Bill 167 (SB 167)**: The committee voted 11-9 to recommend **ITL**, citing concerns about taxpayer subsidies and environmental impact related to green hydrogen infrastructure.

### **Broader Themes**
1. **Subsidies vs. Market Competition**: The debate centered on whether net metering and other energy policies constitute subsidies or foster market competition.
2. **Cost-Shifting Concerns**: Opponents of net metering expansion highlighted the risk of shifting costs to ratepayers, particularly with large entities benefiting disproportionately.
3. **Role of Non-Profits and Businesses**: Non-profits were emphasized as vital to New Hampshireâ€™s social fabric, while businesses underscored the need for energy cost reductions to remain competitive.
4. **EV Infrastructure**: Discussions reflected the tension between expanding EV charging infrastructure and determining appropriate funding mechanisms.
5. **Economic and Environmental Impacts**: Members weighed the economic benefits of supporting non-profits and tourism against the need for reliable and sustainable energy infrastructure.

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**
- **Net Metering Bills (SB 69, SB 79, SB 68)**: Proceeded to the House floor without recommendations due to tied votes or ITL outcomes.
- **EV Charging Stations (SB 52)**: Sent to the House floor without a recommendation.
- **Energy Market Stability (SB 54)**: A subcommittee was formed to further study the bill.
- **Other Bills**: Most passed unanimously with amendments and were moved to the consent calendar.

The meeting concluded with members acknowledging the hard work done and looking forward to continued discussions on energy policy and infrastructure. A subcommittee meeting was scheduled for April 24th to further review **SB 54** with input from the PUC and other stakeholders.
