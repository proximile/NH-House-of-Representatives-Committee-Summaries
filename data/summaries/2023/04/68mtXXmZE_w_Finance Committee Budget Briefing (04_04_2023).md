**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Budget Briefing (04/04/2023)**

On April 4, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened to discuss the state budget for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, focusing on two key bills: **HB 1-A** (appropriations for state departments) and **HB 2-FN-A-L** (state fees, funds, revenues, and expenditures). The meeting highlighted critical issues, budget priorities, and challenges facing the state, with an emphasis on fiscal responsibility, workforce shortages, and strategic investments. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Budget Overview and Key Provisions**
1. **Budget Structure**:
   - The budget is balanced, with no new taxes or fees, and includes $15.89 billion in total appropriations.
   - It reflects a 12.7% increase due to inflation and a 1.5% population growth, though it remains below the 14.2% tax expenditure limitation.
   - Federal funds account for 32% of the budget, with allocations for education, highways, and other critical sectors.

2. **Tax Cuts and Revenue**:
   - The interest and dividends tax will end in January 2025, two years earlier than planned, to encourage savings and investment.
   - The communication service tax was retained to offset revenue losses and attract businesses and high-wealth individuals.

3. **State Employee Pay and Retirement**:
   - State employees will receive a 10% pay raise in 2024 and a 2% raise in 2025 to address workforce retention challenges.
   - $50 million is allocated to reduce unfunded liabilities in the retirement system, with the state covering municipal shares.

4. **Education Trust Fund**:
   - The fund is reallocated to focus on adequacy, with $158 million added for adequacy payments to reduce its use as a "slush fund."

5. **Infrastructure and Technology**:
   - Investments include IT upgrades, the creation of a Chief Privacy Officer, and funding for state system improvements.
   - Corrections operations are fully funded, but $40 million for a new men's prison was removed due to cost concerns.

6. **Environmental and Waste Management**:
   - Funding is allocated for PFAS response, landfill monitoring, and initiatives to reduce food waste, including a phase three feasibility study on PFAS contamination in Merrimack.

### **Critical Challenges and Workforce Shortages**
1. **Healthcare Workforce Crisis**:
   - Severe staffing shortages, particularly in healthcare, have led to overcrowded emergency rooms and delayed patient discharges due to insufficient post-hospital care.
   - Behavioral health counseling and support are emphasized to prevent ER visits, but competitive wages and Medicaid reimbursement rate increases (proposed at 11%) are needed to attract and retain workers.

2. **ER Boarding Crisis**:
   - Patients, especially those with mental health issues, are stuck in emergency rooms due to a lack of community care resources. The committee prioritized increasing reimbursement rates to improve capacity and reduce ER visits.

3. **Hiring Shortages Across Departments**:
   - Workforce shortages persist in corrections, state police, and other state departments, complicating efforts to fully fund and staff critical services.

### **Healthcare and Social Services**
1. **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**:
   - The committee pushed for an 11% increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates to address the decade-long gap caused by inflation, though funding alone cannot fully resolve workforce shortages.

2. **Substance Abuse Prevention and Recovery**:
   - Funding was allocated for local coalitions to prevent youth substance abuse, with a focus on pilot programs. The committee emphasized maintaining support for the Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs and recovery programs.

3. **Trauma-Informed Care**:
   - Efforts to improve juvenile care include eliminating strip searches in favor of full-body scanners, reflecting a trauma-informed approach.

### **Budget Process and Fiscal Responsibility**
1. **Rainy Day Fund and Economic Uncertainty**:
   - The committee stressed the importance of maintaining the rainy day fund amid risks of inflation and recession, cautioning against diverting funds to other projects.

2. **Transparency and Audits**:
   - Accountability in spending was emphasized, with audits ensuring funds are used effectively. Lawmakers were encouraged to report inefficiencies or issues in their districts.

3. **Collaboration with the Senate**:
   - The committee acknowledged that the Senate will review the budget and may propose amendments, urging representatives to advocate for their priorities during the Senate process.

### **Additional Discussions**
1. **Affordable Housing and Growth**:
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of affordable housing, particularly as tax cuts may attract new residents. Localities were encouraged to address housing challenges.

2. **Prescription Drug Affordability Board**:
   - Reforms were proposed to increase accountability and eliminate redundant powers within the board.

3. **Teacher of the Year Program vs. Substance Abuse Funding**:
   - A freshman representative questioned the allocation of $250,000 to expand the Teacher of the Year program compared to $200,000 for youth substance abuse prevention. The committee defended the latter as a pilot program aimed at long-term cost savings through prevention.

### **Conclusion**

The committee emphasized strategic investments in healthcare, education, infrastructure, and workforce retention while maintaining fiscal responsibility and transparency.
