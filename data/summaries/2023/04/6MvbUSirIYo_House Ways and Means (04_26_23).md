**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting on April 26, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on April 26, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several key bills and motions. The meeting focused on a range of topics, including tax policy, business regulations, charitable gaming, and funding mechanisms. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Tax Policy and Business Regulations**

1. **Senate Bill 260 (SB 260)**: Clarifying Tax Treatment for LLC Owners  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aimed to clarify the tax treatment of compensation for owners and members of LLCs, particularly professional LLCs (e.g., dentists, lawyers, CPAs), ensuring that reasonable and customary compensation is treated as income rather than business profits, thus exempt from the Business Profits Tax (BPT).  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Introduced by **Senator Tim Lang** in response to constituent concerns about double taxation, where owner disbursements were taxed as business profits despite being equivalent to W-2 employee compensation.  
     - The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) argued that existing law (RSA 77-A) already allows for the deduction of reasonable compensation, making the bill redundant and potentially confusing.  
     - Committee members debated the necessity of the bill, with some questioning whether it addressed a widespread issue or was driven by a single case.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to recommend "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), finding the bill unnecessary and potentially confusing.

2. **Senate Bill 189 (SB 189)**: Decoupling Business Interest Deduction Limits  
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposed decoupling New Hampshire’s business interest deduction limitations from the federal **Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 163(j)**, which limits interest deductions to 30% of adjusted taxable income.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill would allow businesses to fully deduct interest expenses in the year incurred, rather than carrying forward excess deductions, aligning New Hampshire with 18 other states that have decoupled from the federal limitation.  
     - Supporters argued that the bill would encourage business investment, particularly in capital-intensive industries like manufacturing, and make New Hampshire more competitive for international companies.  
     - The DRA testified that the revenue impact was **indeterminate**, as it depended on how businesses responded (e.g., accelerating investments).  
   - **Outcome**: The committee debated the potential benefits against the uncertainty of revenue impact, with supporters emphasizing the need to restore a favorable tax environment for businesses.

### **Charitable Gaming and Horse Racing**

1. **Senate Bill 190 (SB 190)**: Advanced Deposit Wagering (ADW) for Horse Racing  
   - **Purpose**: The bill clarified the legality of advanced deposit wagering (ADW) for horse racing in New Hampshire, ensuring compliance with the **Interstate Horse Racing Act of 1978** and introducing consumer protections, bonding for operators, and cybersecurity requirements.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - ADW allows bettors to place wagers on horse races via phone or apps, but there was confusion about its legality in New Hampshire.  
     - **Senator Tim Lang** (Prime Sponsor) emphasized the bill’s intent to align state law with federal law and address ambiguities in New Hampshire’s horse racing statutes.  
     - Debate centered on the tax rate for ADW (2.25% vs. 1.25% for simulcast betting), with industry representatives proposing amendments.  
   - **Outcome**: The public hearing was closed, and the committee will consider proposed amendments.

2. **Senate Bill 192 (SB 192)**: Lucky 7 Ticket Sales  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aligned Lucky 7 ticket sales with existing bingo laws to help charities benefit more fully from ticket sales.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to pass the bill.

3. **Senate Bill 139 (SB 139)**: Price of Lucky Seven Tickets  
   - **Purpose**: The bill addressed the price of Lucky Seven tickets, amending it to limit the price to $2 when sold in a dispenser (from $10).  
   - **Outcome**: The amended bill passed unanimously (20-0) and will go on the consent calendar.

### **Funding Mechanisms and Commissions**

1. **Senate Bill 17 (SB 17)**: Gifts and Donations Account for Fish and Game  
   - **Purpose**: The bill established a gifts and donations account within the Fish and Game fund, focusing on non-game species.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee passed the motion unanimously (20-0), and the bill will go on the consent calendar.

2. **Senate Bill 51 (SB 51)**: Commission to Study Charitable Gaming and Historical Horse Races  
   - **Purpose**: The bill created a commission to study charitable gaming and historical horse races.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - An amendment to clarify appointment processes for commission members failed (10-10).  
   - **Outcome**: The original bill passed unanimously (20-0) and will proceed to the regular calendar.

3. **Senate Bill 104 (SB 104)**: Scholarships for Community Colleges  
   - **Purpose**: The bill addressed scholarships for community colleges but had flaws in its funding mechanism.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to retain the bill for further work.

4. **Senate Bill 191 (SB 191)**: Surcharges on Electric Vehicles  
   - **Purpose**: The bill imposed surcharges on electric vehicles to fund road maintenance.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 13-7 to retain the bill for further study, recognizing the complexity of the issue and the need for more coordination across committees.

### **Efficiency and Preparation**

The committee chair commended members for their efficiency and preparation, noting that some bills were skipped due to lack of readiness. The committee planned work sessions for upcoming bills, including an amendment to **Senate Bill 19**, which extends bingo hours, and **Senate Bill 112**, which aims to create a dedicated fund for problem gambling.
