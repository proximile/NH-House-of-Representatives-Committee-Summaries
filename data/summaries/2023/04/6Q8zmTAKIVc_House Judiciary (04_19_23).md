The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 19, 2023, centered on several key legislative discussions, including data privacy, medical malpractice screening panels, and assisted reproduction laws. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

### **Data Privacy Legislation (Senate Bill 255)**
The primary focus of the meeting was **Senate Bill 255**, which aims to establish consumer data privacy rights and obligations for businesses handling personal data in New Hampshire. Key points included:

1. **Consumer Rights**: The bill grants consumers rights to access, correct, delete, and obtain copies of their personal data. It also allows them to opt out of data processing for purposes like targeted advertising and introduces a "universal opt-out" mechanism for broader control. Sensitive data would require opt-in consent, and companies would be prohibited from using "dark patterns" to manipulate consent.

2. **Business Obligations**: Businesses, particularly larger ones, would need to comply with transparency, data minimization, and security standards. They would also conduct risk assessments for data processing activities that could harm consumers. Smaller businesses, however, are largely exempt from compliance.

3. **Enforcement and Concerns**: Enforcement would be handled by the New Hampshire Attorney General, with no private right of action for consumers. This raised concerns about the adequacy of enforcement resources and the potential burden on the Attorney General’s office. Stakeholders, including Consumer Reports and privacy engineers, advocated for stronger enforcement mechanisms, such as a private right of action or increased funding for the Attorney General.

4. **Comparisons to Other States**: The bill is modeled after privacy laws in Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut, but differs from California’s more stringent laws. Some stakeholders, including Microsoft and the State Privacy and Security Coalition, supported the bill for its clarity and consistency, while others emphasized the need for stronger consumer protections.

5. **Financial and Operational Impact**: The fiscal impact of the bill remains unclear, with concerns about the additional workload for the Attorney General’s office and the lack of direct funding from fines collected.

### **Medical Malpractice Screening Panels (Senate Bill 65)**
The second major topic was the proposed repeal of the **medical malpractice screening panel system** under **Senate Bill 65**. Key points included:

1. **Background and Ineffectiveness**: The panel system, established in 2005, was intended to reduce costs, expedite case resolution, and weed out frivolous claims. However, it has been underutilized, costly, and ineffective, with only one case going through the panel in 2017. Most cases are resolved through mediation or trial without using the panels.

2. **Support for Repeal**: The judicial branch, represented by Richard Head, supported the repeal, citing inefficiencies and the administrative burden on the courts. Plaintiff attorneys Kimberly Kirkland and Holly Haynes also testified that the panels increase costs and delays without providing meaningful benefits.

3. **Opposition and Alternatives**: The New Hampshire Hospital Association and the New Hampshire Medical Society opposed immediate repeal, advocating for a pause and study period to explore potential reforms. They suggested alternatives, such as making the process voluntary or more efficient.

4. **Arguments for Repeal**: Proponents of repeal argued that the panel system is outdated, redundant, and no longer necessary, given the current state of medical malpractice litigation and insurance markets. They emphasized that most cases are resolved through mediation, making the panels unnecessary.

### **Assisted Reproduction Law (Senate Bill 264)**
The meeting also briefly discussed **Senate Bill 264**, which aims to update New Hampshire’s assisted reproduction statute to reflect modern family structures, including same-sex couples and diverse family formations. The bill seeks to reduce unnecessary court proceedings, such as confirmatory adoption hearings, for same-sex couples who have biological children. It received bipartisan support in the Senate, with minor adjustments made to address language concerns.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
1. **Data Privacy**: Stakeholders emphasized the need for clear, consistent, and enforceable privacy laws. While the bill was seen as a positive step, concerns about enforcement mechanisms, resource allocation, and the lack of a private right of action were raised.

2. **Medical Malpractice Panels**: There was widespread agreement that the current screening panel system is ineffective, costly, and redundant. While some advocated for immediate repeal, others suggested a temporary pause to explore potential reforms.

3. **Assisted Reproduction**: The proposed updates to assisted reproduction laws were seen as necessary to reflect modern family structures and reduce unnecessary legal hurdles for same-sex couples.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the need for thoughtful legislation that balances consumer protections, business interests, and administrative efficiency. Further refinement and stakeholder input were deemed essential for both the data privacy and medical malpractice bills.
