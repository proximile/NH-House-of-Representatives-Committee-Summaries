### **Key Bills and Amendments**

#### **SB 14: Game Cameras and Landowner Rights**
1. **Amendment 1446H**: Proposed by the vice chair, this amendment aimed to revise hunting regulations and game camera usage on state or municipally owned property. It also sought to reduce fines for violations. After debate, the amendment failed with **8 yeas, 11 nays, and 1 no vote**.
2. **Amendment 1466**: Introduced by Representative Spleen, this amendment sought to balance landowner privacy and hunting practices:
   - Prohibited game cameras within **300 feet of an occupied building or driveway** without landowner permission.
   - Allowed landowners to post **no-camera signs** at property entrances.
   - Reduced fines for violations from **$1,000 to $100**, with a **warning** for first-time offenses.
   - Clarified that prohibiting cameras would not affect landowners' eligibility for the **20% current use tax discount**.
   - The amendment passed narrowly with **9 in favor, 10 opposed**, though concerns were raised about enforcement, the 300-foot restriction, and potential abuse of landowner permissions.
3. **Retention Motion**: Representative Tudor argued for retaining the bill to refine it further, but the motion failed with **9 in favor, 10 opposed**.
4. **OTP Motion**: Representatives debated whether to pass the Senate bill as is or retain it for revisions. The OTP motion passed with **10 yeas, 9 nays, and 1 no vote**, though concerns about property surveillance and discrimination persisted.

#### **SB 15: Tree Stands and Landowner Permission**
1. **Amendment 2023-1381h**: This amendment replaced the requirement for **written permission** from landowners with **verbal permission** for hunters to place tree stands or blinds on private property. It also extended the deadline for removing tree stands from **January 1st to April 1st** and required hunters to label their stands with their name and contact information. The amendment passed overwhelmingly with **18 votes in favor, 1 opposed, and 1 absent**.
