The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee meeting on April 25, 2023, focused on several legislative bills related to charitable gaming, online gaming, and historic horse racing (HHR). The discussions highlighted the significant role of charitable gaming in funding nonprofits, the potential impacts of new gaming technologies, and the need for regulatory updates. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and debates from the meeting:

---

### **Charitable Gaming and Revenue**
Charitable gaming plays a vital role in New Hampshire, generating $20-28 million annually for approximately 1,000 charities. However, concerns were raised about the potential impact of online gaming on brick-and-mortar charitable gaming venues. Evidence from other states suggests that the introduction of online gaming has led to declines in physical casino revenues. Additionally, the introduction of **Historic Horse Racing (HHR)** has increased revenues but also changed funding models, with some operators now splitting revenues between two charities per event. Questions were raised about the fairness of charging charities rent despite increased HHR revenues.

### **Senate Bill 104: Online Gaming**
**Senate Bill 104** proposes legalizing online gaming, with revenues directed toward education, particularly scholarships for community college students and workforce development programs. The bill sparked significant debate:  
- **Supporters**, including Senator Tim Lang, argued that online gaming would generate new revenue without cannibalizing brick-and-mortar charitable gaming, citing New Jersey’s experience. They also emphasized consumer protections and the potential to attract a new demographic of users.  
- **Opponents**, including former Representative John Graham and charitable organizations like the New Hampshire Historical Society and Meals on Wheels, expressed concerns that online gaming could divert funds from brick-and-mortar venues, reducing income for charities that rely on gaming revenues.  
- The bill includes provisions to protect charities, such as increasing wager limits and advertising brick-and-mortar locations through the online platform. However, questions remained about its alignment with the state constitution and whether projected revenues ($40 million by 2026) represent new income or a shift from existing gaming activities.

### **Senate Bill 51: HHR Moratorium and Study Commission**
**Senate Bill 51** proposes extending a moratorium on new HHR licenses until 2026 and establishing a study commission to examine the impact of HHR and other charitable gaming activities on revenues and charities. The commission would include representatives from the AG’s office, lottery, charities, and gaming operators. While there was broad support for the study, some questioned the necessity of the requested $250,000 for expert consultations. Discussions emphasized the importance of including diverse stakeholders and addressing issues like revenue splits, charity selection processes, and the need for audits to ensure transparency.

### **Senate Bill 120: Charitable Gaming Licenses and Wager Limits**
**Senate Bill 120**, presented by Senator Lang, proposes extending charitable gaming licenses from an annual to a three-year process and increasing the wager limit to $50. The bill aims to help charities retain more funds, allow operators to raise employee wages, and keep New Hampshire competitive with neighboring states. Concerns were raised about the deletion of specific penalty provisions, but it was clarified that these are further detailed in existing rules. Public testimony highlighted potential risks, such as increased problem gambling and lack of municipal control over gaming limits.

### **Senate Bill 119: Background Checks**
**Senate Bill 119** proposes eliminating background checks for charitable board members unless they are directly involved in gaming operations. This bill aims to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy while maintaining checks for those actively involved in gaming. Background checks for games of chance cost $48 and are conducted by the FBI, while bingo and Lucky Seven games do not require checks.

### **Senate Bill 112: Pari-Mutuel Pools and HHR**
**Senate Bill 112** proposes changes to RSA 284, including removing the 40-mile simulcasting buffer for HHR facilities, eliminating language allowing simulcasting at such facilities, and repealing the requirement that 70% of employees at racing facilities must be New Hampshire residents. These changes aim to modernize outdated regulations, particularly since live racing is no longer active in the state. However, stakeholders raised concerns about changes to the calculation of "breakage" (leftover funds from wagers after payouts), which could disincentivize simulcasting operations. The bill also addresses the allocation of breakage funds, with a portion potentially going to the problem gaming fund.

### **Future Considerations**
Throughout the meeting, representatives emphasized the need for data-driven decisions and long-term solutions to balance the growth of charitable gaming with the needs of the nonprofit sector. The proposed study commission is expected to provide insights into how to address challenges posed by new gaming technologies and revenue-sharing models. Further work sessions were planned to address unresolved issues, particularly the technical and fiscal implications of online gaming and HHR.

In summary, the meeting highlighted the complex interplay between charitable gaming, online gaming, and HHR, with a focus on ensuring that nonprofits continue to benefit while addressing regulatory and technological challenges. The committee’s decisions will hinge on balancing economic opportunities with the protection of charitable organizations and the existing gaming ecosystem.
