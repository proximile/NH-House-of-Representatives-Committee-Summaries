**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting - Municipal and County Government (04/20/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 20, 2023, focused on several key bills addressing municipal and county government issues, including housing development, broadband infrastructure, emergency housing, and immigration enforcement. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Housing Development and Affordability**
1. **Senate Bill 47 (SB 47)**:
   - **Purpose**: Reestablish a commission to study barriers to increased residential development density, addressing New Hampshire’s housing shortage (estimated at nearly 24,000 units).
   - **Key Issues**: Outdated septic system standards, restrictive zoning regulations, and the need for workforce housing.
   - **Proposals**: Study public water and sewer systems, property tax incentives, and enforcement of workforce housing responsibilities under RSA 674:58-61.
   - **Concerns**: Lack of local planner representation on the commission, potential overlaps with other bills (e.g., SB 84), and balancing development with environmental conservation.
   - **Amendment**: Adjusted commission membership; passed the Senate with a voice vote.

2. **Senate Bill 78 (SB 78)**:
   - **Purpose**: Streamline subdivision regulations to reduce costs and delays in housing development.
   - **Proposals**: Increase the allowed cost escalation factor from 10% to 15%, require municipalities to release bonds within 20 days of work completion, and clarify enforcement of bond release rules.
   - **Concerns**: Increased administrative burden on municipalities and affordability of new housing units.

### **Broadband Infrastructure**
1. **Senate Bill 222 (SB 222)**:
   - **Purpose**: Enable municipalities to use municipal revenue bonds (not taxpayer-funded) to finance broadband infrastructure, updating the definition of broadband to 100 Mbps upload and 20 Mbps download.
   - **Key Issues**: Improving access in underserved rural areas, high deployment costs, and reliance on federal funding.
   - **Support**: Seen as a critical tool for expanding broadband, particularly in rural areas like Carroll County.
   - **Concerns**: Feasibility of fiber optics in rural areas, affordability of satellite internet (e.g., Starlink), and the need for consistent service standards.

### **Emergency Housing and Municipal Welfare**
1. **Senate Bill 110 (SB 110)**:
   - **Purpose**: Clarify residency and reimbursement responsibilities for municipalities providing emergency housing and services to transient individuals or residents of other towns.
   - **Key Issues**:
     - **Residency Definition**: Individuals in emergency housing remain residents of their original municipality for 30 days after leaving.
     - **Reimbursement**: Municipalities must coordinate reimbursement, with flexibility based on affordability.
     - **Transient Individuals**: Challenges in determining residency and ensuring voting rights.
   - **Concerns**: Uncertainty about reimbursement mechanisms and the burden on municipalities like Laconia, which often bear the cost of services for non-residents.
   - **Proposals**: County-level funding to distribute costs more equitably.

### **Immigration Enforcement and Sanctuary Policies**
1. **Senate Bill 132 (SB 132)**:
   - **Purpose**: Prohibit municipalities from adopting “sanctuary policies” that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
   - **Key Issues**:
     - **Opposition**: Strong pushback from law enforcement, community leaders, and advocacy groups, who argued the bill would erode trust with immigrant communities, deter crime reporting, and complicate policing.
     - **Support**: Proponents framed the bill as necessary to maintain law and order and prevent New Hampshire from adopting policies they believe would lead to societal decline.
     - **Concerns**: Broad and vague language, potential First Amendment violations, and the bill’s inconsistency with New Hampshire’s tradition of local control.
   - **Law Enforcement Testimony**: Police chiefs and sheriffs opposed the bill, emphasizing that it would harm public safety and divert resources from their primary duties.
   - **Public Testimony**: Immigrants and advocates highlighted the economic and social contributions of immigrant communities and warned of increased racial profiling and Fourth Amendment violations.

### **Other Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 88 (SB 88)**:
   - **Purpose**: Increase the annual membership fee cap for town officers associations from $20 to $50, adjusted for inflation since 1977.
   - **Discussion**: Questions about which associations are included and the fee structure.

2. **Senate Bill 111 (SB 111)**:
   - **Purpose**: Clarify responsibilities and authorities of municipalities with a town council-town manager form of government, ensuring town clerks remain elected positions.
   - **Discussion**: Focused on the need for clarity and grammatical structure of the bill.

1. **Housing Crisis**: Multiple bills (SB 47, SB 78) addressed New Hampshire’s housing shortage, focusing on regulatory barriers, infrastructure, and affordability.
2. **Broadband Expansion**: SB 222 aimed to improve broadband access in underserved areas, with discussions on funding mechanisms and deployment challenges.
3. **Emergency Housing**: SB 110 sought to clarify residency and reimbursement for emergency housing, with concerns about cost-sharing and implementation.
