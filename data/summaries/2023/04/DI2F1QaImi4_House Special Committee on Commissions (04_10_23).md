**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (04/10/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions convened on April 10, 2023, to address inefficiencies, redundancies, and oversight challenges within the state’s legislative commissions, committees, and related entities. The meeting focused on streamlining processes, improving accountability, and ensuring these bodies effectively serve legislative goals. Key themes and discussions included:

### **1. Challenges with the Current System**
   - **Proliferation and Redundancy**: The number of legislative commissions and committees has grown significantly over the years, leading to duplication of efforts and wasted resources. Many commissions overlap in subject matter, and some are inactive or fail to fulfill their statutory mandates.
   - **Resource Strain**: The sheer volume of commissions consumes significant time and resources for legislators and staff. Limited availability of legislators, who often serve on multiple committees, further dilutes effectiveness.
   - **Quorum and Turnover Issues**: High turnover among legislators and difficulties in achieving quorums delay commission work, with some commissions sitting vacant for months.
   - **Lack of Oversight**: Standing committee chairs often lose authority and insight when new commissions are created, leading to a lack of continuity and awareness of ongoing work.
   - **Appointment Challenges**: Appointing members to commissions is time-consuming, particularly at the start of a new term. Specific appointment requirements (e.g., needing a breastfeeding mother) complicate the process.

### **2. Communication and Accountability**
   - **Reporting and Oversight**: Ensuring commission reports reach appropriate stakeholders, particularly committee chairs, is critical to avoid duplication and ensure utility. There is a need for better communication and coordination between legislative and executive branches.
   - **Accountability Issues**: Many commissions lack accountability, with some not meeting or producing actionable reports. Tracking commissions and updating legislative management systems is manual and often outdated.

### **3. Process and Structural Improvements**
   - **Standardization**: There is a need for standardized processes in creating, managing, and reporting on commissions. Suggestions include developing standardized templates, clear sunset provisions, and consistent language for quorum requirements and member attendance.
   - **Consolidation and Elimination**: The committee discussed consolidating or eliminating redundant commissions to reduce inefficiencies and focus resources on productive entities.
   - **Legislative vs. Statutory Commissions**: Legislative commissions (e.g., chaptered study committees) are often more efficient than statutory commissions, as legislators drive the process and can achieve quorums more easily.

### **4. Cultural and Educational Shifts**
   - **Cultural Resistance**: Legislators often prefer creating new commissions rather than using existing structures, despite the inefficiencies. A cultural shift is needed to prioritize more efficient study methods and recognize the authority of standing committees.
   - **Educational Initiatives**: Educating new legislators about the time and responsibilities involved in serving on commissions is essential to manage expectations and reduce unnecessary commission creation.

### **5. Legislative Efforts and Future Steps**
   - **Recent Efforts**: Legislative actions, such as amendments to RSA 1449 in 2022 and Senate Bill 84, have attempted to address these issues by setting term limits, capping membership, and standardizing processes. However, further refinement is needed.
   - **Proposed Solutions**: The committee considered forming subcommittees to tackle specific issues, such as process improvements and reviewing existing commissions. Recommendations include consolidating commissions, improving the appointment process, and ensuring commissions are attached to appropriate executive branch agencies for administrative support.
   - **Next Steps**: The committee plans to meet regularly, gather more data, and propose actionable recommendations to streamline the commission system, reduce redundancy, and improve functionality and accountability.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for comprehensive reforms to address the inefficiencies and challenges associated with New Hampshire’s legislative commissions. By focusing on standardization, consolidation, accountability, and cultural shifts, the committee aims to create a more effective and streamlined system that aligns with legislative priorities and reduces the strain on legislators and staff.
