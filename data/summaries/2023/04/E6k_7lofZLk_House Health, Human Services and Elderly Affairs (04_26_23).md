**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting on April 26, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on April 26, 2023, to discuss a wide range of healthcare-related bills and amendments. The meeting addressed critical issues such as **Medicaid expansion**, **vaccine administration**, **telehealth services**, **mental health care**, and **harm reduction strategies**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Medicaid Expansion (Senate Bill 263, SB 263)**
The committee extensively debated **Senate Bill 263**, which proposes making Medicaid expansion permanent by removing the sunset clause currently in place. Key points included:
- **Support for Permanent Expansion**: Many representatives, including **Rep. Weber**, highlighted the success of Medicaid expansion in improving public health, reducing uncompensated care for providers, and serving as a safety net for vulnerable populations. They emphasized its role in helping individuals recover from life crises and reintegrate into the workforce.
- **Concerns About Sunset Clause**: Others, such as **Rep. Leon**, argued for retaining the sunset clause to allow periodic reviews and updates to the program. Concerns were raised about outdated language, unenforceable work requirements, and the need to address systemic issues like the "benefits cliff," where individuals lose benefits if their income increases.
- **Economic and Social Impact**: The discussion underscored the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion, including lower healthcare premiums for employers and increased workforce productivity. However, some representatives expressed concerns about long-term financial sustainability and the potential for Medicaid to become a crutch rather than a stepping stone.
- **Federal and State Context**: Representatives noted the federal-state partnership of Medicaid and the need for longer-term planning to stabilize provider reimbursement rates and improve care delivery. The committee ultimately voted 19-0 to adopt **SB 263** as is, signaling strong support for permanent expansion.

### **2. Vaccine Administration (Senate Bill 200, SB 200)**
The committee debated **Senate Bill 200**, which sought to expand the ability of optometrists to administer certain vaccines, including COVID-19, influenza, and shingles vaccines. Key points included:
- **Safety and Training Concerns**: Some representatives expressed hesitancy about allowing optometrists to administer vaccines, particularly COVID-19 vaccines, due to concerns about safety, training, and the lack of long-term data.
- **Access to Vaccines**: Supporters of the bill emphasized the need to increase vaccine access, especially in rural areas where healthcare providers are scarce. Despite this, an amendment to the bill failed with a vote of 4-16.
- **Amendment on mRNA Vaccines**: **Rep. Palazzov** proposed an amendment to exclude newer or controversial vaccines, such as those using mRNA technology, until July 2025. The committee discussed the amendment but did not vote on it during this session.

### **3. Telehealth Services (Senate Bill 238, SB 238)**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 238**, which initially focused on telehealth prescribing for mental health services. **Rep. Murphy** proposed an amendment to expand its scope by incorporating language from **House Bill 500**, which had already passed unanimously. Key points included:
- **Broadening Telehealth Access**: The amendment aimed to expand telehealth prescribing for a wider range of conditions, particularly in rural areas where access to in-person care is limited.
- **Informed Consent**: The discussion emphasized the importance of obtaining clear consent, especially for minors, and ensuring that consent is specific to each treatment or procedure.
- **Training Requirements**: The committee agreed to continue refining the amendment, with a focus on informed consent and training requirements for providers.

### **4. Mental Health and Behavioral Health (Senate Bill 85, SB 85)**
The committee debated **Senate Bill 85**, which addresses mental health crises and insurance regulations. Key points included:
- **Concerns About Self-Declared Emergencies**: **Rep. Leon** expressed concerns about self-declared mental health emergencies leading to significant changes in insurance regulations.
- **Mobile Crisis Teams**: **Rep. Shapiro** highlighted the bill's focus on mobile crisis teams and forming a commission to study sustainable funding. The committee ultimately voted 10-9 to recommend the bill be "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), meaning it should not move forward.

### **5. Harm Reduction and Drug Checking**
The committee discussed harm reduction strategies, including the identification of substances like Fentanyl and Xylitol in drug checking stations. Representatives emphasized the importance of these strategies in ensuring public safety and health.

---

### **6. End-of-Life Care and Chronic Pain Management**
The committee highlighted the need to protect end-of-life care and chronic pain patients, ensuring they receive appropriate pain management without stigma or barriers.

---

### **7. Other Bills and Amendments**
- **Senate Bill 87 (SB 87)**: The committee unanimously passed an amendment to clarify supervision requirements for unlicensed student nurses providing healthcare services at camps. The bill, as amended, also passed unanimously (19-0).
- **Senate Bill 127 (SB 127)**: The committee decided to continue discussions on this bill, which involves fee structures for certain services, to the following week.
- **House Bill 240 (HB 240)**: A subcommittee was proposed to further examine the bill, which involves consent for medical treatment, particularly for minors.

### **Key Themes**

- **Informed Consent**: There was a strong focus on the need for clear and specific consent protocols, especially for minors and vulnerable populations.
