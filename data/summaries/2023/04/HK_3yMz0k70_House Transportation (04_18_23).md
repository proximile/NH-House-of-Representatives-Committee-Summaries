**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (04/18/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on April 18, 2023, to discuss several key legislative initiatives aimed at addressing transportation-related issues, including licensing discrepancies, vehicle safety, and the challenges faced by seasonal agricultural workers. The meeting featured detailed discussions on multiple Senate bills, with testimonies from stakeholders, experts, and representatives. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **1. Licensing Discrepancies and H-2A Visa Issues**
- **Senate Bill 187**: The bill focuses on allowing H-2A visa holders (seasonal agricultural workers) to drive in New Hampshire using their home country licenses or international permits, provided they are in the state for less than a year and meet specific criteria. Farmers testified about the critical nature of these workers to the agricultural industry and the difficulties they face due to the temporary nature of their stay and lack of reciprocity agreements with countries like Jamaica. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) expressed support for the farming community but raised technical concerns about the bill’s language and its potential impact on other visa categories. The DMV is actively working to establish reciprocity agreements to address these challenges.

### **2. Catalytic Converter Theft**
- **Senate Bill 188**: Introduced by Senator Fenton, this bill aims to curb catalytic converter theft by imposing record-keeping requirements on scrap metal dealers. Sellers would be required to provide proof of identification and ownership documents. Stakeholders, including auto dealers and rental companies, highlighted the significant impact of catalytic converter theft on businesses and consumers. The effectiveness of similar legislation in neighboring states was also discussed, emphasizing the need for stricter enforcement to deter theft.

### **3. Off-Highway Recreational Vehicle (OHRV) Safety**
- **Senate Bill 256**: This bill proposes a phased approach to improve safety for OHRV operators, requiring individuals born after January 1, 1978, to complete a safety course. The bill received strong support from stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Off-Highway Vehicle Association and Fish and Game Law Enforcement. Key features include:
  - Free in-person training and a $34.95 online option.
  - A temporary one-hour course for renters, focusing on etiquette and rules of the road.
  - Emphasis on reducing accidents and improving rider etiquette to maintain access to private lands and trails, which are vital to the state’s OHRV economy.

Concerns were raised about unclear language in the bill, particularly regarding the "born after" date requirement, prompting suggestions for clearer wording. Fish and Game confirmed its readiness to handle increased demand for safety courses, aligning with existing boater safety programs and Vermont’s approach.

### **4. Recovery of Search and Rescue (SAR) Expenses**
- **Senate Bill 13 FN**: Introduced by Senator David Waters, this bill allows the DMV to suspend or revoke a driver’s license if an individual fails to pay for SAR expenses incurred due to their negligence. The bill builds on existing statutes by adding a certification process, notification, and appeals mechanisms. The Hike Safe Card program, which allows individuals to cover SAR costs even if negligent, has been successful, generating $311,000 in 2022. SAR operations are costly, with negligence narrowly defined, and only a small number of bills are sent annually after thorough follow-up and payment plans are exhausted. The bill also includes reciprocity agreements with other states to enforce license suspensions for non-residents.

### **5. Rear-Facing Car Seats for Children Under Two**
- **Senate Bill 118**: This bill mandates rear-facing car seats for children under two, aligning with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Supporters, including experts from Dartmouth Health and AAA, highlighted studies showing that rear-facing seats reduce the risk of severe injuries by 70% by protecting the head, neck, and spine. The bill emphasizes education and accessibility, with grants available for low-income families. Concerns were raised about the bill’s impact on low-income families, potential space issues in vehicles, and the risk of parents prematurely switching to forward-facing seats once the child turns two. Representative Leon argued for education over legislation, citing limited data on crashes involving young children in New Hampshire.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on enhancing public safety, supporting critical industries like agriculture and tourism, and addressing enforcement gaps. Key outcomes include:
- Support for **Senate Bill 187** to address licensing challenges for H-2A visa holders, with ongoing efforts to establish reciprocity agreements.
- Advancement of **Senate Bill 188** to combat catalytic converter theft through stricter record-keeping requirements.
- Strong backing for **Senate Bill 256** to improve OHRV safety, with clarifications needed on certain language.
- Endorsement of **Senate Bill 13 FN** to recover SAR costs through license suspensions, ensuring accountability for negligent behavior.
- Mixed reactions to **Senate Bill 118**, with support for its safety benefits but concerns about its impact on low-income families and the need for education over enforcement.

The discussions highlighted the importance of balancing legislative action with practical considerations, stakeholder input, and the economic and social implications of proposed policies. The committee plans to address technical concerns and refine language in the bills before advancing them further.
