The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on April 19, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several education-related bills and issues. The meeting focused on key topics such as civics education, accountability systems, charter schools, data collection, and specific legislative proposals. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

#### **1. Civics Education and Accountability**
The committee extensively discussed **Civics Education**, emphasizing its importance in fostering a democratic and respectful society. Key points included:
- **Civics Education Bill (SB 216)**: The bill mandates civics education from elementary through high school, integrating it into the curriculum alongside history and government courses. Amendments were proposed to ensure the curriculum remains nonpartisan and includes civic virtues like honor, humility, and integrity. However, some amendments were rejected for being overly prescriptive.
- **Naturalization Test Concerns**: Teachers raised issues about the naturalization test, suggesting it is time-consuming and advocating for alternative assessments to better measure students' understanding.
- **Accountability and Reporting**: The bill includes provisions for accountability in schools, requiring regular reporting to the State Board of Education. Discussions centered on whether the commissioner or a designee should present these reports, as well as concerns about data breaches and the unique pupil identifier system.
- **Legislative Oversight**: The committee emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in monitoring school performance and ensuring data security.

The committee addressed several administrative and procedural issues:
- **Transfer Credits**: Policies for transferring credits, including for students with commercial pilot licenses or advanced placement credits, were confirmed to be in place and approved by the Higher Education Commission.
- **Accreditation and Conflicts of Interest**: Concerns about potential conflicts of interest among trustees involved in accrediting educational institutions were addressed, with trustees required to recuse themselves if their institutions are up for accreditation.
- **Special Education Dispute Resolution (SB 135)**: The committee discussed a bill related to alternative dispute resolution in special education. An amendment was proposed to clarify that dispute resolution cannot be initiated if a parent refuses services entirely, but it was voted down as existing laws already address this issue.

Some advocated for state-specific systems to complement federal requirements, while others emphasized the need to mirror federal plans to avoid conflicting standards.
- **Data Collection and Indicators**: The importance of specific data indicators, such as dual enrollment, International Baccalaureate (IB) programs, Advanced Placement (AP) courses, and college and career readiness metrics, was highlighted.

- **Unique Student Identifiers**: The committee debated the use of SASID numbers versus "unique people identifiers," emphasizing the need for clarity and consistency in terminology.
