### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on House Bill 253 and Senate Bill 253 (April 25, 2023)

The NH House of Representatives meeting on April 25, 2023, focused on two key bills addressing parental access to minors' medical and mental health records: **House Bill 253 (HB 253)** and **Senate Bill 253 (SB 253)**. The discussions centered on balancing parental rights with minors' privacy, particularly in the context of mental health care, while addressing legal and practical concerns. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **House Bill 253 (HB 253)**
1. **Overview and Relationship to HB 406**:  
   - HB 253 and **House Bill 406 (HB 406)** share similar concepts but differ in language and technicality. HB 253 is less technical and avoids certain legal standards present in HB 406.  
   - Both bills focus on parental access to minors' medical records, particularly through online portals, which are distinct from full medical records.  

2. **Parental Access and Privacy Concerns**:  
   - Testimonies highlighted concerns about parental access to minors' mental health records, with some arguing that allowing parents access to therapy notes could discourage minors from seeking care or being open with therapists.  
   - Others shared personal anecdotes where lack of access to medical records led to adverse outcomes, emphasizing the need for parental involvement.  

3. **Mental Health Crisis**:  
   - Advocates stressed the importance of confidentiality in mental health care for minors, citing rising rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidality. They urged the committee to prioritize youth privacy and access to care.  

4. **Committee Decision**:  
   - The committee debated whether to retain HB 253 for further work or table it. Some representatives argued for retaining it to potentially strengthen HB 406, while others, like Representative Bickford, opposed it, calling it unnecessary and poorly constructed.  
   - Ultimately, the committee voted to **retain HB 253** for further work, with the possibility of combining or aligning it with HB 406 to address conflicting language and balance parental rights with minors' privacy.

### **Senate Bill 253 (SB 253)**
1. **Bill Overview**:  
   - SB 253 proposes that parents have full access to their child’s medical records unless a healthcare provider determines, based on **clear and convincing evidence**, that disclosure would result in abuse or neglect.  
   - It includes protections for healthcare providers to withhold records if they believe disclosure would endanger the child.  

2. **Concerns Raised**:  
   - **Conflicting Standards**: Opponents argued that the bill introduces a higher standard of proof (clear and convincing evidence) than existing state law (reasonable belief) for abuse and neglect reporting, creating potential conflicts.  
   - **Child Safety**: Critics expressed concern that the bill could harm children in abusive or neglectful situations by making it harder for healthcare providers to withhold records.  
   - **Mental Health Records**: Testifiers highlighted the risks of including mental health records in the bill, as they are often highly sensitive and could be misused by parents.  
   - **Federal Law**: Some argued the bill conflicts with HIPAA, which already allows withholding records if disclosure could endanger the child.  

3. **Support for the Bill**:  
   - Proponents, including Senator Dan Ennis (the bill’s sponsor), emphasized that the bill reinforces parents’ rights to access their child’s medical records and provides clarity in cases where records are withheld.  
   - Supporters argued that the bill protects both parents and children by ensuring transparency while allowing exceptions in cases of potential harm.  

4. **Proposed Amendments**:  
   - Opponents suggested amendments to align the bill with existing state and federal laws, such as replacing “clear and convincing evidence” with “reasonable belief” and clarifying HIPAA compliance.  

5. **Testimony Highlights**:  
   - **Dr. Julie Kim** (pediatric oncologist) opposed the bill, citing the importance of maintaining a safe space for adolescent patients to discuss sensitive health issues without fear of parental disclosure.  
   - **Matthew Hood** (Dartmouth Health) raised concerns about conflicting standards and the potential for harm if records are disclosed to abusive parents.  
   - **Paula Minahan** (NH Hospital Association) proposed amendments to ensure consistency with current laws and protect minors’ rights.  

6. **Committee Dynamics**:  
   - Committee members debated the bill’s necessity, with some questioning why it was needed if parental access to medical records is already a constitutional right.  
   - Discussions also touched on the developmental differences in treating younger children versus adolescents and the importance of teaching teens to manage their healthcare.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Balancing Rights and Privacy**: Both bills sparked debates about how to balance parental rights with minors’ privacy, particularly in the context of mental health care.  
2. **Legal and Practical Concerns**: Concerns were raised about conflicting standards, federal law compliance, and the potential for harm in abusive or neglectful situations.  
3. **Next Steps**:  
   - HB 253 was retained for further work, with the possibility of combining or aligning it with HB 406.  
   - SB 253 faced calls for amendments to address legal inconsistencies and protect minors’ rights, with further discussions expected.  

The meeting highlighted a divide between those who see the bills as necessary reaffirmations of parental rights and those who view them as potential threats to child safety and consistency with existing laws. The committee’s decisions reflect an ongoing effort to refine these proposals to better serve both parents and minors.
