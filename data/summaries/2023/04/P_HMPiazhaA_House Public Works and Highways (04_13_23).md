**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Public Works and Highways Meeting (04/13/23)**

The New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee convened on April 13, 2023, to discuss several key legislative items, including **Senate Bill 228 FN**, **affordable housing development on state-owned land**, and **Senate Bill 258**. The discussions centered on the preservation and improvement of public recreational facilities, the challenges of developing affordable housing, and the transfer of surplus state properties for historical preservation.

### **Senate Bill 228 FN: Hilton Park Boat Ramp and Dock Renovation**
The committee focused on **Senate Bill 228 FN**, which proposes the renovation of the **Hilton Park boat ramp** in **Dover** and the construction of a new dock. The project aims to enhance community benefits, including expanding educational programs, reducing costs for local schools, and serving as a venue for the annual **Piscataqua Riverfest**, which celebrates maritime heritage and conservation.

**Key Points:**
1. **Potential Benefits**: The new dock and ramp would support educational initiatives, reduce costs for surrounding schools, and provide a site for community events like Riverfest.
2. **Tidal Challenges**: Concerns were raised about low tide conditions affecting boat access, prompting discussions on the need for careful timing or dredging.
3. **Funding and Study**: The bill does not allocate state funds but proposes a feasibility study involving the **Department of Fish and Game**, **Department of Transportation (DOT)**, and **Pease Development Authority (PDA)**. Federal funding opportunities for waterfront projects were also discussed.
4. **Vagueness and Concerns**: Some representatives criticized the bill for lacking specificity regarding authority, funding, and project details, calling it "nebulous."
5. **Motion and Recess**: A motion to pass the bill was withdrawn due to a lack of consensus. The committee decided to revisit the bill later in April or May, potentially amending it to address concerns.

### **Affordable Housing Development on State-Owned Land**
The committee also discussed the challenges of developing affordable housing on state-owned land, particularly in **Newington**. The state owns thousands of properties, some of which are suitable for affordable housing, but current laws and financial constraints complicate their development.

**Key Points:**
1. **Land Acquisition and Discounts**: The difficulty of developing affordable housing on land acquired at full market value was highlighted. The ability of the commissioner to negotiate discounts with **New Hampshire Housing** was emphasized, particularly for properties with long-term restrictions.
2. **Newington Property**: A specific property in Newington, state-owned for over 70 years, was discussed. The **Newington Historical Society** seeks to preserve it for public use, but the town has been reluctant due to financial and maintenance concerns.
3. **Non-Profit Involvement**: Current laws restrict the transfer of state-owned property to public entities, barring non-profits like the **New Hampshire Preservation Alliance** from taking over. This limitation hinders potential stewardship of such properties.

### **Senate Bill 258: Transfer of Surplus State Property**
The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 258**, which addresses the disposal of surplus state property, including a former **railway depot in Newington**. The bill aims to allow **historical societies**, in addition to municipalities, to acquire such properties for preservation purposes.

**Key Points:**
1. **Purpose of SB 258**: The bill seeks to enable historical societies to acquire surplus state properties for preservation, allowing sales at **less than fair market value** if there are historical, social, environmental, or economic benefits.
2. **Concerns Raised**:
   - **Conflicting Language**: Inconsistencies in the bill regarding below-market-value sales were noted.
   - **Town Involvement**: Questions arose about the lack of full support from the town of Newington and whether the state should override local interests.
   - **Reversion Clause**: Concerns were raised about what happens if the historical society fails or no longer needs the property.
   - **Scope of the Bill**: The broad language of the bill raised concerns about potential misuse or unintended consequences.
3. **DOT’s Role**: **Adam Smith**, Assistant Administrator of the Bureau of Right-of-Way, clarified that the bill aligns with federal regulations and would require amendments to the state’s right-of-way manual. He emphasized that the process would involve multiple layers of approval.
4. **Affordable Housing**: **Ben Frost** of the **New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority** supported the bill and suggested including affordable housing as a valid purpose for below-market-value sales.
5. **Turnpike Concerns**: Representatives expressed concerns about the financial impact on the **Turnpike system**, but Smith noted that the Turnpike is unlikely to be significantly affected.
6. **Next Steps**: The committee will continue discussions, potentially narrowing the bill’s scope or adding safeguards to address concerns.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing public benefits, historical preservation, and financial responsibilities. Key issues included:
- The need for greater clarity and specificity in legislation, particularly regarding funding and project details.
- The challenges of developing affordable housing on state-owned land and the potential role of non-profits in preserving public properties.
- The importance of ensuring that surplus state property transfers serve the public interest without unintended consequences.

The committee’s discussions underscored the importance of addressing these issues through careful legislative action and collaboration with stakeholders.
