**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (April 10, 2023)**

On April 10, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened to discuss several Senate bills focused on energy efficiency, grid modernization, and renewable energy. The meeting centered on **Senate Bills 113, 161, 166, and 167**, each addressing distinct aspects of New Hampshire’s energy landscape. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Senate Bill 113: Clarifying Energy Efficiency Funding for Weatherization Programs**
The committee began with **SB 113**, which seeks to clarify the cost-effectiveness review of the **Joint Utility Energy Efficiency Plan (New Hampshire Saves)**. The bill addresses an interpretation by the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)** requiring **65% of energy savings to be electric**, applied to both annual and lifetime savings. This interpretation has limited funding for **weatherization programs**, which are long-term and primarily non-electric.

**Key Points:**
- **SB 113** proposes a one-word change to specify that the 65% electric savings requirement applies only to **annual savings**, not lifetime savings, thereby restoring funding for weatherization programs.
- Testimonies from **Senator Kevin Avard** (prime sponsor), the **Department of Energy**, **Eversource**, the **New Hampshire Home Builders Association**, and the **Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA)** supported the bill, emphasizing its importance for low-income households and local construction jobs.
- The bill aims to simplify utility planning and ensure consistent application of cost-effectiveness standards, aligning with the intent of **House Bill 549 (2022)**.

### **Senate Bill 161: Expanding Access to Solar for Low-Income Residents**
The discussion then shifted to **SB 161**, which aims to expand eligibility for **low-to-moderate income (LMI) community solar projects**, particularly for **public housing authorities** and **rental properties**.

**Key Points:**
- The bill would allow housing authorities and similar entities to participate in LMI solar projects, even if they use a **master meter** for utilities, thereby reducing energy costs for low-income residents.
- Testimonies from **Josh Meehan (Keene Housing Authority)**, **Sam Evans Brown (Clean Energy NH)**, and **Griffin Roberge (Department of Energy)** highlighted the financial strain of rising electricity costs and the need for solar projects to reduce expenses.
- The bill would enable more housing authorities to compete for renewable energy grants, leveraging existing funds without requiring additional state or federal funding.
- The **Department of Energy** proposed technical amendments to align the bill’s language with federal statutes.

### **Senate Bill 166: Grid Modernization**
The committee extensively discussed **SB 166**, which focuses on modernizing New Hampshire’s energy grid to increase competition, reliability, and efficiency.

**Key Points:**
- The bill establishes a **Grid Modernization Advisory Group** to address technical issues such as **advanced metering**, **interconnection**, and **storage**, and to develop market-based reforms.
- It aims to prepare the grid for future energy projects, including **offshore wind** and **electric vehicles**, and to manage **demand response** to stabilize energy costs.
- The **Department of Energy** raised technical concerns, particularly regarding **interconnection requirements** and **pilot programs**, and suggested amendments to clarify cost recovery for consultants.
- **Eversource Energy** supported the bill, emphasizing the importance of collaboration among utilities, state agencies, and legislators.
- The **Community Power Coalition** highlighted the potential benefits of **market-based approaches** to distributed energy resources, advocating for broader market participation.

### **Senate Bill 167: Green Hydrogen Infrastructure**
The final discussion centered on **SB 167**, which aims to establish a framework for **green hydrogen production, storage, and infrastructure** in New Hampshire.

**Key Points:**
- The bill includes **tax credits** to incentivize investment in green hydrogen projects, capped at $5 million annually, with a maximum of $500,000 per applicant.
- **Representative McGee** and **Representative Kaplan** proposed amendments to ensure the bill consistently refers to **green hydrogen** and excludes fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.
- **Senator David Waters** supported the bill but emphasized the need to include **nuclear energy** (e.g., Seabrook Nuclear Station) as a potential source for green hydrogen production.
- The bill proposes creating an **advisory committee** to oversee hydrogen infrastructure development, though some suggested converting it into a **legislative study committee** for better oversight.
- Safety and environmental concerns were discussed, with some representatives suggesting repurposing existing natural gas infrastructure for hydrogen transmission.

### **Key Themes Across All Bills**
1. **Equity in Energy Access**: Both **SB 161** and **SB 113** emphasize the importance of making energy efficiency and renewable energy accessible to low-income residents.
2. **Grid Modernization and Market-Based Approaches**: **SB 166** focuses on modernizing the grid and promoting market-driven solutions to energy development, with a focus on cost-effectiveness and avoiding cross-subsidization.
3. **Green Hydrogen Development**: **SB 167** positions green hydrogen as a key component of New Hampshire’s energy future, leveraging federal funding and private investment.
4. **Collaboration and Oversight**: All bills highlight the importance of collaboration among utilities, state agencies, and legislators, as well as the need for clear regulatory oversight and technical amendments.

### **Next Steps**
The committee plans to hold a **work session** to finalize the language of **SB 166** and **SB 167** and will likely vote on **SB 113** and **SB 161** soon. The discussions reflect a commitment to advancing New Hampshire’s energy goals while addressing technical, financial, and equity concerns.
