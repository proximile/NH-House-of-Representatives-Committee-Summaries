**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (04/11/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on April 11, 2023, to discuss several key bills and amendments related to education, mental health, workforce training, and student safety. The meeting highlighted a range of issues, from addressing the youth mental health crisis to improving school safety and expanding workforce training programs. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

### **Mental Health Education (SB 151)**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill SB 151**, which aims to incorporate **mental health education** into the state’s public school curriculum. The bill seeks to address the growing **youth mental health crisis** by teaching students life skills, coping strategies, and awareness of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.

**Key Points:**
1. **Support**: Advocates, including Laura Lee Godfrey (Chair of the Governor’s Youth Advisory Council) and Sam Hawkins (Public Policy Assistant at NAMI NH), emphasized the lack of mental health education in schools and the importance of reducing stigma. Godfrey shared a personal story about helping a friend during a panic attack, underscoring the need for students to have the tools to manage their mental health.
2. **Concerns**: Critics, including parental rights advocates like Anne-Marie Banfield, raised concerns about:
   - **Teacher Training**: The ability of untrained teachers to handle sensitive mental health topics.
   - **Overdiagnosis**: The risk of introducing or exacerbating mental health issues through education.
   - **Academic Focus**: The potential replacement of core academic subjects with mental health education.
   - **Parental Involvement**: The need for opt-out options for families who object to the content.
3. **Amendments**: The bill includes provisions for parental opt-out and provides a **model curriculum** developed by the Department of Education, which schools can adopt but are not required to implement.
4. **Implementation**: Questions were raised about accountability and the feasibility of implementation, with the Department of Education clarifying that local school districts would be responsible for curriculum execution. Concerns about funding and the timeline for implementation were also discussed, with past mandates like civics education taking over a year to implement.

### **Workforce Training and Career Development**
The committee discussed several bills related to workforce training and career development, including:

1. **SB 152 - Workforce Training Programs**: This bill proposes expanding workforce training programs, including combining welding with scuba diving and exploring opportunities in the offshore wind industry. Concerns were raised about the lack of legislative oversight in the proposed Offshore Wind Workforce Training Center Committee, but the bill passed with a majority vote.
2. **Digital Badging and LinkedIn (HB 213)**: Referred to as the "LinkedIn Bill," this legislation focuses on student access to digital badging platforms for internships, apprenticeships, and jobs. Concerns were raised about data privacy and security risks associated with private companies profiting from student data. Proposals included transferring digital badging credits to official school transcripts to separate expertise verification from direct platform access.
3. **SB 136 - Held for Later Discussion**: The committee decided to delay action on this bill, moving on to other items on the agenda.

### **School Safety and Law Enforcement Coordination (SB 109)**
The committee unanimously passed **SB 109**, which focuses on improving school safety through coordination with law enforcement. The bill ensures compliance with privacy laws like FERPA while allowing for the disclosure of physical records in cases of serious threats to school safety.

---

### **Alternative Dispute Resolution in Special Education (SB 135)**
The committee discussed **SB 135**, which proposes allowing continuances in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes for special education conflicts if mutually agreed upon by the parties. Currently, ADR processes are limited to 30 days, which can hinder resolution due to scheduling conflicts, expert availability, or complex issues like individualized education plans (IEPs). The bill aims to provide more flexibility in resolving these disputes, with testimony highlighting that 85-90% of cases require continuances.

---

### **School Budgets and Administrative Policies**
1. **SB 155 - School Administrative Unit Budgets**: The committee debated the need for clarity and transparency in school budget processes. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on local elections and the ability to amend budgets. The bill was ultimately tabled with a motion to "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate), meaning it was recommended to kill the bill.
2. **SB 77 - School Placement and Tuition Policies**: This bill modifies school placement policies to include approved private schools. There was confusion about the approval process for private schools and whether they meet New Hampshire’s adequate education standards. The discussion highlighted the role of the Commissioner of Education and interstate agreements in approving schools.

### **Professional Development and Teacher Training**
The committee emphasized the need for **professional development** for teachers to effectively deliver new curriculum content, particularly in mental health education. Questions arose about who would bear the costs of such training, with the Department of Education estimating costs around $100,000 for developing a model curriculum.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Mental Health Education**: SB 151 was retained, with discussions focusing on balancing the need for mental health education with concerns about implementation, teacher training, and parental rights.
2. **Workforce Training**: SB 152 passed, expanding workforce training programs, though concerns about oversight and funding were noted.
3. **School Safety**: SB 109 passed unanimously, emphasizing the importance of coordination with law enforcement to ensure school safety.
4. **Special Education Disputes**: SB 135 was discussed, with a focus on improving flexibility in ADR processes for special education conflicts.
5. **Digital Badging**: The "LinkedIn Bill" (HB 213) highlighted the need to balance student access to career-building tools with data privacy and security concerns.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of addressing the youth mental health crisis, improving school safety, expanding workforce training opportunities, and ensuring transparency in school budgets and policies. The discussions reflected a commitment to balancing student needs with practical implementation challenges and parental rights.
