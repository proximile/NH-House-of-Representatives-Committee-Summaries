The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions met on April 17, 2023, to discuss the effectiveness, management, and future of legislative study committees and state commissions. The meeting emphasized the need for greater accountability, efficiency, and collaboration to address longstanding challenges and improve outcomes. Key themes and points from the discussion are summarized below:

### **Challenges and Concerns**
1. **Inactive and Ineffective Commissions**: Members highlighted issues with commissions becoming inactive due to gaps in membership, particularly when members are not re-elected, leading to delays as new members get up to speed. Some commissions have not met for years, raising questions about their purpose and productivity.
2. **COVID-19 Impact**: While the pandemic initially disrupted commission activities, members questioned whether it should still be cited as a blanket excuse for inactivity, given that it began in 2019-2020.
3. **Avoiding Direct Action**: Concerns were raised that study committees and commissions are sometimes used to delay addressing issues directly, allowing problems to persist for years.

### **Accountability and Efficiency**
1. **Clear Expectations and Standards**: The committee stressed the need for greater accountability among committee chairs, including setting clear expectations and standards to ensure productive outcomes.
2. **Mapping Commissions to Committees**: A key focus was on mapping commissions to relevant statutory committees to better understand their roles and effectiveness. Suggestions included creating spreadsheets or flowcharts to track alignment and identify gaps.
3. **Standardization and Sunset Clauses**: Members proposed standardizing the creation and review of commissions by including sunset clauses and minimum requirements for activity. This would ensure commissions are regularly evaluated and dissolved if no longer effective.
4. **Proactive Dissolution Process**: The committee discussed establishing a process for automatically dissolving commissions that fail to meet certain criteria, such as not meeting for a specified period, to reduce the need for individual repeal bills.

### **Collaborative Approach and Support**
1. **Support for Committees**: Instead of disbanding underperforming committees, the idea of offering support and resources to help them succeed was proposed. This included engaging with committee chairs to understand their challenges and providing assistance to improve their effectiveness.
2. **Alternatives to Large Commissions**: Smaller, more focused legislative study groups were suggested as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to larger, multi-agency commissions.
3. **Bipartisan Cooperation**: The committee emphasized the importance of bipartisan consensus to avoid conflicts over commissions considered “sacred cows” by either party, focusing on those with broad agreement for dissolution or reform.

### **Historical Context and Recommendations**
1. **Review of Past Reforms**: The committee discussed significant historical reforms, such as RSA 1449, which limits commission membership to 15 and requires a majority of members to be from the General Court. House Rule 37g mandates that study committees file reports by November 1st of the second year.
2. **Avoiding Redundancy**: The committee reviewed past reports, including those from Karen Ebel, to understand previous recommendations and actions taken regarding commissions. Some commissions have already been repealed or amended, and the committee aims to avoid redundant efforts.

### **Process Improvements and Next Steps**
1. **Subgroup Reviews**: The committee considered splitting into subgroups to review existing commissions, identify inactive or redundant ones, and recommend actions such as disbanding or investigating further.
2. **Collaboration with OLS**: The Office of Legislative Services (OLS) was highlighted as a resource for drafting templates and statutory language to streamline the creation and dissolution of commissions.
3. **Future Recommendations**: The committee aims to provide strong recommendations to House leadership by the end of the year, focusing on a structured process for creating, managing, and disbanding commissions.
4. **Next Meeting**: Members were encouraged to review materials, identify process improvements, and prepare for the next meeting, which will include insights from experienced members like Karen Ebel.

### **Overall Tone and Goals**
The meeting concluded with a collaborative tone, emphasizing the need for a more efficient and accountable system for managing state commissions. The committee’s goals include fostering transparency, standardization, and bipartisan cooperation to ensure commissions are effective, productive, and aligned with legislative priorities.
