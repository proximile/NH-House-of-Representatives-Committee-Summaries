The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 3, 2023, centered on several key legislative discussions related to utility infrastructure, net metering, and renewable energy policies. The meeting addressed a range of bills aimed at improving utility pole management, expanding net metering opportunities, and supporting renewable energy projects across the state. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions:

### **Utility Pole Management (Segment 1/6)**
The meeting began with a focus on **utility pole management**, particularly addressing inefficiencies in transferring wires between companies and the challenges municipalities face in accessing data systems. A bill was introduced to improve the management systems for utility poles, enhance communication between utility companies, and provide municipalities with real-time information on pole conditions. Key points included:
- **Stakeholder Group**: The bill proposes creating a stakeholder group comprising representatives from investor-owned utilities, municipalities, and other relevant parties to improve communication and management systems.
- **Double and Triple Poles**: The issue of double and triple poles, which often remain in place for extended periods due to accidents or storms, was highlighted as a safety and aesthetic concern.
- **Data Systems**: The "engine" system, a national database used by many utilities, was discussed, with the bill encouraging broader adoption and improvements to this system.
- **Safety Concerns**: The bill emphasizes the need for timely removal of old or damaged poles to address safety risks.
- **Future Steps**: The stakeholder group will work on improving pole transfer efficiency, and the Department of Energy will submit annual progress reports to the legislature.

### **Net Metering and Hydroelectric Facilities (Segments 2/6 and 6/6)**
The discussion then shifted to **net metering**, with a focus on hydroelectric facilities and legacy wiring issues at two paper mills: **Monadnock Paper Mills** and **Brookfield Renewable**. Key bills discussed included:
- **Senate Bill 40 (SB 40)**: This bill aims to clarify existing laws (SB 91 from 2021) to allow these hydro facilities to participate in net metering despite legacy wiring issues. It ensures that only excess generation after meeting the mills' power needs is eligible for net metering and provides a methodology for separating eligible and ineligible generation.
- **Legacy Wiring Issues**: Both hydro facilities share a single interconnection point with the grid due to historical wiring practices, making costly infrastructure upgrades impractical.
- **Opposition from the Department of Energy (DOE)**: The DOE opposed SB 40, arguing it could set a dangerous precedent by watering down the definition of "customer generator."
- **Narrow Scope**: The bill is narrowly tailored to address specific legacy wiring issues at these two sites and does not apply to other renewable energy projects.

### **Expansion of Net Metering and Renewable Energy Projects (Segments 3/6, 4/6, and 5/6)**
The meeting also covered several bills aimed at expanding **net metering** opportunities and supporting **renewable energy projects** for municipalities, non-profits, and businesses:
- **Senate Bill 68 (SB 68)**: This bill allows municipalities to collaborate on renewable energy projects across political boundaries within the same utility franchise territory, enabling smaller towns to achieve economies of scale in solar energy projects.
- **Senate Bill 69 (SB 69)**: This bill expands net metering eligibility to include non-profit entities such as hospitals, religious organizations, and housing authorities, helping them reduce energy costs.
- **Senate Bill 79 (SB 79)**: This bill allows industrial and commercial entities to generate renewable energy up to 100% of their average annual consumption, helping businesses reduce energy costs without creating revenue-generating opportunities.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Interconnection Costs**: High costs for grid upgrades were identified as a significant barrier to renewable energy projects.
  - **Cost Shifting Concerns**: Some expressed concerns about net metering potentially shifting costs to non-participating ratepayers, though studies suggest minimal impact at current levels.
  - **Procedural Delays**: The Department of Energy opposed changes to net metering statutes while an ongoing Public Utilities Commission (PUC) docket examines the issue.
- **Testimonies**: Representatives from companies like **Stonyfield Yogurt** and **Hitchner Manufacturing** testified in support of SB 79, emphasizing the economic and environmental benefits of expanding net metering. Local officials and energy committee members also testified in favor of SB 68, sharing challenges in implementing solar projects in smaller towns.

### **Overall Themes and Next Steps**
The meeting underscored the tension between advancing renewable energy goals and addressing procedural and economic concerns. Key themes included:
- **Legislative Support**: Strong support for legislative changes to facilitate municipal and non-profit participation in net metering and renewable energy projects.
- **Economic and Environmental Benefits**: Testimonies highlighted the economic and environmental benefits of expanding net metering opportunities and supporting renewable energy projects.
- **Opposition and Concerns**: The Department of Energy and other stakeholders raised concerns about cost-shifting, technical implementation, and the need to wait for the PUCâ€™s review before making policy changes.
- **Future Steps**: The committee plans to continue hearings on these bills, address technical amendments, and consider proposed changes to resolve concerns raised by stakeholders.

In summary, the meeting highlighted the importance of legislative action to improve utility infrastructure, expand net metering opportunities, and support renewable energy projects while balancing economic, procedural, and technical considerations.
