The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee held a work session on **SB 71-FN** on April 26, 2023. The bill had two main components:  

1. **Section One**: Expands the presumption that all types of cancer in firefighters are occupational hazards, making them eligible for workers' compensation.  
2. **Section Two**: Establishes a commission to study the implementation of optional annual cancer screenings for firefighters.  

### Key Discussion Points:  
- **Section One**:  
  - Most members supported this section, acknowledging the occupational risks firefighters face.  
  - Concerns were raised about assuming all cancers are work-related, but it was clarified that the presumption can be challenged with evidence.  
  - The cost to municipalities was discussed, with some members noting it might be minimal due to the limited number of cases.  

- **Section Two**:  
  - There was significant skepticism about the need for a legislative commission, with members questioning its effectiveness and whether it would lead to actionable outcomes.  
  - Some suggested that the study could be conducted by experts outside the legislature.  

### Outcome:  
- The subcommittee unanimously moved to **retain Section One** and **remove Section Two** from the bill.  
- An amendment was prepared to clean up the language in case the full committee decided to keep the commission.  

The motion will be presented to the full Executive Departments and Administration Committee for final approval.
