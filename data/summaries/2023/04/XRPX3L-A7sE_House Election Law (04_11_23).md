### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (April 11, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 11, 2023, focused on several key election-related bills and amendments, with discussions centered on modernizing election infrastructure, improving voter accessibility, and ensuring election integrity through audits. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

#### **Senate Bill 70 (SB70): Election Information Portal**
- **Purpose:** SB70 proposes the creation of an **election information portal** to streamline voter registration, updates, and absentee ballot requests. The portal aims to make voting more accessible, reduce confusion at the polls, and encourage participation, particularly among young and working-age voters.
- **Support:** Organizations like **603 Forward** and the **New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights** testified in favor of SB70, highlighting its potential to reduce errors, ease the workload for town clerks, and align New Hampshire with the 40 states and Washington, D.C., that already use similar portals.
- **Concerns:** Some raised issues about the current system, such as the inconvenience of same-day registration and difficulties accessing town clerks’ offices.

#### **Amendment to SB70: Funding for Election Counting Machines**
- **Proposal:** **Representative Ross Berry** introduced an amendment to SB70, which would:
  - Allocate **HAVA (Help America Vote Act)** funds to municipalities for purchasing new **election counting machines**.
  - Shift SB70’s funding mechanism from the general fund to HAVA funds.
- **Rationale:** The amendment addresses the aging **AccuVote machines**, which are nearing the end of their lifespan. HAVA funds would cover half the cost of new machines, with the state covering the other half, minimizing costs to local taxpayers.
- **Opposition:** **Senator James Gray** opposed the amendment, arguing that municipalities should decide how to allocate their funds and that diverting HAVA funds could strain other election-related needs, such as training and accessible voting machines.
- **Debate:** There was discussion about the efficient use of HAVA funds, with Berry criticizing the state for not reinvesting interest earned from the funds to offset inflation. Concerns were raised about the potential depletion of HAVA funds if used for both the portal and machines.

#### **Senate Bill 156 (SB156): Voter Registration and Verification**
- **Purpose:** SB156 aims to streamline voter registration and verification processes, particularly for individuals without identification. It removes unconstitutional procedures and introduces voluntary sections on registration forms for additional information (e.g., social media accounts, phone numbers) to aid investigations by the Attorney General’s Office.
- **Key Provisions:**
  - Allows moderators or clerks to certify voters they know personally.
  - Reduces unnecessary investigations by focusing on cases that truly require scrutiny.
  - Clarifies procedures for voters who register without ID.
- **Support:** The **League of Women Voters** supported the bill, emphasizing the need to remove outdated and confusing language from previous legislation.

#### **Senate Bill 157 (SB157): Post-Election Audits**
- **Purpose:** SB157 extends the post-election audit process for **AccuVote machines**, ensuring election integrity and voter confidence. The process involves scanning ballots, comparing results with election night counts, and conducting random manual checks.
- **Support:** The **Secretary of State’s office** and the **Brennan Center** supported the bill, highlighting the effectiveness of audits conducted in 2022. Recommendations included expanding audits to cover hand-counted ballots, presidential primaries, and increasing the number of towns audited.
- **Concerns:** The temporary nature of the bill was noted, as the state is considering new ballot-counting machines. Suggestions were made to create a more permanent and inclusive audit process applicable to all types of voting machines.

---

#### **Senate Bill 158 (SB158): Simplifying Absentee Ballots**
- **Purpose:** SB158 aims to simplify the absentee ballot process by eliminating the need for outer envelopes, reducing the workload for clerks and making the process more efficient.

---

#### **Broader Themes and Discussions**
1. **Modernization of Election Infrastructure:** The meeting emphasized the need to modernize New Hampshire’s election processes through technological advancements like the election information portal and new counting machines, while balancing costs and resource allocation.
2. **Election Integrity and Voter Confidence:** Post-election audits were highlighted as critical to ensuring the accuracy of results and increasing voter trust. The 2023 report by the **New Hampshire Special Committee on Voter Confidence** found that audits significantly boost voter confidence.
3. **Bipartisan Support:** Many of the proposed bills, including SB70 and SB158, enjoyed bipartisan support, with advocates emphasizing the importance of maintaining election integrity while improving accessibility and efficiency.
