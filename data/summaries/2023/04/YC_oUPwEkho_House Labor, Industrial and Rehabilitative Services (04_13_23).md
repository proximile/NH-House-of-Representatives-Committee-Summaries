**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services (04/13/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 13, 2023, convened the Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services committee to discuss several key labor-related bills and topics. The session covered a wide range of issues, including wage payment modernization, tip pooling, labor negotiations, and unemployment compensation overpayments. Here is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Wage Payment Modernization and Payroll Cards (Senate Bill 46)**
The committee extensively discussed **Senate Bill 46**, which aims to modernize wage payment systems by allowing employers to pay wages electronically via direct deposit or payroll debit cards. Key points included:
- **Benefits**: Proponents argued that electronic payments offer consistency, security, and convenience, especially in situations where physical check delivery is hindered (e.g., snowstorms). Payroll cards provide fraud protection, no overdraft fees, and access to funds through in-network ATMs at no cost.
- **Concerns**: Representatives raised questions about accessibility for employees in rural areas, fees associated with debit cards, and the practicality of replacing lost or stolen cards, particularly for small businesses without 24/7 support. There were also concerns about employees without bank accounts or identification.
- **Legislative Intent**: The bill would remove the requirement for employers to offer paper checks if they prefer electronic payment methods. Employers could still offer paper checks but would have the flexibility to default to electronic payments.

### **Tip Pooling, Service Charges, and Coercion (Senate Bill 269)**
The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 269**, which clarifies responsibilities around **tip pooling** and **service charges** in the hospitality industry:
- **Key Provisions**: The bill distinguishes between **tips** (discretionary payments owned by employees) and **service charges** (mandatory payments considered business income). It resolves discrepancies between state law and IRS tax rules, ensuring employers are not taxed on income they do not retain.
- **Voluntary Participation**: The bill allows employers to facilitate discussions on tip pooling but emphasizes that participation must remain voluntary and non-coercive. Employers cannot enforce participation but can document agreed-upon practices.
- **Impact**: The bill aims to reduce friction between businesses and the Department of Labor while protecting employees' rights and ensuring fair labor practices.

### **Labor Negotiations and Contract Timelines (Senate Bill 193)**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 193**, which seeks to improve labor negotiations in public education and other sectors:
- **Purpose**: The bill requires public employers and bargaining units to initiate negotiations within 10 days of a request or agree to a mutual timeline. It aims to prevent delays that lead to expired contracts, workforce unrest, and disruptions in wages and benefits.
- **Support**: Testimony highlighted the importance of timely negotiations for maintaining stability and positive labor relations. The bill received bipartisan support and was modeled after Maineâ€™s successful implementation of a similar law.
- **Impact**: The bill does not compel agreement but ensures that negotiations continue in good faith, benefiting both employees and employers.

### **Overpayment of Unemployment Compensation (Senate Bill 42)**
The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 42**, which addresses overpayments of state unemployment compensation:
- **Purpose**: The bill prohibits the state from charging interest on non-fraud overpayments, aligning with federal policy. It aims to reduce the financial burden on individuals who inadvertently received overpayments, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Support**: New Hampshire Legal Assistance testified in favor, emphasizing the disproportionate impact on women and low-income workers. The bill seeks to prevent punitive measures on individuals who made honest mistakes.
- **Data**: In 2022, $2.7 million in overpayments were identified, with $1.2 million attributed to non-fraud cases.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Modernization and Accessibility**: The discussion on wage payment systems highlighted the need to balance modernization with ensuring accessibility and protections for all employees, particularly those in rural areas or without traditional banking access.
2. **Fair Labor Practices**: Bills addressing tip pooling, service charges, and labor negotiations emphasized the importance of voluntary participation, non-coercion, and timely resolutions to maintain positive labor relations.
3. **Equity and Support**: Efforts to eliminate interest on non-fraud unemployment overpayments and streamline collective bargaining timelines reflect a commitment to equity, fairness, and efficiency in labor policies.

The meeting concluded with plans for executive sessions and potential subcommittee meetings to finalize the bills and address remaining concerns. Overall, the discussions underscored a collaborative effort to modernize labor practices, protect employees' rights, and improve labor-management relations in New Hampshire.
