**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting (04/12/23)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee meeting on April 12, 2023, addressed a wide range of legislative proposals, focusing on probate services, legal representation for indigent individuals, access to public records, remote meeting participation, and procedural updates for state agencies. Here’s a detailed summary of the discussions:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Senate Bill 92: Restoring the Role of the Register of Probate**  
   - The bill aims to reinstate the **Register of Probate** as a point of contact for constituents to discuss probate matters, though the role would not include providing legal advice.  
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of resources (e.g., offices, phones, computers) for the Register of Probate and the potential overlap with duties currently handled by Circuit Court clerks.  
   - The **Probate Navigator Program**, still in development, was questioned for its ability to adequately train Registers of Probate.  
   - Some representatives questioned the necessity of the bill, given existing structures.  

2. **Senate Bill 128: Payment for Legal Services in Involuntary Mental Health Admissions**  
   - The bill proposes shifting the responsibility for paying legal fees from the **judicial branch** to the **Judicial Council** for individuals involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities.  
   - Concerns were raised about the bill’s wording, which could allow non-indigent individuals to receive state-funded legal services.  
   - Amendments were suggested to ensure only indigent individuals qualify, possibly involving the **Office of Cost Containment** to retroactively investigate eligibility.  
   - The bill does not increase overall costs but reallocates payment responsibility.  

3. **Senate Bill 129: Mediation Costs in Marital Cases**  
   - The bill seeks to cover mediation costs for indigent parties in marital cases, encouraging mediation and reducing court resource usage.  
   - The **Judicial Branch** supported the bill, emphasizing its benefits for resolving disputes efficiently.  

4. **Senate Bill 183: Access to 9-1-1 Call Recordings**  
   - The bill proposes allowing individuals to access their own 9-1-1 call recordings for legal purposes without requiring a subpoena.  
   - Privacy protections were included, such as requiring signed authorizations and limiting the use of recordings to legal proceedings.  
   - The **New Hampshire Association for Justice** supported the bill, citing its importance for resolving insurance claims without litigation.  

5. **Senate Bill 27: Financial Disclosure Forms for Judges**  
   - The bill allows judges to use their judicial financial disclosure forms to satisfy RSA 15A requirements, streamlining the filing process.  
   - Concerns about transparency gaps were addressed, as the judicial form is more comprehensive than the executive branch form.  
   - The bill passed the Senate on the consent calendar and was supported by the judicial branch.  

6. **Senate Bill 59: Location Flexibility for Attorney General Investigations**  
   - The bill removes the requirement for investigative meetings to be held at the State House, allowing for virtual or other locations.  
   - The **Attorney General’s office** supported the change for convenience and consistency, though concerns were raised about potential limitations on in-person hearings.  

7. **Senate Bill 89: Marriage License Accommodations for Medical Reasons**  
   - The bill allows town clerks to accommodate individuals who cannot appear in person for marriage licenses due to documented medical reasons.  
   - Concerns were raised about the vagueness of “documented medical reasons” and the potential misuse of the provision.  
   - The sponsor agreed to consult with the Senate to clarify language and restore flexibility for clerks.  

8. **Senate Bill 250: Remote Meeting Participation and Access to Public Records**  
   - The bill addresses remote participation in public meetings, setting a 28-day limit for out-of-state participation without a medical reason and allowing chairpersons to determine legitimacy.  
   - Opposition from the **NH Municipal Association**, **Right to Know NH**, and the **NH Association of Counties** argued that the bill complicates existing law without addressing key issues.  
   - Discussions highlighted the inefficiencies of remote participation, such as technical delays, while acknowledging its benefits for accessibility.  

### **Themes and Concerns**  
- **Fiscal and Administrative Challenges**: Several bills raised concerns about funding and administrative capacity, particularly for the **Judicial Council** and **Probate Navigator Program**.  
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Discussions emphasized the need for clear language to prevent loopholes and ensure fiscal and procedural accountability.  
- **Flexibility vs. Mandates**: Many bills sought to provide flexibility (e.g., remote meetings, marriage license accommodations) while avoiding unintended consequences or overreach.  
- **Privacy and Equity**: Balancing access to public records (e.g., 9-1-1 call recordings) with privacy protections was a recurring theme, as was ensuring equitable access to legal services and public information.  

### **Next Steps**  
The committee planned to execute bills on May 3rd and continue refining language and addressing stakeholder concerns over the summer. The meeting underscored the importance of careful drafting and collaboration to address complex legal and administrative challenges effectively.
