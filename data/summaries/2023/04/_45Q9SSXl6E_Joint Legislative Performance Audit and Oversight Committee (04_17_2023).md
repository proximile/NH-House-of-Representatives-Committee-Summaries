### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Joint Legislative Performance Audit and Oversight Committee Meeting (04/17/2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Legislative Performance Audit and Oversight Committee convened on April 17, 2023, to discuss a range of audit-related topics, procedural updates, and ongoing oversight efforts. The meeting was divided into three key segments, each addressing distinct areas of focus. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting.

### **1. Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and Related Audits**

The committee began with a discussion on the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and its ongoing restructuring efforts. Key points included:

- **OPLC Audits**: The committee reviewed recent audits involving OPLC, particularly those related to the Board of Dental Examiners and the Mental Health Workforce Requirements audit. Due to OPLC’s ongoing restructuring, the committee decided to table a full audit of OPLC itself until the agency stabilizes.
  
- **Restructuring Concerns**: Representative Weber emphasized that OPLC has been in a state of continuous restructuring for years, making it premature to conduct a comprehensive audit. The committee acknowledged the need for stability before further scrutiny.

- **Legislative Actions**: The committee referenced a 78-page bill passed by the House addressing OPLC restructuring and changes to its funding sources, underscoring the importance of allowing time for these changes to take effect.

- **Human Rights Commission**: Concerns were raised about the Commission on Human Rights, which faces a backlog of 230 cases, limited investigators, and infrequent hearings. Comparisons were drawn to the Real Estate Commission under OPLC, which also struggles with delays in processing complaints.

- **Next Steps**: The committee concluded this segment without setting a date for the next meeting, indicating they would reconvene as needed.

### **2. Department of Education’s Oversight of Special Education Programs**

The committee then shifted focus to the scope of an audit examining the Department of Education’s oversight of special education programs. Key discussions included:

- **Audit Scope Debate**: The committee debated whether the audit should focus solely on compliance with federal and state laws or expand to include student outcomes. Concerns were raised about the department’s ability to monitor local education agencies (LEAs) effectively.

- **Medicaid and Special Education Funds**: The inclusion of Medicaid funds in special education budgets was discussed, with a call for greater transparency in how these funds are utilized.

- **Federal and State Requirements**: The committee acknowledged the federal requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the state’s role in ensuring compliance. Members questioned whether the department was fulfilling its monitoring duties.

- **Student Outcomes**: Several members stressed the importance of assessing whether students are achieving desired outcomes, such as post-secondary education, employment, and independent living, rather than focusing solely on compliance.

- **Sampling LEAs**: A proposal to sample LEAs to better understand their performance was discussed, though concerns about resource constraints were raised.

- **Audit Limitations**: The committee recognized the limitations of the audit, including the inability to review all 31,000 Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) in the state. The focus remained on the department’s efficiency and effectiveness in overseeing special education programs.

- **Motion to Approve Scope**: After extensive discussion, the committee approved the audit scope as written, emphasizing the department’s role in ensuring compliance and improving student outcomes.

- **Other Topics**: The committee briefly discussed other suspended audit topics, including the Bureau of Elderly and Adult Services, public access to water, and the Secretary of State’s archives and records.

### **3. Procedural Updates and Special Education Audit Scope**

The final segment of the meeting covered procedural updates and further discussion on the special education audit. Highlights included:

- **Meeting Opening and Chair Election**: The meeting was opened, and Senator Rosenwald was elected as the committee chair for the next two years.

- **Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes**: The minutes from the November 10, 2022, meeting were approved.

- **Orientation on Performance Audits**: Steve Smith, Director of Audits, and Jay Henry, Performance Audit Supervisor, provided an orientation for new committee members on the role and process of performance audits. They emphasized the importance of determining audit scope and resource allocation.

- **Introduction of Committee Members**: Members introduced themselves, detailing their districts and committee assignments.

- **Status of Ongoing Audits**: The committee reviewed the status of several ongoing audits, including the Weatherization Assistance Program, Mental Health Workforce Requirements, Special Education Dispute Resolution Process, State Oversight of Special Education, and the Commission on Human Rights. Timelines and scopes were discussed, with some audits expected to be completed by 2024.

- **Scope Statement for Special Education Oversight Audit**: Steve Grady, Senior Performance Audit Manager, presented the scope statement for the Department of Education’s oversight of special education. The audit aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the department’s general supervision in producing expected outcomes, including compliance with federal and state statutes.

- **Commissioner’s Remarks**: Frank Edelblut, Commissioner of Education, expressed concerns that the current audit scope might not fully address the issues faced by students with disabilities. He advocated for a broader audit that includes local school district spending and the actual services provided to students.

- **Committee Discussion**: Members emphasized the importance of understanding the full cost and performance of special education services, including local district expenditures and Medicaid reimbursements.
