The New Hampshire House Rules Committee meeting on April 25, 2023, focused on setting deadlines for filing legislation and other procedural matters. Key discussions included:

1. **Acceptance of Minutes**: The committee voted to accept the minutes from the previous meeting.

2. **Filing Deadlines**: A proposal was made to extend the last day to file Legislative Service Requests (LSRs) from September 15th to September 22nd to accommodate members' schedules, including those traveling or dealing with medical appointments. This extension would also avoid conflicting with Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sundown on September 15th. Concerns were raised about the potential increase in bills filed and the workload for the Office of Legislative Services (OLS), but the committee ultimately approved the deadlines as proposed: September 11th, September 15th, November 3rd, November 17th, and January 4th.

3. **Statutory Study Committees**: A motion was made to allow statutory or study committees to file legislation after the regular filing deadline if their reporting deadline falls after the filing period closes. This was approved to streamline the process and avoid last-minute issues.

4. **Calendar Negotiations with the Senate**: Representative Weber urged the committee to negotiate with the Senate to extend the House's calendar by a week in the next term, as the shortened timeline this term created challenges for committees dealing with complex bills.

5. **Additional Business**: No further business was brought forward, and the meeting concluded.

The meeting highlighted efforts to balance deadlines with practical considerations for members and the legislative process.
