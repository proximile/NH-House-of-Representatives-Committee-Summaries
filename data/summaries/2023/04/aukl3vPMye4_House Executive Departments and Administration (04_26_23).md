### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting – Executive Departments and Administration (04/26/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 26, 2023, focused on a range of legislative bills and amendments, primarily addressing public health, privacy, workforce retention, and administrative reforms. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Public Defender Program and Health Insurance (Senate Bill 108)**
The meeting highlighted challenges faced by the New Hampshire Public Defender (NHPD) program, particularly high attrition rates due to low salaries and inadequate health benefits. **Senate Bill 108** aims to allow public defenders to opt into the state health plan, addressing recruitment and retention issues. Testimonies from NHPD staff underscored the financial and emotional toll of the current high-deductible health plan, which has led to difficulties in retaining attorneys. While the bill received unanimous Senate support, concerns were raised about the financial impact on the state and the potential for increased utilization of the health plan. The committee emphasized the importance of better health insurance to support the mental and physical well-being of public defenders, which is critical for their demanding roles.

#### **2. Privacy and Public Health (Senate Bill 105)**
**Senate Bill 105** sparked significant debate over the balance between privacy and public health. The bill seeks to protect the privacy of mothers’ medical information by decriminalizing the mother’s worksheet for birth certificates and de-identifying data sent to the Division of Vital Records and the CDC. Senator Cindy Rosenwald, the bill’s sponsor, argued that current practices violate constitutional privacy rights by collecting identifiable health information without consent.

However, public health professionals and representatives expressed concerns that removing identifiable data would hinder critical public health efforts, including tracking maternal and infant health disparities, ensuring newborn screenings, and maintaining federal funding for health programs. Testimonies from families highlighted the life-saving impact of newborn screening programs, which rely on timely and accurate data to diagnose conditions like **mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (MPS1)** and **spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)**. The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review, with a focus on balancing privacy protections with the need for robust public health data.

#### **3. Peer Support Groups and Workers’ Compensation (Senate Bill 207)**
The committee discussed the role of peer support groups, particularly for first responders, and their eligibility for workers’ compensation coverage. Members expressed support for codifying the definition of peer support groups in statutes to clarify their role and expand services for stress management and critical incident debriefing. The discussion emphasized the need for confidentiality protections and liability coverage for peer support volunteers, including retired first responders. Due to the complexity of the issue, the relevant portion of **Senate Bill 207** was referred to a subcommittee for further review, involving workers’ compensation attorneys to address liability and coverage questions.

#### **4. Workforce and Administrative Reforms**
Several bills focused on workforce retention and administrative modernization:

- **Senate Bill 44**: This bill updates the scope of practice for the Medical Laboratory Director of Analytical Toxicology (MLDAX) and removes outdated criminal justice degree requirements for licensure. An amendment was adopted to ensure continuity of care for patients treated by substance abuse specialists. The bill passed with bipartisan support.
  
- **Senate Bill 149**: This bill regulates nurse staffing agencies to prevent practices like “bait and switch” pricing and placing unqualified nurses in healthcare facilities. An amendment clarified language and removed redundant clauses. The bill passed unanimously.

- **Senate Bill 74**: Requested by the Department of Administrative Services, this bill modernizes the state’s personnel system by updating language and streamlining job classifications. An amendment was adopted to align the bill with ongoing reforms.

- **Senate Bill 203**: An amendment was adopted to maintain the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) website for the Board of Manufactured Housing for five years. The bill passed unanimously.

- **Senate Bill 49**: An amendment created a non-lapsing fund for OPLC, capped at $3 million, with surplus funds returned to the general fund. The bill passed with the amendment.

- **Senate Bill 71**: An amendment removed a commission studying firefighter cancer screening while retaining the presumption that cancer in firefighters is occupationally caused. The bill passed with the amendment.
