**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (04/26/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on April 26, 2023, to discuss a range of legislative topics, focusing on consumer protection, cannabis regulation, event ticket sales, and enforcement challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Ticket Sales and Consumer Protection**
- **Challenges with Secondary Ticket Markets**: Representatives highlighted the deceptive practices of secondary ticket marketplaces like Vivid Seats and StubHub, which often mislead consumers into believing they are purchasing directly from primary sellers. This results in inflated prices and consumer dissatisfaction.
- **Legislative Solutions**: The committee discussed the need for legislation to empower consumers with clear information about ticket sources and pricing. **Senate Bill 201** was introduced to address these issues by requiring **clear disclosures** on resale websites, such as whether the seller owns the ticket or is affiliated with the venue. Consumers would need to acknowledge these disclosures before purchase.
- **Enforcement and Impact**: The **Attorney General’s Office** emphasized that the bill would allow enforcement under consumer protection laws, including restitution and civil penalties. However, challenges remain in addressing out-of-state resellers and defining the scope of **sellers** under the bill. Representatives from venues like the **Palace Theater** and **Nashua Center for the Arts** shared firsthand accounts of financial and reputational harm caused by fraudulent resellers.

### **2. Cannabis and Hemp Product Regulation**
- **Unregulated THC Products**: The committee discussed **Senate Bill 180**, which aims to prohibit the sale of hemp-derived THC products (e.g., Delta-8, Delta-9) in New Hampshire. These products are currently unregulated, pose public health risks, and are accessible to minors.
- **THC Thresholds and Corrections**: A discrepancy in the bill’s THC threshold (0.03% vs. 0.3%) was identified and needs correction to align with federal and state hemp laws.
- **Interaction with HB 639**: SB 180 would complement **House Bill 639**, which legalizes and regulates adult-use cannabis in New Hampshire. The bill seeks to remove unregulated THC products from the market, ensuring all THC products are sold within a controlled, age-restricted system.
- **Public Health and Safety**: Testimony highlighted the risks of unregulated THC products, including contamination with pesticides and heavy metals. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Cannabis Association, supported the bill, emphasizing the need for responsible regulation, consumer education, and independent lab testing.
- **Implementation Timeline**: The committee debated whether the bill should take effect immediately or after 60 days to allow businesses to clear inventory. The standard 60-day implementation period was favored.

### **3. Hospitality and Tourism Education Commission**
- **Senate Bill 37**: A proposal to establish a commission to study hospitality and tourism education programs in New Hampshire was debated. Concerns were raised about redundancy, as UNH already offers a program in this area. The committee ultimately voted to recommend that the bill be killed (ITL).

---

### **4. Federal Home Loan Bank Parity (Senate Bill 66)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to align state insurance laws with federal laws to ensure parity for insurance companies borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB).
- **Support**: The bill received support from industry experts and the Insurance Department, as it addresses rare but critical scenarios involving insurance company receiverships. The FHLB provides liquidity to banks, credit unions, and insurance companies, particularly during economic crises.

---

### **5. Liquor Commission and Enforcement**
- **Training and Enforcement**: Representatives questioned whether the Liquor Commission would need specific training to identify and handle prohibited products, such as unregulated THC items or illegal items in convenience stores.
- **Confiscation and Destruction**: There was uncertainty about the process for confiscating and destroying prohibited products, including whether a court order would be required.
- **Proposed Solutions**: Suggestions included educating businesses about the law, issuing cease-and-desist letters, and conducting crackdowns similar to actions taken in Connecticut. An amendment to adjust the bill’s language was proposed and approved in a straw vote.

---

### **6. Consumer Protection in Cannabis and Ticket Sales**
- **House Bill 639 (Cannabis Regulation)**: The bill emphasizes the need for research into cannabis products, particularly Delta 8 and Delta 9, to understand their impact and ensure proper regulation. The bipartisan effort was commended for addressing challenges like product safety and impaired driving.
- **Consumer Empowerment**: Both HB 639 and SB 201 aim to empower consumers by providing transparency and protecting them from fraudulent practices in the cannabis and ticket resale industries.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Consumer Protection**: A recurring theme was the need for transparency and regulation to protect consumers from deceptive practices in ticket sales and unregulated THC products.
- **Enforcement Challenges**: The committee acknowledged the difficulties in enforcing laws, particularly against out-of-state resellers and unregulated products. Clear protocols, training, and collaboration with stakeholders were emphasized.
- **Legislative Action**: The committee voted on several bills, including recommending the killing of SB 37 and advancing SB 180 and SB 201 with amendments. Technical corrections, such as the THC threshold in SB 180, were noted for future revisions.
