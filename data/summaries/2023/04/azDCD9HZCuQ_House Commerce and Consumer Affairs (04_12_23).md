### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (April 12, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on April 12, 2023, to discuss several key bills and issues impacting the state’s economy, consumer affairs, and energy markets. The meeting focused on education and workforce development, community governance, housing affordability, and energy policy. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

#### **1. Education and Workforce Development in Hospitality and Tourism (Senate Bill 37)**  
- **Purpose**: SB 37 proposes the creation of a committee to study the declining interest in hospitality and tourism education in New Hampshire. Despite the industry’s significant contribution to the state’s economy, educational institutions are meeting only about 10% of the demand for graduates.  
- **Sponsor**: Senator Dan Ennis, a hospitality industry professional and professor at UNH, emphasized the need for public-private partnerships and better funding to attract young people to the field.  
- **Discussion**: Committee members raised questions about housing for hospitality workers, the feasibility of the commission’s timeline, and whether agritourism should be included in the study. The bill was moved to the business subcommittee for further review.

#### **2. Governance and Dispute Resolution in Resident-Owned Communities (Senate Bill 64)**  
- **Purpose**: SB 64 seeks to establish a committee to study disputes within Resident-Owned Communities (ROCs), particularly between residents and their boards. The bill aims to address issues like financial mismanagement, lack of transparency, and the absence of formal dispute resolution mechanisms.  
- **Testimony**: Louise Rideout, a resident of Bayview Crossing Cooperative, testified about challenges such as double-charging rent, conflicts of interest, and inadequate support from organizations like the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund.  
- **Discussion**: Committee members debated the need for a new commission versus strengthening the existing Manufactured Housing Board. Some argued for broader oversight to include investor-owned communities, while others questioned the state’s role in private disputes.

#### **3. Updates to Business and Consumer Regulations**  
Several bills aimed at modernizing and streamlining regulations were discussed:  
- **Weights and Measures (SB 67)**: Proposed updates to calibration standards, administrative processes, and fees for certified copies.  
- **Liquor Commission Deadlines (SB 21)**: Extends the deadline for brewers and microbrewers to submit paperwork and permits electronic filing.  
- **Business Entity Regulations (SB 197)**: Includes changes such as allowing nonprofits to appoint agents for service of process and simplifying address changes for registered agents.  
- **Beer Distributor Reporting (SB 98)**: Increases the threshold for reporting overdue payments from $100 to $250, reducing administrative burdens for distributors.

#### **4. Housing and Affordability in Manufactured Housing Parks**  
- **Resident-Owned Housing Parks (SB 61)**: Residents of co-op communities testified about the need for oversight and dispute resolution in manufactured housing parks. Issues included financial mismanagement, lack of transparency, and non-compliance with bylaws.  
- **Broader Scope**: Some participants argued that any study committee should include investor-owned communities, as they face similar governance challenges.  
- **Support for SB 203**: Some speakers supported revamping the Manufactured Housing Board to provide better oversight for both resident-owned and investor-owned communities, suggesting it could address issues without creating a new committee.

#### **5. Energy Policy and the Jones Act (SB 98)**  
- **Jones Act Overview**: The Jones Act requires that cargo shipped between U.S. ports be transported on vessels owned, built, and operated by Americans. While it supports national security, it also increases energy costs.  
- **Impact on New Hampshire**: The state relies heavily on natural gas for energy, and the Jones Act complicates the transport of domestically produced liquefied natural gas (LNG), leading to higher prices, especially during winter months.  
- **Proposed Study**: SB 98 would require the New Hampshire Department of Energy to study the economic impact of the Jones Act on the state’s heating fuel and energy markets. The department requested $250,000 to hire an outside consultant for the study.  
- **Debate**: Supporters of the Jones Act emphasized its importance for national security and the domestic maritime industry, while critics argued for waivers to reduce energy costs. Alternative solutions, such as increasing pipeline capacity or investing in renewable energy, were also discussed.

#### **Key Themes and Takeaways**  
1. **Education and Workforce Development**: SB 37 highlights the need to align hospitality and tourism education with industry demands.  
2. **Community Governance and Dispute Resolution**: SB 64 and related discussions underscore the challenges of managing resident-owned communities and the need for transparency, accountability, and formal mechanisms for resolving disputes.  
3. **Housing and Affordability**: Both resident-owned and investor-owned manufactured housing communities face governance and financial management issues, necessitating legislative action.  
4. **Energy Policy and the Jones Act**: The Jones Act’s impact on energy costs in New Hampshire is a complex issue, balancing national security concerns with the need for affordable energy. The proposed study aims to inform future policy decisions.
