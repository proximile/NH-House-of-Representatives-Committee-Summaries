**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Resources, Recreation, and Development (April 19, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 19, 2023, addressed a range of issues related to off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs), environmental conservation, water quality regulations, and biodiversity. The discussions highlighted the need to balance economic development, recreational opportunities, public safety, and environmental protection.

### **Off-Highway Recreational Vehicles (OHRVs)**

1. **Economic Benefits and Community Concerns**:  
   OHRVs were recognized as a significant source of revenue for the state, but concerns were raised about their impact on communities, including noise, dust, and disruption in residential areas. Residents called for stronger enforcement and protections for affected communities.

2. **Legislative Bills and Commission Review**:  
   The meeting reviewed several OHRV-related bills, emphasizing the importance of thorough commission review before decision-making. Key legislation included **Senate Bill 160**, which addresses the use of OHRVs on designated trails and the requirement for permits for certain activities.

3. **Montana Plates and Enforcement Challenges**:  
   SB 160 aims to close a loophole where OHRVs registered as street vehicles in states like Montana (via LLCs) bypass New Hampshire regulations. The bill would prevent such vehicles from being used recreationally on trails while allowing them on roadways if properly registered. Enforcement challenges, including dual registration issues, were discussed.

4. **Special Event Permits**:  
   The bill expands the special event permit system for OHRV events, allowing unregistered vehicles to participate in activities like mud runs and nighttime events. Permits require 45-day notice, a $50 fee, and town approval, with provisions for events exceeding noise limits if approved by the town.

5. **Wildlife and Community Impact**:  
   Concerns were raised about the disruption to wildlife, particularly during winter events, and the impact of loud noises and bright lights on nearby residents. The bill seeks to balance recreational opportunities with environmental and community considerations.

### **Environmental Conservation and Water Quality**

1. **Section 401 Certifications**:  
   The committee discussed amendments to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, allowing the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to waive certifications for projects with minimal environmental impact, such as water pipe replacements, to save time and resources. Clear timelines for DES action on certification requests were proposed to address delays.

2. **Surface Water Withdrawals**:  
   Amendments proposed requiring water conservation plans for new large surface water withdrawals, aligning them with existing groundwater withdrawal requirements to ensure responsible water use and protect public trust resources.

3. **Public Notice and Hearings**:  
   The committee considered adding provisions for public notice and hearings for certain water-related permits, enhancing transparency and public involvement in the permitting process.

4. **Water Quality Standards and E. coli Monitoring**:  
   Technical adjustments to water quality standards, including the use of statistical measures like the 7Q10 for wastewater permitting, were discussed. Language related to E. coli monitoring in water bodies was clarified to address concerns about naturally occurring versus human-influenced contamination.

### **Biodiversity and Land Conservation**

1. **Biodiversity Bill (SB 164)**:  
   Senator David Waters introduced SB 164 to include biodiversity considerations in the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP). The bill aims to protect diverse ecosystems for future generations, reflecting the evolution of environmental conservation efforts.

2. **Concerns About Language and Definitions**:  
   There was significant concern about the broad and complex definition of biodiversity proposed in the bill, which could create confusion within the LCHIP statute. The insertion of "biodiversity easements" was seen as potentially problematic, complicating the use of well-established conservation easements.

3. **Stakeholder Positions**:  
   - **Neutral Stance**: LCHIP and the Forest Society are neutral on the bill but emphasize the need for careful consideration of language to avoid unintended consequences.  
   - **Opposition**: The NH Fish and Game Department opposes the bill, citing concerns about the broad definition of biodiversity and its potential to create ambiguity in land management practices.  
   - **Support**: The Humane Society supports the bill, viewing it as beneficial for animal health and well-being.

4. **Existing Efforts and Biodiversity Loss**:  
   LCHIP and other organizations already incorporate biodiversity considerations into their grant evaluations and conservation easements. The primary driver of biodiversity loss was identified as habitat loss and degradation, exacerbated by invasive species, pollution, and human activity.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing economic development, recreational opportunities, and environmental conservation. Key themes included the need for clear and consistent regulations, enhanced enforcement, and stakeholder collaboration. The committee plans to finalize amendments and schedule further work sessions to refine the discussed legislation, ensuring it aligns with existing frameworks and addresses the concerns of all stakeholders.
