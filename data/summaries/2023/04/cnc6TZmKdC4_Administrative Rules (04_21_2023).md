**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (04/21/2023)**

On April 21, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss and review various administrative rules, with a focus on education, health and human services, case management, respiratory care, and household goods carriage. The meeting involved detailed deliberations to ensure clarity, compliance with federal and state laws, and the protection of individual rights, particularly for vulnerable populations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Education Rules**
1. **Agricultural Educator Certification**:  
   The committee addressed the repeal of the comprehensive agricultural educator certification, merging it with the career and technical education (CTE) agriculture endorsement. This change was recommended due to the low number of educators holding the certification and to streamline requirements. However, concerns were raised about lowering standards by removing the bachelor’s degree requirement for some teachers. The Department of Education clarified that the goal is to make agricultural programs more accessible to high schools.

### **Health and Human Services (HHS) Rules**
1. **Immunization Registry**:  
   The committee reviewed amendments to the immunization registry rules, specifically modifying the religious exemption form to clarify that it is a right, not a request. This change was approved.  
   
2. **Residency Agreements for Developmental Disabilities**:  
   Discussions centered on eviction processes for individuals living in group homes, emphasizing compliance with federal Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) settings rules. Concerns were raised about the clarity of eviction notices and residents’ rights to appeal. HHS agreed to include explicit language about appeal rights in eviction notices.

### **Case Management Rules**
1. **Conflict of Interest Concerns**:  
   The committee examined licensing requirements for case management agencies, focusing on potential conflicts of interest where entities providing case management also offer other services. This issue is tied to a corrective action plan with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  
   
2. **Exemptions and Licensure**:  
   Questions arose about exemptions for certain healthcare entities (e.g., area agencies) from licensure requirements under Rule 819.02. Concerns were raised that allowing these entities to provide both case management and other services could violate federal regulations requiring separation of services.  
   
3. **Preliminary Objection**:  
   The committee approved a motion to issue a preliminary objection to the rules, seeking further clarification and revisions to address conflicts of interest and ensure compliance with federal regulations.

### **Respiratory Care Practitioners**
1. **Interim Rules**:  
   The committee reviewed interim rules for respiratory care practitioners, set to expire on May 23, 2023. Stakeholders highlighted the absence of student licensure, which was seen as a barrier to addressing workforce shortages. Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts allow student respiratory therapists to work and be paid, but New Hampshire does not.  
   
2. **Continuing Education**:  
   Concerns were raised about the vagueness of continuing education requirements in the rules. The committee discussed the need for clearer guidelines on acceptable courses.  
   
3. **Approval with Future Revisions**:  
   Despite concerns, the committee moved to approve the interim rules, with the understanding that further rulemaking would address issues like student licensure and continuing education.

### **Household Goods Carriage Rules**
1. **Interim Rules**:  
   The committee reviewed interim rules for the carriage of household goods by motor vehicles, introduced following the repeal of RSA 375a and the enactment of RSA 359-T. The rules were based on the previous 4600 series rules, which may still be in effect.  
   
2. **Conflicts Between Rules**:  
   There was confusion about whether the 4600 series rules remained valid and how they would interact with the new 9100 series rules. The Department of Safety clarified that the 9100 rules would take precedence in case of conflict.  
   
3. **Areas Needing Clarification**:  
   The committee identified several issues requiring clarification, including the calculation of the 10% overage rule for estimates and the process for voluntary suspensions of carrier permits.  
   
4. **Conditional Approval**:  
   The committee conditionally approved the interim rules, expecting the Department of Safety to address the identified issues during the regular rulemaking process.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with motions to postpone or conditionally approve various rules, reflecting the committee’s commitment to ensuring clarity, compliance with federal regulations, and stakeholder input in the rulemaking process. Key themes included addressing conflicts of interest in case management, improving accessibility and workforce development in education and healthcare, and clarifying administrative procedures for household goods carriage. The committee postponed further discussions on certain rules to allow for additional review and refinement.
