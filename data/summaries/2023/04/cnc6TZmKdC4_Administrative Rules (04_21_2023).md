**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (04/21/2023)**

On April 21, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss and review various administrative rules across multiple sectors, including education, healthcare, tenant protections, and transportation. The meeting focused on ensuring clarity, compliance with federal regulations, and stakeholder input in the rulemaking process. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Education Administrative Rules**
1. **Comprehensive Agricultural Educator Certification**:
   - The committee discussed the repeal of the "comprehensive agricultural educator" certification due to the low number of educators holding this credential. The certification will be integrated into the Career and Technical Education (CTE) agriculture endorsement, which does not require a bachelorâ€™s degree. This change aims to streamline certifications and address the shortage of agricultural educators. While concerns were raised about potentially lowering educational standards, the decision was based on recommendations from the Professional Standards Board and public input.

2. **Other Education Rules**:
   - The committee briefly reviewed rules related to comprehensive business educators and professional education requirements, with no significant objections or changes proposed.

### **Case Management Agencies**
1. **Licensing Requirements**:
   - The committee examined licensing requirements for case management agencies, which coordinate care and services for clients. Discussions centered on whether the rules align with broader definitions and corrective action plans. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clarified that the rules are consistent with RSA 151 and were developed in consultation with providers.

2. **Conflict-Free Case Management**:
   - The Department is under a corrective action plan with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure conflict-free case management, with a compliance deadline of July 1, 2023. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts of interest, particularly when area agencies provide both case management and direct services. Testimony from Emily Johnson of Granite Case Management emphasized the need for clarity to avoid conflicts of interest. The committee stressed the importance of separating case management services from direct services to comply with federal regulations.

### **Tenant Protections for Individuals with Disabilities**
- The committee addressed concerns raised by the Disability Rights Center regarding eviction protections for individuals with disabilities in group homes. The DHHS proposed adding a residency agreement to ensure compliance with federal Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) settings rules, which require protections comparable to landlord-tenant laws. Specific concerns included the clarity of eviction notices and the right to appeal. The committee requested explicit language about appeal rights in eviction notices to ensure individuals are fully informed of their rights.

### **Respiratory Care Practitioners**
- The committee reviewed interim rules for respiratory care practitioners, set to expire on May 23, 2023. Concerns were raised about the lack of provisions for student licensure and the vagueness of continuing education requirements. Testimony from respiratory therapists highlighted that New Hampshire is the only state without student licensure rules, which negatively impacts the recruitment and retention of students. The committee considered postponing the approval of the rules to allow for further stakeholder input and clarity on these issues.

### **Carriage of Household Goods by Motor Vehicles**
- The committee discussed the adoption of new interim rules under RSA 359-T, which replaces the repealed RSA 375-A. Issues were raised about the coexistence of the new rules (9100 series) with the old rules (4600 series) and the need for clarity on which rules take precedence in case of conflict. The committee also addressed the need for clear language regarding the 10% threshold for exceeding estimates and the process for voluntary suspensions of carrier certificates or permits. The Department of Safety agreed to add language specifying that the new rules take precedence over the old rules and to clarify the 10% threshold based on the original estimate. The committee conditionally approved the interim rules, pending these clarifications.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting emphasized the importance of clear language, stakeholder engagement, and compliance with federal regulations in the rulemaking process. Several items were conditionally approved or postponed for further review, including rules for respiratory care practitioners and the carriage of household goods. The committee adjourned without further objections, with plans to address unresolved issues in future meetings.

Overall, the discussions reflected a commitment to protecting vulnerable populations, streamlining administrative processes, and ensuring that rules are both effective and enforceable.
