### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (April 4, 2023)

The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on April 4, 2023, to discuss several significant Senate bills, with a primary focus on healthcare access, Medicaid expansion, and workforce support. The meeting included public hearings, testimonies, and detailed discussions on the following key topics:

---

#### **1. Opioid Abatement and Substance Use Disorder Treatment (Senate Bill 32)**  
Introduced by Senator Rosenwald, **SB 32** proposes updates to the opioid abatement fund, established in 2020 to manage settlement funds from opioid litigation. The bill aims to streamline grant distribution, clarify eligibility, and expand reimbursement for substance use disorder treatments, including naloxone and FDA-approved medications. New Hampshire expects over $300 million from settlements over the next 18 years, with 15% allocated to litigating subdivisions and the remainder to the abatement fund. The Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) expressed strong support for the bill, highlighting its alignment with best practices in addressing the opioid crisis.

#### **2. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (Senate Bill 34)**  
Sponsored by Senator Gray, **SB 34** addresses technical fixes related to the transfer of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) from the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to DHHS. The bill allows the release of aggregate, de-identified PDMP data by county, which was previously restricted, and corrects terminology while transferring certain provisions back to OPLC. DHHS supports the bill, emphasizing its importance for data coordination and public health efforts.

#### **3. Nursing Workforce Flexibility (Senate Bill 87)**  
Introduced by Senator Ward and presented by Daley Frenette, **SB 87** aims to address healthcare workforce shortages by allowing retired nurses and nursing students to practice in youth camps and recreational settings. The bill clarifies definitions and standards for medical personnel, addressing the challenges of hiring seasonal nurses. The New Hampshire YMCA and New Hampshire Camp Directors Association supported the bill, citing the need for flexibility in licensing to ensure adequate healthcare coverage in these settings.

#### **4. Medicaid Expansion and Granite Advantage Health Care Program (Senate Bill 263)**  
The meeting extensively discussed **SB 263**, introduced by Senator Jeb Bradley, which seeks to permanently reauthorize New Hampshire’s Medicaid expansion program, known as the Granite Advantage Health Care Program. Key points included:

- **Program Impact**: Since its inception in 2014, Medicaid expansion has significantly reduced uncompensated care costs, lowered uninsured rates, and improved access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment. It has also helped individuals return to the workforce and stabilized healthcare premiums for employers.
  
- **Personal Testimonies**: Individuals shared powerful stories of how Medicaid expansion transformed their lives, enabling access to critical healthcare services, addiction recovery, and chronic disease management. For example, one man with ulcerative colitis regained his health, job, and home through affordable medication provided by Medicaid.

- **Economic and Public Health Benefits**: Stakeholders emphasized the program’s economic benefits, including $500 million in annual federal funding that supports hospitals, reduces uncompensated care, and strengthens the healthcare workforce. The program also helps small businesses by alleviating the burden of providing health insurance.

- **Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment**: Providers highlighted Medicaid expansion’s role in addressing New Hampshire’s mental health and addiction crises, increasing access to inpatient treatment, medication-assisted treatment, and recovery support services.

- **Call for Permanent Reauthorization**: Advocates urged the legislature to make Medicaid expansion permanent, citing its proven success over the past decade and the need for stability in healthcare access and economic benefits. Temporary reauthorizations were criticized for creating uncertainty and hindering long-term planning.

- **Concerns and Opposition**: Some speakers expressed concerns about the program’s long-term sustainability, its impact on federal debt, and the absence of work requirements. However, these concerns were outweighed by overwhelming support from healthcare providers, business representatives, and advocacy groups.

#### **5. Youth Recreational Programs (Senate Bill 171)**  
Introduced by Representative Denise Rashardi, **SB 171** modifies the definition of youth recreational programs to include children under six years old, addressing inconsistencies with full-day kindergarten programs. This change would allow organizations like the Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, and YWCAs to provide before and after-school care to younger children, helping to alleviate child care shortages. Testimony from Diane Fitzpatrick of the Boys and Girls Club of Manchester highlighted the need for this change to better serve families.

---

#### **6. Genetic Testing Disclosure (Senate Bill 240)**  
Sponsored by Senator Sue Prentiss, **SB 240** allows healthcare facilities to disclose genetic testing results to clinical entities for care coordination and research, removing administrative barriers. Testimony from Courtney Tanner of Dartmouth Health emphasized the bill’s potential to improve patient access to innovative treatments while maintaining HIPAA protections and informed consent. Concerns about potential misuse of genetic information were addressed with assurances that safeguards would remain in place.
