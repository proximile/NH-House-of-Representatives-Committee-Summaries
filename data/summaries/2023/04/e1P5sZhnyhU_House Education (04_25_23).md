**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting on April 25, 2023**

The NH House of Representatives Education Committee convened on April 25, 2023, to discuss several education-related bills, with significant focus on **SB 272 (Parent’s Bill of Rights in Education)**, **SB 218 (Early Educator Professional Development Grant)**, and **SB 266 (Statewide Education Improvement Assessment Program)**. The meeting highlighted deep divisions over parental rights, teacher retention, and education assessment reforms. Here’s a detailed overview:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **SB 272: Parent’s Bill of Rights in Education**
- **Purpose**: This bill sought to establish a Parent’s Bill of Rights, emphasizing parental authority and transparency in schools, particularly regarding issues like gender identity.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Supporters**: Argued that the bill upholds parental rights and ensures truthfulness in communication between schools and parents. They cited Supreme Court precedents supporting parental authority in education.
  - **Opponents**: Contended that the bill targets LGBTQ+ students, disrupts trust between schools and families, and aligns with a broader national agenda that harms public education and marginalized children.
- **Outcome**: A motion to pass the bill (OTP) failed, and the committee voted to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**, effectively halting its progress. A minority report is expected from Representative Miler.
