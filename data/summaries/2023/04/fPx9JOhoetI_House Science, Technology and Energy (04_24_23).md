### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Science, Technology and Energy (04/24/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 24, 2023, focused on **Senate Bill 54**, which addresses energy procurement, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and the role of utilities and third-party oversight in ensuring low-cost, reliable energy for ratepayers. The discussions, spanning four segments, highlighted the complexities of energy policy, the need for transparency, and the balance between long-term commitments and flexibility. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

#### **1. Purpose and Scope of SB 54**
The subcommittee aimed to clarify questions about SB 54 and determine whether to recommend it to the full committee. The bill focuses on:
- **Energy Procurement**: Establishing a framework for utilities to procure long-term energy resources, including renewable energy.
- **Ratepayer Protections**: Ensuring that costs and benefits are fairly distributed and that ratepayers are shielded from excessive risks.
- **Market Stability**: Reducing exposure to energy price volatility, particularly during winter months.

---

#### **2. Role of Utilities and Third-Party Oversight**
- **Utility Involvement**: The Department of Energy (DOE) argued that utilities are better equipped than the DOE to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) due to their expertise and resources. However, concerns were raised about potential conflicts of interest, as utilities often have affiliates bidding on the same projects.
- **Third-Party Oversight**: Significant discussion centered on involving independent third parties to evaluate RFPs and ensure transparency. Eversource (a utility) supported this idea, emphasizing the complexity of energy market analysis. The DOE and Consumer Advocate suggested hiring consultants for oversight.
- **Public Input**: Proposals were made to allow public comment and independent evaluation of RFP responses by intervening parties, such as power suppliers. However, concerns about confidentiality and competitive issues were raised.

---

#### **3. Contract Terms and Risk Management**
- **Contract Length**: The bill allows for contracts up to 20 years, which is standard for long-term energy agreements. While longer contracts can reduce financing costs, concerns were raised about locking ratepayers into outdated technologies or unfavorable terms. The committee debated whether shorter contracts might offer more flexibility.
- **Performance Incentives and Penalties**: The subcommittee discussed adding language to require performance incentives for meeting cost projections and penalties for non-performance. Suggestions were made to ensure these obligations apply at all times, not just during peak demand periods.
- **Stranded Costs**: The subcommittee debated how to handle costs if a contract is rejected, suggesting they could be treated as stranded costs and recovered through a separate charge.

---

#### **4. Renewable Energy and Environmental Attributes**
- **Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)**: The handling of RECs and their resale to minimize costs for ratepayers was a recurring topic. Suggestions were made to distribute RECs directly to load-serving entities to maximize benefits for ratepayers.
- **Energy Arbitrage**: There was debate about whether utilities should be required (rather than permitted) to sell energy and environmental attributes in the wholesale market to minimize costs for ratepayers. Eversource supported this change to clarify their intent.

---

#### **5. Cost Recovery and Ratepayer Protections**
- **Cost Recovery Mechanisms**: The bill proposes recovering costs through a uniform annual factor applied to all ratepayers. Suggestions were made to separate these costs from distribution rates and treat them as a common supply cost or stranded cost if the contract is not approved.
- **Community Power Concerns**: Representatives from the Community Power Coalition raised concerns about their ability to evaluate RFP responses and participate in the process, given their growing role as an electricity supplier in New Hampshire.

---

#### **6. In-State vs. Out-of-State Resources**
- **Prioritizing In-State Resources**: Debate centered on whether the bill should prioritize in-state energy resources. The DOE opposed such language, citing Commerce Clause concerns and the regional nature of energy markets.
- **Transmission Costs**: The bill's treatment of transmission costs was scrutinized, with concerns raised about the potential for unchecked expenses and the need for cost-benefit analyses.

---

#### **7. Amendments and Next Steps**
- **Amendment Proposals**: The subcommittee reviewed proposed amendments, including changes to language about in-state resources, cost-benefit analyses, and public comment requirements. Key changes included shifting from "May" to "Shall" regarding utilities selling energy and environmental attributes into the wholesale market.
- **Finalizing Language**: The committee agreed to reconvene on **Monday, May 1st**, to finalize the amendment language and hold an executive session to vote on the proposed changes.

---

#### **8. Broader Policy Considerations**
- **Competitive Market Impact**: The potential impact of long-term PPAs on New Hampshire’s competitive energy market was discussed. While some argued that the bill could stabilize prices by reducing market volatility, others expressed concerns about unintended consequences for existing generators.
- **Existing vs. New Resources**: There was debate over whether existing resources (e.g., base-load facilities) should be eligible for PPAs. Proponents of the bill emphasized the need for **new generation** to address New England’s energy challenges, while others argued that existing facilities could provide cost-effective solutions for ratepayers.
- **Utility Profit and Risk**: The question of whether utilities should earn a profit for signing PPAs was addressed, with concerns that such incentives could jeopardize the bill’s passage. The focus remained on **performance-based incentives** rather than upfront rewards.

---

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of energy procurement and the need for transparency, flexibility, and ratepayer protections. The subcommittee worked to balance long-term commitments with the ability to adapt to technological changes and market conditions. Amendments were proposed to address concerns about cost recovery, RECs, public input, and the impact on the competitive market. The committee planned to reconvene on May 1st to finalize the bill’s language and move it forward.
