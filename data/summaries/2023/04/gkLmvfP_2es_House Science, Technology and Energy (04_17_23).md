The April 17, 2023, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee focused on a range of energy-related bills, with a particular emphasis on **Senate Bill 54**, **Senate Bill 52**, and other measures addressing energy reliability, affordability, and infrastructure development. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and key themes:

---

### **Senate Bill 54: Long-Term Energy Procurement and Reliability**
**Purpose**: The bill aims to address **winter reliability, price volatility, and high energy costs** by enabling utilities to enter into long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for new and incremental energy resources. It emphasizes **technology neutrality**, allowing various energy sources (e.g., hydrogen, solar, wind, natural gas) to compete.

**Key Provisions**:
- **Consumer Protections**: Safeguards ensure **just and reasonable rates**, with oversight from the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Office of the Consumer Advocate.
- **Project Size Limits**: PPAs are capped at **2 million megawatt hours** (20% of New Hampshire’s load) to balance reliability and market competition.
- **Cost Recovery**: Utilities can pass costs or savings from PPAs to all ratepayers, including those using competitive suppliers.
- **Timeline**: Utilities must submit PPAs by 2025, with a 9-month review period.

**Supporters’ Arguments**:
- **Price Stability**: PPAs could hedge against energy price volatility, particularly during winter peaks, and provide long-term cost savings.
- **Winter Reliability**: Diversifying energy sources reduces reliance on natural gas, which has seen extreme price volatility.
- **New Investments**: The bill incentivizes **new energy projects**, addressing New Hampshire’s energy challenges.

**Concerns and Criticisms**:
- **Market Distortion**: Critics, including the New England Power Generators Association (NEPGA), argued that long-term PPAs could undermine the competitive market and lead to **stranded costs**, citing past failures like the Berlin biomass plant.
- **Risk to Ratepayers**: Concerns were raised about the potential for **bad deals** if market conditions change or contracts become unfeasible.
- **Technology Neutrality**: Some questioned whether the bill adequately supports **renewable energy** or risks favoring traditional sources like natural gas.

**Legislative Process**: The bill was debated extensively, with suggestions to retain it for further study to clarify language and address concerns, such as prioritizing in-state projects and ensuring utility accountability.

### **Senate Bill 52: Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Infrastructure**
**Purpose**: The bill establishes a **study committee** to evaluate the regulation, operation, and funding of EV charging stations in New Hampshire, aiming to support tourism and avoid losing revenue to neighboring states.

**Key Points**:
- **Funding Mechanisms**: The committee will explore non-ratepayer funding sources, such as federal grants, private partnerships, and surcharges on electricity purchases at public charging stations.
- **Infrastructure Challenges**: Installing **Level 3 fast chargers** requires significant utility-side infrastructure upgrades, raising concerns about costs being passed to ratepayers.
- **Performance Issues**: Existing fast chargers often fail to deliver advertised speeds, and there is no state oversight for EV chargers (unlike gas pumps).
- **Economic and Environmental Benefits**: EVs can lower electric rates by acting as flexible loads during off-peak hours, and the industry is moving away from cobalt in batteries.

**Support**: Stakeholders, including Eversource and Clean Energy NH, supported the bill, highlighting its potential to address **charging deserts** and spur **economic development**.

### **Other Key Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 225: Utility Property Assessment Commission**:
   - Renews a commission to address the assessment of utility property for tax purposes, focusing on power generation facilities. The commission’s deadline is extended to November 1, 2023.

2. **Senate Bill 16: Utility Pole Attachments**:
   - Establishes a stakeholder group to address utility pole issues. A sunset clause (e.g., 5 years) was suggested to ensure the committee concludes its work.

3. **Senate Bill 40: Customer Generators**:
   - Focuses on legacy hydroelectric facilities, with an amendment limiting the bill’s scope to two specific companies.

4. **Senate Bill 166: Grid Modernization**:
   - An amendment clarified language around energy project evaluations, ensuring consistency in how reduced retail loads and transmission costs are credited.

5. **Senate Bill 167: Green Hydrogen**:
   - An amendment ensures incentives apply only to **green hydrogen**, not gray or blue hydrogen. Discussions highlighted the need to attract federal funding for this emerging technology.

6. **Senate Bill 69 and 79: Customer Generator Groups**:
   - SB 69 creates a new group for non-profits, while SB 79 focuses on industrial hosts. Both bills sparked debate about potential cost shifts to ratepayers.

7. **Senate Bill 113: System Benefits Charge**:
   - Clarifies annual versus lifetime energy savings, with an amendment to remove a 0.25% adder to strengthen guardrails.

8. **Senate Bill 161: Community Solar Projects**:
   - Addresses low-to-moderate income community solar, with an amendment allowing the Department of Energy to issue rules or orders for program development.

### **Recurring Themes**
1. **Balancing Reliability, Affordability, and Innovation**:
   - Discussions emphasized the need to ensure energy reliability and affordability while supporting new technologies like renewable energy, green hydrogen, and EV infrastructure.

2. **Consumer Protection**:
   - Many bills included provisions to protect ratepayers from excessive costs, but concerns persisted about potential **cost shifts** and **stranded costs**.

3. **Market Competition**:
   - There was a strong focus on maintaining competitive energy markets, with warnings against policies that could distort prices or favor specific resources.

4. **Infrastructure Investment**:
   - Both energy and EV infrastructure require significant investment, with a push to leverage federal funding and avoid burdening ratepayers.

5. **Legislative Process**:
   - Many bills were seen as complex and requiring further refinement, leading to suggestions to retain or amend them rather than moving forward immediately.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s energy landscape, with legislators grappling with how to balance **market competition**, **consumer protection**, and the need for **reliable, affordable energy**. Key bills like SB 54 and SB 52 reflect broader efforts to address immediate energy challenges, support innovation, and ensure economic development while safeguarding ratepayers. The committee planned to continue discussions in work sessions and consider amendments to address unresolved issues.
