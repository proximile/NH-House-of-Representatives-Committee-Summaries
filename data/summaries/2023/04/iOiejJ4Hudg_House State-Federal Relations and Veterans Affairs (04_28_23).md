The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee, held on April 28, 2023. The primary focus of the meeting was **Senate Bill 103 (SB 103)**, which seeks to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the **Raid on Fort William and Mary** (later renamed Fort Constitution) in December 1774. This event is considered by some to mark the first shots of the American Revolution, predating Lexington and Concord.

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Introduction of SB 103**:  
   - The bill was introduced by Grant Bossy on behalf of Senator Rebecca Perkins.  
   - It aims to recognize New Hampshire's role in the American Revolution by designating December 14-15 as Fort Constitution Days and integrating the commemoration into the state's **Sestercentennial Commission** (250th anniversary of the Revolution).  

2. **Historical Context**:  
   - The raid involved 400 colonists overpowering a small British garrison at Fort William and Mary, seizing gunpowder critical to the Revolutionary War effort.  
   - Paul Revereâ€™s first ride was to warn colonists of British plans to secure the fort's gunpowder, four months before his famous ride to Lexington and Concord.  

3. **Amendment to the Bill**:  
   - A drafting error in the bill listed the date as 2026 instead of 2024. The committee voted unanimously to amend the bill to correct this.  

4. **Committee Discussions**:  
   - Members discussed the historical significance of the raid, including minor injuries sustained during the confrontation and the distribution of gunpowder to Revolutionary forces.  
   - Representatives shared personal connections to Revolutionary history, including family ties to key figures like John Stark.  

5. **Vote and Recommendation**:  
   - The committee voted 12-0 to approve the amended bill and recommend it for consent.  

6. **Closing Remarks**:  
   - The chair thanked members for their participation and acknowledged the completion of the committee's agenda for the session.  

The meeting highlighted the committee's focus on honoring New Hampshire's historical contributions to the American Revolution and ensuring the Sestercentennial Commission recognizes this pivotal event.
