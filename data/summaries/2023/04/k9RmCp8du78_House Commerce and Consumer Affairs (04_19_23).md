### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting – House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee (April 19, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on April 19, 2023, to discuss several bills related to healthcare, insurance, and consumer affairs. The meeting focused on improving access to healthcare services, modernizing insurance regulations, and exploring the feasibility of a state-based health exchange. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Healthcare and Mental Health Integration**

1. **Integrated Behavioral Health Services (SB235)**  
   - **Purpose**: To integrate behavioral health services into primary care and specialty sites, improving access to mental health treatment.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Primary care physicians often serve as the first point of contact for mental health issues, but access to psychiatrists is limited.  
     - Embedding psychologists or other mental health professionals in primary care settings can enhance access, reduce emergency room visits, and lower healthcare costs.  
     - The bill ensures insurance companies cannot deny coverage for mental health services delivered through this model.  
     - Concerns were raised about the bill’s language, including vague terms, reimbursement rates, and specific billing codes (CPT codes). Some stakeholders suggested non-legislative solutions might suffice.  
     - The New Hampshire Psychological Association supports the bill but opposes retaining it for further study, emphasizing the need to codify the practice into law.

2. **Reproductive Health Care Cost Study (SB198)**  
   - **Purpose**: To study the cost of expanding group health insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF) without requiring a diagnosis of infertility, benefiting same-sex couples and single individuals.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The study aims to assess the financial impact of expanded IVF coverage, with the hope of demonstrating minimal cost increases.  
     - Supporters highlighted the importance of equitable access to fertility treatments and data-driven policy decisions.

### **State-Based Health Exchange (SB243)**  

1. **Purpose**: To evaluate the feasibility of transitioning from the federal health benefit exchange (healthcare.gov) to a state-based exchange for individuals purchasing health insurance.  
2. **Key Points**:  
   - **Current Challenges**: New Hampshire relies on the federal exchange, which has limitations such as a one-month data lag and lack of flexibility in policy decisions (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic).  
   - **Benefits of State Control**: A state-based exchange could save up to $5 million annually in federal fees, improve enrollment, and allow tailored policies to local needs.  
   - **Study Committee Proposal**: The bill proposes forming a study committee to assess risks, benefits, costs, and customization options for a state exchange.  
   - **Financial Considerations**: Transitioning could reduce costs (federal exchanges charge a 2.75% commission, while state exchanges often operate at half that cost) and leverage federal matching funds.  
   - **Skepticism and Caution**: Some representatives expressed concerns about the costs, risks, and liability of transitioning, emphasizing the need for unbiased analysis.

### **Insurance Regulations and Modernization**

1. **Senate Bill 31**:  
   - **Purpose**: To make technical updates to insurance laws, including allowing third-party administrators (TPAs) to post bonds instead of meeting licensing requirements, modernizing language in property and casualty insurance statutes, and addressing federal healthcare reform regulations.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Heather Silverstein, General Counsel for the Insurance Department, provided details and answered questions.  

2. **Senate Bill 82**:  
   - **Purpose**: To ensure timely payment of claims by managed care organizations, addressing delays that impact healthcare providers and patients.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Claims must be adjudicated within 45 days if additional information is requested; otherwise, they are deemed clean and must be paid.  
     - The New Hampshire Hospital Association supported the bill, while Anthem opposed it, calling it repetitive and unnecessary.  

3. **Senate Bill 99**:  
   - **Purpose**: To remove the requirement for on-site audits of third-party administrators (TPAs), allowing virtual audits instead.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The change reflects modern practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

4. **Senate Bill 142**:  
   - **Purpose**: To update insurance statutes by replacing outdated terms like "Rating Bureau" with "advisory organization" and clarifying confidentiality provisions for proprietary information.
