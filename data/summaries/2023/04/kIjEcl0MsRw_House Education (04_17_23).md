### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Meeting (04/17/23)

The NH House of Representatives meeting on April 17, 2023, focused on various aspects of education policy, including **student assessments, accountability systems, educational standards, data privacy, and career development**. The discussions centered on legislative efforts to streamline policies, align state practices with federal requirements, and address challenges in education delivery and oversight. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and points from the meeting:

---

#### 1. **Student Assessments and Accountability**
   - **Assessment Flexibility**: Representatives debated the use of **SAT** and **ACT** as statewide assessments, with concerns about student anxiety and the potential for tutoring to skew results. The Department of Education (DOE) emphasized avoiding vendor-specific language in statutes to maintain flexibility in future contracts.
   - **Participation Rates**: The federal **95% participation rate** requirement for assessments was discussed, with opt-outs potentially impacting school accountability scores. Non-participating students' scores are counted as zeroes in federal metrics, penalizing schools with high opt-out rates.
   - **Proficiency Levels**: Student performance is reported through proficiency levels (below proficient, approaching proficient, proficient, or above proficient), determined by standardized **cut scores**. This system is used to identify the lowest-performing schools to meet federal accountability requirements.
   - **Alternative Assessments**: The **Performance Assessment of Competency Education (PACE)** program, which used performance-based assessments, was discontinued due to funding and complexity. The state currently relies on the **SAT** for high school accountability, with consideration of extending its contract.

#### 2. **Educational Standards and Adequacy**
   - **Statewide Academic Standards**: The committee clarified the distinction between **Statewide academic standards** (adopted by the State Board of Education) and **academic standards**, emphasizing the need for consistency across grade levels and subjects like U.S. history.
   - **Adequate Education**: Discussions focused on defining **adequate education** and ensuring schools meet minimum standards. The relationship between statewide testing and the broader goals of education was questioned, with acknowledgment that testing is only one component of accountability.
   - **School Approval vs. Adequacy**: The committee distinguished between **minimum standards for adequacy** and broader **school approval processes**, emphasizing that adequacy is the foundation of public education, with additional layers of standards built on top.

---

#### 3. **Accountability Systems and Oversight**
   - **IBASS and PBAS**: The **Input-Based Accountability System (IBASS)** and **Performance-Based Accountability System (PBAS)** were discussed as tools for measuring school compliance with adequacy standards. The removal of **NEASC accreditation** as an alternative to IBASS was debated, with a focus on creating a consistent measurement system for all schools.
   - **Legislative Oversight**: The **Legislative Oversight Committee** plays a key role in reviewing academic standards and ensuring compliance with **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act)**. Concerns were raised about the committee’s authority and clarity of responsibilities.
   - **Reporting and Compliance**: The DOE is responsible for implementing statewide accountability systems, with schools demonstrating compliance through reporting. Challenges with **school visits** to verify compliance were noted, with suggestions to use retired educators or NEASC reports as alternatives.

---

#### 4. **Data Privacy and Retention**
   - **Data Retention**: Concerns were raised about the **eight-year retention period** for student data, with calls for clearer policies on data retention and destruction in vendor contracts.
   - **Third-Party Platforms**: Discussions on **HB 1612** and **RSA 189:70** highlighted concerns about student data privacy on platforms like **LinkedIn**, particularly regarding third-party terms of service, age restrictions, and potential risks like hate speech policies or data breaches.
   - **Student Data Privacy Consortium**: New Hampshire’s efforts to secure over 1,300 data privacy agreements with online platforms since 2019 were acknowledged, but further work was needed to address emerging risks.

---

#### 5. **Career Development and Social Media**
   - **LinkedIn and Credentialing**: The use of platforms like LinkedIn for career development was debated, with some arguing that **industry-standard certifications** (e.g., Adobe or Pearson) are more valuable than LinkedIn badges. Schools were encouraged to teach students how to use such platforms responsibly.
   - **CTE Programs**: The committee discussed integrating **Career and Technical Education (CTE)** programs into district curricula, emphasizing their role in preparing students for the workforce.
   - **Legislative Language**: Proposed amendments to **RSA 189:70** aimed to clarify the use of social media for career exploration, but concerns about legislative clarity and student safety led to discussions about reverting to the original bill language.

---

#### 6. **Graduation Rates and Competencies**
   - **Graduation Rates**: The committee aligned state law with federal law by reducing the graduation rate threshold from **69% to 67%**, clarifying that this change would not significantly impact school accountability metrics.
   - **Competencies vs. Standards**: The distinction between **competencies** and **academic standards** was clarified, with competencies sometimes representing a single standard or a collection of standards. The definition of "competency" was reinstated after being accidentally deleted.

---

#### 7. **Local Control and Federal Influence**
   - **Local Flexibility**: There was debate over whether school districts should have the flexibility to use alternative assessments without federal funding. Concerns were raised about losing statewide data comparability and accountability.
   - **Federal Funding**: The state leverages **federal funding** for its assessment programs, which primarily focus on federally mandated tests. This has led to concerns that non-tested subjects (e.g., social studies, art, music) are being marginalized in the curriculum.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted efforts to **streamline education policies, improve accountability systems, and address emerging challenges** in student assessments, data privacy, and career development. Key priorities included **aligning state practices with federal requirements, ensuring data privacy, and providing clarity in legislative language**. The committee planned to continue discussions in future meetings to finalize legislation and address unresolved concerns.
