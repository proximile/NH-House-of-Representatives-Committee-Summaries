### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (04/17/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on **April 17, 2023**, covered a wide range of topics related to education legislation, assessments, accountability, and standards. The discussions centered on balancing flexibility, federal compliance, local control, and student privacy while addressing the challenges of implementation, cost, and clarity in state education policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all six segments:

---

#### **1. State Assessments and Academic Standards**
   - **State Assessments and SAT**: The committee debated removing specific references to the SAT and College Board from state statutes to allow flexibility in choosing assessment vendors. Concerns were raised about potential biases and the SAT’s effectiveness as a statewide assessment, while others defended its role as a college entrance exam and its alignment with federal requirements.
   - **Vendor Flexibility**: The importance of not specifying vendors in statutes was emphasized to maintain flexibility, with the state’s contracting process ensuring accountability through RFPs and approval from the governor and council.
   - **Proficiency and Cut Scores**: Discussions focused on clarifying proficiency levels in assessments and making them more transparent to the public, akin to traditional grading scales.
   - **Academic Standards**: The committee reviewed the definition of academic standards, debating whether they should include course-specific standards or broader grade-level standards. Concerns were raised about the marginalization of non-tested subjects like social studies, health, and arts.

---

#### **2. Accountability and Compliance**
   - **Opt-Outs and Accountability**: Parent opt-outs from state assessments were a concern, as they are counted as zeros under federal ESSA requirements, potentially labeling schools as underperforming. The committee acknowledged conflicts between federal penalties for opt-outs and state laws prohibiting such penalties.
   - **Federal and State Alignment**: The committee discussed the implications of federal ESSA mandates on state education policy, including the need for waivers to implement alternative assessments like the discontinued PACE (Performance Assessment of Competency Education) program.
   - **Accountability Systems**: The IBASS (Input-Based Accountability System) and PBASS (Performance-Based Accountability System) were discussed as tools for measuring whether schools provide an adequate education. The committee emphasized the need for consistency across public, charter, and non-public schools.
   - **NeSA Accreditation**: The role of NeSA (New England Association of Schools and Colleges) accreditation was debated, with the committee deciding to remove it as an alternative to IBASS to ensure all schools are evaluated under the same state accountability system.

---

#### **3. Charter Schools and Public School Approval**
   - **Charter Schools**: The committee distinguished between conversion charter schools (traditional public schools that convert to charter schools) and standalone state-authorized charter schools, discussing their governance and operation within or outside public school districts.
   - **Public School Approval**: The debate centered on the clarity of minimum standards for public school approval and their application across different types of schools, including charter and non-public schools.

---

#### **4. Data Privacy and Student Safety**
   - **Data Privacy and Retention**: Concerns were raised about student data retention and destruction policies, particularly how long third-party vendors should retain assessment data. The committee considered the need for clearer guidelines.
   - **Social Media for Career Development**: The committee discussed a bill allowing high school students to use platforms like LinkedIn for career development. Concerns about student safety, privacy, and the terms of service of social media platforms were raised, with some suggesting alternative, education-specific platforms like PowerSchool.

---

#### **5. Graduation Rates and Adequate Education**
   - **Graduation Rates**: The committee debated the threshold for identifying low-performing schools, aligning state law with federal requirements that set the bar at a 67% graduation rate for Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI) schools.
   - **Criteria for Adequate Education**: Discussions focused on clarifying the language around the criteria for an adequate education, separating it from broader minimum standards for public school approval. The committee aimed to ensure clarity without altering the substance of the law.

---

#### **6. Local Control vs. State Mandates**
   - **Local Control vs. Standardization**: Some representatives expressed concerns about reducing local control over assessments, while others emphasized the need for standardized data to ensure accountability and comparability across schools.
   - **Stakeholder Involvement**: The importance of involving educators, parents, and community members in the development of standards and assessments was emphasized, with discussions about codifying consultation processes.

---

#### **7. Cost and Resources**
   - **Financial Constraints**: Expanding testing to additional subjects or reintroducing programs like PACE would require significant financial resources, which the state currently lacks. The committee acknowledged these constraints and considered potential solutions, such as contracting retired superintendents for school visitations.

---

#### **8. Next Steps and Future Considerations**
   - **Technical Corrections**: The committee emphasized the need for technical corrections to ensure consistency in language across education statutes, including aligning definitions with minimum standards and removing redundant or outdated language.
   - **Future Policy Improvements**: The committee acknowledged the need for further review and potential changes to the state plan, particularly in light of ongoing updates to minimum standards and the impact of the pandemic on education.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a comprehensive examination of the state’s education policies, focusing on balancing federal compliance, local control, and student privacy.
