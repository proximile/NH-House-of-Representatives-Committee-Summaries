### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (04/25/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on April 25, 2023, to address significant concerns regarding the Family Court system. The committee was established in response to widespread allegations of procedural irregularities, delays, denial of due process, and perceived biases within the Family Division. These issues came to the forefront during the 2023-2024 term, as the House Children and Family Law Committee reviewed several bills that highlighted systemic problems in the Family Court.

#### Committee Formation and Purpose
The committee comprises 10 members, evenly divided between political parties and drawn from the Children and Family Law Committee and the Judiciary Committee. Its primary objective is to investigate allegations of failures to adhere to statutes, court rules, and procedural standards, and to make recommendations for future legislative action to address these issues.

#### Discussion on Evidence Withholding and Due Process
One of the key topics discussed was the withholding of evidence in family court proceedings. A participant shared a personal story involving a domestic violence (DV) case where they were acquitted in criminal court but still faced restrictions on unsupervised visitation with their child in family court. The participant emphasized the lack of access to crucial evidence, such as a 9-1-1 call, which they believed could significantly impact their case and potentially lead to a new trial.

The committee clarified its focus on the Family Division of the Circuit Court and acknowledged that it does not have jurisdiction over criminal court matters. Members requested specific details, such as RSA numbers, dates, and judicial decisions, to better understand the case and identify potential due process violations. The participant expressed concern about the lack of checks and balances in the system, which they believe affects many parents in similar situations.

#### Testimony Guidelines and Public Participation
The committee outlined specific guidelines for public testimony to ensure a focused and productive discussion:
- Witnesses are encouraged to provide detailed, specific testimony rather than generalizations.
- Testimony should include dates, times, judges’ names, and specific instances of perceived errors.
- The committee will not retry cases but will focus on identifying patterns or procedural issues.
- Members of the public are given five minutes to testify, with a warning at 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
- Stakeholder groups representing multiple individuals will be allotted more time.

#### Concerns Raised
Several critical concerns were raised during the meeting, including:
- Allegations of biases against certain parties in family court cases.
- Failures to follow the Rules of Evidence, leading to unfair outcomes.
- Delays in rendering decisions, which exacerbate the emotional and financial strain on families.
- Inconsistencies in judicial rulings, which undermine confidence in the system.
- Specific issues, such as the handling of 9-1-1 calls in family cases, were highlighted as particularly problematic.

#### Future Plans and Legislative Context
The committee outlined its plans for future sessions, including:
- Holding hearings on specific topics, potentially including mock court sessions to illustrate typical Family Court cases.
- Scheduling visits to observe Family Court proceedings to gain firsthand insights.
- Requesting further testimony from the judicial branch to better understand the challenges faced by the Family Division.

The committee’s formation was partly driven by **House Resolution 14 (HR 14)**, which sought subpoena power to investigate the Family Court. Although HR 14 was tabled due to procedural issues, the committee aims to address the concerns raised in the resolution through its investigations and hearings. The ultimate goal is to provide a balanced and thoughtful examination of the Family Division’s operations and to recommend legislative changes that will improve the system for all parties involved.

#### Conclusion
The meeting concluded with logistical planning for the next session, including scheduling stakeholder groups and confirming the meeting time. The committee is committed to exploring potential legislative changes to address issues related to evidence disclosure, due process, and procedural fairness in family court cases. By fostering a transparent and inclusive dialogue, the committee aims to identify actionable solutions that will enhance the integrity and effectiveness of the Family Division of the Circuit Court.
