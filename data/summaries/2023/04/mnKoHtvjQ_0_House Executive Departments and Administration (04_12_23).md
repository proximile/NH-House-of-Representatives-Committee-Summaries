### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (04/12/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 12, 2023, focused on three key bills: **Senate Bill 106**, **Senate Bill 71**, and **Senate Bill 72**, each addressing critical issues in workforce development, public safety, and healthcare efficiency. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Senate Bill 106: Credentialing Pathway for Early Childhood Education**
**Purpose**: SB 106 aims to establish an **industry-recognized credential** for high school students completing Career Technical Education (CTE) programs in early childhood education. The goal is to address workforce shortages in childcare and provide a **scaffolding pathway** for students to enter the field, earn higher wages, and pursue further education.

**Key Points**:
- **Current Challenges**: The childcare industry faces severe staffing shortages, leading to under-enrollment in programs like Head Start and reduced federal funding due to unmet ratio requirements.
- **Credentialing Pathway**: The bill proposes a **new certification** for CTE students, allowing them to enter the workforce without requiring additional supervised experience (currently 750 hours for non-CTE students). This certification is designed to **attract and retain** young workers by offering a **14% wage increase** ($2/hour more) compared to uncredentialed entry-level workers.
- **Industry Support**: The childcare industry supports the bill, as it provides a **clear pathway** for high school graduates to enter the workforce and addresses critical staffing needs.
- **Broader Implications**: The bill is part of a larger effort to **professionalize childcare**, emphasizing education and training while incentivizing young people to pursue careers in early childhood education.
- **Questions and Concerns**: Representatives raised questions about the **value of the certificate**, its recognition by employers, and the incentives for students to choose early childhood education over other teaching fields. Discussions also covered requirements like background checks and ongoing professional development.
- **Economic Impact**: The bill is seen as a **piece of the puzzle** to address the broader childcare crisis, which impacts workforce participation and economic development.

**Outcome**: The bill was referred to the **licensing committee** for further review and clarification of existing childcare credentialing requirements.

### **Senate Bill 71: Workers' Compensation for Firefighter Cancer Diseases**
**Purpose**: SB 71 seeks to expand workers' compensation coverage to **all types of cancer** for firefighters and establish a commission to study **cancer screening programs**. The bill addresses the occupational cancer risks firefighters face, including exposure to **PFAS** (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in protective gear.

**Key Points**:
- **Current Issues**: Firefighters face a **14% higher risk** of dying from cancer than the general population, with occupational cancer now the leading cause of line-of-duty deaths. Current law excludes certain cancers (e.g., brain, stomach, testicular, and female reproductive cancers) from coverage.
- **Commission's Role**: The proposed commission would study the **prevalence of cancer among firefighters**, the benefits of **early detection**, and the costs of implementing **annual cancer screenings**. Examples from **Massachusetts** and **New Jersey** were cited as successful models.
- **Debate and Concerns**:
  - **Presumption of Occupational Cause**: The bill shifts the burden of proof to workers' compensation carriers to disprove that a firefighter's cancer is job-related, raising concerns about potential overreach.
  - **Cost and Implementation**: Questions were raised about the financial impact on municipalities and the feasibility of widespread screening programs.
  - **PFAS in Gear**: Firefighters are exposed to PFAS in protective gear, which is mandatory for all fire-related activities, increasing their cancer risk.
- **Support from Firefighters**: Representatives from the **Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire** and the **New Hampshire Association of Fire Chiefs** testified in support of the bill, emphasizing the urgent need for expanded cancer coverage and early detection programs.
- **Additional Concerns**: Questions were raised about whether other high-risk groups (e.g., miners, nail salon workers) should also have access to similar workers' compensation benefits.

**Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review, with discussions on potential amendments to address concerns.

### **Senate Bill 72: Provider Credentialing**
**Purpose**: SB 72 aims to streamline the credentialing process for healthcare providers when they change locations or practice ownership, ensuring no disruption in network participation.

**Key Points**:
- **Current Challenges**: Testimony highlighted the delays and challenges in credentialing, which negatively impact patients and providers.
- **Support**: **Paula Minahan** of the **New Hampshire Hospital Association** and **Alex Feldbabel** from the **Insurance Department** supported the bill, emphasizing its importance in addressing timely credentialing and access to care.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (18-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

### **Key Themes Across the Bills**:
1. **Health and Safety**: SB 71 addresses the health risks faced by firefighters, emphasizing the need for expanded cancer coverage and early detection programs.
2. **Efficiency in Healthcare**: SB 72 seeks to improve the credentialing process for healthcare providers to ensure timely access to care.
3. **Workforce Development**: SB 106 aims to address workforce shortages in early education by providing high school students with industry-recognized credentials, fostering interest in early education careers, and supporting students in transitioning to post-secondary education or the workforce.

### **Conclusion**:
The meeting highlighted the legislature’s focus on addressing critical issues in public safety, healthcare efficiency, and workforce development. While SB 72 passed unanimously, SB 71 and SB 106 were referred to committees for further review and refinement. These bills collectively aim to improve the lives of firefighters, streamline healthcare processes, and bolster the early childhood education workforce in New Hampshire.
