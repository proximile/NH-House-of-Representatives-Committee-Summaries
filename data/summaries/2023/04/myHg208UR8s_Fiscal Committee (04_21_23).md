### **Scheduling and Logistics**
1. **Next Meeting Date**:  
   - The committee scheduled its next meeting for **May 19th at 10 A.M.**, despite conflicts with the Fallen Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Service and the Hillsborough County Executive Committee meeting.

### **Operational and Program Updates**
1. **Medicaid Program**:

2. **Vehicle Mileage and Fleet Management**:  
   - The committee reviewed a report on state vehicles not meeting the required annual mileage. Questions were raised about the reduction in minimum mileage benchmarks and whether cost savings had been achieved, with the Department of Administrative Services citing high gas prices as a limiting factor.

3. **Liquor Commission Store Closure**:  
   - The closure of a non-profitable store in Winchester was discussed, with the Liquor Commission citing flooding issues and proximity to larger stores. The impact on the local community was noted, but nearby stores were deemed sufficient to serve the area.

4. **Youth Development Center (YDC) Claims**:  
   - Judge John Broderick provided an update on the YDC claims office, which handles cases related to sexual and physical abuse. He emphasized the trauma-informed approach of the claims process and highlighted concerns about the statute of limitations, urging prompt action to address unresolved cases.

  - KPMG presented the results of the state’s Federal Single Audit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a motion to accept the Federal Single Audit report and place it on file for public release.
