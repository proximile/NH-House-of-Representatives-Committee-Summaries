### **Arguments in Support of SB 272**

2. **Transparency**: Proponents emphasize the need for transparency in school policies and curricula, ensuring parents are fully informed about their children’s experiences in school.
3. **Protection from Harm**: Some supporters shared concerns about schools overstepping their role, such as encouraging social transitions or medical interventions without parental consent. They argue that parental oversight is necessary to protect children from irreversible decisions.
4. **Trust in Schools**: Supporters believe the bill will foster trust between parents and schools by ensuring open communication and preventing schools from keeping secrets.
5. **Cultural and Ideological Concerns**: A few speakers accused schools of promoting "radical gender ideologies" and argued that parents should have the final say in their children’s upbringing.

### **Arguments Against SB 272**
1. **Student Safety**: Opponents argue that the bill could endanger LGBTQ+ students, particularly those in unsupportive or abusive households. Forcing schools to disclose sensitive information could lead to rejection, abuse, or homelessness.

3. **Privacy and Autonomy**: Opponents emphasized the importance of allowing students to control when and how they share their gender identity with their families. Forced disclosure could undermine their autonomy and trust in educators.
4. **Impact on Educators**: Teachers and school staff expressed concerns about being forced to violate student confidentiality, which could erode trust and make it harder for students to seek help.
5. **Existing Protections**: Critics pointed out that many of the rights outlined in SB 272 are already protected under existing laws, making the bill redundant and potentially harmful.
6. **Discriminatory Impact**: Opponents argued that the bill disproportionately targets LGBTQ+ students by requiring schools to monitor and report behaviors related to gender identity, creating a hostile environment.
