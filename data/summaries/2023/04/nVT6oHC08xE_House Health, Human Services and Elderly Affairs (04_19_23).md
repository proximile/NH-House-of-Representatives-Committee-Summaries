### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **Senate Bill 238 (Telehealth Prescribing for Mental Health):**
   - **Purpose:** Expands telehealth prescribing for mental health conditions, including Schedule II-IV controlled substances, beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency.
   - **Debate:** Supporters highlighted telehealth’s role in improving access, especially for rural populations, older adults, and individuals with mobility issues. Opponents raised concerns about the safety of prescribing controlled substances without in-person evaluations, particularly for minors.
   - **Amendments:** Included provisions for parental consent and access to medical records. The Office of the Child Advocate opposed the amended version, citing concerns that it could compromise child safety by setting a high legal standard for withholding records from potentially abusive parents.
   - **Overlap:** Discussions noted potential redundancy with **House Bill 500**, which addresses telehealth prescribing more broadly.

2. **Senate Bill 239 (Harm Reduction Services and Substance Misuse Treatment):**
   - **Purpose:** Codifies harm reduction strategies, including syringe service programs, naloxone distribution, and the Doorways program, a statewide initiative for substance use disorder treatment.

     - Requires medical professionals to complete training on medically assisted treatment (MAT) during licensing renewal.

3. **Senate Bill 35 (RSV Vaccine Administration by Pharmacists):**
   - **Purpose:** Allows pharmacists to administer the RSV vaccine.
   - **Debate:** Focused on the importance of reporting adverse reactions through systems like VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). An amendment proposed strict reporting requirements with penalties for non-compliance, but it failed due to concerns about fairness and enforceability.
   - **Outcome:** The bill passed with broad support, highlighting the desire to expand vaccine access while acknowledging the need for future improvements in adverse event reporting.
