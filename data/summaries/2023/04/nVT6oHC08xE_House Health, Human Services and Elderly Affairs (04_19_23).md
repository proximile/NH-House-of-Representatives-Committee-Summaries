**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (April 19, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on April 19, 2023, to address a range of critical issues related to healthcare, substance use disorders, harm reduction, and elderly affairs. The meeting featured extensive discussions on several bills, amendments, and policy initiatives, with a focus on expanding access to care, ensuring public health safety, and addressing the opioid crisis. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Telehealth and Mental Health Services (SB 238)**
The committee debated **Senate Bill 238**, which seeks to expand the use of telehealth for mental health services, particularly for children, beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency. Key points included:
- **Parental Consent**: Concerns were raised about minors accessing mental health medication without parental consent. The Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) supported the original bill language, emphasizing the need to protect children from potentially abusive parents.
- **Access and Monitoring**: While some representatives highlighted the benefits of telehealth in rural areas and for individuals with mobility issues, others expressed concerns about overmedication and the need for in-person monitoring.
- **Urgency**: The bill must pass before the May 11 deadline to avoid a lapse in telehealth prescribing capabilities.

---

### **2. Substance Use Disorders and Harm Reduction (SB 239)**
**Senate Bill 239**, introduced by Senator David Waters, focused on harm reduction services and substance misuse treatment. Key provisions included:
- **Harm Reduction Programs**: The bill formalized harm reduction as a task force within the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs and supported syringe service programs to prevent infectious diseases and overdose fatalities.
- **Medically Assisted Treatment**: The bill removed barriers to prescribing medications like buprenorphine by eliminating the X-waiver requirement and mandated substance misuse training for healthcare providers during license renewal.
- **Funding**: Concerns were raised about the sustainability of the **Doorways Program**, which is currently funded by a $28 million federal grant. The bill codified the program but specified that state funding is not required unless appropriated.

### **3. Pharmaceutical Drug Take Back Programs (SB 50)**
The committee unanimously supported **Senate Bill 50**, which establishes a safer system for disposing of unused medications, moving away from less effective methods like the "yucky goo" approach.

---

### **4. APRNs and Nurse Midwives (SB 83)**
**Senate Bill 83** was passed to allow advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and certified nurse midwives to sign documents within their scope of practice, aligning statute with current practice.

---

### **5. Controlled Drug Prescription Health and Safety Program (SB 34)**
An amendment to **Senate Bill 34** was adopted to ensure accountability in the release of prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data. The bill, as amended, was passed unanimously.

---

### **6. Study Committee on Non-Profit Contracting (SB 236)**
The committee debated whether to establish a formal study committee to examine issues faced by non-profits contracting with the Department of Health and Human Services. While some argued for a focused approach, others felt ad hoc discussions would suffice.

---

### **7. Opioid Abatement Trust Fund (SB 32)**
The discussion on **Senate Bill 32** focused on the distribution of $330 million from pharmaceutical settlements. Representatives emphasized the need to quickly disburse funds to organizations involved in prevention, treatment, and harm reduction. There was also debate on defining "harm reduction" and the need for more information gathering.

---

### **8. RSV Vaccine Administration (SB 35)**
**Senate Bill 35**, which authorizes pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to administer RSV vaccines, sparked significant debate over an amendment requiring the reporting of adverse reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Key points included:
- **Enforcement**: Concerns were raised about the severity of penalties (e.g., revocation of authorization) for failing to report adverse events.
- **Federal vs. State Law**: Some argued that federal law already requires adverse event reporting, making state-level enforcement redundant.
- **Voting Outcome**: The amendment failed (7-12), but the underlying bill passed (17-2) and was moved to the consent calendar.

---

### **9. Child Protection and Insurance Issues**
Discussions highlighted challenges faced by organizations working with highly volatile children, including the inability to secure insurance. Representatives emphasized the need for legislative intervention to address these issues and ensure adequate care for vulnerable populations.

---

### **10. Future Considerations and Next Steps**
Several representatives expressed interest in forming committees to study broader issues, such as adverse event reporting for vaccines and the sustainability of harm reduction programs. The meeting concluded with plans to move certain bills to the consent calendar and a brief recess before an executive session.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing public health safety, access to care, and professional accountability. Key themes included:
- **Expanding Access**: Efforts to expand telehealth services and harm reduction programs were central to the discussions.
- **Funding Sustainability**: Concerns about the reliance on federal grants for programs like Doorways highlighted the need for sustainable funding mechanisms.
- **Child Protection**: Debates over parental consent and access to medical records emphasized the importance of safeguarding vulnerable populations.
- **Legislative Process**: The urgency of passing bills before deadlines and the need for stakeholder involvement were recurring themes.

Overall, the meeting reflected the committee’s commitment to addressing pressing healthcare issues while navigating the challenges of policy implementation and funding sustainability.
