The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing meeting on April 24, 2023, focused on addressing the state’s housing crisis through a multifaceted approach, emphasizing regulatory reforms, infrastructure improvements, and innovative housing solutions. The discussions highlighted key areas of focus, including Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), zoning and building codes, infrastructure, financing, and affordable housing initiatives. 

### Key Themes and Recommendations:

1. **Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**:
   - ADUs were a central topic, with consensus on the need to expand regulations to make them more accessible. Proposed changes included allowing detached ADUs, increasing size limits (e.g., from 750 to 1,000 square feet), and reducing restrictive requirements like parking mandates. 
   - Concerns were raised about ADUs being used for short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb) rather than long-term housing, prompting discussions on legislation to restrict their use for affordable housing. 
   - Newmarket, NH, was highlighted as a model for ADU policy, amending its ordinance to allow ADUs by right, removing barriers like special exceptions and variances.

2. **Zoning and Building Codes**:
   - The committee emphasized the need for zoning reform to address arbitrary minimum lot sizes and outdated soil-based zoning regulations. Evidence-based zoning, tied to septic system capacities and environmental realities, was proposed as a more practical approach. 
   - Local zoning and building codes were identified as significant barriers to affordable housing development, with some exceeding state standards. The committee discussed state-level preemption to prevent overly restrictive local regulations while balancing the importance of local control. 
   - Tiny homes (as small as 170-200 square feet) and off-site construction methods (e.g., 3D-printed buildings) were discussed as innovative solutions, though zoning and lot size requirements often hinder their development.

3. **Infrastructure and Impact Fees**:
   - Water and sewer infrastructure were identified as critical for increasing housing density. The committee discussed extending impact fee holding periods to help municipalities fund infrastructure improvements, with Manchester considering a shift from specific impact fees to a system development charge for greater flexibility. 
   - State-level funding or incentives for infrastructure projects were suggested to support housing development, particularly in areas with high demand.

4. **Affordable Housing Initiatives**:
   - The severe shortage of affordable housing, especially for low-income workers, elders, and vulnerable populations, was a recurring theme. Supportive housing models, which include services for mental health, recovery, and education, were highlighted as essential for improving residents’ housing situations. 
   - Non-profit developers, housing cooperatives, and manufactured home parks were discussed as potential solutions. The committee also explored the concept of housing land trusts, where the trust owns the property and leases it to residents, allowing them to build equity. 
   - Leveraging federal programs like HUD’s Section 202 (for older adults) and Section 811 (for people with disabilities) was recommended to fund housing for vulnerable populations.

5. **Financing and Incentives**:
   - Financing challenges were a significant barrier to housing development, particularly for affordable housing projects. The committee explored the creation of a New Hampshire Housing Bank to provide financing for underserved communities. 
   - Incentives for municipalities to adopt housing-friendly regulations, such as model zoning policies and state funding for infrastructure expansion, were discussed as ways to encourage housing density. 

6. **Public-Private Partnerships and Education**:
   - Manchester’s proactive approach to housing affordability was highlighted, including public-private partnerships, leveraging federal funds (e.g., ARPA, HUD grants), and using city-owned land for affordable housing projects. 
   - The committee stressed the need for public education on ADUs and addressing labor shortages in the construction industry through partnerships with CTE schools and developers.

7. **Urban Planning and Transportation**:
   - Urban planning considerations, such as expanding bike lanes, walkability, and accommodating diverse transportation modes (e.g., electric bikes, wheelchairs), were discussed as ways to improve affordability and safety. 
   - The link between transportation and affordable housing was acknowledged, with suggestions that improved transportation options could facilitate housing development in certain areas.

8. **Manufactured Housing and Co-ops**:
   - Manufactured housing and housing cooperatives were identified as potential solutions, with plans to invite experts to future meetings to explore these options further.

### Next Steps:
The committee planned to meet again on May 15, 2023, to continue discussions and invite representatives from the Human Rights Commission and HUD. They also aimed to compile model policies from successful housing initiatives in towns like Dover and Newmarket.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s housing crisis and the need for a comprehensive, collaborative approach. Key priorities included zoning reform, infrastructure investment, flexible building codes, and innovative housing solutions like ADUs, tiny homes, and manufactured housing. Balancing local control with statewide needs, incentivizing municipalities, and addressing financing challenges were identified as critical steps toward increasing housing affordability and availability.
