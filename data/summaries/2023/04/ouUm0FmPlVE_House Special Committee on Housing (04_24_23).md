The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on Housing meeting on April 24, 2023, addressed the state's pressing housing crisis through a multifaceted approach, focusing on regulatory reform, infrastructure development, and innovative housing solutions. The discussions spanned a wide range of topics, including Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), zoning laws, building codes, affordable housing, and transportation infrastructure. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points and proposals:

### Housing Affordability and Supply
1. **Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**: ADUs were highlighted as a potential solution to increase housing supply. The committee discussed increasing the size of ADUs from 750 to 1,000 square feet to make them more suitable for families. Concerns about ADUs being used for short-term rentals like Airbnb were addressed by noting that current legislation restricts second ADUs to affordable rental levels. Manchester and Newmarket were cited as examples of municipalities updating zoning ordinances to make ADUs easier to build, including allowing detached units and reducing parking requirements.

2. **Missing Middle Housing**: The integration of "missing middle housing" (e.g., duplexes, fourplexes) into neighborhoods was emphasized to address the housing crisis. This approach aims to provide more diverse housing options that are affordable to middle-income families.

3. **Manufactured Housing and Co-ops**: Manufactured home parks and cooperative housing were discussed as viable solutions for affordable housing, particularly in areas with available land. The state and counties were encouraged to release unused land for such projects.

### Zoning and Building Codes
1. **Outdated Zoning Laws**: The committee criticized outdated zoning ordinances, particularly arbitrary lot size requirements, which often exceed what is necessary for health, safety, and welfare. Suggestions included tying lot size minimums to soil type and septic system requirements and reducing lot size requirements to increase housing density.

2. **Building Codes**: Bill McKinney, President of the New Hampshire Building Officials Association, emphasized that building codes allow for affordable housing, including tiny homes (400 square feet or less). Barriers to housing were identified as stemming more from land use laws, such as setbacks and density, rather than building codes. The importance of following established code adoption processes rather than legislating building codes was stressed.

### Infrastructure and Impact Fees
1. **Impact Fees**: The committee discussed the limitations of current state laws that prevent municipalities from holding impact fees for more than six years. Suggestions were made to extend this period to 10 or 20 years to allow better long-term infrastructure planning and development.

2. **Water and Sewer Systems**: The need for state assistance in improving water and sewer systems, particularly in smaller communities, was emphasized. Newmarket’s transition from specific water and sewer impact fees to a generalized development fee system was highlighted as a model for flexibility in funding infrastructure improvements.

### Transportation and Walkability
1. **Bicycle and Transportation Infrastructure**: Discussions focused on expanding bicycle access, building bike lanes, and integrating bus transit into bike lanes. The U.S. Department of Transportation's "Safe Streets for All" funding opportunity was mentioned as a potential resource for municipalities to improve walkability, biking, and public transportation.

2. **Electric Bikes and Scooters**: The growing popularity of electric bikes and scooters prompted discussions on the need for clear guidelines and safety considerations in bike lanes.

### Financial and Legislative Strategies
1. **Funding and Incentives**: The committee explored various financing options for affordable housing, including leveraging federal funds (e.g., HUD grants, ARPA funds), creating a New Hampshire Housing Bank, and providing incentives for non-profit developers. Public-private partnerships were also discussed as a means to incentivize affordable housing development.

2. **Legislative Proposals**: Potential legislative proposals included changes to existing laws to facilitate housing development, improve transportation infrastructure, and address the housing shortage. The committee considered compiling model policies from towns that have successfully increased housing inventory, such as Dover and Manchester, to share with other municipalities.

### Public Education and Labor Shortages
1. **Public Education**: The need for public education on ADUs and housing options was emphasized, as many residents are unaware of the opportunities available. Workshops and community outreach were suggested as methods to increase awareness.

2. **Labor Shortages**: The committee recognized the labor shortage in the construction industry and proposed collaborations with Career and Technical Education (CTE) schools to train workers.

### Next Steps and Future Meetings
1. **Model Policies Development**: The committee plans to develop model housing policies based on successful examples from towns like Dover and Newmarket. These policies would be recommended but not mandated.

2. **Upcoming Events and Meetings**: The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for May 15th, with plans to invite representatives from the Human Rights Commission and HUD (Housing and Urban Development). A workshop on ADUs hosted by Vital Communities, a non-profit organization, was highlighted as a free event scheduled for May 6th.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s housing crisis and the need for a multifaceted approach, including regulatory reform, infrastructure investment, public education, and innovative housing solutions. The committee aimed to balance local control with state-level interventions to address the housing shortage effectively, with a strong emphasis on increasing the supply of affordable housing through zoning reform, financial incentives, and collaborative efforts.
