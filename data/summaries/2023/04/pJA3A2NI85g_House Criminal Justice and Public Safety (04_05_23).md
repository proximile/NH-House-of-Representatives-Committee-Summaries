The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 5, 2023, focused on critical issues within the criminal justice and public safety sectors, particularly addressing bail reform, court security, and the impact of legislative changes on the judicial system. The discussions revolved around several key bills and overarching themes, including public safety, judicial discretion, constitutional concerns, and resource allocation.

### **Bail Reform and Public Safety**
A significant portion of the meeting centered on bail reform, with a focus on addressing the issue of repeat offenders and the perceived inefficiencies of the current "catch and release" system. Key points included:
- **Repeat Offenders**: Prolific repeat offenders, often linked to substance use disorders and mental health issues, were identified as a major concern. Examples of individuals repeatedly arrested for offenses like DUI, theft, and property crimes highlighted the need for stricter measures.
- **Proposed Solutions**: Bills such as **Senate Bill 249** and **Senate Bill 252** aimed to address these issues by introducing measures like a "three strikes" rule, which would mandate pre-trial detention after a third offense, and requiring individuals charged with serious crimes to appear before a judge before being released. However, concerns were raised about the potential for these measures to disproportionately affect individuals with substance use disorders and the removal of judicial discretion.
- **Constitutional Concerns**: The discussion referenced the U.S. Supreme Court case *U.S. v. Salerno*, emphasizing the need for clear and convincing evidence of dangerousness for pre-trial detention. Critics argued that some aspects of the proposed legislation might violate constitutional rights by imposing blanket holds without individualized assessments.
- **Victim Protection**: The impact on victims of crime was a recurring theme, with representatives highlighting the financial and emotional toll of property crimes and the need for a system that better protects victims.

### **Court Security and Training**
The meeting also addressed **Senate Bill 130**, which aims to establish a standardized training and certification program for court security officers. Key points included:
- **Current Challenges**: Court security officers currently develop their own training programs, diverting resources from their primary security duties. The bill seeks to standardize training across all New Hampshire courts, ensuring officers are better prepared for specific courthouse security challenges.
- **Collaborative Approach**: The program would be developed in collaboration with the judicial branch, sheriffs, and police standards and training, with existing officers being phased into the new training program.

### **Impact of Legislative Changes on the Judicial System**
The repeal of the "Felonies First" law, effective January 1, 2024, was a major topic of discussion. Key points included:
- **Increased Workload**: The repeal will shift approximately 8,000-9,000 felony cases from Superior Court to Circuit Court, significantly increasing the workload for Circuit Court judges and staff. This change will also introduce an estimated 3,400 new detention bail hearings annually.
- **Resource Strain**: The Circuit Court system, already handling about 127,000 cases annually with 42 judges, will face additional strain, potentially leading to delays in non-criminal cases such as civil and family law matters.
- **Proposed Solutions**: Suggestions to alleviate the strain included the introduction of a magistrate system to handle certain judicial responsibilities, thereby reducing the workload on judges.

### **Other Bills and Amendments**
Several other bills were discussed and voted on, including:
- **Senate Bill 76**: Reconsidered and passed with an amendment to name the bill "Maryland's Law," addressing the reporting of deaths and the consequences of failing to report them.
- **Senate Bill 249**: Retained for further discussion, with plans to work on a comprehensive bail reform bill that incorporates elements from multiple proposals.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the need for a balanced approach to criminal justice reform, emphasizing public safety, victim protection, and constitutional rights while addressing systemic issues in the bail process and judicial system. The discussions highlighted the importance of data-driven decisions, the need for additional resources, and the potential for innovative solutions like the magistrate system to manage increased caseloads efficiently. The meeting also reflected the complexities of implementing reforms that balance policy goals with the practical realities of the judicial system's capacity.
