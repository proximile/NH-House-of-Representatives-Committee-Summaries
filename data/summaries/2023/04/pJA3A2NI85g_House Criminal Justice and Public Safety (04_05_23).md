The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee meeting on April 5, 2023, focused on several key legislative proposals, primarily centered on bail reform, court security, and the treatment of individuals with mental health and substance use disorders within the criminal justice system. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing public safety, individual rights, and resource constraints. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key themes and legislative proposals discussed:

### **Bail Reform**
1. **Senate Bill 249**: This bill addresses repeat offenders who violate bail conditions by establishing a rebuttable presumption against bail for individuals arrested for a third felony, Class A misdemeanor, or drunk driving offense while already on bail for prior offenses. Proponents argued it would enhance public safety by holding repeat offenders accountable, while opponents raised concerns about disproportionate impacts on certain communities and the lack of resources to address underlying issues like substance abuse and mental health. Questions were raised about the bill’s timing, fiscal impact, and alignment with the principle of “innocent until proven guilty.”

2. **Senate Bill 252**: This bill requires individuals arrested for serious offenses (violent crimes, domestic violence, stalking, or sex crimes involving children) to appear before a judge before being released on bail, rather than by a bail commissioner. Supporters, including Manchester Police Chief Alan Aldenberg, emphasized the need to protect victims and prevent dangerous individuals from being released too quickly. Opponents, such as the ACLU, argued that the bill could lead to unnecessary pre-trial detention without individualized assessments, potentially violating constitutional rights. The bill also raised concerns about the increased workload on the judicial system, with an estimated 3,400 new detention hearings annually.

3. **Pre-Trial Release Programs**: Concerns were raised about the lack of pre-trial release programs in some counties, particularly Hillsborough County, which lacks such programs despite being the state's largest county with significant crime rates. These programs aim to reduce reoffending by connecting individuals with necessary services like drug and mental health treatment.

4. **Judicial Discretion and Constitutional Concerns**: There was debate over the removal of judicial discretion in bail decisions, with some arguing that judges should have the flexibility to consider individual circumstances. Others supported mandatory detention for repeat offenders to protect public safety. Constitutional concerns were raised about proposals to detain individuals without bail, citing the need for hearings and legal representation to ensure due process.

### **Court Security**
1. **Senate Bill 130**: This bill authorizes the Police Standards and Training Council to establish a standardized training and certification program for court security officers in New Hampshire. Proponents argued that this would improve court security by leveraging the expertise of the Police Standards and Training Council, ensuring officers are better prepared for specific courthouse challenges. The judicial branch requested this bill to professionalize and standardize training, which is currently resource-intensive and not always up-to-date with best practices.

### **Mental Health and Substance Use**
1. **Root Causes of Reoffending**: The root causes of reoffending, particularly mental health and substance use disorders, were highlighted. It was noted that jails are not equipped to provide adequate treatment, and there is variability in how different counties handle these cases. The need for data-driven decisions was emphasized, with some arguing that anecdotal evidence should not drive policy changes.

2. **Treatment Programs**: Various solutions were proposed, including improving treatment programs in jails, implementing real-time bail tracking systems, and retaining bills for further study and stakeholder input. The importance of considering the impact on victims of crime was stressed, with some arguing that the current system fails to protect victims adequately.

### **Operational and Resource Challenges**
1. **Judicial System Impact**: The repeal of the "felonies first" policy and the addition of new detention hearings would significantly increase the workload for the court system. Implementing a real-time bail tracking system would require significant investment in technology and personnel. The potential use of magistrates to handle bail decisions and paperwork was debated as a way to reduce in-court time and alleviate some stress on the judicial system.

### **Legislative Process and Amendments**
1. **Amendments and Voting**: The committee deliberated on various bills, including Senate Bills 130, 244, 245, 249, and 252. Amendments were proposed and discussed, with a focus on updating outdated laws and addressing privacy concerns. The committee also reconsidered a previous vote on Senate Bill 76, which involved reporting deaths, and adopted an amendment to name the bill "Maryland's Law" in honor of a constituent's grandmother.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Public Safety vs. Individual Rights**: The debate centered on balancing public safety with the rights of individuals, particularly in the context of bail reform.
2. **Resource Constraints**: Both bills highlighted the strain on judicial and law enforcement resources, with concerns about the fiscal impact of increased hearings and training programs.
3. **Consistency and Clarity**: Legislators emphasized the need for clear, consistent policies in both court security training and bail decisions to ensure fairness and effectiveness.

Overall, the meeting reflected a focus on improving public safety and judicial efficiency while addressing concerns about fairness, resource allocation, and the potential unintended consequences of the proposed legislation. The discussions underscored the complexities of legislative decision-making and the collaborative efforts of committee members to address constituent concerns and improve the justice system.
