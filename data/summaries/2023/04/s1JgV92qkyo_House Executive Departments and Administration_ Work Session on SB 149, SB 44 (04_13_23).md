**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Subcommittee Work Session on SB 149-FN and SB 44-FN (04/13/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Executive Departments and Administration Committee held a subcommittee work session on April 13, 2023, to discuss **SB 149-FN** and **SB 44-FN**. The session addressed a range of issues related to professional licensing, regulatory boards, investigations, disciplinary processes, and workforce challenges in healthcare and mental health services. Key themes and discussions are summarized below:

---

### **Role of Public Members and Regulatory Boards**
1. **Public Representation**: Public members on regulatory boards play a critical role in representing public interests, particularly in reviewing complaints. Their perspective ensures that public expectations are considered, even if alleged misconduct does not meet professional standards of care.
2. **Board Merging**: There was discussion about merging certain boards, such as the Board of Mental Health Practice and the Board of Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselors, to improve collaboration and address overlapping scopes of practice. However, concerns were raised about the potential loss of board-specific expertise and its impact on mental health services.
3. **Appointment Process**: The governor and executive council appoint board members, ensuring public accountability. While the online application system has streamlined the process, recruitment of public members remains a challenge. Suggestions included leveraging state representatives to identify candidates and creating a public information officer role to improve outreach.

### **Complaint and Disciplinary Processes**
1. **Current Process**: The **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** receives complaints, investigates them, and presents findings to the board, which decides whether to dismiss the complaint or proceed with disciplinary action.
2. **SB 655 Implications**: Under **SB 655**, the OPLC would gain authority to initiate investigations without board approval, though boards would retain final say on disciplinary actions. Concerns were raised about the OPLC’s lack of subject matter expertise in specific professions (e.g., medicine, plumbing) and the potential for future legislatures to remove board adjudicative authority entirely. Clear statutory language was recommended to define the roles of the OPLC and boards.
3. **Costs of Investigations**: There was debate about whether licensees found guilty of misconduct should bear investigation costs, with calls for reasonable caps to ensure fairness.

### **SB 149-FN: Regulation of Nurse Staffing Agencies**
1. **Bill Overview**: SB 149 aims to regulate nurse staffing agencies, including provisions to prevent overcharging during public health emergencies and the placement of unlicensed or suspended professionals.
2. **Concerns and Suggestions**:
   - Representatives questioned the enforceability of clauses prohibiting agencies from charging higher fees during communicable disease outbreaks unless a state of emergency is declared.
   - The bill’s ability to reduce costs for healthcare facilities was debated, with some noting it sets standards for agency practices rather than directly addressing pricing.
   - Public testimony from **Lynette Han Shoemaker** (CEO of Evergreen Place) and **Brandon Williams** (President of the NH Healthcare Association) highlighted the financial burden of staffing agencies on smaller facilities and the need for transparency.
3. **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included striking ambiguous language, refining clauses to align with existing statutes, and adjusting the bill’s effective date to allow time for rule implementation.

### **SB 44-FN: Scope of Practice and Licensing for MLADCs and CRSWs**
1. **Scope of Practice for MLADCs**: Current law restricts **Master Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselors (MLADCs)** from treating mental health issues unless the patient is actively receiving substance use disorder treatment. A proposed amendment would allow MLADCs to treat mental health issues independently, promoting continuity of care.
2. **Licensing Changes**: The bill removes the **criminal justice degree** as an automatic qualification for MLADC licensure, moving it to a rule-based system. It also increases **continuing education requirements** for **Certified Recovery Support Workers (CRSWs)** from 12 to 24 hours to align with national standards and ensure reciprocity with other states.
3. **Social Work Compact**: A representative from the **National Association of Social Workers** discussed the **Social Work Compact**, which would allow licensed clinical social workers in New Hampshire to practice in other states that have adopted the compact, reducing licensing barriers and improving continuity of care.

---

### **Broader Themes and Considerations**
1. **Efficiency and Fairness**: The discussions emphasized the need for efficiency in licensing and disciplinary processes, ensuring fairness for both practitioners and the public.
2. **Workforce Challenges**: Addressing workforce shortages in mental health and substance use disorder treatment was a recurring theme, with proposed legislative changes aimed at expanding access to care and improving collaboration among professionals.
3. **Public Accountability**: The session highlighted the importance of public representation and accountability in regulatory processes, with a focus on improving communication and recruitment efforts for public board members.

### **Next Steps**
- The subcommittee planned to reconvene to vote on proposed amendments, particularly for SB 44-FN, after filing them with the Office of Legislative Services (OLS).
- Further review and refinement of SB 149-FN were planned based on feedback from stakeholders and legal counsel.
- The committee aimed to balance regulatory oversight with practical considerations, ensuring that legislation addresses workforce needs and public expectations effectively.

In summary, the work session focused on improving the efficiency, fairness, and public accountability of regulatory processes while addressing workforce challenges in healthcare and mental health services. The discussions underscored the need for clear statutory language, collaboration among boards, and legislative adjustments to meet evolving professional and public needs.
