**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (04/25/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on April 25, 2023, to discuss and refine election laws and campaign finance regulations. The session, led by the House Election Law Committee and its subcommittee on campaign finance, focused on improving transparency, consistency, and clarity in the state’s election and campaign finance systems. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and action items from the meeting:

### **1. Definitions and Terminology**
The meeting began with a detailed examination of election law terminology, aiming to clarify definitions and address ambiguities:
- **Research, Receipts, and Segregated Funds**: Definitions were outlined for bona fide surveys, independent research, and message testing, emphasizing that these activities should not involve sales, marketing, or attempts to influence behavior. "Receipts" were defined as money or value received for promoting or opposing candidates or measures, excluding commercial transactions. "Segregated funds" were described as accounts funded externally and used for specific expenditures.
- **Political Advocacy Organizations**: These were defined as entities spending $5,000 or more annually on communications advocating for or against candidates or measures.
- **Push Polling**: The committee scrutinized the outdated definition of push polling, considering updates to reflect modern methods like online and mixed-delivery polls.
- **Political Committees**: The definition of a political committee was debated, including whether it should apply to groups of two or more people promoting a candidate or measure, even without spending money.

### **2. Campaign Finance Reform**
The committee revisited recent campaign finance reforms and identified areas needing correction or refinement:
- **Contribution Limits**: An unintended consequence of past reforms was the increase of the contribution limit from $7,000 to $15,000. Members discussed aligning this with the original legislative intent.
- **Pre-Filing Period**: Confusion arose over whether the pre-filing period for campaign finance was eliminated, with the Attorney General’s office confirming its continued existence despite legislative efforts to remove it.
- **LLC and PAC Loopholes**: The committee debated how LLCs and PACs might obscure donor identities, with some members advocating for addressing larger PAC loopholes before focusing on LLCs.
- **Expenditures and Contributions**: Definitions were reviewed to ensure transparency and accountability, including allowances for child care expenses.

### **3. Transparency and Reporting**
Improving transparency and efficiency in campaign finance reporting was a central theme:
- **Mandatory Online Reporting**: The committee explored phasing in mandatory online reporting for campaign finance disclosures, balancing transparency with the potential burden on low-resource candidates.
- **Reporting Thresholds and Violations**: Common reporting errors, such as missed deadlines and illegible filings, were discussed, with suggestions for reducing errors while maintaining transparency.
- **Streamlining Disclaimers**: Members considered simplifying and standardizing disclaimer requirements for political advertisements across print, digital, and other mediums.

### **4. Modern Challenges in Election Law**
The committee addressed contemporary issues in election law and campaign finance:
- **Political Text Messaging**: Regulations for political text messaging, currently in a legal gray area, were discussed, with proposals to require disclaimers similar to those for phone calls.
- **Political Advertising**: The definition of political advertising was reviewed to include modern forms of communication, such as social media influencers, with suggestions to tighten disclosure requirements for paid spokespersons.
- **Campaign Sign Regulations**: Concerns were raised about the placement and cleanup of political signs in public spaces, with calls for stricter enforcement and penalties for failure to remove signs post-election.

### **5. Public Input and Next Steps**
The committee briefly discussed allowing public comments during meetings, though it was noted that these sessions are not advertised as public hearings. Action items included:
- Compiling a list of suggested changes to election law definitions and distributing it at the next meeting.
- Inviting the Secretary of State’s office to provide a briefing on the new online reporting system at the next meeting on May 9th.
- Contacting the Democratic Party and the Secretary of State’s office for historical context on certain definitions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with lighthearted remarks and a reminder of the next meeting dates (May 9th and 16th). The chair adjourned the session at 11:55 AM. Overall, the discussions aimed to refine election laws and campaign finance regulations to ensure clarity, transparency, and alignment with legislative intent, while addressing modern challenges like digital communication and influencer marketing. The committee sought common ground on less contentious issues while acknowledging potential disagreements on more complex topics.
