The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 5, 2023, covered a wide range of legislative topics, focusing on key bills related to the **Board of Manufactured Housing**, the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**, and **transparency in government spending**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Senate Bill 203: Board of Manufactured Housing**
The meeting began with a detailed discussion on **Senate Bill 203**, which proposes significant changes to the **Board of Manufactured Housing**. The bill aims to modernize the board by adjusting its membership, expanding its jurisdiction, and establishing a **dispute resolution process** for both **investor-owned** and **resident-owned manufactured housing communities (ROCs)**. Key points included:
- **Sponsor’s Testimony (Senator Kevin Avard)**: The bill seeks to increase the board’s jurisdiction to handle disputes under RSA 301a, include ROCs in its membership, and provide a fair resolution process for low- to moderate-income homeowners. It also reduces the board’s membership from 11 to 5 and assigns the OPLC to handle complaints.
- **Resident Testimonies**: Residents like **Kristen Island** and **Bonnie Garies** raised concerns about mismanagement, retaliation, and lack of oversight in ROCs, particularly regarding missing funds and the role of the **New Hampshire Community Loan Fund (NHCLF)**. **Louise Rideout** opposed the bill, arguing it would burden taxpayers without addressing root issues.
- **NHCLF’s Perspective (Tara Reardon)**: NHCLF supports the bill, emphasizing the need for a dispute resolution forum to address conflicts in ROCs and highlighting the **affordable housing** benefits of ROCs.
- **Opposition (Mark Tay, Board Chair)**: Tay opposed the bill, citing concerns about the reduced board size and lack of expertise to handle complex corporate governance issues.
- **Key Concerns**: Residents fear retaliation and mismanagement, while critics questioned the board’s expanded jurisdiction, funding, and effectiveness in resolving disputes.
- **Next Steps**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review and potential amendments.

### **Senate Bills 49, 146, and 208: Licensing, Agriculture, and Transparency**
The meeting also addressed several other bills, including **Senate Bill 49**, **Senate Bill 146**, and **Senate Bill 208**:
- **Senate Bill 49**: This bill proposes creating a **non-lapsing fund** for the OPLC to retain excess revenue from licensing fees, which currently lapse into the general fund. The funds would be used for **capital expenditures** (e.g., software upgrades) or to **reduce future licensing fees**. An amendment adds a **biennial reporting requirement** to track fund usage. The bill addresses **unconstitutional taxation** concerns and provides financial flexibility for OPLC. It was referred to the **Ways and Means Committee** for further review.
- **Senate Bill 146**: This bill modifies the **Agricultural Advisory Board**, removing certain term requirements and allowing the board to request the Commissioner of Agriculture to leave meetings if necessary. It aims to clarify the board's role and improve transparency. The bill received unanimous support.
- **Senate Bill 208**: This bill mandates **transparency in federal fund disbursements** by requiring the Department of Administrative Services and the Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery (GOFER) to report on federal relief funds in a **check register format**. The goal is to enhance accountability and public trust. The bill received bipartisan support.

### **OPLC Challenges and Licensing Issues**
The meeting also delved into the operational and financial challenges faced by the OPLC, as well as licensing issues:
- **Capital Expenditures**: The OPLC discussed the need for **software upgrades** and a new building. The OPLC’s relocation from a state-owned building to leased space has significantly increased costs, and there is a desire to move into a state-owned building or purchase one, similar to the Lottery Commission’s approach.
- **Licensing Issues**: **Senate Bill 107 (SB 107)** aims to amend RSA 332-G1 to ensure that entry into the workforce is not barred based on past criminal convictions unless there is a substantial relationship between the conviction and the profession. The bill seeks to reconcile conflicting standards in RSA 332-G10 and RSA 332-G13 and includes provisions for appeals and board responses. Concerns were raised about the potential repeal of RSA 332-G5, which allows appeals to the State Building Code Review Board, and it was suggested that the repeal be removed from the bill.

### **Key Themes**
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Several bills emphasized the need for transparency in government spending and decision-making, including **Senate Bill 208** and the role of the **Right to Know Ombudsman**.
- **Funding and Operational Challenges**: The OPLC highlighted its financial struggles, including the need for software upgrades and a new building, as well as the importance of retaining licensing fees to benefit licensees directly.
- **Fairness and Equity**: **Senate Bill 107** and the discussions on **Senate Bill 203** underscored the need for fair treatment of individuals with criminal records and low- to moderate-income homeowners in ROCs.

### **Next Steps**
The bills discussed were referred to subcommittees or other legislative bodies for further review, with several receiving favorable support. The meeting highlighted the legislature’s focus on modernizing state boards, improving transparency, and addressing operational challenges while ensuring fairness and accountability.
