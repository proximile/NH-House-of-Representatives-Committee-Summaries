**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting on Senate Bill 58 (04/26/23)**

The New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on April 26, 2023, to discuss **Senate Bill 58 (SB 58)**, which focuses on protections for healthcare workers and facilities. The bill addresses the use of physical force, detainment, and warrantless arrests in healthcare settings, with the aim of enhancing safety for medical staff while balancing concerns about civil rights and the potential criminalization of vulnerable populations, particularly those experiencing mental health crises. The discussion centered on clarifying the bill’s language, addressing stakeholder concerns, and proposing amendments to ensure a balanced approach.

### **Key Points from the Discussion**

1. **Scope of SB 58**:
   - The bill applies to licensed healthcare facilities, such as hospitals and urgent care centers, but does not extend to individual doctor’s offices.
   - The committee worked with an amended version of SB 58, as the original Senate bill was unavailable.

2. **Security and Use of Physical Force**:
   - The bill seeks to clarify and expand protections for healthcare workers, particularly in facilities without full-time security staff.
   - Existing statutes (e.g., RSA 627) already allow for the use of force in certain situations, but SB 58 aims to provide clearer guidelines for healthcare providers to use non-deadly force to maintain safety and decorum.

3. **Warrantless Arrests**:
   - SB 58 would allow law enforcement to make warrantless arrests in cases where healthcare workers are threatened or assaulted, even for misdemeanor-level offenses.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential misuse of this provision, particularly in cases involving individuals experiencing mental health crises. Advocates emphasized the need for de-escalation and treatment rather than arrest.

4. **Rosenwald Amendment**:
   - The **Rosenwald Amendment**, which was reintroduced after failing in the Senate, clarifies the circumstances under which healthcare workers can use force and law enforcement can make warrantless arrests.
   - Supported by stakeholders, including the Disability Rights Center and NAMI New Hampshire, the amendment aims to balance protections for healthcare workers with safeguards against overreach and the criminalization of mental health issues.

5. **Stakeholder Perspectives**:
   - **Healthcare Providers**: Representatives from hospitals, including Catholic Medical Center (CMC), highlighted the frequent incidents of violence in emergency rooms and the need for protections for healthcare workers. They noted that security personnel are trained in de-escalation and non-deadly force but are not always present in every area, leaving staff vulnerable.
   - **Disability Rights Advocates**: Karen Rosenberg from the Disability Rights Center argued that the bill risks criminalizing individuals in mental health crises and advocated for better de-escalation training, resources, and community-based mental health services.
   - **Law Enforcement**: Officials expressed support for the bill, noting that current laws make it difficult to arrest individuals for misdemeanor-level assaults in hospitals without a warrant. They emphasized the need for clarity to allow arrests when healthcare workers are threatened or assaulted.

6. **Proposed Amendments and Committee Decision**:
   - Representative Muse proposed an amendment (2023-1498) to incorporate the Rosenwald Amendment into SB 58, returning the bill to its original intent.
   - The committee unanimously voted (6-0) to recommend the amended bill, emphasizing bipartisan support for protecting healthcare workers while addressing concerns raised during the public hearing.

7. **Workplace Safety and Training**:
   - The discussion highlighted existing laws, such as **SB 459**, which mandates workplace violence prevention programs in hospitals, including de-escalation training.
   - Hospitals are already required to report assaults and develop protocols for protecting staff, but there is a need for consistent data collection and best practices.

### **Conclusion**
The committee concluded that the amended version of SB 58 strikes a balance between ensuring the safety of healthcare workers and avoiding unintended consequences, such as the criminalization of mental health issues. The bill will now move forward for further consideration, with stakeholders urging a balanced approach that prioritizes worker safety while protecting the rights of vulnerable populations. The hearing underscored the complexity of the issue, with a strong emphasis on the need for clear guidelines, de-escalation training, and community-based mental health resources.
