The transcript details a subcommittee work session of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration committee, focusing on **SB 203** and **SB 147**. Key discussions include:

### **SB 203 (Board of Manufactured Housing)**
- An amendment (**#1365 H**) was introduced to **delete the restructuring of the board**, as the House position (via **House Bill 2**) already deletes the board. The amendment also **preserves the boardâ€™s website data** for five years to ensure accessibility for successor organizations.
- The amendment passed unanimously (**3-0**) and will be recommended to the full committee.

### **SB 147 (Dental Board and Anesthesia Regulations)**
- The subcommittee discussed amendments to **SB 147**, which addresses dental facility permits and anesthesia regulations. Key points:
  - **Section H** of the bill, which deals with anesthesia provider requirements, was proposed for removal. This section, added in 2018, mandates a second anesthesia provider for pediatric patients under 13, with exemptions for oral surgeons. The subcommittee felt this issue should be addressed by the Senate Health and Human Services committee (**Senate Bill 91**) rather than in SB 147.
  - The **establishment of an Anesthesia and Sedation Committee** within the Dental Board was supported. The committee would include dentists, nurse anesthetists, and anesthesiologists to ensure diverse perspectives.
  - The subcommittee agreed to **retain facility permit requirements** and **fee-setting authority** for dental facilities, as these were deemed essential.
  - Concerns were raised about the **blanket exemption** for anesthesia providers, which was criticized during an audit. The subcommittee suggested repealing this exemption and allowing individual exemptions on a case-by-case basis.

### **Coordination with Senate**
- The subcommittee emphasized the need to **coordinate with the Senate**, particularly regarding **Senate Bill 91**, which addresses similar issues. They decided to proceed with amendments to SB 147 while leaving broader anesthesia provider regulations to the Senate.

### **Next Steps**
- The subcommittee plans to **finalize amendments** and prepare for an executive session in two weeks. They also intend to work with the Senate to ensure consistency in addressing anesthesia provider regulations.

Overall, the session focused on refining SB 147 to address dental facility permits and anesthesia committee formation while deferring broader anesthesia provider regulations to the Senate.
