### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (April 12, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on April 12, 2023, to discuss several key legislative bills aimed at addressing healthcare accessibility, administrative efficiency, and public health improvements. The meeting focused on three primary bills: **SB 200**, **SB 236**, and **SB 127**, each addressing distinct but interrelated issues in healthcare and human services.

#### **SB 200: Vaccine Administration by Optometrists**
SB 200 proposes allowing optometrists to administer vaccines for **influenza, COVID-19, and shingles** to adults and to prescribe medications for lacrimal gland treatment. The bill aims to enhance vaccine accessibility, particularly in rural areas where primary care providers are scarce. Key points of the discussion included:

- **Purpose and Benefits**: The bill builds on the success of pharmacies in vaccine administration, offering a lower-cost alternative to physician visits. It leverages optometrists’ expertise and patient relationships to improve public health outcomes.
- **Optometrists’ Qualifications**: Optometrists are doctoral-level healthcare providers trained in sterile techniques, CPR-certified, and experienced in managing eye-related injections. They are well-equipped to safely administer vaccines.
- **Scope and Limitations**: The bill is incremental, focusing on three vaccines for adults. Optometrists would not actively promote vaccines but offer them during routine visits, especially to patients who may not see a primary care provider.
- **Concerns and Clarifications**: Legislators raised concerns about **record-keeping**, **vaccine storage**, and **patient safety**, particularly regarding adverse reactions. The bill requires optometrists to check the vaccine registry, record administrations, and report adverse events, similar to pharmacies.
- **Testimonies**: **Dr. Angelique Sawyer** and **Dr. Scott Huffer** from the New Hampshire Optometric Association testified in support, emphasizing optometrists’ ability to safely administer vaccines and improve public health outcomes.
- **Cost and Implementation**: Larger practices are more likely to adopt vaccine administration due to the costs of storage, training, and record-keeping. Smaller practices may not immediately offer this service.

#### **SB 236: Insurance Issues for Non-Profit Organizations**
SB 236 proposes the establishment of a committee to study insurance issues faced by non-profit organizations that contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, particularly those providing intensive foster care services. Key points included:

- **Challenges**: Organizations like Waypoint highlighted the difficulties in obtaining affordable liability insurance due to the high-risk nature of their work with vulnerable children.
- **Proposed Solutions**: The committee would explore potential solutions, such as creating an insurance pool for these organizations.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Concerns were raised about the need to include stakeholders from the insurance industry and other relevant parties in the committee’s work.

#### **SB 127: Comprehensive Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Bill**
SB 127 is a comprehensive bill addressing various technical and policy changes across health, human services, and elderly affairs. Key highlights included:

- **Overview**: The bill includes **16 sections** addressing technical corrections, policy updates, and operational improvements. It originated from the Senate and was unanimously passed there.
- **Key Sections**:
  - **Sections 1 & 2**: Corrected a cross-reference related to fees collected under the **Controlled Drug Act** for opioid treatment programs.
  - **Sections 3 & 4**: Expanded the scope of who can provide personal care services to include **guardians** and **powers of attorney**, addressing workforce capacity issues in rural areas.
  - **Sections 5 & 6**: Clarified that funds for personal care items in long-term care facilities cannot be used for room and board. Also prohibited third-party payments for residential care services unless for add-ons like private rooms or cable TV.
  - **Section 7**: Streamlined reporting requirements for nursing facility quality assessments, eliminating duplicate reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
  - **Sections 8 & 9**: Updated licensing requirements for beverage and bottled water producers, exempting **100% apple cider** from licensing if sold directly to consumers.
  - **Sections 10 & 11**: Addressed **Medicaid for Employed Adults with Disabilities (MEAD)** and **Medicaid for Older Adults with Disabilities (MOAD)** programs, eliminating premium fees and aligning with federal law.
  - **Sections 12 & 13**: Updated state law to align with federal requirements for **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)** overpayments and disqualification penalties.
  - **Sections 14 & 15**: Changed the reporting frequency for health disparities and workforce data from **annual to every three years**, reducing administrative burden while maintaining oversight.
  - **Section 16**: Extended the sunset provision for a commission studying public health services delivery through regional networks.
- **Public Testimony**: **Representative Jess Edwards** raised concerns about the bill’s structure, calling it a "Christmas tree bill" with multiple unrelated items. He questioned the policy of creating **dedicated funds** for opioid treatment programs, arguing it reduces legislative oversight. He also identified a potential math error in fee calculations for providers with zero or one patient.
- **Department Responses**: **John Williams**, Director of Legislative Affairs for DHHS, clarified that the bill primarily corrects technical errors and aligns with existing policies, such as the opioid treatment fund established in HB 1661. He emphasized the bill’s intent to streamline processes and reduce administrative burdens.
- **Additional Questions**: Committee members sought clarification on specific sections, including the **MEAD program**, **SNAP disqualifications**, and the **math error** in provider fees. Department representatives acknowledged the need for further review on the fee calculation issue.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the importance of collaborative solutions to address healthcare accessibility, administrative efficiency, and public health challenges. The discussions highlighted the need to protect patients and children while addressing financial and logistical burdens on providers. The committee’s deliberations on SB 200, SB 236, and SB 127 reflect a commitment to improving healthcare delivery, aligning with federal laws, and ensuring the well-being of New Hampshire residents.
