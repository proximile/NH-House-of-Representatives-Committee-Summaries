**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (04/25/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on April 25, 2023, to discuss several key legislative bills and issues, with a strong focus on environmental protection, waste management, and public health. The meeting centered around **Senate Bill 61 (SB 61)**, which seeks to modernize landfill siting regulations, as well as other bills addressing out-of-state waste, rabies vaccination exemptions, background checks for waste facility permits, and agricultural support. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Key Legislative Discussions**

#### **1. Senate Bill 61 (SB 61): Landfill Siting and Setback Regulations**
SB 61 was the primary focus of the meeting, with extensive testimony and debate on its provisions to update landfill siting rules and setback requirements. Key points included:
- **Current Setback Rules**: The existing **200-foot setback** for landfills from perennial surface waters was widely criticized as outdated and inadequate, especially given modern environmental challenges like PFAS contamination. Testifiers emphasized that this rule fails to account for New Hampshire’s complex hydrogeology, including rapid groundwater movement in areas with sand, gravel, or fractured bedrock.
- **Site-Specific Criteria**: SB 61 proposes **site-specific setback criteria** based on hydrogeologic conditions and advanced technologies. This approach aims to better protect water resources and public health by considering local environmental factors.
- **Independent Study**: The bill allocates **$150,000** for a **desktop study** to analyze landfill setback criteria, compare regulations in neighboring states (e.g., Maine), and recommend improvements. The study will be conducted by independent contractors, with oversight from the Department of Environmental Services (DES).
- **Rulemaking Timeline**: DES is tasked with completing rulemaking within **24 months** of the bill’s passage. Concerns were raised about the potential for reverting to outdated rules if the deadline is missed, prompting discussions about adding a sunset clause or other safeguards.
- **Public Input and Transparency**: Testifiers stressed the importance of public involvement in the study and rulemaking process, including opportunities for public comment during the Request for Proposal (RFP) drafting and contractor selection phases.
- **Health and Environmental Risks**: Personal stories of PFAS contamination highlighted the long-term hazards of landfills and the need for robust protections. Speakers urged the committee to ensure that updated regulations are in place before any new landfill permits are granted.

#### **2. Out-of-State Waste and Landfill Management**
Several bills and discussions addressed the issue of **out-of-state waste** being dumped in New Hampshire landfills, as well as broader waste management concerns:
- **Study Committee on Out-of-State Trash**: Legislators debated forming a study committee to address the increasing volume of out-of-state waste and its impact on local landfills, tipping fees, and environmental quality. The committee would aim to propose bipartisan legislation by the next legislative session.
- **Senate Bill 159 (SB 159)**: This bill seeks to study the impact of out-of-state waste on New Hampshire landfills and the issuance of future landfill permits. Concerns were raised about New Hampshire becoming a dumping ground for other states’ waste, with discussions on interstate commerce implications and potential solutions.
- **Limited vs. Unlimited Service Areas**: The differences between **limited** (local) and **unlimited** (out-of-state) service area landfills were discussed, with questions about how service areas are determined and whether permits could be more restrictive.

#### **3. Cumulative Impact Analysis (Senate Bill 267)**
Senator Deborah Alchler introduced **Senate Bill 267**, which requires the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to consider **cumulative impacts** in rulemaking and statutes. Key points included:
- **Current Limitations**: DES currently assesses individual pollutants but lacks a regulatory framework for evaluating the combined effects of multiple pollutants. This bill aims to address the cumulative environmental and public health impacts of pollution sources.
- **Resources and Complexity**: Testimony from DES highlighted the complexity of cumulative impact analyses and the need for additional staff and resources to conduct them effectively.

#### **4. Other Bills and Discussions**
- **Senate Bill 162 (SB 162)**: This bill proposes **annual recertification** for rabies vaccination exemptions for dogs, cats, and ferrets, simplifying the process for pet owners while ensuring public health safety.
- **Senate Bill 211 (SB 211)**: This bill updates language in state statutes to align with federal requirements for **criminal background checks** of solid and hazardous waste facility permit applicants.
- **House Bill 152 (HB 152)**: The committee concurred with a Senate amendment to reduce the threshold for fertilizer penalty refunds from one ton to half a ton, reducing administrative burdens.
- **Senate Bill 23 (SB 23)**: This bill proposes a **study committee** to explore ways to streamline meat processing for non-amenable species (e.g., bison, deer, elk) for small farmers.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Environmental Protection**: The meeting underscored the urgency of updating landfill regulations to reflect modern scientific and environmental standards, particularly in light of PFAS contamination and other long-term risks.
2. **Public Health**: Legislators and stakeholders emphasized the need for robust protections to safeguard drinking water, recreational waters, and public health from landfill-related hazards.
3. **Transparency and Public Involvement**: Testifiers and legislators stressed the importance of transparency, public input, and independent, science-based decision-making in the rulemaking process.
4. **Bipartisan Support**: Many of the bills discussed, including SB 61, garnered bipartisan support, reflecting a shared commitment to addressing environmental and public health challenges.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee planned to hold an **executive session** on May 9, 2023, to discuss potential amendments to SB 61 and vote on its passage.
- A tour of the University of New Hampshire’s agricultural research facilities was scheduled to learn about water quality and PFAS research.
- Legislators emphasized the need for ongoing oversight and collaboration with DES and stakeholders to ensure the successful implementation of new regulations.

In summary, the meeting highlighted a proactive legislative approach to addressing critical environmental and public health issues, with a focus on modernizing landfill regulations, reducing out-of-state waste, and ensuring transparency and public involvement in the decision-making process.
