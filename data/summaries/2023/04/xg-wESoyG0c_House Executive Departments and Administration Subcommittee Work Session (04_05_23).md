**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Executive Departments and Administration Subcommittee Work Session (04/05/23)**

On April 5, 2023, the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Subcommittee convened a work session to address critical issues related to building codes, industry standards, and refrigerant regulations. The session focused on two main topics: the broader discussion of building codes and industry autonomy, and the specific consideration of **SB 53**, which permits the use of certain refrigerants compliant with the Clean Air Act. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Building Codes and Industry Standards**

1. **Industry Autonomy and Innovation**:  
   A developer highlighted the importance of allowing the construction industry to drive its own standards and solutions. Drawing from personal experience with innovative construction methods, he emphasized the challenges posed by rigid code restrictions and argued that industry-led standards would simplify adoption for non-industry stakeholders.

2. **Adoption of ASHRAE Standards**:  
   The committee debated the implications of adopting **ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers)** standards by reference. Legislators expressed concerns about being bound to future updates of these standards without explicit legislative approval. To address this, participants suggested incorporating specific ASHRAE provisions into the code rather than referencing entire standards.

3. **Legislative Flexibility**:  
   Participants underscored the need to avoid rigidly tying legislation to external standards that could evolve over time. They referenced challenges faced in other states, such as Kentucky, to illustrate the potential pitfalls of inflexible code adoption.

4. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee agreed to continue the conversation, draft written proposals, and hold another meeting to finalize recommendations. They also acknowledged the ongoing efforts of the **Building Code Review Board** in updating codes.

5. **Refrigerant Regulations**:  
   Concerns were raised about the potential inability to purchase certain refrigerants if codes or related legislation were not passed promptly. This issue tied into the broader discussion of ensuring timely updates to codes and standards.

### **Discussion on SB 53: Refrigerant Regulations**

1. **State Fire Marshal's Perspective**:  
   **Sean Timmy**, the State Fire Marshal, expressed no major safety concerns with **SB 53** as written. However, he noted that newer refrigerants are not fully addressed in the 2018 fire code. To address this, he recommended incorporating the 2023 edition of **NFPA 55**, which includes updated safety standards for refrigerants, through the **Board of Fire Control** process. Timmy emphasized that refrigerants in quantities under 10,000 pounds in non-sprinklered buildings pose no significant risk.

2. **Building Code Review Board's Input**:  
   **Philip Sherman**, Chair of the Building Code Review Board, provided additional insights into the alignment of refrigerant regulations with federal and state safety standards. His input reinforced the need for updated codes to address the flammability of newer refrigerants while ensuring compliance with the **Clean Air Act**.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Balancing Innovation and Regulation**: The discussions emphasized the importance of enabling industry innovation while ensuring legislative clarity and avoiding unintended consequences from adopting external standards.  
- **Flexibility in Code Adoption**: Legislators and stakeholders agreed on the need for flexibility in adopting and updating codes to avoid being locked into outdated or evolving standards.  
- **Timely Updates**: The session highlighted the urgency of updating codes, particularly regarding refrigerant regulations, to prevent disruptions in the industry and ensure safety compliance.  
- **Collaborative Approach**: The committee committed to ongoing collaboration, including drafting proposals and holding follow-up meetings, to address these complex issues effectively.
