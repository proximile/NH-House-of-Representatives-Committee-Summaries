**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee Meeting (04/04/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee convened on April 4, 2023, to discuss several bills addressing hunting, land use, and wildlife management. The meeting focused on balancing technological advancements in hunting with landowners' rights, privacy concerns, and the preservation of New Hampshire’s hunting traditions. Key discussions and bills included:

---

### **SB 14: Regulation of Game Cameras**
1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to address privacy concerns and protect landowners' rights by regulating the use of game cameras on private property.
2. **Key Provisions**:
   - Requires hunters to obtain **written or posted permission** from landowners before placing game cameras.
   - Cameras must be labeled with the owner’s name and contact information.
   - Prohibits **cellular cameras** that transmit images in real-time, as they violate fair chase principles.
   - Imposes a **24-hour waiting period** after remotely viewing wildlife before hunting.
   - Establishes a **$1,000 fine** for violations.
3. **Debate**:
   - Supporters, including the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, Farm Bureau, and Wildlife Federation, emphasized the need to respect landowners' privacy and property rights.
   - Concerns were raised about the high fine, enforcement challenges, and potential unintended consequences, such as doxing hunters or limiting cell camera use.
   - Testimonies highlighted the increasing use of game cameras without permission, leading to privacy violations and the risk of more landowners posting their property as "no trespassing."

### **SB 15: Regulation of Tree Stands and Observation Blinds**
1. **Purpose**: The bill seeks to improve communication between landowners and hunters by clarifying regulations for tree stands and observation blinds.
2. **Key Provisions**:
   - Requires **labeling** of all tree stands and blinds with the owner’s name and contact information.
   - Distinguishes between **permanent** (requires written permission) and **temporary** stands (allowed without written permission from August 1st to December 31st).
   - Mandates removal of structures by **January 1st**, unless landowners grant permission for them to remain longer.
3. **Debate**:
   - Landowners expressed frustration over unauthorized tree stands and the need for better communication with hunters.
   - Questions arose about defining "permanent" stands and the practicality of enforcing written permission, with the committee agreeing that verbal permission suffices.
   - Liability concerns were addressed, particularly regarding "attractive nuisance" laws and scenarios where removing a tree stand could be considered theft.

### **SB 12: Leasing of Seasonal Camps**
1. **Purpose**: The bill standardizes the leasing process for seasonal camps managed by the Fish and Game Department.
2. **Key Provisions**:
   - Aligns lease terms with other state agencies, allowing leases up to five years without additional approvals.

3. **Outcome**: The committee unanimously passed the bill on consent.

### **Other Discussions**
1. **Date Selection for Regulations**: The committee debated the timing of implementing regulations, particularly wintertime timber cuts, which are often the only feasible time for such activities. The Timberland Runners Association was suggested as a resource for further input.
2. **Effective Date of Legislation**: The committee acknowledged that setting an effective date 60 days after passage often causes complications and agreed to consider a later implementation date to allow for proper rule-making.
3. **Companion Legislation**: The need for additional legislation to address non-hunting uses of game cameras, such as surveillance by private investigators or stalkers, was briefly discussed.

### **Next Steps**
- The chair announced that no action on the discussed bills (including SB 14 and SB 15) would occur until at least April 25, giving committee members time to review the laws and reflect on the discussions.
- Potential amendments, such as adjusting fines and clarifying language, were considered to address concerns raised during the meeting.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the importance of balancing technological advancements in hunting with landowners' rights, privacy, and safety. While there was strong support for the proposed legislation, concerns about enforcement, fines, and unintended consequences were acknowledged. The committee emphasized the need for continued dialogue and collaboration to preserve New Hampshire’s hunting traditions and maintain positive relationships between hunters and landowners.
