The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on April 18, 2023, to discuss several key bills, focusing on electric vehicle (EV) registration fees, charitable gaming regulations, and road funding. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Electric Vehicle Registration Fees (Senate Bill 191)**
The committee extensively debated **Senate Bill 191**, which proposes a **$100 annual surcharge on EV registrations** and **$50 for plug-in hybrids** to address declining gas tax revenues as EV adoption increases. The bill aims to ensure EV owners contribute to road maintenance, as they do not pay gas taxes. Key points included:

1. **Fairness and Road Funding**: Proponents framed the bill as a "fair share" measure, ensuring EV owners contribute to road infrastructure. The surcharge is based on average miles driven and gas tax equivalents. With EV adoption projected to grow to 60,000 vehicles by 2030, the surcharge is expected to generate **$800,000 in 2024**, increasing over time.

2. **Charging Infrastructure**: Up to 20% of the revenue may fund EV charging infrastructure, addressing concerns about accessibility and tourism. New Hampshire has already secured **$17.1 million in federal funding** for charging stations.

3. **Concerns and Opposition**: Critics argued the bill unfairly penalizes EV owners, who represent only **1% of vehicles**, and could discourage EV adoption. Some suggested alternative funding mechanisms, such as **mileage-based taxes** or **charging infrastructure fees**, though these are not yet feasible.

4. **Broader Context**: The bill is part of a national trend, with 30 other states adopting similar EV fees. The discussion highlighted the need for innovative funding models as gas tax revenues decline.

### **Charitable Gaming Regulations (Senate Bill 19 and Senate Bill 139)**
The committee also discussed two bills related to charitable gaming, aiming to support charities and smaller social clubs:

1. **Senate Bill 19: Relative to Bingo Dates**:
   - The bill increases the number of permitted bingo dates per licensee from 10 to 16 per calendar month, raising the annual total from 120 to 192. It also includes a friendly amendment to increase allowable expense reimbursements for charity employees from $25 to $50 per day.
   - Testimonies highlighted the challenges charities face in staffing and the need for increased revenue. Concerns were raised about potential competition among charities and the feasibility of staffing additional dates.
   - The bill was generally supported as a way to help charities increase revenue and cover volunteer expenses.

2. **Senate Bill 139: Relative to the Price of Lucky Seven Tickets**:
   - The bill initially proposed raising the maximum wager on Lucky Seven tickets from $1 to $10 but was amended to $2 to address concerns about unintended consequences, such as large prize pots and the proliferation of gambling parlors.
   - Testimonies emphasized the need for fairness and competitiveness for smaller clubs (e.g., VFW, American Legion) compared to larger gambling entities. Concerns were raised about increased gambling and regulatory oversight.
   - The committee considered amending the bill to cap the ticket price at $2, balancing competitiveness with control.

### **Additional Discussions (Senate Bill 192)**
The committee also discussed **Senate Bill 192**, which seeks to adjust the hours for selling **Lucky Seven tickets** at bingo events, moving the start time from **12 p.m. to 8 a.m.** to align with casino operating hours. This change would help charities reliant on early ticket sales for revenue, particularly those hosting morning bingo events.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **EV Registration Fees**: The committee acknowledged the need to address declining gas tax revenues but debated the fairness and long-term viability of the proposed EV surcharge. Concerns about discouraging EV adoption and the financial burden on low-income communities were prominent.
- **Charitable Gaming**: Both gaming-related bills aimed to support charitable organizations by increasing revenue opportunities. Concerns centered on staffing, competition, and the potential for unintended consequences with higher wagers.
- **Broader Implications**: The discussions highlighted the need for innovative funding mechanisms as the state transitions to electrification and the importance of balancing fairness and competitiveness in charitable gaming.

The committee planned to process the information and potentially hold executive sessions to further deliberate on the bills.
