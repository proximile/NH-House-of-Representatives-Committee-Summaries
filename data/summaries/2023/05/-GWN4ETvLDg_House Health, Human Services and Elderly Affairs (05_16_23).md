The NH House of Representatives meeting focused on **Senate Bill 240**, which addresses the use of patient data, particularly genetic information, for clinical care and research. The discussion centered on three main issues:  

1. **Access to Data**: Ensuring that patient data is restricted to clinical care and not used beyond that scope without consent.  
2. **Consent**: Clarifying the need for explicit patient consent for the use of their data in clinical research.  
3. **De-Identified Data**: Addressing concerns about the use of de-identified patient data for retrospective research, particularly in clinical or genetic analysis.  

Key points of debate included:  
- **Patient Privacy**: Representatives emphasized the importance of protecting patient confidentiality, especially regarding genetic information.  
- **Research Needs**: There was a push to balance privacy concerns with the need for clinical research to advance medical care.  
- **De-Identified Data**: Concerns were raised about using de-identified data without specific consent, particularly for historical records. Some argued that de-identified data is essential for research where obtaining consent is not feasible.  

The committee agreed to focus on **Sections 1 to 14** of the bill, which address consent and data use for clinical care and research, while deferring the more contentious issue of de-identified data for future discussion. They plan to draft an amendment for the agreed-upon sections and continue working on the remaining issues over the summer. The next meeting is scheduled for **May 24th** to finalize the amendment.
