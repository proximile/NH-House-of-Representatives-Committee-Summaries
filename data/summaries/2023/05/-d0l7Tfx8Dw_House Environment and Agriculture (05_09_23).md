**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (05/09/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on May 9, 2023, to discuss and vote on several key environmental and agricultural bills. The meeting featured robust debates on amendments, stakeholder concerns, and the urgency of passing legislation to address regulatory gaps. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

#### **1. Reversion Clause and Extensions**
The committee debated the inclusion of a reversion clause in a bill, which would revert to old rules if certain deadlines aren’t met. Representative Bixby emphasized that removing the clause entirely would kill the bill, while others argued for extensions under extraordinary circumstances to ensure the bill’s survival. The consensus was to allow extensions to delay reversion, balancing stakeholder concerns about indefinite delays and litigation risks.

#### **2. Stakeholder Concerns and Trust**
Discussions highlighted a lack of trust in the regulatory process, particularly regarding potential delays in rulemaking. Compromises were proposed to address stakeholder concerns, including ensuring transparency and timely reporting.

#### **3. Urgency of Passing Legislation**
The committee noted that current rules expire next year, making it critical to pass legislation to avoid regulatory gaps. Members emphasized the importance of passing bills, even if imperfect, to provide stability and continuity.

### **Bill-Specific Discussions**

#### **SB 267 (Cumulative Impact Analysis for Environmental Rules)**
Representative Bixby proposed an amendment to adjust the timeline for a report on the cumulative impacts of contaminants and ensure delivery to relevant committees. The amendment was adopted unanimously.

#### **SB 161/162 (Rabies Vaccination Exemptions for Pets)**
The committee discussed a bill allowing exemptions from rabies vaccinations for dogs, cats, and ferrets if medically necessary. The bill simplifies the renewal process by requiring only the primary vet’s signature after the initial exemption. It passed with an 18-1 vote.

#### **SB 211 (Background Checks for Waste Facility Permits)**
The bill aligns state requirements with federal standards for background checks on solid and hazardous waste facility permit applicants. It passed unanimously (19-0).

#### **SB 23 (Study Committee on Meat Processing)**
The committee discussed creating a study committee to address challenges in processing non-amenable species (e.g., deer, elk, bison) and improving meat processing infrastructure. The bill passed unanimously (19-0).

#### **SB 159 (Study Committee on Landfill Permits and Out-of-State Waste)**
The committee considered forming a study committee to examine unlimited service area permits for landfills and the impact of out-of-state waste. The bill passed unanimously (19-0).

#### **SB 62 (Landowner Liability for Hazardous Waste Cleanup)**
The committee discussed technical corrections to statutes related to landowner liability under the Hazardous Waste Cleanup Fund, including removing gender-specific language. The bill passed unanimously (19-0).

#### **SB 61 (Surface Water Setbacks for Landfills)**
The committee debated a bill requiring the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to establish site-specific setbacks for landfills from perennial surface water bodies. Key issues included the 24-month timeline for rulemaking, conflict of interest concerns, and the need for scientific input. The committee decided to delay further discussion due to unresolved questions.

#### **HB 56 (Landfill Setback Requirements and DES Contracting)**
The committee discussed solid waste landfill setback requirements and DES contracting with consulting firms to assess and recommend changes to regulations. Key points included:
- **Conflict of Interest**: Ensuring transparency in the Request for Proposals (RFP) process while avoiding overly strict definitions that could limit qualified bidders.
- **Qualified Consultants**: Emphasizing expertise in environmental protection, health and safety risks, and hydrogeological aspects of landfill design.
- **Reporting and Oversight**: Proposing regular updates from DES and forming a subcommittee for oversight.
- **Extensions and Deadlines**: Allowing extensions up to 120 days to prevent reverting to old rules.
- **Scope of Study**: Clarifying that the study focuses on developing standards for site-specific setbacks, not evaluating every potential landfill site.
- **Public Access to Reports**: Agreeing to make the final report publicly available on the DES website.
