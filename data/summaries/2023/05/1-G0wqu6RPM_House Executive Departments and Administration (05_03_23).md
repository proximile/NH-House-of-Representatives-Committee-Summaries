The NH House Executive Departments and Administration Committee meeting on May 3, 2023, focused on two main bills: **Senate Bill 207** and **Senate Bill 106**.

### **Senate Bill 207**
- **Purpose**: The bill has two parts: 
  1. Establishing a committee to study emergency medical and trauma services.
  2. Expanding peer support groups for firefighters and other first responders to address post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder.
- **Key Discussion**: 
  - The intent of the second part is to provide confidentiality protections for peer support groups and allow organizations like the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire to offer peer support services.
  - Questions arose about whether the bill provides liability protection for peer counselors, which was clarified as not the primary intent but could be interpreted as part of confidentiality protections.
  - Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with **HB2**, particularly regarding the definition of "employee organizations" and their inclusion in peer support groups.
  - The committee agreed to remove the study committee (part one) and focus on the peer support provisions (part two). Further clarification on language and definitions will be addressed in a follow-up meeting.

### **Senate Bill 106**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to create a credentialing pathway for early childhood education through Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs, allowing students to gain certification without additional college credits.
- **Key Discussion**:
  - The bill would allow clinical hours in school-based programs (not licensed by HHS) to count toward certification, addressing a gap in the current system.
  - Concerns were raised about why the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) hasn’t implemented this through rulemaking, given their existing authority.
  - The committee sought clarification from HHS on why this hasn’t been done and whether there are legal or technical barriers.
  - A minor amendment was proposed to remove a section referencing RSA 170e:11, as it pertains to daycare center licensing, not credentialing.

### **Next Steps**:
- The committee will reconvene after gathering more information from HHS and stakeholders to address concerns and finalize amendments for both bills.
