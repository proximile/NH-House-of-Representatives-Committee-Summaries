**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (05/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on May 19, 2023, addressed a wide range of issues related to healthcare, Medicaid services, mental health, and public health policy. The discussions were organized into three main segments, each focusing on distinct but interconnected topics.

### **Healthcare and Medicaid Services**
1. **Transportation and Rural Access**:  
   The committee examined challenges in accessing healthcare, particularly for Medicaid enrollees in rural areas. The contract with DentaQuest and Northeast Delta Dental includes provisions for transportation and mileage reimbursement to address barriers identified through risk assessments. Mobile dental clinics were proposed as a solution to improve access in underserved regions, though rural provider participation remains low.

2. **Provider Feedback and Engagement**:  
   Two provider advisory committees were established—one through the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the New Hampshire Dental Society, and another integrated into the DentaQuest/Northeast Delta Dental contract—to gather ongoing feedback and address provider concerns. The committee also discussed the implementation of a closed-loop referral system to manage no-show issues, though it is not yet operational.

3. **SB 263 and Medicaid Dental Services**:  
   The committee debated SB 263, which focuses on Medicaid dental services, including program duration, community engagement requirements, and funding. The bill has moved to the finance committee with multiple amendments, and the committee of conference will play a critical role in resolving differences between the House and Senate positions. Frustration was expressed about the opaque nature of the committee of conference process.

4. **Adult Dental Benefit Program**:  
   The rollout of the new adult dental benefit program was discussed, with 117 providers enrolled as of May 10th. Mobile dental clinics are being utilized to address geographic disparities and improve network adequacy. However, concerns were raised about the impact of Medicaid recertification (the "unwind") on individuals in the middle of dental treatment plans.

5. **Contract Management**:  
   The committee reviewed contracts with dental vendors, Northeast Delta Dental and DentaQuest, and discussed upcoming amendments to align with CMS requirements. The partnership between the two vendors was highlighted as a strength in managing the dental program.

### **Developmental Services and Provider Transition**
- Updates were provided on the transition from area agencies directly contracting with providers to DHHS handling these contracts. Efforts are underway to onboard cohorts of providers and address concerns about the financial viability of area agencies and IT system costs. The committee also briefly discussed the need for more detailed documentation of the Developmental Disabilities (DD) waitlist in meeting minutes.

### **Mental Health and Public Health Initiatives**
1. **Mission Zero Initiative**:  
   Interim Commissioner Laurie Weaver presented updates on the "Mission Zero" initiative, aimed at reducing emergency department (ED) boarding for mental health patients. Key strategies include increasing designated receiving facility (DRF) beds, improving care coordination, adding crisis stabilization centers, and addressing staffing shortages. The initiative also focuses on transitional housing to support patients after discharge.

2. **COVID-19 After-Action Review**:  
   Director Robert Buxton and Stephanie Locke discussed the state’s after-action review of its COVID-19 response, conducted by Title Basin, a consulting firm. The review will analyze preparedness, response, and recovery efforts from January 2020 to June 2021, with a final report due in June 2024. Areas of focus include supply chain logistics, vaccination distribution, and emergency operations center staffing. Concerns were raised about the review’s flexibility to address future crises that may differ from the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Alzheimer's Disease Subcommittee**:  
   The committee discussed re-establishing a subcommittee on Alzheimer's disease to oversee initiatives related to Alzheimer's and other memory-related issues. A proposed $500,000 public awareness campaign was highlighted, with insights provided by Representative Edwards and lobbyists from the Alzheimer's Association.

### **Strategic Guidance and Stakeholder Engagement**
- Members emphasized the need for better vetting and validation of federal guidance, particularly from the CDC, and improved communication of reality-based policies to the public. Local input, transparency, and stakeholder engagement were stressed as critical to effective policy implementation, particularly in municipalities and public health programs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the announcement of the next committee meeting on June 23, 2023. Overall, the discussions underscored the committee’s focus on improving access to healthcare, addressing rural disparities, enhancing mental health services, and ensuring transparency and stakeholder engagement in public health policy decisions.
