The New Hampshire House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee convened on May 24, 2023, to discuss and vote on two key bills: **Senate Bill 47 (SB 47)** and **Senate Bill 132 (SB 132)**.

### **Senate Bill 47: Regional Planning and Conservation Directives**
- **Amendment Discussion**: Representative Priest introduced an amendment to SB 47, which incorporated language to include the New Hampshire Association of Regional Planning Commissions. The amendment also addressed conservation directives and committee makeup changes from prior meetings. Representative Hicks provided additional clarification during the discussion.
- **Vote**: The amendment passed with strong support (18-2), and the bill, as amended, also passed with the same margin (18-2).

### **Senate Bill 132: Immigration Enforcement and Sanctuary Policies**
SB 132, which sought to address immigration enforcement at the local level, was the focal point of the meeting, sparking intense debate and a close vote. Key points from the discussion included:

1. **Concerns Over Inconsistent Enforcement**: Representatives expressed concerns about varying immigration enforcement policies across municipalities, which could lead to confusion and chaos. Some argued that SB 132 would standardize enforcement and ensure local policies align with federal law.

2. **Amendment Proposal**: Representative Power introduced an amendment to SB 132, which aimed to prohibit cities and towns from adopting restrictive policies (referred to as "sanctuary policies") that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The amendment clarified definitions and narrowed the bill’s scope to ensure it did not mandate cooperation but rather prevented outright prohibition of such cooperation.

3. **Debate Highlights**:
   - **Supporters**: Proponents of SB 132 argued that the bill would enhance public safety by preventing policies that could shield individuals from federal immigration enforcement, particularly those detained for state law violations. They also linked lax immigration policies to the fentanyl crisis, emphasizing that the drug, which is causing significant harm in New Hampshire, often enters through the southern border.
   - **Opponents**: Critics, including Representatives Wheeler and Yokela, contended that the bill was unnecessary, as local law enforcement already cooperates with federal immigration authorities. They raised concerns about potential unintended consequences, such as violating First Amendment rights, imposing financial burdens on municipalities, and overstepping the state’s role in what is fundamentally a federal issue.

4. **Voting Outcomes**: The amendment to SB 132 failed in a close vote (9-11). The committee then moved to vote on the original bill, which would prohibit sanctuary policies. The final vote on SB 132 was not explicitly recorded in the transcript, but the discussion indicated a deeply divided committee.

5. **Societal and Fiscal Concerns**: One representative drew parallels between unchecked immigration and the decline of European cities, warning that similar societal and fiscal decay could occur in New Hampshire if immigration policies are not addressed.

6. **Committee Reports**: Given the contentious nature of the bill, the committee decided to write separate reports for and against SB 132, with representatives assigned to draft the arguments.

### **Key Themes Across the Meeting**
1. **Immigration Enforcement**: The debate centered on the role of local governments in enforcing federal immigration laws. Supporters of SB 132 emphasized the need for consistent policies across the state to ensure public safety, while opponents questioned the necessity and potential overreach of the bill.
2. **Discretion vs. Mandate**: SB 132 aimed to strike a balance by allowing local law enforcement discretion in cooperating with federal immigration authorities while prohibiting policies that outright restrict such cooperation.
3. **Federal vs. State Role**: Several representatives argued that immigration policy is a federal issue and that New Hampshire should not attempt to address it at the state level.
4. **Public Safety and Rights**: Supporters of SB 132 highlighted its potential to protect public safety, while opponents raised concerns about constitutional rights and financial impacts on municipalities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the committee largely completing its business for the session, pending any additional bills that might arise. SB 47 passed with strong support, while SB 132 remained contentious, reflecting the broader national debate over immigration enforcement and the balance between federal and local authority. The committee’s decision to draft separate reports for and against SB 132 underscored the deep divisions on this issue.
