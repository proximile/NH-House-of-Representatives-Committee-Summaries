The session began with traditional opening proceedings, including a prayer by Reverend Bob Stewart, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the National Anthem performed by Isabella Osgood.

**Key Legislative Actions and Debates**

3. **Bill Debates and Votes**:
   - **SB 209**: A motion to table the bill, which aimed to provide menstrual hygiene products in correctional facilities, passed with a division vote.

   - **SCR 1**: A resolution affirming New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status passed with bipartisan support after a roll call vote, emphasizing the state’s tradition amid challenges from the Democratic National Committee.
   - **SB 149-FN**: A bill addressing nurse agencies and labor shortages in nursing. Opponents argued it would increase compliance costs without solving the labor issue, while supporters believed it addressed real problems in nursing homes. A motion to table the bill passed.
   - **SB 14-FN**: Addressed the use of game cameras, with debates over property rights and surveillance. Amendments were proposed to balance landowners' rights and privacy concerns. The bill was referred to the Committee on Criminal Justice.

   - **SB 69-FN** and **SB 79**: Both bills related to net metering for renewable energy. SB 69 proposed expanding net metering for non-profits, while SB 79 aimed to expand it more broadly. Opponents raised concerns about cost shifting and reliability, while supporters highlighted benefits for non-profits and local energy generation. SB 69 was tabled after a failed motion to pass, while SB 79 discussions began but were not concluded.
   - **SB 167-FN-L**: Aimed to incentivize green hydrogen production in New Hampshire. Supporters highlighted its potential for economic growth and clean energy, while opponents argued it was premature and unnecessary government interference.
