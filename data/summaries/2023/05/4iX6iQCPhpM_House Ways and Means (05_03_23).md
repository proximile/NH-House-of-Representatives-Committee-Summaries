**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Ways and Means, 05/03/23):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 3, 2023, centered on discussions related to gambling and gaming legislation, with a focus on **Senate Bill 112** and **Senate Bill 19**. Key themes included problem gambling funding, breakage allocation, and regulatory amendments. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key points:

---

### **Problem Gambling and Funding**
1. **Rising Addiction Rates**:  
   - Representatives highlighted the increase in gambling addiction rates, particularly near major casinos, where up to 8% of gamblers could develop problems.  
   - Concerns were raised about the estimated number of problem gamblers in New Hampshire (e.g., 165,000), with questions about the accuracy of these figures.  

2. **Dedicated Problem Gaming Fund**:  
   - A proposal to create a **dedicated problem gaming fund** was discussed, which would allocate gambling revenue to address addiction issues.  
   - **Representative Almy** proposed an amendment to ensure funds are more visible and accountable, changing the language from "used as payment" to "to be deposited" in the fund (RSA 284-22c).  

3. **Current Funding and Oversight**:  
   - The **$250,000 annual allocation** for problem gambling services was deemed insufficient given the growth in gambling revenues.  
   - Concerns were raised about the **lack of transparency** and **oversight** in how funds are used, with calls for more effective **prevention, treatment, and mental health services** rather than just awareness campaigns.

### **Breakage Allocation**
1. **Definition and Calculation**:  
   - **Breakage** (unclaimed winnings from wagers) was a major topic of discussion. There was confusion about how breakage is calculated and whether the bill’s language aligns with actual practices.  
   - The committee requested a detailed explanation of breakage calculations to better understand its impact.  

2. **Proposed Redirection**:  
   - Currently, breakage is split among the operator, the state, and the treasury. A proposal was made to redirect breakage entirely to the **dedicated problem gaming fund**.  
   - Concerns were raised about the **potential impact on operators**, with fears that this could disincentivize them from offering certain games, potentially reducing overall revenue.

### **Risky Behaviors and Addiction**
1. **Holistic Approach**:  
   - Gambling was linked to other risky behaviors, such as substance abuse, smoking, and unprotected sex.  
   - Suggestions were made to create a commission to address risky behaviors holistically, with tobacco identified as a gateway to further substance misuse.

### **Legislative Amendments and Regulatory Updates**
1. **Senate Bill 19**:  
   - Two amendments (**1475** and **1603**) were discussed, both aimed at increasing the allowable days for **Lucky Seven** sales from 10 to 16 days per month, aligning it with proposed changes to bingo regulations.  
   - Another amendment proposed increasing the reimbursement limit for bingo volunteers from $25 to $50 to account for inflation and encourage participation.  

2. **Advanced Deposit Wagering**:  
   - A pending bill, **Advanced Deposit Wagering**, was mentioned, which would regulate mobile and internet wagering on horse racing, currently operating in a legal gray area.

### **Horse Racing and Sports Betting**
1. **Historic Horse Racing**:  
   - Questions arose about whether horse racing wagers were covered under current sports betting laws.  
   - Discussions also touched on the role of **historic horse racing** in the broader gambling landscape.
