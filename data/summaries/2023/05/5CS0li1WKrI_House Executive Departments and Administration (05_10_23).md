**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting – Executive Departments and Administration (05/10/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 10, 2023, focused on a range of legislative and administrative issues, with particular emphasis on professional licensing boards, vital records privacy, and healthcare regulations. Here are the key topics and discussions:

### **Professional Licensing Boards and Independence**
1. **Board of Medicine and Peer Review Independence**: Concerns were raised about the Board of Medicine appointing members to a peer review board, potentially compromising its independence. Suggestions were made to involve the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** in the appointment process to ensure impartiality.
2. **Advisory Boards and Efficiency**: Discussions centered on converting certain boards, such as the **acupuncture board** and **nursing home administrators board**, into advisory boards. The **assessing certification board** under OPLC was also debated, with concerns about its independence and member appointment processes. Additionally, the possibility of reducing board member numbers to improve efficiency and quorum was considered.
3. **Investigatory and Adjudicatory Processes**: The committee emphasized the need to separate the investigatory and adjudicatory roles in handling professional complaints. The **OPLC** would manage investigations, while boards would handle adjudication, ensuring a clear division of responsibilities. The **Medical Review Subcommittee (MRC)**, which investigates complaints against physicians, was discussed for its issues with quorum and case backlogs. Proposals included eliminating the MRC and establishing an investigative committee under the **Board of Medicine** to streamline the process.
4. **Remote Attendance and Volunteer Compensation**: **House Bill 308**, which allows remote attendance for board meetings, was highlighted as a potential solution to improve participation and reduce backlogs. Additionally, the issue of low compensation for board members was raised, with suggestions to increase stipends to attract more qualified applicants.

### **Vital Records and Privacy**
1. **House Bill 105 Amendments**: The subcommittee discussed amendments to **House Bill 105**, which addresses **vital records retention** and privacy concerns. The proposed amendment removes **Section 2** of the bill and retains **Section 1**, mandating **record retention for seven years** for hospitals and birth centers. Privacy concerns, particularly around **vital records**, were highlighted, with plans to address these issues in collaboration with the **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)** and the **Secretary of State’s office**.
2. **Data Accessibility and Privacy**: The **Secretary of State’s office** clarified that **vital records** are constitutionally mandated to be maintained by their office, ensuring privacy and security. Concerns were raised about **data accessibility** for research purposes while protecting individual privacy, particularly regarding **address information**. DHHS emphasized the need for full addresses for medical research and internal program purposes.

### **Healthcare Regulations and Compacts**
1. **Social Workers Compact**: The committee considered adding a **Social Workers Compact** to a bill, which would allow social workers licensed in one state to practice in other compact states without additional licensing. The compact aims to improve **license portability**, particularly for **military families** and those living near state borders. It was also highlighted as beneficial for **telehealth** and maintaining client-clinician relationships across states.
2. **Telemedicine and Career Ladders**: The committee addressed **telemedicine regulations**, requiring practitioners in New Hampshire to be **licensed or certified** by the state. A **career ladder for Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs)** was proposed to provide advancement opportunities toward becoming a full nurse.
3. **Mental Health Boards**: The need for **public members** on **mental health boards** to be independent from the practice of mental health was highlighted, with plans to ensure this in statute.

### **Administrative Corrections and Next Steps**
1. **Assessing Boards Mix-Up**: There was a mix-up between the **assessing certification board** and the **assessing Standards Board**, with the former intended to be under OPLC and the latter under the **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA)**. This error was identified and is being corrected through amendments.
2. **Non-Germane Amendment**: The committee discussed the need to draft a **non-germane amendment** to address various issues, including the **MRC**, **telemedicine**, and **social workers compact**.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a focus on balancing **privacy concerns**, **data accessibility**, and **efficient administrative processes** in healthcare and licensing. The committee planned to work on these issues over the summer, with a particular emphasis on streamlining processes, ensuring board independence, and protecting individual privacy while facilitating necessary data access for research and program purposes.
