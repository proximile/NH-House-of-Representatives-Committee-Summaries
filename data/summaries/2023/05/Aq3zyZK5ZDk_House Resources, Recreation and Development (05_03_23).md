The New Hampshire House of Representatives Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on May 3, 2023, for a meeting that addressed a range of legislative issues, with a particular focus on the handling of human remains, environmental regulations, and biodiversity considerations. The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance and included both discussions and executive actions on several bills.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

#### 1. **Handling of Human Remains:**
   - **Native American Remains:** The committee discussed the application of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), clarifying that it primarily applies to historical remains held by institutions like museums, which must be repatriated. Modern Native American remains are treated under standard cemetery laws, especially if they are in marked graves.
   - **Historical vs. Modern Burials:** A distinction was made between historical remains (e.g., from 1900 or 1920) and more recent ones (e.g., from 1975). Historical remains are subject to NAGPRA, while modern remains fall under traditional cemetery laws.
   - **Institutional Practices:** Jennifer Goodman of the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance emphasized the importance of encouraging local institutions to inventory their collections and take appropriate steps regarding human remains. The discussion noted a shift from mandatory to voluntary language in the law.
   - **Equal Treatment:** The committee considered amending the law to ensure equal statutory treatment for all human remains, not just Native Americans, and discussed codifying best practices for African-American burial grounds into statute.
   - **Future Considerations:** The committee highlighted the need for careful consideration and consultation with descendant communities in all cases involving human remains, particularly for Senate Bill 11, which addresses the treatment of human remains and burial grounds.

#### 2. **Legislative Actions:**
   - **Senate Bill 56:** Relative to payments for the restoration of certain jurisdictional resource losses. The bill was passed unanimously (19-0), with discussions highlighting its potential to expedite impact projects and improve watershed renewal programs.
   - **Senate Bill 164:** Relative to the consideration of biodiversity in the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP). The committee voted 16-4 to recommend the bill as inexpedient to legislate, citing concerns that it could create more problems than it solves and lacks input from the LCHIP board of directors.
   - **Senate Bill 229:** Relative to the administration of certain wetland permits by the Department of Environmental Services (DES). The bill passed unanimously (20-0), with discussions emphasizing its role in simplifying wetland permitting processes.
   - **Senate Bill 160:** Relative to the use of off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs) on designated trails. An amendment was introduced to address concerns about the Montana loophole and ensure compliance with federal water quality standards. The amendment and bill passed unanimously (20-0).
   - **Senate Bill 60:** Relative to the consideration of biodiversity in the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP). An amendment was introduced to clarify responsibilities and establish processing times for certification requests. The amendment and bill passed unanimously (20-0).

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the complexities of handling human remains, particularly those of marginalized communities, and the need for clear, equitable legal frameworks. The committee also addressed various environmental and recreational legislative issues, demonstrating a commitment to balancing development with conservation and community heritage. The session concluded with plans for future work sessions and continued discussions on pending bills, particularly those involving human remains and burial grounds.
