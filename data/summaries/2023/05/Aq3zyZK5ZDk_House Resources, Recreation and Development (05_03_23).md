**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: House Resources, Recreation and Development (May 3, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on May 3, 2023, for a session of the Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee, addressing a range of legislative issues. The meeting included both a detailed discussion on the handling of human remains and an executive session focused on environmental and recreational bills. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from both segments:

---

### **Discussion on the Handling of Human Remains**  
The session began with a focus on legislation concerning the treatment of human remains, particularly those of African-American and Native American descent. The goal was to refine existing laws and ensure respectful and consistent practices for the discovery, preservation, and repatriation of remains. Key highlights included:  

1. **Current Procedures**: When human remains are discovered, local law enforcement and the medical examiner determine if they are part of a crime or of historical significance. If historical, the Division of Historical Resources takes over, aiming to preserve remains in place or repatriate them in consultation with descendant communities.  

2. **Proposed Legislation**: The bill under discussion seeks to formalize the treatment of African-American remains similarly to Native American remains, ensuring consultation with descendant communities and proper repatriation. It also addresses the inventory and return of remains and artifacts held by institutions.  

3. **Role of Archaeologists**: The bill emphasizes the involvement of professional archaeologists, though concerns were raised about language that might allow continued excavation without immediate cessation when remains are found.  

4. **Descendant Communities**: The process involves identifying and consulting with descendant communities for decisions on the disposition of remains. This is particularly challenging for African-American remains due to historical contexts like slavery, which often lack direct familial records.  

5. **Statutory Changes**: The amendment aims to align the bill with existing statutes, placing provisions about human remains in RSA 227 (which currently covers Native American remains) and cemetery-related provisions in RSA 289.  

6. **Codifying Best Practices**: While current practices treat all remains with respect and aim for repatriation, the bill seeks to codify these practices, especially for African-American remains, to ensure consistency and legal backing.  

7. **Museums and Institutions**: The bill encourages museums and historical societies to inventory and return remains and artifacts, shifting from a mandatory "shall" to an encouraging "should" in some provisions.  

The discussion concluded with a commitment to refine the legislation to ensure it appropriately addresses the treatment of all human remains while respecting the historical and cultural contexts of different communities.

### **Executive Session Highlights**  
The executive session focused on several bills related to environmental and recreational issues. Key highlights included:  

1. **Senate Bill 56**: Addressing payments for the restoration of certain jurisdictional resource losses, the bill passed unanimously (19-0) after initial reservations were addressed.  

2. **Senate Bill 164**: Focusing on biodiversity considerations in the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP), the committee deemed the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) with a 16-4 vote, citing potential issues and lack of inclusion for all species. A minority report is expected.  

3. **Senate Bill 229**: Pertaining to the administration of wetland permits by the Department of Environmental Services (DES), the bill passed unanimously (20-0) after being praised for simplifying permitting processes.  

4. **Senate Bill 160**: Related to the use of Off-Highway Recreational Vehicles (OHRVs) on designated trails, the bill passed unanimously (20-0) after an amendment (1519H) clarified its focus and removed certain sections.  

5. **Senate Bill 60**: Involving water quality statutes and permitting processes, the bill passed unanimously (20-0) after an amendment (1635H) refined its language.  

6. **Work Sessions and Scheduling**: The committee discussed scheduling additional work sessions, particularly for Senate Bill 11, which had been retained from the previous session. An executive session for SB 11 was planned for May 10th, contingent on progress in the work session.  

7. **Process and Committee Operations**: The chair explained procedures for handling bills returning from the Senate, including concurrence, non-concurrence, and committee of conference processes. Plans were also made to address retained bills in June.  

8. **Technical Issues**: Representative Hoyt emphasized the importance of using microphones correctly to ensure all members, especially those with hearing impairments, could fully participate.  

The session concluded with plans to reconvene for a work session at 2:00 PM.
