### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on House Election Law (05/30/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 30, 2023, centered on discussions related to election law reforms, with a particular focus on campaign finance regulations. The meeting was marked by a collaborative tone as members sought to identify areas of agreement and streamline the state’s campaign finance system. Key discussions and decisions from the meeting are summarized below:

#### **1. Exploratory Committees**
Members debated the necessity of exploratory committees, with some arguing they are often used as a pretense for candidacy rather than genuine exploration. Concerns were raised that these committees allow candidates to circumvent campaign finance limits, leading to scenarios where individuals effectively campaign without officially declaring. There was a strong push to eliminate exploratory committees to simplify the system and close potential loopholes.

#### **2. Contribution Limits**
The committee discussed streamlining contribution limits by eliminating separate phases (e.g., exploratory, primary, general election) and establishing a single, higher contribution limit. This approach was seen as a way to reduce complexity, prevent incumbent advantages, and create a more equitable system for all candidates.

#### **3. Mandatory Online Filing**
There was broad support for phasing in mandatory online filing for campaign finance reports, starting with higher offices (e.g., governor, PACs) and eventually including state representatives. Concerns about accessibility for those without internet access were acknowledged, with suggestions to set thresholds for mandatory online filing to ensure fairness.

#### **4. Surplus Funds**
The handling of surplus campaign funds was a key topic, with a focus on ensuring transparency and preventing personal use of funds. Proposals included allowing surplus funds to be used for charitable donations or future campaigns, thereby maintaining accountability and ethical use of resources.

#### **5. Loans and Debt**
The committee considered setting deadlines for repaying campaign loans, after which unpaid loans would be converted into candidate contributions. This measure aims to prevent indefinite loan repayment periods and address concerns about candidates using loans as an "accounting trick" to bypass contribution limits.

#### **6. Voluntary Committees**
The utility of voluntary political committees was questioned, with some members arguing they are redundant and could be eliminated to streamline campaign finance laws. This would reduce administrative burdens and simplify the regulatory framework.

#### **7. Definitions and Clarity**
Efforts were made to clarify definitions and reporting requirements, such as standardizing deadlines for reporting campaign activities and simplifying terminology (e.g., using "treasurer" instead of "fiscal agent"). These changes aim to improve transparency and reduce confusion in the campaign finance process.

#### **8. Election Cycle Definition**
The committee discussed defining the election cycle more clearly, potentially starting the day after a general election and ending on the day of the next general election. This would provide a consistent framework for campaign finance reporting and accountability.

#### **9. Uniform Contribution Limits**
Members advocated for creating uniform contribution limits across different types of committees (e.g., exploratory, primary, general election) to reduce complexity and potential loopholes. This would ensure a fairer and more transparent system for all candidates.

#### **10. Transparency and Reporting**
The importance of transparency in campaign finance was emphasized, particularly in ensuring timely reporting of expenditures and contributions. Discussions highlighted the need for better oversight of entities like Super PACs, which often spend heavily right before elections without sufficient disclosure.

#### **11. Phased Implementation**
Recognizing the need for a smooth transition, the committee discussed phasing in reforms over several election cycles. This approach would allow candidates and committees time to adapt to the new regulations.

#### **12. CACR Discussion**
During the executive session, the committee discussed a Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution (CACR) related to the New Hampshire presidential primary, aiming to ensure it remains the first in the nation. The committee unanimously voted (19-0) to deem the CACR inexpedient to legislate.

#### **13. Future Plans**
The committee scheduled two additional meetings on June 13 and June 27, 2023, to continue refining proposals and preparing a report on recommended changes to campaign finance laws. Plans were also made to invite a representative from the Attorney General’s office to discuss enforcement of campaign finance laws.

#### **14. Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a focus on simplifying and improving the campaign finance system, reducing loopholes, enhancing transparency, and ensuring fair regulations. The collaborative effort reflects the committee’s commitment to creating a more equitable and accountable electoral process in New Hampshire.
