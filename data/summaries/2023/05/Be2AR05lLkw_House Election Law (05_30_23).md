**Summary of NH House of Representatives Election Law Meeting (05/30/23)**  

The New Hampshire House Election Law Committee convened on May 30, 2023, to address a range of issues related to campaign finance reform, election transparency, and the state’s presidential primary process. The meeting was divided into several key discussions, focusing on streamlining campaign finance laws, improving reporting mechanisms, and addressing the role of exploratory committees. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:  

### **1. Presidential Primary and CACR9**  
The committee began with an executive session on **CACR9**, a Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution aimed at ensuring New Hampshire’s presidential primary remains the first in the nation. The committee unanimously voted (19-0) to deem the resolution “inexpedient to legislate,” effectively halting its progress.  

### **2. Campaign Finance System Improvements**  
The committee launched a subcommittee session to identify areas of agreement for improving the campaign finance system. Key topics included:  
- **Simplifying Terminology**: Efforts were made to clarify terms such as “fiscal agent,” “financial agent,” and “treasurer” to reduce confusion.  
- **Consistent Reporting Deadlines**: The committee discussed standardizing reporting deadlines for candidates and committees, proposing that the reporting period end on Sunday, with reports due the following Wednesday.  
- **Exploratory Committees**: There was significant debate over whether exploratory committees should be retained, reformed, or eliminated. Some members argued that these committees allow candidates to raise funds without full transparency, while others emphasized their role in protecting free speech rights.  
- **Defining the Election Cycle**: The committee considered defining the election cycle as the period from the day after the general election to the next general election day, aiming to create clarity.  

### **3. Loans and Campaign Debt**  
The committee addressed the issue of **campaign loans**, particularly candidates loaning money to their own campaigns. Concerns were raised about loans being rolled over or repaid using donor contributions, which could allow donors to circumvent contribution limits. The committee proposed setting a deadline for loan repayment, after which unpaid loans would be converted into contributions from the candidate.  

### **4. Surplus Campaign Funds**  
The conversation touched on **surplus campaign funds**, noting that candidates can use these funds for politically related activities or donate them to charitable organizations, but cannot convert them to personal use.  

### **5. Contribution Limits and Phases**  
The committee considered simplifying campaign finance laws by eliminating separate phases of the election cycle (exploratory, primary, and general) and setting a **single contribution limit**. This change aims to reduce complexity and prevent incumbents from having an advantage over challengers.  

### **6. Transparency and Reporting**  
There was a strong emphasis on **transparency** in campaign financing, particularly regarding self-funding by candidates. The committee discussed phasing in **mandatory online filing systems**, starting with higher-level races (e.g., governor and PACs) and gradually including smaller races like state representatives. This would make campaign finance information more accessible to the public while accommodating those with limited internet access.  

### **7. Incumbent Protection**  
Some representatives argued that the current campaign finance system acts as an “**incumbent protection plan**,” making it harder for new candidates to compete. Simplifying the system and removing barriers to participation were seen as ways to level the playing field.  

### **8. Streamlining Definitions and Enforcement**  
The committee worked on clarifying definitions of political committees and other terms in the campaign finance law to reduce confusion and inconsistencies. They also discussed the need for clearer **enforcement mechanisms**, including potential involvement from the Attorney General’s office.  

### **9. Voluntary Committee Registration**  
The committee questioned the need for **voluntary committee registration**, considering it redundant and unnecessary. They explored eliminating this option to simplify the process.  

### **10. Feedback and Next Steps**  
Representatives from the **Secretary of State’s office** provided input, emphasizing the need to account for other forms of campaign debt (e.g., unpaid bills) and suggesting practical timelines for implementing new reporting requirements. The committee concluded with plans to continue discussions in future meetings, scheduled for **June 13th and June 27th**, aiming to finalize recommendations that would streamline campaign finance laws and improve transparency.  

### **Overall Goals**  
The meeting highlighted a collective effort to reform campaign finance laws, making them more **transparent**, **equitable**, and less prone to manipulation. By addressing administrative issues, clarifying definitions, and balancing First Amendment rights, the committee aims to create a fairer and more accessible election system for all candidates and voters.
