**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Meeting (05/09/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee convened on May 9, 2023, to address critical issues surrounding **campaign finance reform** and the **protection of New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary status**. The discussions highlighted the complexity of existing laws, the need for transparency, and the importance of simplifying the system to ensure fairness and compliance. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and proposals from the meeting:

---

### **1. Campaign Finance Reform**
The committee extensively discussed the challenges and proposed reforms to New Hampshire’s campaign finance laws, focusing on transparency, simplification, and closing loopholes.

#### **Key Issues and Proposals:**
- **Transparency and Loopholes**:  
  - Concerns were raised about loopholes in the current system, such as candidates using "accounting tricks" to bypass contribution limits. For example, funds raised to pay off campaign debt could be rolled into future campaigns, effectively doubling contributions.  
  - There was a push to address anonymous donations, balancing the need to protect small donors’ privacy while ensuring transparency for larger contributions that could influence candidates.  

- **Simplification and Consistency**:  
  - The committee emphasized the need for a "wholesale rewrite" of campaign finance laws to make them more consistent, less prone to misinterpretation, and easier to comply with.  
  - Proposals included consolidating the nine types of political committees into a single, streamlined structure and standardizing reporting requirements.  

- **Electronic Filing**:  
  - To improve transparency and accessibility, there was broad support for transitioning to mandatory electronic filing for campaign finance reports. The new system is expected to be in place by the 2026 election cycle.  

- **Reporting Deadlines and Fundraising**:  
  - The timing and frequency of campaign finance reports were debated, with suggestions to set a clear cycle reset date (e.g., January 1 of the election year) and limit post-election fundraising to a shorter period (e.g., one week) to prevent candidates from using debt as a loophole.  
  - Concerns were raised about candidates carrying debt from one election cycle into the next, potentially bypassing contribution limits. Proposals included requiring candidates to settle debts within a specific timeframe.  

- **Exploratory Committees**:  
  - The concept of exploratory committees was scrutinized, with concerns about candidates raising significant funds without formally declaring candidacy. There was discussion about setting limits on exploratory fundraising or eliminating the category altogether.  

- **Contribution Limits**:  
  - The committee debated setting uniform contribution limits across all types of committees to prevent donors from circumventing limits through multiple entities, such as LLCs or PACs.  

- **Enforcement and Free Speech**:  
  - Emphasis was placed on the need for clear, enforceable laws that are easy to administer. The Secretary of State’s office stressed the importance of simplicity and consistency in campaign finance reporting.  
  - Some representatives expressed concerns about balancing campaign finance regulations with First Amendment rights, particularly around political speech and fundraising.

### **2. CACR9: Protecting New Hampshire’s First-in-the-Nation Presidential Primary**
The committee also addressed **CACR9**, a constitutional amendment aimed at cementing New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary status.

#### **Key Points:**
- **Historical Context**: New Hampshire has held the first primary since 1916, with state law mandating it be held at least a week before any similar contest.  
- **Importance**: The primary is crucial for grassroots campaigning, forcing candidates to engage directly with voters and shaping the presidential race by narrowing the field.  
- **Current Challenges**: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has threatened to move New Hampshire’s primary behind other states, potentially excluding its delegates if it remains first in line.  
- **Purpose of CACR9**: The amendment seeks to protect the primary’s status from future legislative changes and external pressures.

### **3. Committee Discussion and Next Steps**
The committee acknowledged the complexity of campaign finance reform and the need for bipartisan cooperation to create a more transparent and fair system. Key takeaways included:  
- **Future Meetings**: The committee agreed to continue meeting regularly to develop a comprehensive set of principles and requirements for campaign finance reform, with the goal of presenting unified legislation in the next filing period.  
- **Stakeholder Input**: The committee will seek input from the Attorney General’s office, election officials, and other stakeholders to ensure the new campaign finance system is user-friendly and effective.  
- **Commitment to Transparency**: There was a shared commitment to streamline the process and protect New Hampshire’s unique role in the presidential primary process while ensuring fair and transparent campaign finance practices.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for campaign finance reform to address loopholes, improve transparency, and simplify compliance. Additionally, the committee reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status through CACR9. Moving forward, the committee will focus on refining proposals and working collaboratively to create a more equitable and transparent electoral system.
