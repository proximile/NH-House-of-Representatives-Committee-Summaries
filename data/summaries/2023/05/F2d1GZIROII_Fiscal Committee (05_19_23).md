**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting on May 19, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on May 19, 2023, to address a wide range of agenda items, including funding allocations, construction projects, and budget approvals. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and decisions made during the meeting:

### **Meeting Commencement and Administrative Matters**
- The meeting was called to order, with the absence of one senator and the late arrival of Representative Edwards noted.
- The minutes from the April 21st meeting were adopted without further discussion.
- The committee reviewed a consent calendar spanning Tabs 3 through 7, with specific items removed for individual consideration, including requests related to Health and Human Services (HHS) and other departments.

### **Forensic Facility Construction**
- The design for a forensic facility was finalized, and bids were solicited by Public Works. However, the bids exceeded expectations due to rising construction costs.
- To address the funding gap, $4 million was reallocated from previously unused funds earmarked for ambulatory surgical centers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was clarified that encumbered funds would carry over into the next biennium, with a significant volume of contract amendments and approvals expected in the remaining weeks.
