**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (05/03/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on May 3, 2023, to discuss a range of topics related to healthcare, insurance, consumer affairs, and legislative proposals. The meeting featured detailed deliberations on several bills and broader policy issues, reflecting the committee’s focus on balancing innovation, feasibility, and constituent needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. State-Based Health Care System**
The committee extensively debated a proposal to transition from the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) to a state-based health care system. Key points included:
   - **Goals and Challenges**: While the committee acknowledged the potential benefits of a state-based system—such as improved quality, affordability, and coverage—they highlighted significant challenges, including high costs, complexity, and the need for federal subsidies and executive leadership.
   - **Lack of Public Demand**: The absence of constituent advocacy for a state-based exchange was noted, raising questions about public support for such a transition.
   - **Executive Leadership**: Members emphasized that initiatives of this scale, like Massachusetts’ RomneyCare, require strong executive branch involvement, which was lacking in this case.
   - **Outcome**: The committee ultimately deemed the bill unfeasible, recommending against its passage and moving to “inexpedient to legislate,” effectively killing the bill. They suggested reworking the proposal with broader state health care goals and executive branch collaboration.

### **2. Collaborative Care Models in Healthcare**
The committee focused on integrating behavioral health into primary care through collaborative care models involving psychologists and primary care physicians. Key discussions included:
   - **Model Effectiveness**: Psychologists play a critical role in de-escalating behavioral health emergencies and providing coping skills, while primary care physicians handle medical treatments and referrals.
   - **Billing and Reimbursement Issues**: A major hurdle identified was the lack of clear billing codes for psychologists in collaborative settings, leading to reimbursement challenges. Insurance representatives (e.g., Anthem, Point 32 Health) acknowledged coverage should exist but cited ongoing reimbursement issues.
   - **Legislative Considerations**: The committee debated whether legislation was necessary to clarify and support these models or if better communication and education among providers and insurers could resolve the issues.
   - **Outcome**: Due to the complexity of the matter, the committee delayed a final decision, planning further meetings and potential amendments to the bill.

### **3. Other Legislative Proposals**
The committee also addressed several other bills and topics:
   - **Liquor Bill on Delinquent Payments**: A bill raising the minimum dollar amount for delinquent accounts by liquor licensees passed with no significant opposition.
   - **Public Benefit Corporations (PBC)**: A bill allowing PBCs to use the “PBC” designation in their titles and enabling out-of-state PBCs to register in New Hampshire was passed with little discussion.
   - **Mobile Home Parks Study**: A bill proposing a study commission to address issues in mobile home parks was retained for further study, with some members arguing that existing agreements already provide remedies for homeowners.
   - **Jones Act Study**: A bill to study the economic impact of the Jones Act on New Hampshire’s heating and electricity costs was retained, with some members questioning its necessity and suggesting alternative approaches.
   - **Prompt Payment for Managed Care**: Concerns about delays in insurance payments led the committee to retain a related bill pending a report from the insurance department in September.
   - **Insurance Review Amendments**: Amendments allowing insurers to conduct on-site or virtual audits of operations administrators were adopted, and the bill was passed.
   - **Reproductive Health Care Coverage Study**: A bill to study the cost of providing reproductive health care coverage for LGBTQ couples was retained, with debates over whether current infertility coverage already addresses the issue.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
   - **Complexity and Feasibility**: Many proposals, particularly in healthcare, were deemed too complex or premature, requiring further study, executive leadership, or clearer public demand.
   - **Need for Collaboration**: Effective policy implementation often hinges on collaboration between legislators, executive branch leaders, insurers, and healthcare providers.
   - **Focus on Constituent Needs**: The committee emphasized addressing specific concerns raised by constituents, such as billing issues in collaborative care models and challenges faced by mobile home park residents.
   - **Economic and Practical Considerations**: Cost implications and practical feasibility were critical factors in evaluating bills, leading to decisions to retain or amend several proposals.

In conclusion, the committee demonstrated a cautious and deliberative approach, balancing innovation with practicality and prioritizing constituent needs and economic impact in their decision-making process.
