2. **Senate Amendments**:
   - **House Bill 238 (Developmental Disabilities)**: The Senate removed provisions requiring the Developmental Services Quality Council to be involved in contracting decisions.

   - **House Bill 611 (Cannabis)**: The Senate amended the bill to include a commission to study state-controlled cannabis sales and to prohibit the sale of hemp products with certain THC levels. The committee recommended **non-concurrence** and requested a **committee of conference**, citing concerns about the commission’s composition and overlap with existing studies.

3. **Executive Session**:

### **Focus on House Bill 238 (Developmental Services Quality Council)**
The committee dedicated significant time to discussing **House Bill 238**, which aims to improve communication and transparency in developmental disability services. Key points included:

1. **Quality Council Communication**:
   - The Senate amended the bill to require **quarterly dialogues** between the Developmental Services Quality Council and DHHS, with the department required to respond in writing within 30 days.
   - Concerns were raised about the phrase "no more frequently than quarterly," which could limit the council’s ability to address urgent issues. However, exceptions were noted for administrative rules and regulations.

2. **Contracting Issues**:
   - The original bill included provisions for the council’s involvement in contracting decisions, but these were removed by the Senate due to concerns about procurement rules and fairness.
   - Advocates from the area agencies and the Disability Rights Center testified that the bill, as amended, represents significant progress, even if it doesn’t address all concerns.

3. **Committee of Conference**:
   - There was debate over whether to request a committee of conference to address concerns about the quarterly communication limit and the lack of formal responses for administrative rules.
   - Ultimately, the committee leaned toward **concurring with the Senate amendments**, recognizing the risk of losing the bill if further changes were pursued.

4. **Future Legislation**:
   - The committee discussed using **House Bill 608**, a retained bill, as a vehicle to address remaining issues, particularly around contracting, in the next legislative session.

5. **Final Vote**:
   - The committee voted **unanimously (20-0)** to recommend the bill for passage, with the understanding that further work may be needed in the future.
