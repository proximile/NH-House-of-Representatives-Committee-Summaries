**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (05/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on May 24, 2023, to discuss several key pieces of legislation, focusing on genetic testing, developmental disabilities, foster care, and cannabis policy. The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to patient autonomy, stakeholder collaboration, and thorough deliberation on complex issues.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **1. Senate Bill 240: Genetic Testing and Patient Consent**
The committee unanimously passed **Senate Bill 240** (20-0) with **Amendment 1954 H**, which clarifies and strengthens patient consent regarding genetic testing. Key points included:
- **Patient Control Over Genetic Data**: The bill ensures patients have full control over their genetic information, specifying how it is used or shared in clinical care. Concerns were raised about ambiguities in current statutes, which the amendment addressed.
- **De-Identified Data for Research**: The bill also touched on the use of de-identified genetic data for research. While some members expressed concerns about balancing privacy and research, the committee decided to focus on patient care for this bill and defer broader research issues for future legislation.
- **Cannabis Commission**: The Senate’s addition of a commission to study cannabis legalization was briefly discussed, with some representatives expressing disappointment at its inclusion in a bill focused on patient care.

#### **2. House Bill 238: Developmental Disabilities Quality Council**
The committee debated **House Bill 238**, which aims to improve communication and accountability between the Developmental Disabilities Quality Council and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Key points included:
- **Quarterly Meetings and Written Responses**: The bill requires quarterly meetings and written responses from DHHS to the Quality Council, though some members felt the language limiting communication to "no more frequently than quarterly" could hinder timely responses to urgent issues.
- **Stakeholder Support**: Lobbyist Alex Katrubis and Stephanie Patrick, chair of the Quality Council, expressed support for the bill, viewing it as a significant step forward despite not addressing all concerns (e.g., contracting issues).
- **Committee of Conference**: While some members initially considered requesting a committee of conference to address lingering concerns, they ultimately supported concurring with the Senate’s amendments to avoid losing progress already made.
- **Future Legislation**: Members discussed using **House Bill 608**, a retained bill, as a vehicle to address unresolved issues in future sessions.

#### **3. House Bill 408: Foster Family Homes and Child Protections**
The committee discussed **House Bill 408**, which addresses foster family homes and child protections. The Senate’s amendments simplified language and added a provision for DHHS to request a federal waiver. The committee agreed to concur with the Senate’s version, viewing it as a collaborative improvement.

#### **4. House Bill 611: Cannabis Legalization Commission**
The committee briefly touched on **House Bill 611**, which involves studying cannabis legalization and creating a commission. Concerns were raised about the commission’s composition, particularly the lack of representation from individuals with direct experience in cannabis cultivation and use.

#### **5. Retained Bills and Subcommittees**
The committee discussed forming formal subcommittees to review specific retained bills, ensuring diverse perspectives and thorough deliberation. Key areas of focus included transgender issues, developmental disabilities, sexual assault, organ donation, and childcare funding. The committee acknowledged the tight timeline for resolving retained bills, with a deadline in November, and emphasized the importance of formal subcommittees for inclusive decision-making.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
- **Patient Autonomy**: The committee demonstrated a strong commitment to patient autonomy, particularly in genetic testing and developmental disability services.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Discussions emphasized the importance of collaboration with stakeholders, including the Quality Council and advocacy groups, to improve legislation.
- **Future Focus**: While some issues (e.g., cannabis commission composition, contracting concerns) were not fully resolved, the committee highlighted plans to address them in future sessions.
- **Efficient Process**: The committee efficiently moved key bills forward, with unanimous support for **Senate Bill 240** and consensus on concurring with Senate amendments to **House Bill 238** and **House Bill 408**.

The meeting concluded with a decision to adjourn and reconvene as needed, reflecting the committee’s dedication to thoughtful and inclusive policymaking.
