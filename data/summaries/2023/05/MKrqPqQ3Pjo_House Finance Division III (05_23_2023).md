On May 23, 2023, the New Hampshire House Finance Division III convened to discuss several key legislative bills, primarily focusing on healthcare, Medicaid, and social service programs. The meeting highlighted critical policy debates, fiscal considerations, and the broader impact of these programs on the state’s residents. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Legislative Discussions**

1. **Healthcare Access for Women**  
   Representatives raised concerns about the state Medicaid program denying care to adult women based on age or the number of children, particularly for conditions like endometriosis or cancer. They emphasized the importance of timely medical intervention to reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.

2. **Senate Bill 239 (SB 239): Harm Reduction and Drug Policy**  
   Introduced by Senator David Waters, SB 239 addresses harm reduction strategies, including needle exchange programs, drug testing, and the Governor’s Doorways program for substance abuse treatment. The bill includes amendments to clarify definitions and procedures, ensuring that syringe service program participants can possess harm reduction items without legal repercussions.  
   - **Debate**: Some committee members expressed concerns about the broad definition of harm reduction and potential costs, while others stressed the importance of saving lives and addressing drug abuse.  
   - **Outcome**: The motion to retain the bill passed 5-4.  
   - **Clarifications**: Senator Waters emphasized that the bill does not support or fund safe injection sites.

3. **Senate Bill 263 (SB 263): Medicaid Renewal and Granite Advantage Health Program**  
   SB 263 extends the New Hampshire Granite Advantage Health Program and establishes a commission to evaluate its effectiveness.  
   - **Debate**: Some representatives argued for periodic renewal to allow for policy adjustments and prevent scope creep, while others favored a permanent extension, citing the program’s proven value and benefits.  
   - **Outcome**: The motion to retain the bill passed 5-4.  
   - **Concerns**: Discussions included the program’s sustainability, federal funding, and the need for a sunset clause to ensure periodic legislative review.

4. **Senate Bill 172 (SB 172): TANF Law Amendments**  
   SB 172 allows court-appointed guardians to receive Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) benefits for children in their care, particularly when foster care placements are unavailable.  
   - **Debate**: The discussion highlighted the importance of providing financial support to guardians and the bill’s minimal fiscal impact, as TANF funds are federally sourced and the state’s reserve is substantial.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was unanimously recommended to pass (9-0) without significant debate.

5. **Hospital Uncompensated Care**  
   Stephen Anon, representing the New Hampshire Hospital Association, discussed the significant reduction in uncompensated care due to Medicaid expansion. He emphasized the program’s benefits in providing timely and appropriate care, which reduces long-term healthcare costs.  
   - **Questions**: Committee members inquired about the calculation of uncompensated care and the tax-exempt status of hospitals.

### **Additional Concerns**  
Representative Colfault raised several issues on behalf of Representative Hull, including:  
- The lack of a functional work requirement for Medicaid.  
- The need for copays to ensure fiscal responsibility.  
- Concerns about sterilization procedures for individuals under 37.  
The discussion also underscored the importance of periodic review and reauthorization of Medicaid programs to prevent scope creep and ensure effective program management.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting concluded with plans to finalize recommendations for the full finance committee by June 1, 2023. Overall, the discussions reflected a strong emphasis on balancing fiscal responsibility with the need to improve healthcare access, address substance abuse, and support vulnerable populations through programs like Medicaid and TANF. The committee’s decisions highlighted the complexities of managing state-funded programs while striving to meet the diverse needs of New Hampshire residents.
