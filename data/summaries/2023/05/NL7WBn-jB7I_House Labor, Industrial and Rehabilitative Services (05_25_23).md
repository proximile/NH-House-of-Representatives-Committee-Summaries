The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on May 25, 2023, to discuss and vote on several key bills related to labor, industrial services, and unemployment compensation. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance the interests of employees and employers, clarify legislative language, and address complex issues within the constraints of the legislative calendar. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### Key Discussions and Votes
1. **Labor-Related Bills**:
   - The committee debated multiple bills addressing labor issues, including electronic payments to employee debit cards, tip sharing, and other employment regulations.
   - **Senate Bill 269**, which pertains to tip sharing and labor regulations, was a focal point. The committee considered amendments to the bill, emphasizing the importance of protecting employees’ tips and ensuring they are not controlled by employers.
   - Proposed amendments included specifying “10 business days” instead of “10 days” for certain actions to align with other states’ laws, and requiring written notice for specific labor practices. These sparked debates over clarity, necessity, and potential impacts on businesses.

2. **Committee Dynamics and Future Plans**:
   - The chair and members expressed concerns about the timing of addressing retained bills as the summer approached. They discussed scheduling additional meetings in June and potentially July or August to manage the workload.
   - Members volunteered to participate in subcommittees for specific bills, such as those related to medical marijuana and OSHA regulations.
   - Voting outcomes varied, with some motions passing unanimously and others resulting in split decisions, such as a 12-8 vote on one bill. The committee also discussed the potential for minority reports on certain bills.

3. **Senate Bill 42 FN: Overpayment of Unemployment Compensation**:
   - This bill addresses overpayments of unemployment benefits and distinguishes three scenarios:
     - **No Fault**: Recipients are not required to repay overpayments caused by departmental or employer errors.
     - **Fraud**: Recipients must repay the overpayment, face criminal charges, and accrue interest after 60 days.
     - **With Fault but Not Fraud**: The bill proposes eliminating interest on overpayments caused by recipient errors that do not constitute fraud.
   - **Amendment Discussion**: Representative Seaworth proposed an amendment allowing the Department of Employment Security to discretionarily charge interest (up to 1%) in cases of fault without fraud. Supporters argued it provided flexibility and prevented system abuse, while opponents viewed it as punitive and potentially biased.
   - **Vote on the Amendment**: The amendment resulted in a tie vote (10-10) and did not pass. The bill advanced without the amendment.
   - **Final Arguments**: Supporters highlighted the bill’s bipartisan nature and alignment with federal policy, while opponents warned that removing interest entirely could create perverse incentives.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was supported in its original form, reflecting a consensus to reduce punitive measures for non-fraudulent overpayments and align state policy with federal guidelines.

### Overall Themes and Outcomes
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to:
- Protecting employee rights, particularly regarding tips and unemployment benefits.
- Clarifying legislative language to ensure consistency and fairness.
- Balancing accountability in the unemployment system with compassion for individuals who make honest mistakes.
- Managing a heavy legislative workload by planning additional meetings and subcommittee work.

The discussions and votes reflected a nuanced approach to labor and unemployment issues, aiming to create equitable policies that serve both employees and employers while adhering to state and federal guidelines.
