The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on May 9, 2023, focused on discussing and voting on two Senate bills: **Senate Bill 228** and **Senate Bill 258**. Here’s a summary of the key points:

### **Senate Bill 228 (Hilton Ramp Study)**
- The committee discussed an amendment to SB 228, drafted by Representative Eaton, who was absent. Representative Chris Schultz filled in for him.
- The amendment clarified the study's scope, including the involvement of the Fish and Game Department, the Pease Development Authority, and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to address concerns about parking, water access, and commercial fishing use.
- The committee unanimously approved the amendment (18-0) and subsequently voted to recommend the bill "ought to pass" with the amendment (18-0).
- The bill, which includes a study deadline of June 30, 2024, was placed on the consent calendar.

### **Senate Bill 258 (Historic Property Disposal)**
- The committee debated SB 258, which aims to establish a process for transferring excess DOT properties with historical significance to non-profits or other entities for preservation.
- A Senate amendment proposed by Senator Perkins was discussed but not formally adopted, as it would need to be brought forward as a House amendment.
- Concerns were raised about the bill's broad implications, including how it would handle properties acquired through eminent domain and the lack of specific details on implementation.
- The committee voted to recommend the bill "interim study" (ITL), with a vote of 12-6, effectively delaying further action on the bill for further review.

### **Other Business**
- The committee briefly discussed **House Bill 296** (Driveway Permits), which was amended by the Senate. The committee decided to continue discussions via email rather than holding a formal meeting.
- Updates were provided on the capital budget amendment, which included minor corrections and a change in oversight for a building purchase from the Department of Education to Public Works. The committee expressed support for concurring with the Senate’s changes.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to sign a congratulations card and a brief recess. The committee emphasized the importance of addressing public interests and preserving historical properties while ensuring proper procedures are in place.
