### Comprehensive Summary: NH House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (05/01/23)

On May 1, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened to discuss and amend **Senate Bill 54 (SB 54)**, which focuses on long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), electric energy procurement, and ratepayer protections. The meeting was divided into two segments, with extensive discussions on amendments, definitions, and policy implications. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Overview of SB 54 and Key Themes**
SB 54 centers on enabling utilities to enter into long-term PPAs (up to 20 years) for energy, including renewable energy, to stabilize energy prices and promote renewable energy development. The bill also addresses the treatment of **environmental attributes** (e.g., renewable energy credits) in energy contracts and includes provisions to protect ratepayers. The committee reviewed and adopted **Amendment 2023-1586H**, making several changes to the bill to improve clarity and address concerns.

---

#### **2. Key Discussions and Amendments**
The committee debated and finalized eight key changes to the amendment, focusing on the following areas:

- **Environmental Attributes**:  
  - Clarified language around "environmental attributes" traded in energy markets.  
  - Debated whether to explicitly mention renewable energy credits or keep the term broad to accommodate future market developments.  

- **Long-Term PPAs**:  
  - Allowed utilities to enter into PPAs for up to 20 years, with the goal of encouraging renewable energy projects and stabilizing energy prices.  
  - Some members advocated for reducing the maximum term to 10 years to minimize risks to ratepayers, but the committee retained the 20-year limit, citing industry standards and financing needs for renewable energy projects.  

- **Ratepayer Protections**:  
  - Removed **"stop-loss caps"** from ratepayer protection mechanisms, as they were deemed ineffective.  
  - Replaced **"adequate"** with **"in the best interest of ratepayers"** to emphasize the importance of protecting consumers.  

- **Definitions and Clarity**:  
  - Revised the definition of **"incremental electric energy sources"** to clarify whether they include only new additions to existing facilities or all energy from modified facilities.  
  - Added **"creates or supports electric energy sources"** to better define the role of energy projects.  
  - Replaced **"winter event"** with **"long-duration weather events"** to account for both winter cold events and summer heat waves.  
  - Removed the phrase **"at a site where no facility previously existed"** to allow repowering of existing facilities.  

- **Public Comment and Transparency**:  
  - Changed **"May solicit public comment"** to **"shall solicit public comment"** to ensure transparency, though concerns were raised about potential delays.  

- **Effective Date**:  
  - Changed the effective date from **January 1, 2023**, to **September 1, 2023**, to allow more time for implementation.  

- **Economic and Environmental Benefits**:  
  - Discussed adding language to prioritize projects that generate economic and environmental benefits for New Hampshire, but this was not included in the final amendment.

#### **3. Subcommittee and Full Committee Work Session**
The meeting began late due to delays in receiving the amendment from the Office of Legislative Services (OLS). Once the amendment arrived, the committee proceeded with the following agenda items:

- **Subcommittee Vote**: The subcommittee voted to recommend SB 54 to the full committee, adopting **Amendment 2023-1580h**. Discussions focused on the definition of incremental electric energy sources, the effective date for qualifying energy sources, and the placement of the word **"only"** in a specific clause.  

- **Full Committee Work Session**: The committee debated and finalized changes to the amendment, focusing on clarity, ratepayer protections, and future energy needs. Members proposed splitting long sentences for clarity and adding definitions for terms like **"incremental energy sources."**  

---

#### **4. Final Changes and Unanimous Vote**
After extensive discussions, the committee agreed on seven key changes to the amendment, including:
   - Changing **"May"** to **"shall"** for public comment solicitation.  
   - Deleting the word **"only"** in a specific clause.  
   - Rewriting the definition of **incremental electric energy sources**.  
   - Adding **"creates or supports"** to clarify the role of energy sources.  
   - Replacing **"to be adequate"** with **"to be in the best interest of ratepayers."**  
   - Inserting **"their"** to clarify distribution ratepayers.  
   - Adding a hyphen to **"long-duration weather events."**  

The committee unanimously voted to adopt the amendment and recommend SB 54 for passage as amended.

#### **5. Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with the committee taking a group photo to commemorate the end of their first year of the biennium. The committee planned to reconvene in the afternoon for an **executive session** on SB 54 to finalize its recommendations. The discussions reflected a focus on ensuring clarity, protecting ratepayers, and addressing future energy needs while balancing procedural efficiency.
