The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on May 16, 2023, to address systemic issues within the family court system, focusing on judicial conduct, due process, domestic violence, and the overall fairness and efficiency of family court proceedings. The meeting featured extensive testimony from legal practitioners, individuals with personal experiences, and advocates, highlighting critical areas in need of reform.

### Key Issues and Concerns:

1. **Trauma, Bias, and Domestic Violence**:
   - Victims of domestic violence often face re-traumatization in court, sitting near their abusers and encountering judicial biases about how victims "should" behave. These biases can disadvantage self-represented litigants.
   - Domestic violence petitions are sometimes used strategically to block mediation, violating Rule 211, which mandates a judge’s first appearance.
   - There is a lack of understanding of domestic violence and trauma within the court system, with victims frequently disbelieved or inadequately protected. Supervised visitation centers are underfunded and limited.

2. **Parental Alienation and Weaponization of the System**:
   - Parental alienation claims are often weaponized, particularly by abusive fathers, to manipulate the court system and maintain control over victims.
   - False allegations of abuse and the manipulation of children in custody battles cause significant harm, underscoring the need for accountability and safeguards.

3. **Judicial Misconduct and Lack of Accountability**:
   - Testimony highlighted instances of judicial misconduct, including disbarred judges and marital masters refusing to follow Supreme Court orders. Concerns were raised about the Judicial Conduct Committee and the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) board, with delays in addressing complaints and an inability to file complaints against GALs during ongoing cases.
   - Judges often exercise excessive discretion, leading to inconsistent rulings, premature hearings, and decisions made without proper evidence or adherence to legal procedures.

4. **Due Process and Procedural Failures**:
   - RSA 173B, the domestic violence statute, was criticized as unconstitutional for stripping individuals of rights without due process. Calls were made to repeal the statute and treat domestic violence cases more like criminal matters, with investigations and jury trials.
   - Procedural irregularities, such as denied discovery requests and failures to follow court rules, were frequently cited. Judges’ orders, while increasingly detailed, still lack consistency and clarity.

5. **Systemic Challenges**:
   - The family court system faces severe backlogs and delays, exacerbated by COVID-19 and a shortage of judges. Training new judges further slows case processing.
   - Judges are frequently rotated among courts, disrupting continuity and understanding of individual cases. Specialization in family law could improve outcomes.
   - Disparities in income and resources create unequal access to legal representation and GALs, which are often only available to those who can afford them.

6. **Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution**:
   - While mediation is encouraged to reduce the adversarial nature of family court, it is unsuitable for cases involving domestic violence, where it can be unsafe or ineffective.
   - Alternative dispute resolution methods need to be carefully applied to ensure they do not exacerbate power imbalances or endanger victims.

7. **Gender Bias**:
   - Gender bias persists in the family court system, with mothers often losing custody when allegations of abuse are made against fathers, even if the allegations are proven.

### Calls for Reform:

1. **Increased Funding and Resources**:
   - More judges, clerical staff, and funding are needed to address backlogs and ensure timely, fair resolutions.
   - Supervised visitation centers and services for domestic violence victims require additional support.

2. **Training and Specialization**:
   - Judges and court personnel need better training on domestic violence, trauma, and adverse childhood experiences.
   - Specialization of judges in family law could improve consistency and understanding of complex cases.

3. **Accountability and Transparency**:
   - Reforms to the Judicial Conduct Committee and GAL board are needed to address complaints more efficiently and hold judicial officers accountable.
   - Detailed, transparent court orders referencing statutes and facts should be standardized to improve clarity and fairness.

4. **Systemic Reforms**:
   - Establishment of specialized domestic violence courts to better handle sensitive cases.
   - Collaborative efforts between agencies, such as DCYF and the courts, to improve outcomes for families and children.

5. **Legislative Action**:
   - Repeal or amend RSA 173B to ensure due process protections.
   - Create visitation enforcement agencies to prioritize non-custodial parents’ rights to maintain relationships with their children.

### Conclusion:

The meeting underscored the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to address the systemic issues plaguing the Family Division of the Circuit Court. Testimonies highlighted the profound impact of judicial bias, procedural failures, and inadequate resources on families and children, particularly victims of domestic violence. The committee concluded with a commitment to continue gathering detailed, specific testimony to inform potential legislative changes aimed at creating a more equitable, efficient, and supportive family court system.
