**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting (05/03/23)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on May 3, 2023, to discuss and debate several bills, with a primary focus on consumer protection, privacy, and judicial and administrative reforms. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Consumer Protection and Privacy Bill**
The committee engaged in extensive debate over a bill aimed at enhancing consumer protection and privacy. Key points included:

1. **Motion to Retain the Bill**: Several representatives advocated for retaining the bill to address unresolved questions and ensure robust protection for New Hampshire residents. Concerns were raised about the bill's complexity, the lack of a financial evaluation, and the potential strain on the Attorney General's office, which would require additional resources for enforcement.

2. **Private Right of Action**: A contentious issue was whether the bill should include a private right of action, allowing individuals to sue for violations. Opponents feared this could lead to frivolous lawsuits benefiting attorneys more than consumers, while proponents argued that the Attorney General's office could effectively handle serious violations.

3. **Narrow Scope**: The bill’s scope was relatively narrow, applying only to businesses processing data of 100,000 or more New Hampshire consumers. This was seen as minimizing the burden on small and medium-sized businesses.

4. **Comparison to Other States**: The bill was compared to similar legislation in Connecticut, Virginia, and Colorado. Some representatives argued that delaying the bill would allow New Hampshire to learn from other states' experiences and avoid potential pitfalls.

5. **Amendment Proposals**: Amendments were proposed to limit the Attorney General’s obligation to offer a cure for violations to the first year and to exclude a private right of action, aiming to balance consumer protection with practical enforcement.

6. **Market Self-Regulation**: Some representatives contended that the market already regulates itself to some extent, with businesses addressing privacy and accountability issues in response to consumer concerns.

7. **Vote to Retain**: After thorough discussion, the committee voted to retain the bill for further refinement, with a majority in favor. This decision allows more time to address outstanding concerns and ensure the bill’s effectiveness.

### **Other Key Bills Discussed**

1. **SB 27 - Financial Disclosure Forms for Judges**:
   - This bill simplifies financial disclosure requirements for judges by eliminating redundant paperwork. Representative Perez moved to pass the bill, highlighting its role in reducing confusion and aligning with existing judicial forms. The motion passed unanimously (19-0).

2. **SB 59 - Director of Charitable Trusts**:
   - Representative Alexander proposed an amendment to allow individuals under investigation to request in-person meetings, rather than requiring all meetings to be held at the State House. Both the amendment and the bill passed unanimously (20-0).

3. **SB 65 - Repealing Medical Screening Panels**:
   - The bill repeals underutilized medical screening panels, which were deemed impractical and wasteful. Representative Top moved to pass the bill, and it passed unanimously (20-0).

4. **SB 89 - Marriage License Accommodations for Medical Reasons**:
   - The bill proposes accommodations for obtaining marriage licenses in cases of medical necessity. The discussion was ongoing at the time of the summary, with further details expected in subsequent meetings.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of crafting effective consumer protection legislation while balancing practical enforcement and business impacts. The committee’s decision to retain the consumer protection bill reflects a commitment to thorough consideration and refinement. Additionally, the unanimous passage of other bills highlights the committee’s focus on streamlining judicial and administrative processes, ensuring clarity, and eliminating inefficiencies. The discussions and decisions from this meeting set the stage for continued legislative efforts to address key issues in New Hampshire.
