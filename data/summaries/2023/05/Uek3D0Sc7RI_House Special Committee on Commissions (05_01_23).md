**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (05/01/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions convened on May 1, 2023, to address the structure, management, and efficiency of legislative commissions and committees. The meeting focused on refining processes, improving oversight, and ensuring that commissions remain purposeful and effective. Key discussions and recommendations are summarized below:

### **1. Commission Structure and Sunset Dates**
The committee discussed implementing sunset dates for commissions to ensure they are periodically reviewed and dissolved if no longer necessary. This would reduce redundancy, limit the number of active commissions, and create opportunities for legislators to serve on fewer bodies, thereby alleviating workload pressures.

### **2. Appointment Process**
Challenges in appointing members to commissions, particularly the burden on the Speaker’s office and difficulty finding willing participants, were highlighted. Suggestions included involving committee chairs and ranking members in recommending appointees to distribute the workload and streamline the process.

### **3. Governor’s Appointments**
Concerns were raised about the complexity and time-consuming nature of governor-appointed commissions. Proposals were made to minimize such appointments to simplify the process and improve efficiency.

### **4. Legislative Staffing and Oversight**
There was consensus that legislative commissions should be staffed by legislative employees and meet within legislative facilities to maintain oversight and consistency. The committee also emphasized the need to track commission activities, such as meeting frequency, using tools like Excel spreadsheets or calendar systems.

### **5. Standardized Templates**
The committee proposed creating standardized templates for drafting legislation to establish new commissions. These templates would include clear expectations, such as sunset dates, specific responsibilities, reporting requirements, and study objectives. The goal is to ensure consistency, accountability, and efficiency in the creation and operation of commissions.

### **6. Mapping and Oversight**
The committee stressed the importance of clearly mapping which House committees oversee specific commissions to streamline oversight and ensure accountability. They also discussed tasking standing committees with following up on commission activities and the possibility of creating a joint House-Senate committee to oversee compliance with guidelines.

### **7. Review of Existing Commissions**
The committee reviewed the status of existing commissions, noting that some have not met in years or are inactive. They emphasized the need to evaluate the necessity and effectiveness of these commissions, with a focus on eliminating those that are no longer functional or relevant.

### **8. Collaboration with Universities**
The committee considered leveraging the University System of New Hampshire for research support, highlighting past collaborations with institutions like Dartmouth College. These partnerships have provided valuable assistance in research and website development for commissions.

### **9. Legislative Workload**
Concerns about the heavy workload on legislators serving on multiple commissions were discussed. Proposals included reducing the number of representatives on commissions to alleviate this burden and improve participation.

### **10. Drafting Process and Amendments**
The committee emphasized the importance of understanding the drafting process for commission-related bills and planned to involve legislative drafters, such as Mr. Alakunas, to provide insights and establish guidelines. They also discussed the need for clear guidance on handling amendments to commissions and retained bills, particularly in contentious situations.

### **11. Communication and Expectations**
The committee recognized the importance of educating legislators and committee chairs about the expectations for serving on commissions and creating new ones. This includes setting clear expectations for participation, responsibilities, and the overall purpose of commissions.

### **12. Future Actions**
The committee planned to finalize a mapping of commissions to committees, develop standardized templates for future commissions, and continue discussions with legislative drafters and staff. They also explored the possibility of creating a joint House-Senate committee to oversee commissions and ensure compliance with established guidelines.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting aimed to improve the structure, efficiency, and oversight of legislative commissions, ensuring they are well-organized, purposeful, and effectively contribute to the legislative process. By implementing standardized templates, streamlining appointment processes, and enhancing communication, the committee seeks to create a more efficient and accountable system for managing commissions. These efforts will be further refined in future meetings, with input from legislative drafters, staff, and other stakeholders.
