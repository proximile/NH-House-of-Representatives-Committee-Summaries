The New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee meeting on May 22, 2023, focused on discussing and introducing non-germane amendments to Senate bills. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Amendment to Senate Bill 207**: Representative Broda introduced an amendment to provide conditional licensure for mental health professionals. This amendment, originally House Bill 428, was retained in committee and aimed to address hurdles for mental health professionals in New Hampshire. The amendment would allow mental health professionals to obtain conditional licenses, enabling them to bill and receive reimbursement for services under supervision.

2. **Support Testimony**: Lindsay Courtney, Executive Director of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), testified in support of the amendment, explaining that it aligns with practices in other states and emerging compacts requiring specific licensure categories.

3. **Amendment to Senate Bill 655**: Another amendment, 2023-1943, was introduced, addressing four key areas:
   - Repealing disciplinary proceedings from boards and investigations, separating investigation from adjudication.
   - Clarifying the independence of public members from the board.
   - Redefining the Medical Review Subcommittee, which was previously eliminated.
   - Establishing requirements for board membership and reasons for removal.

4. **Legal Drafting**: The amendment was drafted by attorney Douglas Osterhout from OPLC and included a contingent effectivity clause to ensure it applies after House Bill 655 passes.

The committee closed the public hearing and scheduled voting on these amendments for the upcoming Wednesday executive session.
