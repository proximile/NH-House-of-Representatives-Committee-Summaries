The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee meeting on May 10, 2023, focused on the discussion, amendment, and voting of several key bills related to healthcare, Medicaid expansion, genetic testing, and substance misuse. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

### **1. Senate Bill 239: Substance Misuse, Harm Reduction, and Opioid Abatement**
- **Amendments and Definitions**: The committee debated amendments to refine definitions of **"misuse"** and **"harm reduction"**, aiming to align the bill with federal guidelines (e.g., SAMHSA) and ensure access to opioid abatement funds (approximately $310 million).  
- **Harm Reduction Debate**: Members discussed the **broad scope** of harm reduction, with some expressing concerns about potential liabilities and misallocation of funds, while others emphasized its importance in addressing public health issues like opioid addiction and overdose prevention.  
- **Misuse vs. Abuse**: The committee considered changing the term **"abuse"** to **"misuse"** to better capture the spectrum of substance use, including self-medication and diversion. However, concerns were raised about potential impacts on **insurance reimbursement** and billing codes, which currently use the term "abuse."  
- **Retention Motion**: After a **tie vote (10-10)** on whether to pass the amended bill, the committee decided to **retain the bill** for further refinement, aiming to address concerns and create a more comprehensive and bipartisan-supported piece of legislation.  
- **Public Health Concerns**: Members highlighted the **three-headed monster** of chronic pain, mental health issues, and substance abuse, emphasizing the need for **interdisciplinary approaches** and better funding for underserved populations.  
- **Drug Checking**: Some members stressed the importance of **drug checking** (e.g., fentanyl test strips) as part of harm reduction but noted legislative limitations in this area.

### **2. Senate Bill 263: Medicaid Expansion**
- **Amendment Discussion**: The committee debated an amendment to align the bill with **House Bill 2**, which extends Medicaid expansion but maintains a two-year sunset clause rather than making it permanent.  
- **Support and Opposition**: Supporters of the amendment argued it ensures continuity of care and avoids delays, while opponents, including advocates for permanent expansion, felt it did not go far enough.  
- **Amendment Outcome**: The amendment failed in a **10-10 vote**, and the bill will proceed to the House floor without a committee recommendation.  
- **Sustainability Concerns**: Members raised concerns about the rising costs of Medicaid expansion and the need for ongoing evaluation to ensure sustainability.

### **3. Senate Bill 240: Genetic Testing, Patient Consent, and Data Use**
- **Amendments Proposed**: Representative Weber introduced two amendments to clarify the bill. The first (1718) emphasized **written patient consent** for disclosing genetic data for clinical care or research, while the second (1719) separated **personal care** from **research** to address privacy and ownership concerns.  
- **Patient Consent**: The subcommittee stressed the importance of **clear, specific consent** for genetic data use, ensuring consent forms are explicit and not buried in lengthy documents.  
- **Clinical Care vs. Research**: While there was consensus on allowing genetic data sharing for **clinical care**, concerns were raised about the **research** component, particularly around **de-identified data** and **retrospective studies**. The group considered splitting the bill to focus on clinical care first and address research separately.  
- **Privacy and Data Sharing**: Members discussed balancing **patient privacy** with the need to share genetic data with **clinical partners** (e.g., labs, software companies) for treatment. Concerns were raised about broadening permissions too much, especially regarding **HIPAA business associates** and insurance companies.  
- **Dartmouth Health Perspective**: Representatives from Dartmouth Health highlighted the importance of genetic data sharing for **clinical trials**, particularly in cancer treatment, and the need for systems to match patients with appropriate trials while ensuring consent.  
- **De-Identified Data**: The subcommittee considered allowing the use of **de-identified data** for research, which would not require patient consent, as a less controversial approach.  
- **Next Steps**: The subcommittee leaned toward focusing on **clinical care** in the current bill and deferring the **research** component to a future bill, aiming to clarify language around patient consent and data sharing for clinical purposes.

### **4. Retained Bills and Other Business**
- **Retained Bills**: The committee discussed plans to address 12 retained bills, with a preference for forming subcommittees to work on them transparently and involve stakeholders. Members were encouraged to identify areas of interest and begin work in June to prepare for the next legislative session.  
- **Executive Session**: The committee agreed to skip the next weekâ€™s executive session to allow more time for subcommittee work on **Senate Bill 240**.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with members expressing a desire to move forward efficiently while ensuring thorough consideration of the issues at hand. Key decisions included retaining **Senate Bill 239** for further refinement, proceeding with **Senate Bill 263** without a recommendation, and focusing **Senate Bill 240** on clinical care while deferring research-related provisions. The committee emphasized the importance of addressing urgent healthcare needs, ensuring patient consent, and balancing privacy with the necessity of data sharing for public health and treatment.
