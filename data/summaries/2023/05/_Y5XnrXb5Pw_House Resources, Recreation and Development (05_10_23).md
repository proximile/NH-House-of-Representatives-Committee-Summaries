**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee Meeting (05/10/23)**

On May 10, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened to address procedural matters and deliberate on **Senate Bill 11**, which focuses on the respectful treatment of African-American burial grounds and remains. The meeting highlighted both the procedural intricacies of legislative decision-making and the committee’s commitment to addressing historical injustices.

### Procedural Discussions
The session began with debates over procedural details, including the timing of a vote. Some representatives advocated for a 10-minute voting window to accommodate Hillsborough County representatives attending a convention, but the committee ultimately agreed to hold the vote at 9 o'clock. Additionally, concerns were raised about **Darby’s Amendment**, which had not been discussed in the open session despite prior support for **McHugh’s Amendment**. It was clarified that Darby’s Amendment had been addressed in caucus meetings, so it was not revisited during this session.

The committee emphasized that the meeting was a work session, allowing for the possibility of introducing additional amendments later. Members were reminded to honor agreements made during the session. A veteran representative reflected on the legislative process, noting that while it can be messy, it is an essential part of "how the sausage is made."

### Senate Bill 11: African-American Burial Grounds and Remains
The primary focus of the meeting was **Senate Bill 11**, which seeks to ensure the respectful treatment of African-American burial grounds and remains, particularly those of enslaved individuals who were often buried without proper recognition or documentation. The discussion centered on resolving disagreements over proposed amendments and determining the best path forward for the bill.

#### Key Points of Debate
1. **Amendments**: Significant debate arose between Representatives McHugh and Darby regarding proposed amendments. McHugh’s amendment was seen as closely aligning with the bill’s intent, while Darby expressed concerns about the co-mingling of language with federal statutes (NAGPRA) and the treatment of remains from private collections.  
2. **Subcommittee Proposal**: The chair proposed forming a subcommittee to resolve differences and craft a bipartisan amendment. While some members supported this approach, others believed the full committee could address the issues without delay.  
3. **Policy Statement**: A policy statement in the original bill was removed during drafting, which some members felt was important for legislative intent. However, it was noted that such statements are often considered superfluous in statute.  

#### Consensus and Next Steps
After reviewing the amendments, the committee reached a consensus to support McHugh’s amendment (1597h) as written. A straw vote showed unanimous support among members present. The committee planned to schedule an executive session the following week to formally vote on the amendment, with the goal of passing a bill that honors the dignity of African-American remains and burial grounds while ensuring it moves smoothly through the legislative process.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the committee’s dedication to addressing historical injustices and ensuring the respectful treatment of African-American burial sites. It also highlighted the procedural challenges and behind-the-scenes negotiations inherent in legislative decision-making. By fostering bipartisan collaboration, the committee worked toward a resolution that would honor the past while navigating the complexities of the legislative process.
