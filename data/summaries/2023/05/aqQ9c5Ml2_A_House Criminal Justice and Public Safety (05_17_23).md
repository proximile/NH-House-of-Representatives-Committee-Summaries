### **Senate Bill 14: Regulation of Game Cameras**
**Purpose**: SB 14 focuses on the use of **game cameras** on private and public lands, aiming to regulate their placement to protect **landowner privacy** while maintaining access for hunting and recreational activities.  
**Key Provisions**:  
1. **Landowner Permission**: Hunters must obtain **landowner permission** to place game cameras on private property.  
2. **Labeling Requirements**: Cameras must be labeled with the owner’s **contact information** to facilitate communication.  
3. **Privacy Concerns**: Landowners expressed concerns about **unauthorized camera placement**, potential property damage (e.g., during timber harvesting), and **privacy violations**.  
4. **Enforcement**: Landowners are instructed to contact **law enforcement** to remove unauthorized cameras, avoiding direct confrontations or property damage.  
5. **Fair Hunting Practices**: Hunters are prohibited from harvesting game animals on the same day they view images from a game camera to uphold **ethical hunting standards**.  
**Support**: The bill received widespread support from stakeholders, including the **NH Fish and Game Department**, **Timberland Owners Association**, **Farm Bureau**, and **Wildlife Federation**. These groups emphasized its role in preserving **hunting traditions**, respecting property rights, and maintaining New Hampshire’s **open access tradition**—where 76% of forest land is privately owned.  
**Broader Implications**: Testimonies warned that without the bill, more landowners might **post their land**, restricting access for hunters and recreational users. SB 14 is seen as crucial for fostering **positive relationships** between landowners and recreational users, ensuring the continuation of New Hampshire’s **outdoor recreation economy** and **hunting heritage**.  
**Opposition**: Some raised concerns about potential **restrictions on recreational use** of game cameras and suggested further deliberation to ensure a balanced approach. Questions were also raised about the **right to privacy** on lands open to the public and the impact of **live-action cameras**.  

### **Senate Bill 15: Regulation of Tree Stands and Observation Blinds**
**Purpose**: SB 15 addresses the use of **tree stands** and **observation blinds** on private property, aiming to balance **hunter privileges** with **landowner rights**.  
**Key Provisions**:  
1. **Written Permission**: Hunters must obtain **written permission** from landowners for **permanent tree stands** (those that damage trees).  
2. **Labeling Requirements**: All tree stands and blinds must be labeled with the hunter’s **name and contact information**.  
3. **Removal Deadlines**: Equipment must be removed by **April 1** unless landowners grant permission to leave it up.  
4. **Fair Chase Principles**: Hunters are prohibited from harvesting deer within **24 hours** of viewing them on a trail camera to uphold **ethical hunting practices**.  
5. **Enforcement**: Landowners are encouraged to contact **Fish and Game** to remove unauthorized equipment to avoid legal liability or conflicts with hunters.  
**Support**: The bill emphasizes **education and communication**, with the Fish and Game Department planning to use pamphlets, websites, and public notifications to inform hunters and landowners.  
**Penalties**: Violations could result in fines, originally set at $1,000 but reduced to $125 in the Senate. The focus is on **changing behavior** rather than punishing hunters.  
**Landowner Concerns**: Landowners expressed frustration over finding cameras and tree stands on their property without their knowledge or consent.
