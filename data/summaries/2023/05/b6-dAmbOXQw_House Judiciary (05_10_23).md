### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting (May 10, 2023)

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on May 10, 2023, to discuss several legislative matters, including **Senate Bill 128** and related amendments. The meeting highlighted the complexities of the legislative process, the importance of compromise, and the ethical, fiscal, and practical considerations involved in advancing bills. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **General Legislative Process and Compromise**
The meeting began with a discussion on a bill and **Amendment 1676**, illustrating the legislative process and the need for compromise. A representative expressed a personal preference for the bill as passed by the Senate but acknowledged the necessity of compromise in a non-ideal world. Despite reservations about sections one and two of the amendment, the representative supported moving forward with it, emphasizing the importance of bipartisanship and avoiding letting "the perfect be the enemy of the less perfect." The committee voted on the amendment, which passed, followed by a vote on the main motion (OTP—Ought to Pass) as amended, which passed 17-3. A minority report was briefly discussed, with one representative volunteering to draft a statement indicating the minority’s preference for the Senate’s original version of the bill. The chair also sought input on scheduling a meeting in early June to address retained bills and thanked substitutes for their contributions.

### **Senate Bill 128: Involuntary Admissions and Legal Representation Costs**
The committee then focused on **Senate Bill 128**, which addresses the payment of legal services for individuals involuntarily committed for mental health services. The bill, as amended by the Senate, transfers payment responsibility from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to the Judicial Council and removes the requirement for non-indigent individuals to repay legal fees. Key points of discussion included:

1. **Scope and Purpose**: The bill ensures that individuals without legal counsel will have counsel appointed, with the state covering costs unless the individual can pay. It applies to both emergency and non-emergency involuntary admissions.

2. **Reimbursement Concerns**: There was debate over whether individuals who can afford legal representation should reimburse the state. Some argued for financial responsibility, while others highlighted the difficulty of assessing financial status during emergency admissions.

3. **Judicial Discretion**: Judges currently have discretion to declare someone indigent without a financial affidavit, especially in urgent cases. The bill seeks to formalize this process and ensure costs are covered by the Judicial Council or DHHS.

4. **Proposed Amendments**:
   - **Representative Smith** proposed an amendment narrowing the bill to apply only to involuntary admissions, excluding other cases.
   - **Representative Lynn** proposed an amendment providing flexibility in determining indigency and reimbursement, particularly in cases where financial status cannot be immediately determined. However, Representative Lynn withdrew his amendment in favor of Smith’s.

5. **Practical Challenges**: The committee acknowledged the logistical difficulties in assessing financial status during rapid emergency hearings and the potential burden on individuals who may struggle to pay even small legal fees.

6. **Broader Implications**: Some members argued that the state should not pursue reimbursement for legal fees in involuntary admissions, as individuals are not voluntarily seeking services. Others emphasized fairness, suggesting that those who can pay should contribute.

### **Non-Germane Amendment 2023-1482**
The committee also discussed a **non-germane amendment (2023-1482)** related to **Senate Bill 128**, sponsored by the chair. This amendment retained the repayment requirement for non-indigent individuals but sought to make the process more flexible and user-friendly. Key points included:

1. **Amendment Details**:
   - The amendment focused on **Section 2** of the bill, proposing to add a new term to RSA 604-A.
   - It allowed courts to appoint counsel if unable to determine indigency, with the Office of Cost Containment making recommendations on repayment.

2. **Opposition to the Amendment**:
   - **Karen Rosenberg** (Disability Rights Center) and **Maggie Pritchard** (Behavioral Health Association) argued that charging individuals for legal services during a mental health crisis is unfair and traumatic.
   - **Holly Stevens** (NAMI New Hampshire) emphasized that involuntary commitment is not a choice, and imposing legal fees penalizes individuals for having a mental illness.

3. **Financial Implications**:
   - **Richard Sample** (Judicial Council) expressed concerns about the financial impact on the Judicial Council, noting that collecting fees from individuals in crisis is often unsuccessful.
   - The bill’s fiscal note estimated a cost of $1.5 million, which is unfunded and could strain the Judicial Council’s budget.

4. **Fairness and Practicality**:
   - The chair argued that individuals who can afford to pay should reimburse the state, while those who cannot should not be burdened. He suggested that judges have discretion to determine indigency.
   - Opponents countered that mental health crises make it nearly impossible for individuals to engage in financial determinations, and pursuing fees could exacerbate their conditions.

### **Executive Session and Final Debate**
In the executive session, the chair defended the amendment, emphasizing fairness and the principle that non-indigent individuals should repay legal fees. He argued that the amendment provides flexibility for courts and the Office of Cost Containment to waive fees when appropriate. Critics maintained that the amendment would harm vulnerable individuals and that the focus should be on improving mental health services rather than imposing fees. The debate highlighted the tension between fiscal responsibility and the ethical treatment of individuals in mental health crises.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of balancing fiscal responsibility, fairness, and the ethical treatment of vulnerable individuals in the legislative process. The committee’s discussions on **Senate Bill 128** and its amendments reflected a commitment to ensuring access to legal representation while grappling with practical and financial challenges. The outcome of these deliberations will shape the future of mental health services and legal protections for individuals in New Hampshire.
