The New Hampshire House of Representatives' **Long Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee** meeting on **May 26, 2023**, focused on several key agenda items, including personnel requests, property easements, and the sale of state-owned assets. Here’s a summary:

1. **Personnel Requests**:
   - **Deputy Director for Behavioral Health Division**: The committee approved the creation of a new Deputy Director position within the Division of Behavioral Health, citing the need for operational oversight. The position was assigned a salary grade of GG ($79,430–$110,682).
   - **Director of Medicaid Policy and Clinical Programs**: Another new position was approved to oversee Medicaid policy and clinical programming, with a salary grade of FF ($73,580–$102,518). The committee discussed the challenges of recruiting qualified candidates but expressed confidence in the proposed salary range.
   - **Executive Director of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board**: The committee debated the salary grade for this role, with the Department recommending HH ($86,502–$125,620) and Corn Ferry recommending GG ($79,430–$110,682). The committee ultimately approved the GG grade, acknowledging the difficulty in finding qualified candidates for this specialized role.

2. **Property Easements and Sales**:
   - **Sewer Easement in Merrimack**: The committee authorized the sale of a sewer easement to the Lansing Group for $6,100, facilitating the connection of a sewer line.
   - **Access Point on Route 4, Concord**: The committee approved granting an access point through limited right-of-way to Robert and Mary Ann Wolfe for $44,100, ensuring their property remains accessible after a roundabout construction project.
   - **Maintenance Easement in Seabrook**: A maintenance easement for BJ’s Wholesale Club was approved for $2,300, allowing maintenance activities on state-owned land.
   - **York Dam and Canal Dam Sale**: The committee authorized the sale of the York Dam and associated structures to Briar Hydro Associates for $600,000.
