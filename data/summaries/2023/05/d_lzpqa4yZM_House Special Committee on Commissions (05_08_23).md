**Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (05/08/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions convened on May 8, 2023, to address the state’s legislative commissions and committees, focusing on improving their efficiency, accountability, and effectiveness. The meeting centered on reviewing existing bodies, streamlining processes, and proposing reforms to ensure these groups serve their intended purposes. Key discussions and outcomes included:

### Review and Streamlining of Commissions and Committees
1. **Assessment of Existing Bodies**: The committee emphasized the need to identify and eliminate obsolete or inactive commissions. A master list of all commissions and committees, updated since 2020, is being developed. Efforts include contacting inactive groups to determine their status and considering legislation to repeal those that are no longer functional.

2. **Proposed Reforms**: Ideas were introduced to automatically repeal commissions that have not met or filed reports in the last three years. The committee also highlighted the importance of setting clear purposes and timelines for new commissions to ensure productivity and relevance.

3. **Infrastructure and Oversight**: The committee acknowledged the lack of oversight for study commissions, which sometimes fail to produce final reports. They stressed the need for better infrastructure and processes to ensure commissions fulfill their mandates.

### Process Improvements and Framework
1. **Bill Enrollment and Reporting**: The committee addressed the time-consuming process of reviewing and preparing bills for enrollment after the legislative session. Challenges with meeting reporting deadlines, particularly the default November 1st date for many commissions, were also discussed.

2. **Drafting Legislation**: The committee invited drafting attorneys to discuss the framework for drafting legislation. They emphasized the importance of clear instructions for drafting attorneys to navigate legislative complexities. An example of a study committee on dog grooming regulations was provided to illustrate the process.

3. **Study Committees vs. Commissions**: The distinction between study committees and commissions was clarified. Study committees are temporary and often sunset after one to two years, while commissions are codified in the RSAs (Revised Statutes Annotated). Challenges with commissions, such as non-legislative members exceeding legislative members and the need for sunset provisions, were discussed.

### Committee Housekeeping and Future Steps
1. **Logistics**: Representative Fatusic addressed the absence of a committee clerk, and Representative Rambo was appointed to the role. The next two meetings were scheduled for 1 PM to accommodate members’ schedules.

2. **Future Goals**: The committee plans to prioritize creating a comprehensive compendium of all commissions and committees, along with guidelines for forming new ones. They also aim to improve communication and coordination among legislative offices to streamline processes and avoid duplication of efforts.

### Overall Focus
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency, accountability, and effectiveness of New Hampshire’s legislative commissions and committees. By reviewing existing bodies, improving processes, and implementing reforms, the committee seeks to ensure these groups fulfill their mandates and make optimal use of legislative resources.
