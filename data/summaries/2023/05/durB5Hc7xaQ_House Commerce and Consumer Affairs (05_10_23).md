The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on May 10, 2023, to discuss and vote on several Senate bills. Key highlights include:

1. **Senate Bill 235**: The subcommittee unanimously voted to retain the bill, which addresses services provided through a primary care behavioral health model. The committee supported the motion to retain, with plans to revisit the issue in the fall.

2. **Senate Bill 243**: The committee voted to deem it inexpedient to legislate, rejecting the establishment of a committee to study the implementation of a state-based health insurance exchange. The vote passed 18-0.

3. **Senate Bill 198**: The committee voted to retain the bill, which directs the Insurance Department to conduct a cost study on providing coverage for certain reproductive health care. A financial analysis will be conducted, and the issue will be revisited in September.

4. **Senate Bill 201**: The committee voted to retain the bill, which addresses the resale of event tickets. Concerns were raised about the broader implications of regulating resale practices.

5. **Senate Bill 180**: The committee voted to retain the bill, which regulates certain hemp-derived products. Members agreed that the bill needed corrections and would be revisited in the next session.

Throughout the session, the committee also addressed several other bills, including Senate Bills 21, 31, 64, 67, 82, 98, 99, 102, 142, 197, and 37. Many of these bills were deemed housekeeping measures or technical changes, with most passing unanimously or being retained for further study. The committee emphasized the importance of addressing issues at the departmental level and expressed confidence in ongoing discussions to resolve concerns. The session concluded with remarks from the chair, who praised the committee's work and looked forward to reconvening in September.
