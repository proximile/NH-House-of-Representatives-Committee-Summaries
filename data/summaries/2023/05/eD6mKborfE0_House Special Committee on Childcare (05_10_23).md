The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare convened on May 10, 2023, to discuss several bills aimed at addressing the state’s childcare crisis. The meeting focused on improving childcare access, clarifying licensing regulations, and balancing safety standards with the need to expand capacity. Key bills discussed included **SB 194**, **SB 170**, **SB 221**, and **SB 94**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key takeaways:

---

#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **SB 194: Childcare Definitions and Licensing**  
   - **Proposed Amendments**: Representative McWilliams proposed redefining "child" to include individuals under 21 or those receiving special education services. The committee agreed to review the finalized amendment before further discussion.  
   - **Focus**: The bill aims to update and clarify definitions related to childcare licensing, ensuring consistency across regulations.

2. **SB 170: Fire Codes and Childcare Licensing**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to align childcare licensing terminology with state fire and building codes to reduce confusion for providers and inspectors.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The committee debated the "magic number" of 12 children in small group daycare homes, with some advocating for flexibility up to 17 to increase capacity.  
     - Concerns were raised about grandfathering existing childcare centers (38 centers) and whether it compromises safety. State Fire Marshal Sean Toomey clarified that grandfathering is an administrative process, and all centers are inspected for fire code compliance.  
     - The bill aims to streamline licensing language and ensure inspections reflect the maximum capacity approved by fire codes.  
   - **Support**: The bill is the result of collaboration between childcare providers, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the Fire Marshal’s Office. It seeks to address childcare deserts and workforce challenges by encouraging the use of commercial spaces for childcare.  
   - **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the removal of provisions allowing additional children during school holidays and the potential loss of capacity for existing providers.

3. **SB 221: Childcare Workforce and Affordability**  
   - **Amendments**: Initially proposing a municipal property tax exemption for childcare agencies, the bill was amended to establish a study committee to examine childcare access, affordability, and workforce-related issues.  
   - **Support**: Testifiers, including representatives from the New Hampshire Women’s Foundation and Early Learning NH, emphasized the need for creative solutions to the childcare crisis, particularly in light of the significant drop in women’s workforce participation since the pandemic.  
   - **Focus**: The committee explored regulatory burdens and potential solutions, such as scholarship programs and municipal tax exemptions.

4. **SB 94: Childcare Licensing Updates**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill updates definitions and requirements for residential childcare agencies and daycare licensing.  
   - **Key Changes**:  
     - Updates terminology (e.g., "childcare nursery" to "infant and toddler program").  
     - Adds corrective action plans for non-compliant agencies during license renewal.  
     - Allows license renewal without inspection for programs not currently operating, provided fire and health approvals are met.  
     - Aligns definitions with HB 1513, extending the age of "child" to 22 for those receiving special education services.  
     - Removes the definition of "experiential wilderness facility" as a type of childcare agency.  
   - **Concerns**: Committee members raised questions about the timeline for corrective action plans and the potential impact on childcare providers.
