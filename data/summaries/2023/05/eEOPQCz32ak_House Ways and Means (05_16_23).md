### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on May 16, 2023  

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee meeting on May 16, 2023, focused on revenue projections, budget management, economic concerns, and the fiscal implications of key legislative bills. The discussions highlighted the complexities of revenue forecasting, the state’s reliance on specific tax streams, and the need for fiscal responsibility amid economic uncertainty. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered across the three segments:

---

### **1. Revenue Estimates and Budget Implications**  
- **House vs. Senate Revenue Projections**: The House and Senate had differing revenue estimates, with the Senate revising its projections upward by $184 million compared to the House. This adjustment was based on higher-than-expected collections in business taxes, meals and rentals (M&R) taxes, and other revenues through April. The House’s initial estimates were more conservative, reflecting concerns about short-term economic challenges but greater optimism in the long term.  
- **Business Taxes**: The state’s reliance on business taxes, particularly from large multinational corporations, was a key focus. While these taxes are a significant revenue source, they are concentrated among a few companies, making them vulnerable to fluctuations. The potential collapse of a major corporation could significantly impact state revenues.  
- **Meals and Rentals Tax**: M&R taxes, which fund education trust and general funds, were highlighted as a critical revenue stream. Post-pandemic pent-up demand for events like weddings and conferences has sustained higher M&R tax levels, but concerns were raised about whether this demand might taper off.  
- **Other Revenue Streams**: The committee discussed the volatility of tobacco settlement revenue, Medicaid recoveries, and utility property taxes. They also reviewed updates from the Lottery Commission and the Insurance Department.

### **2. Economic Concerns and Fiscal Management**  
- **Recession and Inflation Risks**: Representatives expressed concerns about the potential for a recession driven by Federal Reserve policies aimed at cooling inflation. Rising interest rates, inflation, and increasing credit card balances were identified as factors that could reduce consumer spending and impact state revenues, particularly from business profits taxes (BPT) and M&R taxes.  
- **New Hampshire’s Resilience**: While New Hampshire’s revenues tend to be more resilient during recessions compared to other states, they also take longer to recover. This underscores the need for careful budget management.  
- **Rainy Day Fund**: The committee emphasized the importance of the state’s rainy day fund in managing budget shortfalls during economic downturns. They discussed potential spending reductions if revenues fall short of projections.

### **3. Legislative Discussions: Senate Bill 49 and Fiscal Notes**  
- **Senate Bill 49 (OPLC Licensing Fees)**: The committee held a public hearing on SB 49, which aims to reform how licensing fees collected by the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** are managed. Key provisions include:  
  - Establishing a **non-lapsing fund** for OPLC, allowing the agency to retain up to **$3 million** for long-term planning and capital expenditures.  
  - Requiring any excess funds over $3 million to be used to reduce licensing fees for professionals.  
  - Addressing historical issues where surplus fees were lapsed into the general fund, often exceeding the **125% rule** (fees should not exceed 125% of operational costs).  
- **Challenges with Fee Structures**: The committee noted inconsistencies in fee-setting, with some professions (e.g., barbering and cosmetology) covering only 40% of their costs while others generated surpluses. SB 49 seeks to stabilize OPLC’s finances and ensure fees benefit licensees.  
- **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal note for SB 49 showed a **zero net impact** on overall revenue, as it reallocates funds rather than reducing them. However, it will reduce the amount lapsed into the general fund by $6.5–8 million.

### **4. Tax Law Changes and Fiscal Adjustments**  
- **HB2 Credit Carryover Cap**: The Senate discussed the impact of tax law changes, such as the HB2 credit carryover cap, which reduced business tax revenues by $8.5 million in FY23.  
- **Single Sales Factor Apportionment**: The potential effects of changes to the single sales factor apportionment on business taxes were also reviewed.  
- **Fiscal Notes and Budget Implications**: The committee analyzed fiscal notes for various bills, including SB 49, and discussed how higher revenue estimates could lead to adjustments in fees or expenditures in future budgets.  

---

### **5. Future Outlook and Next Steps**  
- **Upcoming Revenue Reports**: The committee planned to reconvene for further discussions after the Senate finalizes its budget proposals. May and June revenue reports were anticipated, with June being a critical month for revenue collection.  
- **Broader Legislative Context**: SB 49 is part of a broader effort to reform OPLC’s structure and fee-setting process, including **House Bill 355**, which has already passed the House. The committee emphasized the need for alignment between SB 49 and other OPLC reforms.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the importance of accurate revenue forecasting, proactive budget management, and legislative reforms to address fiscal challenges. The discussions reflected concerns about economic uncertainty, the state’s reliance on volatile revenue streams, and the need to ensure that fees and taxes are used effectively to benefit residents and businesses. The committee’s focus on SB 49 highlighted efforts to improve transparency and accountability in state finances, particularly in managing licensing fees and ensuring fiscal stability for OPLC.
