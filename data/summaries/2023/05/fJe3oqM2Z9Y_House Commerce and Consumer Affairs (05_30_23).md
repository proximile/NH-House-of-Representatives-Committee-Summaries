**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (May 30, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on May 30, 2023, to discuss several key legislative issues, with a primary focus on **cannabis legalization**, **mental health insurance coverage**, and procedural updates on related bills. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The committee engaged in extensive debates on the complexities of cannabis legalization, highlighting both policy and procedural challenges:

1. **Policy Debates**:
   - Members discussed the **conflict between legalizing cannabis sales while maintaining possession as a crime**, with concerns raised about the committee’s jurisdiction, as criminal justice matters fall outside its purview.
   - A **state-controlled cannabis market** model, similar to New Hampshire’s liquor sales system, was proposed in **Senate Bill 98**. This model would operate through **agency stores**, allowing private businesses to sell cannabis under state regulation.
   - There was **opposition to the agency store model**, with some members advocating for a **private enterprise approach**, as outlined in the previously proposed **HB 639**, which included a 12.5% tax on cannabis sales.
   - Concerns were raised about **contradictions in the bill’s language**, particularly regarding the role of **Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs)** and the distribution process from growers to stores.

2. **Social Justice Implications**:
   - Members emphasized the **social justice aspects** of cannabis legalization, noting that arrests for possession continue despite widespread public support for legalization.
   - Some members argued for **decriminalizing possession entirely**, while others supported **possession limits** (e.g., four ounces) as a political compromise.
   - There was a suggestion to **separate the legalization of possession** from the regulation of sales to expedite progress on stopping arrests while addressing sales and distribution separately.

3. **Procedural Challenges**:
   - The committee considered **retaining the bill** until September to address unresolved issues, with a **straw poll** indicating that many members would support the bill if the language regarding agency stores and ATCs was clarified.
   - Skepticism was expressed about the success of a **floor amendment** for legalization, particularly in the Senate.

### **Mental Health Insurance Coverage (Senate Bill 85)**
The committee also discussed amendments to **Senate Bill 85**, which focuses on mental health insurance coverage:

1. **Key Amendments**:
   - The amendment aims to **eliminate the requirement for pre-authorization** from insurance companies for mental health services, reinforcing **mental health parity** under existing law.
   - It specifically seeks to ensure that individuals in a mental health crisis, such as those utilizing the **988 hotline** and **mobile crisis teams**, can receive care without insurance pre-approval.

2. **Study Committee Proposal**:
   - There was a discussion about whether the amendment should include a **study committee** to explore funding and implementation for these services.

3. **Committee Approval**:
   - The committee approved the amendment, adding a representative from the New Hampshire Psychological Association to a commission, and placed the bill on the **consent calendar** for further consideration.

### **Bill Status Updates**
The committee provided updates on the status of several bills:

1. **HB 360 (Marijuana Decriminalization)**:
   - This bill, which sought to decriminalize marijuana, had previously been **voted down** in both the House and Senate, with the Senate laying it on the table unanimously.
   - The committee decided to **set aside discussions** on this bill for the time being.

2. **Senate Bill 98**:
   - The committee voted to send SB 98, which raises reporting requirements for on-premise liquor licensees, to the House floor **unamended**, leaving it on the regular calendar for potential floor amendments.

3. **HB 544**:
   - Members highlighted the need for further work on **retained bills**, such as HB 544, to address unresolved issues.
