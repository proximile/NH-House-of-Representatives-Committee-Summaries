The NH House of Representatives meeting on May 3, 2023, focused on a range of education-related topics, including the review of several bills and the allocation of federal Title II grants. Here is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the session:

### **Legislative Bills**
1. **Senate Bill 213**: The committee debated amendments to this bill, which addresses the use of social media platforms in Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. Concerns about data privacy, student safety, and the appropriateness of social media for educational purposes were raised, particularly regarding platforms like LinkedIn. The committee postponed final action pending further review of the amendments.

2. **Senate Bill 218**: This bill, which proposes a $500,000 state-funded grant program to match Title II funds for early educator professional development, was retained. Committee members sought additional clarification on the bill’s wording, particularly whether state funds must be spent before accessing Title II funds, and raised concerns about the sustainability of mentorship programs.

3. **Senate Bill 266**: Due to its complexity, this bill, which addresses various aspects of education law, was retained for further review. The committee acknowledged the need for additional work sessions to thoroughly examine its provisions.

4. **House Bill 550**: The committee concurred with the Senate’s minor amendment to this bill, which deals with charter public school dissolution, and saw no need for further negotiation.

### **Title II Grants**
The meeting also focused on the allocation and utilization of Title II grants, federal funds designated for educator professional development and mentorship programs. Key points included:

- **Grant Overview**: Title II grants are 27-month funds allocated to school districts for mentorship, professional development, and support for new or transitioning educators. Current grants cover the 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24 school years, with annual amounts ranging from $9.5 to $9.8 million. Unspent funds are returned to the federal government.

- **Challenges with Spending**: As of the meeting, $2.7 million remained unspent for the 2021-22 grant, which expires on September 30, 2023. Additionally, $900,000 for the 2022-23 grant had not yet been budgeted, raising concerns about inefficient fund utilization.

- **Allocation and Distribution**: Funds are distributed based on a federal formula considering census poverty data and Title I student populations. For example, Manchester receives $1.375 million, the largest allocation due to its size and student demographics.

- **Mentorship Programs**: Mentorship initiatives, including a $469,000 virtual mentoring contract with Teach United, were highlighted as valuable for rural and small schools. These programs connect educators across districts to address common challenges and improve professional learning communities.

- **Accountability and Monitoring**: The Department of Education monitors fund usage through initial reviews, monthly reports, and compliance checks. Districts must justify expenditures and provide evidence of program implementation.

### **Debate and Concerns**
Representatives debated the practicality of proposed legislation, particularly Bill 218, questioning whether it would create administrative burdens or hinder access to Title II funds. Suggestions were made to revise the bill’s language to clarify fund usage and ensure alignment with federal requirements.

### **Upcoming Plans**
The committee discussed scheduling future meetings and the possibility of a social gathering to mark the end of the legislative session. They noted that there would be no meetings in July or August, with work on retained bills continuing in September, October, and November.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of managing federal and state education funds, the importance of mentorship programs in supporting educators, and the need for efficient spending. While the committee concurred with Senate amendments on some bills, others were retained for further review and refinement to ensure clarity and effectiveness.
