**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Administrative Rules Committee Meeting (May 19, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Administrative Rules Committee convened on May 19, 2023, to address a range of administrative rule proposals, focusing on eviction processes, procedural efficiency, and compliance with state and federal laws. The meeting highlighted key debates, approvals, and postponements across various departments and issues. Here is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

---

### **Eviction Process and Due Process Protections**
The committee extensively debated proposed changes to eviction processes, particularly for tenants with developmental disabilities or brain injuries. Key concerns and outcomes included:

1. **Faster Eviction Timeline**: The proposed rules would allow eviction within six days for tenants accused of causing substantial property damage or harm to others, bypassing standard landlord-tenant law procedures. This raised significant concerns about due process, as tenants would not have the opportunity to remain housed during an appeal.

2. **Balancing Rights**: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) argued that the rules are necessary to protect other residents and providers in shared housing, especially when a tenantâ€™s behavior poses a risk. HHS emphasized that alternative housing would be secured for evicted tenants to prevent homelessness.

3. **Allegations and Judicial Review**: Critics, including Representative Rosenberg, highlighted that evictions could be based on allegations without judicial review, potentially depriving tenants of due process. Concerns were also raised about the lack of a clear process to verify the validity of allegations.

4. **Comparison to Other States**: Committee members expressed interest in understanding how other states handle similar situations, particularly whether they provide comparable protections or faster eviction timelines for tenants in specialized housing.

5. **Postponement and Data Request**: The committee voted to grant a waiver on timelines, postpone the decision until the next meeting, and request data from HHS on how other states address these issues.

### **Procedural and Efficiency Concerns**
The meeting began with procedural reminders and efficiency considerations:

1. **Quorum and Transcripts**: The chair emphasized the need for efficiency due to potential quorum issues after 10 AM. The court stenographer was absent, so the transcript would be prepared later using minutes and video recordings.

2. **Agenda Discrepancies**: Members noted discrepancies between the printed agenda and the online committee packet. The printed agenda was confirmed as correct, but structural changes to the packet could disrupt the meeting flow.

### **Department-Specific Rule Reviews**
The committee reviewed and acted on several administrative rule proposals:

1. **Fish and Game Rules**: The committee clarified that it is not a policy committee and will not hear testimony on policy matters. Public comments were considered, but the department is not required to incorporate them.

2. **Department of Safety Rules**: Motor carrier safety regulations were discussed, with concerns raised about the constitutionality of automatically adopting federal rule changes without further approval.

3. **State Police Tow List Rules**: Emergency rules for the State Police tow list, set to expire in July, were conditionally approved with amendments.

4. **Telehealth Services**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) presented rules for telehealth services. A redundant paragraph was removed, and the rules were approved.

5. **Child Care Scholarship Program**: DHHS addressed compliance issues with federal child care regulations, particularly the definition of "relative" for monitoring purposes. The rules were approved, and the agency was asked to consider requesting a federal waiver.

6. **Allied Health Professionals**: Fee-setting authority for allied health professionals, which conflicts with the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) rules, was postponed pending further legislative action.

7. **Developmental Services**: Rules for developmental services were reviewed, addressing public testimony and making amendments. A preliminary objection was raised regarding due process protections for individuals in residential programs, but the rules were ultimately approved with editorial corrections.

### **Consent Agenda and Postponements**
Several items, including driver licensing rules and tax and land appeals proposals, were postponed. The consent agenda was approved without objections.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the committee adjourning after addressing these key agenda items. The committee emphasized the importance of clarity, compliance with federal and state laws, and the need for efficient rulemaking processes. The eviction rules will be revisited in the next session, pending additional data from HHS on how other states handle similar issues.
