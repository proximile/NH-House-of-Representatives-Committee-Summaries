**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (05/02/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on May 2, 2023, to address systemic issues within the family court system, focusing on procedural irregularities, constitutional concerns, and the need for reform. The meeting, chaired by Representative Mark Pearson, brought together legislators, stakeholders, and individuals with personal experiences in the family court system to discuss challenges and propose solutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Committee**
The committee was established to investigate alleged irregularities in the Family Division, including failures to follow statutes, court rules, and procedural guidelines. Its goal is to recommend legislative changes to improve the system. The committee clarified that it would not retry individual cases or review court decisions but would focus on procedural issues and systemic flaws. Presentations from stakeholders, including the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), Guardians ad Litem (GALs), and legal assistance organizations, were scheduled for future meetings.

### **2. Constitutional Concerns and Due Process**
Several speakers raised significant constitutional issues within the family court system:
- **Protection Orders**: RSA 173b, which governs protection orders, was criticized for requiring accusations of a crime without proper due process. Speakers argued that protective orders are often issued based on hearsay or unverified claims, curtailing due process rights.
- **Post-Conviction Therapy**: One individual shared his experience of being ordered to undergo therapy despite never being charged with a crime, arguing that this practice violates Fifth Amendment rights.
- **Judicial Discretion**: Concerns were raised about judges making broad equitable orders without statutory authority, potentially overstepping their role.

---

### **3. Custody and Parental Rights**
Speakers, including Dale Savoy, highlighted biases in custody decisions, alleging that the system favors mothers over fathers without sufficient evidence. They pointed out that New Hampshire does not track data on outcomes for children in single-mother homes, despite national statistics showing negative impacts. Additionally, judges rarely inquire about children’s well-being during custody proceedings, raising questions about the prioritization of children’s best interests.

---

### **4. Systemic Issues in the Family Court System**
The committee identified several systemic flaws:
- **Lack of Transparency and Accountability**: The family court system was criticized for its opaque processes and lack of oversight, particularly in cases involving DCYF and GALs.
- **Failure to Follow Statutory Guidelines**: Speakers alleged that courts often fail to adhere to statutory requirements, leading to inconsistent and potentially unjust outcomes.
- **Judicial Overreach**: Judges were accused of trying to solve cases rather than decide them, leading to problematic outcomes and overreach.

---

### **5. Role of Guardians ad Litem (GALs)**
GALs, who are appointed to represent the best interests of children in family court cases, were a major focus of discussion:
- **Conflicts of Interest**: Concerns were raised about GALs and judges having close personal relationships, which were not disclosed in cases, leading to allegations of bias and financial gain.
- **Lack of Oversight**: GALs operate with little oversight, and their recommendations, including the selection of therapists, can lead to biased outcomes.
- **Financial Barriers**: Since 2008, the state has stopped funding GALs in divorce and parenting cases, creating financial barriers for families who cannot afford them. This has resulted in fewer GAL appointments, even in cases where they may be necessary.

### **6. Challenges in Child Protection and Family Treatment Courts**
Joe Rips, Director of DCYF, provided an overview of the child protection system, emphasizing the shift toward voluntary services and prevention efforts to reduce court interventions. Challenges include limited access to judge time, insufficient specialized parent attorneys, and the need for more resources to support families. Family treatment courts, which are being piloted in Sullivan County, were highlighted as a potential solution to improve outcomes for families dealing with substance abuse. However, resource limitations hinder their replication in other courts.

---

### **7. Calls for Reform**
Speakers and committee members proposed several reforms to address the identified issues:
- **Improved Oversight**: Stricter oversight of DCYF, GALs, and judges, including mandatory disclosures of conflicts of interest and adherence to constitutional rights.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Greater transparency in court proceedings and decision-making processes.
- **Data Collection**: The collection of data on custody outcomes and the impact of family court decisions on children and families.
- **Legislative Changes**: Revisiting the structure of family courts, which were moved from constitutionally established superior courts to statutorily created circuit courts, limiting their equitable powers.

---

### **8. Next Steps**
The committee discussed the need for further research and analysis, including reviewing court transcripts and consulting legal experts to better understand the constitutional and statutory issues raised. Committee members were assigned homework to review specific cases and evidence. Future meetings will include a field trip to observe Family Court proceedings and presentations from stakeholders.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored deep concerns about the fairness, transparency, and effectiveness of the family court system in New Hampshire. Issues such as constitutional violations, systemic biases, and lack of oversight were highlighted, with strong calls for legislative and procedural reforms to protect the rights of all parties, especially children. The committee’s work aims to address these challenges and improve outcomes for families navigating the family court system.
