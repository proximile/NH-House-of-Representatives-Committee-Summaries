### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Housing Meeting (05/15/23)

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing convened on May 15, 2023, to address the state’s housing crisis, focusing on affordability, accessibility, regulatory barriers, and innovative solutions. The meeting featured expert testimony, case studies, and discussions on zoning, funding, and fair housing practices. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and insights from the meeting:

---

### **1. Affordable Housing Challenges and Solutions**
- **Housing Costs and Development Barriers**: High land costs, development fees, and stringent regulations have made it difficult to produce affordable housing. Developers often prioritize high-end "McMansions" over affordable single-family homes, exacerbating the housing shortage for lower-income residents.
- **Manufactured Housing and Resident-Owned Communities (ROCs)**:
  - Manufactured homes are the most affordable housing option in New Hampshire, often cheaper than renting. However, rising costs threaten this affordability.
  - ROCs, where residents collectively own the land under their homes, are a successful model for preserving affordability. New Hampshire has 146 ROCs, housing nearly 9,000 households. ROCs provide stability, with rent increases averaging less than 1% annually, compared to investor-owned communities that often displace residents with steep rent increases.
  - The New Hampshire Community Loan Fund plays a critical role in financing ROCs and providing technical assistance.
- **Zoning and Regulatory Barriers**: Zoning laws and minimum lot sizes are significant obstacles to affordable housing development. Many towns restrict or prohibit manufactured housing, despite state law requiring its allowance where single-family homes are permitted. NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard) further hinders new developments.
- **Innovative Partnerships**: Organizations like New Hampshire Housing and CDFA support down payment assistance and infrastructure improvements. Case studies, such as the Woodbury Cooperative in Portsmouth, demonstrate the potential of ROCs to provide affordable homeownership opportunities.

### **2. Regulatory and Policy Reforms**
- **Planning and Density**: Experts emphasized the need for better planning and higher-density housing to reduce costs and increase affordability. Small lot sizes and multi-family housing have historically worked in New Hampshire but are often blocked by local regulations.
- **Building Codes and Impact Fees**: Current building codes and regulations are overly restrictive, particularly for rehabilitating older buildings. Impact fees, which can reach $24,000 per unit, further inflate housing costs. Relaxing codes for pre-1950 buildings and waiving fees for affordable housing projects were proposed as solutions.
- **Incentives vs. Mandates**: While incentives for municipalities to build housing have had limited success, stronger measures, such as tying state aid to housing production, were suggested to encourage development.
- **Exclusionary Zoning**: Zoning practices that disproportionately impact low-income or minority groups were criticized. While zoning based on protected classes (e.g., race, national origin) is illegal, zoning that affects affordability without explicit discrimination remains a challenge.

### **3. Fair Housing and Accessibility**
- **Housing Discrimination**: The New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights enforces anti-discrimination laws in housing, employment, and public accommodations. Protected classes include age, sex, race, disability, and familial status. Exceptions exist for owner-occupied properties with three or fewer units, senior housing, and single-family homes sold without a broker.
- **Source of Income Discrimination**: While neither NH nor federal law explicitly protects against source of income discrimination (e.g., Section 8 vouchers), court cases have found it can disproportionately affect protected classes.
- **Accessibility**: Accessibility for individuals with disabilities remains a concern, with calls for reasonable accommodations (e.g., wheelchair ramps) and modifications in housing.
- **Senior Housing**: Rules for 55+ communities allow up to 20% of residents to be under 55, with exceptions for caretakers.

---

### **4. Federal and State Housing Programs**
- **HUD Programs**: HUD funds housing programs like Section 8 vouchers and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) through state agencies, non-profits, and housing authorities. Entitlement communities (e.g., Manchester, Nashua) receive direct funding, while non-entitlement communities are funded through the state.
- **Inspection Standards**: The committee discussed streamlining inspections for Section 8 housing by aligning federal, state, and local standards. Redundant inspections were identified as a barrier to efficiency.
- **Moving to Work Program**: The Keene Housing Authority’s model, which sold housing to a nonprofit managed by the same board, was highlighted as an innovative approach to reinvesting in affordable housing without HUD funding.

### **5. Legislative and Policy Recommendations**
- **Protecting ROCs**: The committee was urged to strengthen laws supporting ROCs, such as the opportunity-to-purchase law, and address zoning barriers to new affordable housing developments.
- **Comprehensive Reform**: Experts called for a multifaceted approach, including better planning, increased density, regulatory flexibility, and public-private collaboration. The private sector needs the right tools to address the housing crisis, as government efforts alone are insufficient.
- **Historical Context**: The committee acknowledged the historical use of zoning to exclude certain populations and emphasized the need to challenge modern practices that disproportionately impact low-income or minority groups.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s housing crisis and the need for comprehensive solutions. Key priorities include preserving and expanding affordable housing models like ROCs, addressing regulatory and zoning barriers, ensuring fair housing practices, and fostering collaboration between federal, state, and local entities. Legislative action and innovative policies will be essential to create a more equitable and accessible housing market in the state.
