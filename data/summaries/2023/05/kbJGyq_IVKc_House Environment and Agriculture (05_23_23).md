**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting on May 23, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on May 23, 2023, to address critical environmental and agricultural issues, with a particular focus on PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, wastewater management, agricultural practices, and landfill siting regulations. The meeting was divided into three segments, each addressing distinct but interconnected topics.

### **Segment 1: PFAS Contamination, Wastewater Management, and Agricultural Practices**

The first segment centered on PFAS contamination and its implications for wastewater systems, agriculture, and public health. Key discussions included:

1. **PFAS in Toilet Paper**: A representative raised concerns about PFAS in toilet paper, citing a recent article. They proposed a study to analyze toilet paper from New Hampshire stores to assess potential mass loading of PFAS into wastewater systems, particularly in households with children.

2. **Wastewater Treatment Technologies**: Electrocoagulation was highlighted as a promising technology for wastewater treatment, though concerns were raised about its sustainability and scalability, including the availability of raw materials like iron and aluminum plates.

3. **Biosolids in Agriculture**: The use of biosolids (treated sewage sludge) in agriculture was discussed, with a focus on the potential for PFAS to leach into crops. It was noted that biosolids are primarily used for animal feed crops due to consumer concerns. Collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and USDA was emphasized for further investigation.

4. **Compost and PFAS**: The committee explored PFAS levels in compost, particularly food waste compost, which appears to have lower PFAS concentrations compared to biosolids. Further investigation into compost and other agricultural inputs like manure and herbicides was suggested.

5. **Landfill Leachate**: The handling of landfill leachate, which can contain PFAS, was another critical topic. Wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove emerging contaminants like PFAS, leading to concerns about their accumulation in sludge and effluent. Funding is available for wastewater facilities to explore treatment systems for leachate.

6. **Legislative and Technological Solutions**: Representatives expressed interest in legislation to better manage PFAS and other contaminants, including labeling requirements for PFAS in consumer products. The potential for private sector solutions and new technologies to address these issues was also discussed.

7. **Public Health and Environmental Protection**: The importance of protecting New Hampshire's water resources and public health from PFAS contamination was a recurring theme. The committee acknowledged the need for ongoing research, funding, and collaboration with various agencies to address these complex issues.

8. **Committee Wrap-Up**: The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the committee's work and plans to reconvene in the fall to discuss retained bills.

### **Segment 2: Soil PFAS Contamination and Biosolids Management**

The second segment focused on updates regarding soil PFAS contamination and biosolids management, with presentations from Jeff Martz, administrator of the Hazardous Waste Remediation Bureau at DES, and Anthony Drouin, supervisor of the Residuals Management Section at DES.

1. **Soil PFAS Contamination**: Martz provided an overview of a three-part study conducted with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to characterize PFAS in shallow soils, assess leaching factors, and evaluate PFAS transport at contaminated sites. Key findings included higher PFAS concentrations in the southern part of the state and minimal presence of PFAS precursors in New Hampshire soils. Martz emphasized the complexity of PFAS behavior in the environment and the need for protective groundwater standards.

2. **Biosolids Management**: Drouin discussed the state’s efforts to regulate biosolids, septage, and leachate, including annual management volumes and ongoing investigations into PFAS contamination in wastewater systems. He highlighted the significant role of residential contributions to PFAS in wastewater, noting that household products like cleaning agents and personal care items are major sources.

3. **Emerging Technologies**: Drouin outlined future strategies for sludge management, including emerging technologies like pyrolysis, gasification, and electrocoagulation, which could potentially destroy PFAS in sludge. He stressed the need for additional management outlets as land application of biosolids faces increasing restrictions.

4. **Questions and Concerns**: Representatives raised questions about PFAS in school cleaning products, food packaging, and the need for further research into PFAS exposure pathways. Both Martz and Drouin underscored the importance of continued investigation and regulation to address PFAS contamination and protect public health and the environment.

### **Segment 3: SB 61 – Landfill Siting Rules and Environmental Protections**

The final segment focused on **SB 61**, a bill concerning landfill siting rules and environmental protections. Key points included:

1. **Amendments and Discussions**: Two amendments were proposed: **Amendment 2023-1979h** by Representative Bixby and **Amendment 2023-1980h** by Representative Potenza. Bixby’s amendment aimed to incorporate feedback from stakeholders and address issues like conflict of interest, consultant hiring, and rulemaking timelines. It passed **11-9**. Potenza’s amendment sought to strengthen language around safety margins, variability in site testing, and rulemaking oversight but was not adopted due to potential conflicts with Bixby’s amendment.

2. **Key Concerns**: Representatives debated the adequacy of the bill in protecting groundwater and public health. Some argued the bill was weakened by political pressure and industry influence, particularly from Casella, a waste management company. Concerns were raised about the open-ended nature of rulemaking extensions and the lack of language addressing variability in site testing.

3. **Votes and Outcomes**: The committee voted to pass SB 61 with Bixby’s amendment (**11-9**), but several members expressed dissatisfaction, citing the bill’s failure to meet necessary environmental safeguards. Representatives highlighted the importance of a **24-month moratorium** on landfill siting to allow for better rulemaking but lamented the bill’s shortcomings.

4. **Next Steps**: A subcommittee was proposed to oversee the rulemaking process. Representatives Bixby and Haskins were tasked with writing the **majority** and **minority reports**, respectively, for the bill.

5. **Presentation by DES**: The meeting concluded with plans for a presentation by the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** on related environmental issues.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the multifaceted challenges of managing PFAS contamination, wastewater, and landfill siting in New Hampshire. The discussions highlighted the need for comprehensive strategies involving research, technology, legislation, and interagency collaboration to protect public health and the environment. The committee’s work on these issues will continue, with plans to reconvene in the fall to further address retained bills and emerging concerns.
