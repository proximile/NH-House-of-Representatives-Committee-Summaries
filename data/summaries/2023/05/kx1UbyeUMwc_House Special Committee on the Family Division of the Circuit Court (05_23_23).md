**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court (May 23, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a special committee on May 23, 2023, to address systemic issues within the Family Division of the Circuit Court. The meeting focused on allegations of irregularities, inefficiencies, and inequities in the court’s handling of family law matters, including child custody, protective orders, abuse and neglect cases, and the role of guardians ad litem (GALs). The committee emphasized the need for transparency, accountability, and procedural reforms to ensure fair and just outcomes for all parties involved. Key themes and discussions from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **1. Systemic Challenges in the Family Court**
The committee highlighted widespread concerns about the Family Division’s operations, including:
- **Lack of Due Process**: Testimonies revealed instances of biased judicial decisions, abrupt hearings, and insufficient adherence to statutory requirements.
- **Overburdened Judges**: Judges face excessive caseloads, leading to delays and rushed decisions, particularly in abuse and neglect cases.
- **Documentation and Verification**: Members stressed the importance of verifying claims with specific documentation to ensure accurate and fair conclusions in cases involving allegations of impropriety.

### **2. Guardians ad Litem (GALs)**
The role and conduct of GALs were a focal point of discussion:
- **Exceeding Mandates**: Concerns were raised about GALs exceeding their mandated hours and fees without proper oversight.
- **Influence on Decisions**: Despite guidelines prohibiting GALs from making recommendations to judges, this practice persists, potentially influencing court outcomes.
- **Conflicts of Interest and Financial Burden**: Testimonies highlighted instances of perceived bias and the financial strain GALs impose on families.

### **3. Domestic Violence and Protective Orders**
The committee heard personal accounts of unfair treatment in domestic violence cases:
- **Unjust Labeling**: Individuals shared stories of being wrongly labeled as domestic violence perpetrators, resulting in the loss of property, custody rights, and livelihoods.
- **Lack of Due Process**: The process of obtaining and extending protective orders was criticized for lacking thorough review and procedural fairness.

### **4. Abuse and Neglect Cases**
The handling of abuse and neglect cases was scrutinized, with specific concerns raised about:
- **Delays and Permanency**: Cases often face significant delays, leaving children in uncertain situations. Better permanency planning was emphasized as a critical need.
- **Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF)**: Testimonies questioned DCYF’s adherence to statutory requirements and court orders.
- **Legal Representation for Children**: New Hampshire is one of only 14 states that do not provide legal representation for children in abuse and neglect cases. Advocates called for legislative changes to ensure children have legal advocates, citing research that shows better outcomes and faster permanency when children are represented.

### **5. Judicial Appointments and Training**
The committee discussed the need for improved judicial training and appointments:
- **Lack of Experience**: Judges often lack prior experience in handling abuse and neglect cases, necessitating extensive training.
- **Ongoing Education**: Newly appointed judges receive comprehensive training, including court observation and debriefing sessions, with ongoing education to ensure adherence to best practices and legal requirements.

### **6. Court Improvement Project (CIP)**
The New Hampshire Court Improvement Project (CIP), a federally funded initiative, was highlighted for its efforts to improve child welfare outcomes:
- **Standardized Protocols**: The CIP has developed protocols and forms to standardize practices in abuse and neglect cases, ensuring consistent procedures across the state.
- **Legal Representation**: The CIP supports legal representation for parents, children, and child welfare agencies, including training programs for parent attorneys and law students.
