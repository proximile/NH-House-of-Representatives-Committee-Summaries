**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (May 30, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on May 30, 2023, focused on several key education-related issues, with a significant portion of the discussion centered on the **Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)** and its role in high school graduation requirements. The meeting also addressed broader themes of local control, student pathways, funding, and safety in education. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points and debates:

---

### **FAFSA and Graduation Requirements**
1. **Debate on Mandatory FAFSA Completion**:
   - The committee discussed whether completing the FAFSA or signing a waiver should be a mandatory requirement for high school graduation. Current law requires students to complete the FAFSA, sign a waiver, or have the principal attest that the school made a good faith effort to inform the student about FAFSA.
   - **Arguments Against the Mandate**:
     - **Privacy Concerns**: Families are required to share financial information with the federal government, which some view as intrusive.
     - **Burden on Schools**: Superintendents and representatives argued that enforcing the requirement places an administrative burden on schools, especially when chasing non-compliant families.
     - **Local Control**: Many emphasized that the mandate infringes on local control, as schools already provide counseling and resources for post-secondary planning.
     - **Alternative Pathways**: Students pursuing careers in trades, military service, or apprenticeships may not need FAFSA, making the requirement unnecessary.
   - **Arguments in Favor of the Mandate**:
     - **Pro-Business and Pro-Family**: Completing the FAFSA increases access to financial aid, reduces college debt, and promotes post-secondary education, which is essential for workforce development.
     - **Evidence-Based Policy**: States like Louisiana and Alabama have seen higher FAFSA completion and college attendance rates after implementing similar laws.
     - **Simplified Process**: The federal government has streamlined the FAFSA, reducing it to 25 questions with financial data pulled directly from the IRS.

2. **Amendment Proposals**:
   - **Amendment 1744h**: Proposed allowing students to graduate if their district achieved an 80% FAFSA completion rate, provided the student met all other graduation requirements. This amendment was not approved.
   - **Amendment 1396h**: Sought to remove the FAFSA requirement entirely, arguing that students should not be penalized for not completing the FAFSA if they meet other graduation criteria. This amendment gained significant support, particularly from superintendents who signed a letter advocating for local control.

3. **Focus on Information, Not Mandates**:
   - Representative Ladd introduced an amendment (2023-1744h) to shift the focus from mandating FAFSA completion to requiring schools to inform students and families about FAFSA and other post-secondary options. This approach aimed to balance the state’s interest in increasing FAFSA completion with local control and parental responsibility.

### **Local Control and Student Pathways**
1. **Emphasis on Local Autonomy**:
   - Representatives and superintendents repeatedly stressed the importance of local control in education, arguing that state mandates like the FAFSA requirement undermine the autonomy of local school districts.
   - Schools already provide resources and counseling to help students explore post-secondary options, including college, trades, military service, and apprenticeships.

2. **Diverse Post-Secondary Pathways**:
   - There was concern that overemphasizing college as the primary post-graduation pathway sends a mixed message to students who may prefer alternative routes like career and technical education (CTE) or the military.
   - The discussion highlighted the need to recognize and support diverse pathways to success, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach.

### **Funding and Resource Disparities**
1. **Education Funding Formula**:
   - The committee reviewed the Senate’s proposed education funding formula, which includes an "extraordinary needs grant" and a "hold harmless" provision to ensure no district loses funding. However, concerns were raised about the impact on property-poor towns like Berlin and Claremont, which may not benefit as much as wealthier districts.
   - The Senate’s proposal increases funding to $1.04 billion for FY 2024, slightly higher than the House’s proposal of $1.031 billion.

2. **Career and Technical Education (CTE) Funding**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of increased funding for CTE programs, particularly for transportation and tuition reimbursement. While the Senate’s proposal allocates $9 million annually, the committee argued for an additional $2.2 million per year to meet growing demands.

---

### **Student Safety and Privacy**
1. **Social Media in Schools**:
   - The committee debated the use of social media platforms like LinkedIn in schools, raising concerns about student safety, data privacy, and potential exposure to predators. Instant messaging features and the lack of privacy agreements with platforms like LinkedIn were particularly criticized.

2. **Employment of Revoked or Suspended Educators**:
   - Another bill addressed the employment or volunteering of educators with revoked or suspended credentials. The discussion highlighted the importance of protecting students from potentially dangerous individuals, even in private schools. Legal experts clarified that credentialing issues are distinct from employment issues and are narrowly focused on student safety.

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Mental Health and Absences**:
   - The committee briefly discussed bills related to mental health absences (HB 352) and the need for additional support for students facing mental health challenges.

2. **Charter School Funding and Reading Assessments**:
   - Subcommittees were assigned to address specific bills, including those related to charter school funding and reading assessments. The committee emphasized the need for further research and collaboration with stakeholders on issues like digital badging and statewide assessment programs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a broad debate about the balance between state mandates and local control in education, the role of FAFSA in supporting students' post-secondary planning, and the need to recognize diverse pathways to success. While some argued that the FAFSA requirement promotes financial literacy and college access, others viewed it as an unnecessary burden that infringes on privacy and local autonomy. The committee also addressed critical issues related to education funding, student safety, and the importance of supporting CTE programs and property-poor districts. Further discussions and amendments are expected as the committee continues to deliberate on these complex issues.
