**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (May 30, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on May 30, 2023, featured extensive discussions on several key education-related issues, including the **Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)** graduation requirement, **Career and Technical Education (CTE)** funding, educator credentialing, and student safety in the context of technology use. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **FAFSA Graduation Requirement**
The meeting centered heavily on **House Bill (HB) 136** and its amendments, which addressed the FAFSA graduation requirement set to take effect on July 1, 2023. The requirement mandates that high school students complete the FAFSA or sign a waiver to graduate. Key points from the discussion included:

1. **Support for FAFSA**:
   - Proponents argued that FAFSA completion increases awareness of financial aid opportunities, particularly for low-income families, and helps break cycles of poverty. Evidence from states like Louisiana and Alabama, where FAFSA completion rates rose significantly after similar mandates, was cited.
   - Supporters emphasized that FAFSA is a tool for financial literacy and post-secondary education access, benefiting New Hampshire’s workforce and economy.

2. **Opposition and Concerns**:
   - Critics, including several superintendents, argued that the requirement is an unfunded mandate, overly burdensome for schools and families, and an unnecessary state overreach into local education decisions.
   - Concerns were raised about privacy issues, as FAFSA requires sharing financial information with the federal government and schools. Additionally, some argued that not all students plan to attend college, and the mandate sends the wrong message about alternative pathways like trade schools or military service.
   - Superintendents like Brian Mulkey (Goffstown) and Mike Fournier (Bedford) opposed tying graduation to parental actions, arguing it creates tension between families and schools and undermines the purpose of graduation as a celebration of student achievement.

3. **Amendment Proposals**:
   - **Amendment 1744h**: Proposed by Representative Ladd, this amendment sought to remove the FAFSA graduation mandate while requiring schools to inform students about FAFSA and post-secondary pathways. It emphasized local control and avoided penalizing students for parental decisions.
   - **Amendment 1396h**: Introduced by Representative Kristen Noble, this amendment aimed to repeal the FAFSA requirement entirely, citing privacy concerns, administrative burdens, and the importance of local autonomy.
   - A third amendment proposed allowing school districts to achieve an 80% FAFSA completion rate as an alternative to individual student compliance, reducing administrative burdens.

4. **Outcome**:
   - After extensive debate, the committee ultimately decided to maintain the FAFSA requirement, emphasizing its role in informing students about financial aid opportunities. However, discussions highlighted ongoing tensions between state mandates, local control, and family autonomy.

### **Career and Technical Education (CTE) Funding**
The committee also addressed funding challenges for **Career and Technical Education (CTE) centers**, which have been impacted by recent budget amendments. Key points included:

1. **Funding Shortfalls**:
   - CTE centers face difficulties attracting students and maintaining programs due to reduced funding. Transportation costs were a significant barrier, with districts covering the difference between state funding ($680,000 annually) and actual costs ($2.8 million).
   - Smaller districts like Berlin, Claremont, Franklin, and Pittsfield were disproportionately affected.

2. **Proposed Solutions**:
   - A proposal to reallocate $4.4 million annually over the biennium to CTE funding was introduced. This would adjust the adequacy funding formula to better support smaller districts and ensure CTE centers can sustain their programs.
   - The committee emphasized the importance of CTE in providing alternative pathways to success, particularly for students not pursuing traditional college routes.

### **Educator Credentialing and Student Safety**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill (SB) 136**, which prohibits the employment or volunteering of educators whose credentials have been revoked or suspended, extending this prohibition to private schools. Key points included:

1. **Support for SB 136**:
   - The bill was supported by the Department of Education and the New Hampshire Education Association (NEA) as a measure to protect children from educators who pose safety risks.
   - It aims to prevent educators with revoked or suspended credentials from moving between districts or to private schools.

2. **Concerns**:
   - Some representatives raised concerns about potential overreach, particularly regarding private schools and the ambiguity of credential requirements.
   - There were worries about future misuse of credentialing rules, such as penalizing teachers for insubordination or non-compliance with certain policies.

3. **Outcome**:
   - The bill passed with a majority vote, highlighting the committee’s commitment to student safety while addressing concerns about overreach.

### **Technology Use and Student Privacy**
The committee reviewed **SB 213**, which addresses the use of technology platforms like LinkedIn in CTE programs and student career development. Key points included:

1. **Amendments and Concerns**:
   - **House Amendment 2061H**: Allows students to use technology platforms for career development with parental consent but raised concerns about student safety, data privacy, and exposure to inappropriate content.
   - There was debate over a clause discouraging student involvement in careers as influencers or social media personalities, with some arguing it was overly restrictive.

2. **Voting**:
   - The amendment passed with 12 in favor and 8 against, and **SB 213 as amended** also passed with the same vote count.
   - A minority report was indicated, signaling ongoing disagreement with the bill’s provisions.

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Mental Health and Special Education**:
   - The committee formed subcommittees to address mental health-related bills (**HB 352, 505, 151**) and special education funding (**HB 577**).

2. **Charter School Building Aid**:
   - A subcommittee was formed to explore expanding building aid for charter schools (**HB 354**).

3. **Education Funding Formula**:
   - The committee discussed the Senate’s proposed changes to the education funding formula, including the elimination of stabilization aid and the introduction of an **Extraordinary Needs Grant**. Concerns were raised about the impact on property-poor towns like Berlin and Claremont.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted significant debates over the balance between state mandates and local control, the importance of financial literacy and post-secondary education access, and the need to support alternative pathways like CTE and trade schools. The committee moved forward with key bills like **SB 136** but maintained the FAFSA requirement, emphasizing its role in informing students about financial aid. Discussions also underscored the challenges of funding CTE programs and ensuring student safety in the context of technology use. The committee planned to continue reviewing retained bills and forming subcommittees to address unresolved issues.
