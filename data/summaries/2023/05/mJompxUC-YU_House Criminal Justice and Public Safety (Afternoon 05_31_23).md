The transcript captures an executive session of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee on May 31, 2023. The session focused on SB 14, with a motion to adopt an amendment that was confirmed to be identical to a previous version (473) with no changes. Representatives discussed and voted on the amendment, which ultimately passed. Following this, a motion to pass SB 14 as amended was made, seconded, and voted on, also passing. The session concluded with plans to place the bill on the consent calendar, though the chair anticipated it might not remain there. The meeting was then officially closed.
