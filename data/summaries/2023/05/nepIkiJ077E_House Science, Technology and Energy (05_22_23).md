**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (05/22/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on May 22, 2023, to discuss a range of energy-related issues, with a particular focus on biomass energy, renewable energy standards, and amendments to key legislation. The meeting included presentations, debates, and discussions on the economic, environmental, and policy implications of energy decisions in the state. Here are the key points and outcomes:

---

### **1. Biomass Energy and Subsidies**
The committee extensively discussed the economic viability of biomass electricity generation in New Hampshire, with a focus on the need for subsidies and policy intervention to support the industry. Key highlights include:
   - **Economic Challenges**: Biomass plants face significantly higher construction and maintenance costs compared to other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, and solar. A 2018 report from the committee found that subsidies for Class III biomass facilities cost ratepayers $3 million from 2014 to 2017.
   - **Policy Interventions**: Researchers from Dartmouth College’s Policy Research Shop, Mahak Batra and Beatrice Capio, presented findings that concluded subsidies are necessary for biomass to thrive in New Hampshire, given the state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). They also suggested further study on the specific subsidy levels required and the viability of other renewable energy forms.
   - **Environmental and Economic Considerations**: Committee members explored the impact of biomass on the logging industry and forest management. They raised concerns about the potential devaluation of forest land if low-grade timber loses its market value. The researchers emphasized the importance of balancing forest management with energy production and diversifying the state’s energy mix.

### **2. Renewable Energy Standards and Cost Competitiveness**
The committee reviewed data on the cost competitiveness of renewable energy sources, including:
   - **Levelized Cost of Energy**: A national analysis by Lazard highlighted that wind and solar are the most cost-competitive renewable energy sources compared to conventional sources like natural gas and coal. However, the analysis did not account for the costs of backing up intermittent generation.
   - **Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)**: The committee debated the role of RPS in promoting biomass and other renewables. Members expressed interest in further research on the rate of return for ratepayers and taxpayers on subsidies for biomass and other renewable energy projects.

---

### **3. Amendments to Key Legislation**
The committee considered amendments to several bills returned from the Senate, including:
   - **House Bill 281**: The committee debated repealing the Least Cost Integrated Resource Planning (LCIRP) process, with some members opposing the repeal without a replacement. Concerns were raised about potential stranded costs for ratepayers, especially in light of recent legislation allowing long-term power purchase agreements.
   - **House Bill 233 (Thermal Wreck Bill)** and **House Bill 139 (Municipal Group Host Net Metering Bill)**: The committee discussed concurring with Senate amendments to these bills, though specific details were not provided in the transcript.
   - **Streamlining the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)**: While some members supported streamlining the SEC process, others advocated for a more comprehensive review rather than piecemeal changes.

---

### **4. Concerns About Ratepayer Costs**
The committee expressed concerns about potential costs to ratepayers resulting from certain amendments and policies, such as:
   - Adding renewable portfolio standard (RPS) cost information to utility bills.
   - Changes to municipal boundaries that could impact energy costs.

---

### **5. Future Committee Meetings**
The chair mentioned the possibility of scheduling an additional meeting before the end of June to discuss retained bills, with further discussions planned for the fall.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with thanks to the presenters and committee members for their contributions. The discussions underscored the complexity of balancing economic, environmental, and policy considerations in New Hampshire’s energy landscape. The committee emphasized the need for further research and a balanced approach to supporting renewable energy sources like biomass while minimizing costs to ratepayers and ensuring sustainable forest management.
