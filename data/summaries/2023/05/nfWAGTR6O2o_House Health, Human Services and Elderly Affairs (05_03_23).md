The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on May 3, 2023, to discuss a range of healthcare-related bills and amendments. The meeting focused on several key areas, including **Medicaid expansion**, **opioid abatement and harm reduction**, **healthcare provider regulations**, and **patient-centered care**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **Medicaid Expansion**
1. **Senate Bill 263**:  
   - The bill aims to make Medicaid expansion permanent in New Hampshire, currently covering approximately 60,000 residents.  
   - **Supporters** highlighted its bipartisan Senate approval (24-0), its role in reducing healthcare costs, and its support from the business and healthcare communities. They emphasized its benefits in reducing uncompensated care and emergency room visits.  
   - **Opponents** raised concerns about the lack of a sunset clause, potential financial burdens on the state, and the need for reforms such as work requirements and funding protections. Some suggested exploring alternative, cost-effective solutions tailored to New Hampshire’s needs.  
   - The discussion underscored the balance between federal and state responsibilities and the importance of transparency and public input in the legislative process.

#### **Opioid Abatement and Harm Reduction**
1. **Senate Bill 239**:  
   - The bill addresses harm reduction strategies, opioid abatement, and substance misuse.  
   - **Key Debates**:  
     - **Harm Reduction Definitions**: Representatives debated the scope of "harm reduction," with some advocating for precise definitions to avoid unintended liabilities, while others emphasized the need for broad definitions to encompass various public health interventions.  
     - **Stigma and Misuse**: Discussions focused on reducing stigma around harm reduction services, expanding access to naloxone, drug checking services, and street outreach programs.  
     - **Funding Concerns**: There were concerns about the use of state general funds and opioid abatement funds, with some arguing for clarity and sustainability in funding mechanisms.  
   - **Amendments**:  
     - An amendment to remove broad definitions of harm reduction and focus on specific programs like syringe services and drug checking was proposed but not adopted.  
     - Another amendment aimed to include law enforcement in the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery.  

2. **Syringe Service Programs and Drug Checking**:  
   - While many representatives supported these programs as critical harm reduction tools, concerns were raised about balancing harm reduction with the potential risks of enabling drug use.

#### **Healthcare Provider Regulations**
1. **Senate Bill 127**:  
   - The committee discussed an amendment clarifying the fee structure for methadone detoxification and maintenance programs, which passed unanimously (20-0). The bill, as amended, passed 15-5, with some members expressing concerns about its structure and scope.  

2. **Senate Bill 200**:  
   - The bill focused on allowing optometrists to administer vaccines, particularly COVID-19 vaccines.  
   - An amendment proposing a two-year pause on expanding COVID-19 vaccine administration by optometrists failed (8-12).  
   - Another amendment aligning optometrists’ vaccine administration requirements with those of pharmacists passed unanimously (20-0). The bill, as amended, passed 14-6, with concerns raised about optometrists’ focus and potential liabilities.

#### **Patient-Centered Care and Medicaid Requirements**
1. **Care Plan Negotiation**:  
   - A proposal was discussed to create care plans negotiated between primary care providers and patients to determine the frequency of visits, aiming to reduce long-term healthcare costs.  

2. **Community Engagement Requirements**:  
   - There was a debate about reinstating work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which had previously been invalidated by a federal court. Some argued that such requirements align with New Hampshire’s program goals, while others opposed them, emphasizing Medicaid’s core objective of providing healthcare coverage.  

3. **Polypharmacy and Preventative Care**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the risks of polypharmacy (the use of multiple medications) and the importance of preventative care. An amendment proposed requiring annual wellness visits to address polypharmacy, particularly in cardiology and mental health.  

---

#### **Accountability and Oversight**
1. **Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)**:  
   - The role of MCOs in managing healthcare programs was discussed, with a focus on ensuring contracts improve care quality, lower costs, and address polypharmacy. The capitation model, where MCOs are paid per person enrolled, was scrutinized for potentially incentivizing enrollment without ensuring service utilization.  

2. **Data and Transparency**:  
   - Lawmakers emphasized the need for data on program utilization and the effectiveness of preventative care measures. Concerns were raised about the lack of data on primary care service utilization and the potential for wasteful spending.

#### **Amendments and Legislative Process**
- Throughout the meeting, several amendments were proposed and voted on, with some passing unanimously and others failing due to concerns about scope, funding, and clarity.  
- Representatives expressed frustration over the lack of clarity in legislative language, particularly around the distinction between harm reduction and treatment, leading to calls for further review and dialogue.  
- The importance of transparency, public input, and careful consideration of fiscal and legal implications was emphasized.
