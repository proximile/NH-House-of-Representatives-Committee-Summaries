#### **Key Bills Discussed**

1. **Senate Bill 78 (Subdivision Regulations)**:

   - The amendment passed overwhelmingly with a vote of 19 to 1.
   - The bill, as amended, was moved to pass with the same vote (19 to 1).

2. **Senate Bill 47 (Commission to Study Barriers to Residential Development Density)**:
   - **Amendment 2023-1677h** proposed adjusting the commission’s composition by removing the Conservation Commission’s representation.

   - The amendment failed with a tied vote of 10 to 10.
   - The committee recessed further discussion on SB 47 until May 24th to allow time for additional amendments and research.

3. **Senate Bill 88 (Town Officers Association Dues Increase)**:

   - Concerns were raised about unfunded mandates and the allocation of funds, particularly for educational versus lobbying purposes.
   - An amendment was proposed to ensure dues were used solely for educational purposes.
   - After the initial motion to "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate) failed, the bill passed with the amendment.

4. **Senate Bill 111 (Town Council Powers and Authorities)**:
   - The bill aimed to clarify the powers and authorities of town councils under the Town Council-Manager form of government.
