**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (May 9, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on May 9, 2023, to address systemic issues within the family court system. The meeting featured testimonies from individuals, discussions among committee members, and presentations from stakeholders, focusing on delays, transparency, judicial accountability, gender neutrality, child custody, child support, and procedural irregularities. Key points and themes from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Key Issues and Testimonies**
1. **Systemic Delays and Transparency**:
   - Testimonies highlighted significant delays in court processes, particularly in cases involving the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). Donald Gilbert emphasized the lack of responsiveness from DCYF despite court orders, which adversely affects guardianship and child custody cases.
   - Nicholas Rinaldi shared his personal experience, alleging judicial overreach, mishandling of his case, and violations of constitutional rights. He called for greater accountability and reform to address these issues.

2. **Judicial Discretion and Bias**:
   - The committee acknowledged the complexity of family law cases and the significant discretion judges have in determining outcomes based on the best interests of the child. However, concerns were raised about judicial bias and the lack of consistency in rulings.
   - Suggestions included tracking judges’ rulings by gender, establishing an independent board to investigate bias complaints, and improving judicial training to address perjury and false reports of domestic violence.

3. **Child Custody and Support**:
   - Testimonies revealed problems with child support calculations, particularly in 50/50 shared parenting arrangements. Advocates called for a rebuttable presumption of shared parenting to reduce adversarial custody battles and prioritize children’s well-being.
   - Dale Savoy shared his experience of limited visitation rights based on perceived intensity in the courtroom, which he argued was not indicative of abusive behavior. He highlighted the need for evidence-based custody decisions.

4. **Gender Neutrality and Fairness**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of gender-neutral approaches in custody decisions, ensuring no preference is given to either parent based on sex. Judges may consider traditional responsibilities and future caregiving abilities, but the primary focus should remain on the best interests of the child.

5. **Guardianship and Coordination**:
   - Challenges in coordinating custody and guardianship cases across different courts and judges were discussed. Conflicting rulings and confusion for families underscored the need for assigning one judge per family to handle all related cases (e.g., divorce, custody, and child welfare) to improve consistency.

6. **Prenuptial Agreements and Due Process**:
   - The lack of respect for prenuptial agreements in court decisions was criticized, with suggestions to require filed prenuptial agreements as a condition for marriage licenses.
   - Failures in due process, such as the absence of parenting plans and difficulties in appealing court decisions, were highlighted. Concerns were raised about the oversight of the Attorney Discipline Office and the need for an independent committee to address these issues.

### **Proposed Reforms and Recommendations**
1. **Legislative Actions**:
   - The committee explored potential legislative actions, including implementing a presumption of equal shared parenting, improving oversight of judicial training, and addressing delays in court processes.
   - Recommendations from past reports (e.g., 2003 and 2004) were reviewed for context and guidance, emphasizing the need for systemic improvements.

2. **Task Force on Family Law**:
   - A task force was established to review family law, comprising members from various judicial and advocacy organizations, including the Commission on the Status of Men and Women, psychologists, and legal professionals.

3. **Certification of Court Reporters**:
   - The committee discussed recognizing both shorthand and voice methods as certified court reporting techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency in court proceedings.

4. **Office of the Child Advocate (OCA)**:
   - Cassandra Sanchez and Lisa Massio from the OCA presented on their role in overseeing child-serving agencies. They highlighted the need for specialized training for attorneys and judges to better handle family court cases, particularly those involving child abuse and neglect.

5. **Public Input and Communication**:
   - The committee encouraged public participation and provided instructions for submitting electronic testimony to ensure broader input from stakeholders. They emphasized the need for structured information submission to effectively address concerns.

### **Focus on Children’s Well-Being**
Throughout the meeting, committee members and stakeholders stressed that the primary focus of the family court system should be on the well-being of children, rather than treating cases as adversarial battles between parents. The involvement of children in court proceedings and ensuring their voices are heard were highlighted as critical components of achieving this goal.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue reviewing testimony and exploring legislative recommendations to improve the family court system. The committee underscored the need for systemic reforms, including better training for judges and attorneys, clearer protocols for handling complex cases, and enhanced communication between different courts and stakeholders. The ultimate aim is to create a more transparent, fair, and child-centered family court system in New Hampshire.
