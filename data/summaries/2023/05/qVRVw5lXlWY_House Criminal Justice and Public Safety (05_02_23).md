The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened to discuss **Senate Bill 58 (SB 58)**. The meeting began with a brief recess to ensure a full complement of members. Upon reconvening, **Representative Stone** summarized the subcommittee's work, highlighting that stakeholders and the committee preferred the **SB 58 Amendment (594:10)** over the alternative **627:8A**, which raised concerns about the use of force by untrained individuals. **Representative Muse** introduced an amendment (**2023-1498h**) to address issues with the Senate's version of the bill, particularly regarding the detention of individuals in medical settings and potential violations of CMS rules, which could jeopardize Medicaid and Medicare funding. The amendment aimed to balance protecting healthcare workers while ensuring individuals in mental health crises are not unnecessarily arrested and sent to jail.

The committee unanimously adopted the amendment (**20-0**) and moved to pass SB 58 as amended, which also passed unanimously (**20-0**). The bill now advances to the next stage of the legislative process.

After concluding the executive session on SB 58, the committee discussed plans for retained bills. The chair proposed assigning subcommittees for retained bills and suggested starting work in September, with the goal of completing reviews by October or November. Members were encouraged to express interest in specific bills, and the chair agreed to send out a list of retained bills for review. The meeting concluded with thanks to the committee for their work during the session.
