**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Election Law Committee Meeting (05/16/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Election Law Committee convened on May 16, 2023, to discuss potential reforms to campaign finance laws and election statutes. The meeting emphasized bipartisan collaboration and the importance of making incremental improvements to ensure transparency, fairness, and public confidence in the electoral process. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Core Themes and Objectives**
1. **Incremental Progress**: Members stressed the importance of making steady, practical improvements to election laws rather than pursuing comprehensive overhauls. They acknowledged that changes require broad support across party lines and legislative chambers.
2. **Clarification and Simplification**: A recurring theme was the need to clarify and simplify existing statutes, particularly around definitions, reporting requirements, and committee structures, to reduce confusion and ensure consistent enforcement.
3. **Transparency and Corruption Prevention**: Enhancing transparency in campaign finance was highlighted as essential to preventing corruption and maintaining public trust in the electoral system.

### **Key Discussion Points**
1. **Exploratory Committees and Candidate Definitions**: 
   - The committee debated when a person officially becomes a candidate and how to define exploratory committees. Discussions focused on balancing clarity with protecting free speech rights, especially regarding early campaign activities and fundraising.
   
2. **Disclosure Requirements**: 
   - Current rules for disclosing who pays for campaign materials (e.g., signs, digital ads) were reviewed. Members considered whether these rules need updating or further clarification to ensure accountability.

3. **Enforcement of Campaign Finance Laws**: 
   - Concerns were raised about the inconsistent enforcement of existing laws, such as the requirement for candidates to file financial statements before nomination or election. Members emphasized the need for stricter adherence to these provisions.

4. **Candidate Committees vs. Individual Candidates**: 
   - There was debate over whether all candidates should be required to form candidate committees or if individual filing options should remain, particularly for smaller campaigns like State Representatives. Some argued that committees could be burdensome for smaller campaigns, while others saw value in requiring them for larger races (e.g., State Senate, Executive Council).

5. **Reporting Deadlines**: 
   - Discrepancies in reporting deadlines between candidates and candidate committees were noted. The committee discussed aligning these deadlines to streamline the process and reduce confusion.

6. **Election Cycle Definition**: 
   - The lack of a clear definition for an "election cycle" was highlighted. Members discussed the need to define when an election cycle begins and ends, particularly regarding campaign debt and surplus funds.

7. **Surplus Funds**: 
   - The handling of surplus campaign funds was debated, including whether funds should be rolled over into the next election cycle or zeroed out. Concerns were raised about transparency and preventing misuse of funds.

8. **Streamlining Committee Categories**: 
   - The committee considered consolidating or clarifying the various categories of political committees (e.g., candidate committees, exploratory committees, political advocacy organizations) to reduce complexity.

9. **Financial Agents and Fiscal Agents**: 
   - The distinction between Financial Agents, Fiscal Agents, and Treasurers was unclear, prompting suggestions to standardize these roles.

10. **Post-Election Fundraising**: 
    - The group discussed whether candidates should be allowed to raise funds after an election, particularly to pay off campaign debts, and whether additional regulations are needed to prevent misuse.

### **Public Engagement and Bipartisanship**
- A member of the public commended the committee for its bipartisan efforts on campaign finance reform, underscoring the importance of collaboration between Republicans and Democrats.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee agreed to gather additional resources, such as materials from the National Conference of State Legislatures, to inform their work and avoid duplicating efforts.
- Members planned to compile a list of issues to address and prioritize, focusing on incremental improvements to election law.
- The committee scheduled its next meeting for two weeks later to continue discussions and refine proposals.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, reflecting the committee’s commitment to making thoughtful, bipartisan progress on election law reforms. The discussions underscored the need for clarity, transparency, and fairness in campaign finance regulations, with a focus on practical, achievable changes to strengthen New Hampshire’s electoral system.
