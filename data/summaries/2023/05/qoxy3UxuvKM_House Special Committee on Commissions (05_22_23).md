**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (May 22, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Special Committee on Commissions convened on May 22, 2023, to discuss the review, reform, and management of legislative commissions and committees. The meeting focused on improving the efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness of these bodies, while addressing cultural and procedural challenges. Key discussions and proposals included:

### **Cultural Shift and Efficiency**
The committee acknowledged a cultural tendency in New Hampshire to extensively study issues without always producing actionable legislation. They emphasized the need for a cultural shift to make the legislative process more efficient and impactful, particularly in changing statutes or rules. This shift was identified as a significant but essential hurdle for progress. The committee also noted that New Hampshire’s legislative process is unique in that every bill receives a hearing and goes to the floor, unlike many other states.

### **Review and Management of Commissions**
The committee highlighted the role of Legislative Administration in maintaining a biennial list of commissions and ensuring their necessity and productivity. They discussed the importance of eliminating redundant or outdated commissions, with the five-year sunset rule for new commissions serving as a tool to phase out unnecessary ones. The committee reviewed a list of 36 proposed study commissions for the current term, eight of which are new, and stressed the need for a coordinated approach to avoid duplication and clearly define commission purposes.

### **Training and Education**
The committee emphasized the importance of continuing education for legislators, particularly new members and chairpersons, to better understand the roles and functions of study commissions. Proposals included full-day or half-day dedicated training sessions, as well as nonpartisan educational programs to help members understand new rules, statutes, and the rationale behind proposed changes.

### **Visibility, Tracking, and Transparency**
To improve the visibility of commissions, the committee considered creating brochures, videos, and website features such as a radio button to search for commission-related bills. They also discussed adding specific indicators on bill analyses to highlight commission-related legislation. The committee underscored the importance of public hearings and transparency, ensuring stakeholders have the opportunity to advocate for the continuation of specific commissions.

### **Legislative Process and Rule Changes**
The committee addressed the legislative process for introducing and amending bills related to study commissions, including the confidentiality of information during drafting and the possibility of waivers to share certain details. They proposed a rule change to prevent the introduction or consideration of bills that establish or amend study commissions unless they comply with House rules or statutes, particularly RSA 1449, which governs the creation of study commissions.

### **Coordination and Communication**
The committee highlighted the need for better coordination among legislative offices to avoid working in silos. They discussed the development of a master chart to track all commissions and ensure continuity across legislative sessions. Additionally, they explored the possibility of using subcommittees or ad hoc committees within standing committees to study specific issues, rather than creating separate study commissions.

### **Challenges and Future Steps**
The committee acknowledged challenges such as finding legislators willing to serve on study commissions, the burden on staff, and the time-consuming nature of managing these bodies. They proposed periodic reviews of existing commissions to assess their effectiveness and necessity. Moving forward, the committee planned to update the list of commissions, develop a questionnaire for commission chairs, and work on IT solutions to improve data management and accessibility.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, the meeting focused on streamlining the legislative process related to study commissions, ensuring compliance with legal requirements, and fostering a cultural shift toward more actionable outcomes. The committee proposed several procedural improvements and rule changes to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness of legislative commissions, aligning them with legislative priorities and reducing redundancy.
