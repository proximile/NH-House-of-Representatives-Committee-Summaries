### **Gaming and Taxation Bills**

   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (**20-0**) to retain the bill for further study and discussion.

3. **Senate Bill 190**

### **Opioid Settlement Funds: Senate Bill 32**

1. **Purpose**: The bill addresses the distribution of funds from opioid settlements to mitigate the harms of the opioid epidemic.  
2. **Fund Allocation**:  
   - 15% of the settlement funds go to 23 litigating subdivisions (counties and cities).  
   - The remaining funds are managed by the **Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission**, which awards grants for purposes such as substance use disorder treatment, prevention, and housing.  
   - The bill establishes a requirement to distribute at least $5 million in grants annually if the fund balance exceeds $5 million.  
3. **Discussion Highlights**:  
   - The fund currently has around $35 million, with settlements expected to bring in over $300 million over 18 years.  
   - The commission is streamlining grant applications, particularly for smaller communities seeking reimbursement for medications like naloxone.  
   - Sustainability is a focus, with grants potentially covering multi-year programs.  
   - The commission collaborates with the **Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs** to align strategies.  
   - Concerns were raised about administrative costs, but the commission has agreed to fund one staff position, with potential for a second.  
4. **Outcome**: The committee voted **20-0** to recommend the bill **Ought to Pass**.

### **Professional Licensure and Certification: Senate Bill 49 (Revisited)**

1. **Purpose**: The bill relates to the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** and its ability to retain and use funds for capital projects.  
2. **Key Issues**:  
   - The bill conflicts with **HB 655**, a larger bill reorganizing OPLC, which has already passed the House and Senate.  
   - Concerns were raised about the bill incorrectly implying OPLC has authority to lapse funds for capital projects, which is not in current statute.  
   - The bill may bypass the standard process for property acquisition, which typically involves the **Division of Administrative Services**.  
   - The bill includes new language that was not highlighted as such, leading to confusion.  
3. **Discussion Highlights**:  
   - Representative Phyllis pointed out technical issues with the bill, including its inconsistency with existing laws and processes.  
   - There was debate about whether the bill should restrict fund use to capital expenditures or allow broader flexibility.  
   - Representative Fellows proposed an amendment to address some of these concerns, including a $3 million cap on fund usage.  
4. **Outcome**: The committee voted on an **Ought to Pass** motion, but the transcript does not specify the outcome.
