The New Hampshire House Transportation Committee meeting on May 16, 2023, covered several bills and amendments, with key discussions and votes summarized as follows:

1. **Senate Bill 13 (SB 13)**: Relative to the recovery of search and rescue expenses. The committee voted unanimously (28-0) to retain the bill, citing a need to align it with a previously retained bill, House Bill 650.

2. **Senate Bill 118 (SB 118)**: Requiring children under two to be restrained in motor vehicles. The bill passed with an 11-9 vote. Supporters cited safety data and recommendations from organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC, while opponents argued it placed an unnecessary burden on parents and was difficult to enforce.

3. **Senate Bill 187 (SB 187)**: Relative to driver’s licenses for certain visa holders. The committee unanimously (20-0) supported the bill, which extends the period H2A agricultural workers can use their foreign driver’s licenses from 60 to 300 days. An amendment addressing enforcement concerns was also adopted.

4. **Senate Bill 188 (SB 188)**: Relative to catalytic converters. The committee unanimously (20-0) passed the bill, which includes an amendment adding scrap metal dealers to the list of entities covered under the law.

5. **Senate Bill 256 (SB 256)**: Establishing a safety program for off-highway recreational vehicles. The bill passed 15-5, with supporters emphasizing the need for education and safety, particularly as these vehicles are increasingly used on public roads. Opponents argued it was overly restrictive and confusing due to varying start dates for certification requirements.

The committee also discussed amendments to three other bills:
- **House Bill 111 (HB 111)**: Concurred with the Senate amendment reducing the number of senators on a study committee from three to one.
- **House Bill 137 (HB 137)**: Concurred with the Senate amendment adding the New Hampshire Camp Directors Association to a commission.
- **House Bill 268 (HB 268)**: Concurred with the Senate amendment adding the Senate Clerk to the list of entities eligible for special number plates.

The meeting concluded with the chair thanking members for their work and outlining plans for subcommittees to study retained bills, including those related to driver education, vehicle inspections, and window tint regulations. The committee adjourned after finalizing preparations for the upcoming floor session.
