**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Commerce and Consumer Affairs, 05/23/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 23, 2023, focused on two major themes: **cannabis legalization and regulation** and **healthcare legislation**, particularly mental health crisis management. The discussions highlighted significant policy debates, public health concerns, economic implications, and social justice considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points across all segments:

---

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**

1. **Proposed Cannabis Legislation**:
   - The primary focus was on **Senate Bill 98**, which proposes the legalization and regulation of cannabis in New Hampshire. The bill was reintroduced with modifications after previously failing in the Senate.
   - The proposed model would establish a **state-controlled system** for cannabis sales, operated by the New Hampshire Liquor Commission. This model avoids setting a tax rate, as the state would control pricing and profit margins.
   - The bill includes provisions for **dual-use licenses**, allowing existing Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) to participate in retail cannabis sales, which is seen as critical for the viability of the therapeutic cannabis program.

2. **Key Concerns and Criticisms**:
   - **State-Run Monopoly**: Several representatives expressed concerns about the state-run model, arguing it could lead to inefficiencies, financial risks, and potential legal challenges due to federal laws.
   - **Impact on ATCs**: There were worries that excluding ATCs from retail sales could undermine the existing therapeutic cannabis program, potentially forcing patients to turn to the black market or out-of-state sources.
   - **Public Health and Safety**: Michael Holt from the Department of Health and Human Services raised concerns about the proposed **20 mg THC serving size**, advocating for a reduction to **5 mg** for safety reasons. He also emphasized the need for **child-resistant packaging** for all cannabis products.
   - **Racial Justice**: The discussion highlighted racial disparities in marijuana arrests, with Black individuals in New Hampshire being 4.6 times more likely to be arrested than white individuals. Legalization was framed as a step toward addressing these disparities and reducing the collateral consequences of marijuana-related arrests, such as fines, fees, and criminal records.
   - **Economic and Operational Concerns**: Questions were raised about the feasibility of cannabis cultivation in New Hampshire, particularly outdoor growing, and the need for clear regulations. Concerns were also voiced about oversupply, price crashes, and bankruptcies under the state-controlled model, with suggestions to create a free, open market with smaller, tiered licenses.

3. **Public and Industry Input**:
   - Stakeholders, including representatives from the New Hampshire Cannabis Party, supported the bill as a workable first step but suggested improvements, such as clarifying language about cannabis seeds and ensuring the Liquor Commission has the flexibility to implement the program effectively.
   - Testimony from cannabis business owners raised concerns about the state’s role as the sole buyer of cannabis products, advocating for a more open market to prevent large corporations from dominating the industry.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee voted to reconsider **Senate Bill 98**, opening the door for further amendments and discussion. A subcommittee will review the bill to address concerns before a final vote.

### **Healthcare Legislation and Mental Health Crisis Management**

1. **Senate Bill 85**:
   - The bill aims to improve access to mental health crisis services by eliminating prior authorization requirements for mobile crisis units and receiving centers. These services are crucial for stabilizing individuals in non-hospital settings and reducing reliance on emergency departments.
   - The bill supports the implementation of the **988 Suicide Prevention Hotline**, mobile crisis units, and receiving facilities as part of a continuum of care for mental health emergencies.
   - A **study commission** will explore sustainable funding for behavioral health crisis programs, emphasizing the need for evidence-based solutions to reduce suicide rates and improve outcomes.

2. **Testimony from Healthcare Providers**:
   - Physicians and mental health professionals highlighted the strain on primary care providers and emergency departments due to the lack of accessible crisis services. They stressed the importance of mobile crisis teams and community-based interventions to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.
   - John DeJoy, representing the New Hampshire Psychological Association (NHPA), expressed support for SB 85 and advocated for including a clinician from NHPA on the fiscal commission to ensure a better understanding of healthcare practices.

3. **Insurance Coverage**:
   - The bill ensures that mental health emergencies are treated similarly to physical health emergencies, with no prior authorization required for crisis services. Insurers, such as Anthem, have expressed neutrality, noting that prior authorization is not a current barrier to emergency mental health services.

### **Overall Themes and Legislative Action**

1. **Balancing State Control and Market Dynamics**:
   - The cannabis legalization debate centered on balancing state control with market dynamics, with calls for a more open and equitable market to prevent monopolies and ensure the viability of small businesses.

2. **Public Health and Safety**:
   - Public health concerns were a recurring theme, with calls for stricter regulations on THC serving sizes, child-resistant packaging, and the integration of behavioral health into primary care.

3. **Racial Justice and Equity**:
   - Addressing racial disparities in marijuana arrests and ensuring equitable access to cannabis legalization were key social justice considerations.

4. **Mental Health Crisis Management**:
   - Expanding access to mental health crisis services, reducing reliance on emergency departments, and ensuring sustainable funding were critical components of the healthcare legislation discussions.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee’s decision to reconsider **Senate Bill 98** and establish a study commission for behavioral health crisis programs underscores the urgency of legislative action to address these complex issues. Amendments and further discussions are expected to refine the proposed solutions.
