**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on Housing Meeting (06/27/23)**

On June 27, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on Housing convened to address critical housing-related issues and refine proposed legislation aimed at alleviating the state's housing crisis. The meeting focused on a range of topics, including septic and water requirements, accessory dwelling units (ADUs), workforce housing, municipal regulations, and streamlining development processes. Key discussions and proposals are summarized below:

### **Key Topics and Discussions**

1. **Septic and Water Requirements**  
   The committee explored municipal flexibility in setting septic and water standards, emphasizing health and safety while allowing municipalities to exceed minimum requirements without imposing double standards. This approach aims to balance environmental concerns with housing development needs.

2. **Housing Champion Program**  
   Criteria for municipalities to qualify as "Housing Champions" were discussed, including restrictions on lot sizes and minimum square footage requirements. The program seeks to incentivize municipalities to promote affordable housing by offering designations tied to reasonable regulations.

3. **Impact Fees**  
   To reduce upfront costs for developers, the committee debated extending impact fee payment periods up to 20 years, potentially with interest or administrative fees. This measure aims to encourage housing development by easing financial burdens.

4. **Pre-Approval for Housing Developments**  
   Streamlining the approval process for multi-family housing developments that meet fire safety and health standards was considered. Pre-approval at the state or regional level could expedite construction and reduce bureaucratic delays.

5. **Municipal Inspections and Streamlining**  
   The committee discussed ways to streamline municipal inspections and approvals, such as adopting pre-approved designs or modular housing standards. These measures aim to simplify processes and encourage housing development.

6. **Building Code Updates**  
   The state’s building code update process, which follows international standards with state-specific adjustments, was reviewed. The 2021 codes are under consideration, with legislative adoption required to ensure modernized and safe construction practices.

7. **DOT Standards and Walkability**  
   The committee considered incorporating walkability and bicycle-friendly initiatives into housing policies, including potential updates to Department of Transportation (DOT) standards for road construction, particularly for ancillary streets.

8. **Electric Vehicle Charging Stations**  
   The potential for mandating electric vehicle charging stations in affordable housing developments was briefly mentioned, though no decisions were made.

### **Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**  
A significant portion of the meeting focused on proposed legislation to expand and clarify ADU regulations to address housing shortages:

- **ADU Expansion**: The bill would allow homeowners to build up to two ADUs per property, an increase from the current limit of one, to provide more housing options and rental income opportunities.
- **Definitions and Size Limits**: The bill clarifies the definitions of attached and detached ADUs and proposes increasing the maximum size to 1,000 square feet for the first unit and 850 square feet for additional units, with exceptions for smaller primary dwellings.
- **Parking Requirements**: The committee suggested limiting parking requirements to one on-site space per bedroom in the ADU to prevent excessive municipal restrictions.
- **Workforce Housing**: ADUs could qualify as workforce housing, helping municipalities meet state obligations. The bill implicitly discourages short-term rentals by requiring one ADU to meet workforce housing criteria.
- **Owner Occupancy**: The bill maintains the requirement that the property owner must occupy one of the dwelling units but does not specify which unit.
- **Aesthetic and Design Standards**: Municipalities can set aesthetic standards for ADUs but cannot impose overly restrictive size or parking requirements.

### **Workforce Housing and Municipal Regulations**  
The committee refined the definition of workforce housing, emphasizing affordability based on median income levels. Concerns were raised about the inclusion of the word "sale" in the definition, with suggestions to clarify language to avoid misinterpretation. Additionally, the committee explored tying municipal incentives, such as the "Housing Champion" designation, to the adoption of reasonable lot size requirements and streamlined processes.

### **Environmental and Septic Concerns**  
Discussions addressed septic system requirements and their relationship to lot sizes. Suggestions included basing minimum lot sizes on soil type and septic system needs, with questions raised about the clarity of terms like "septic radius."

### **Housing Appeals Board (HAB)**  
The committee considered expanding the HAB's jurisdiction to include appeals from various municipal decisions (e.g., fire department, health department, zoning) to provide a clearer avenue for resolving disputes.

### **Next Steps**  
The committee assigned specific tasks to members for further research and drafting of language on these topics. Subcommittees were formed to refine the proposed legislation, with multiple versions of the bill being drafted to accommodate differing views. A follow-up meeting was planned for early September to review progress and finalize recommendations.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing New Hampshire’s housing needs while balancing state mandates and local control. Members expressed strong opinions on the need for state intervention to address the housing crisis while respecting municipal decision-making. The committee aims to move toward consensus by refining legislation and streamlining processes to promote affordable and accessible housing across the state. The meeting concluded with members wishing each other a good summer break.
