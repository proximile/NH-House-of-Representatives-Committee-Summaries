The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference met on June 20, 2023, to discuss House Bill 534, focusing on differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The House version proposed $2.5 million for a groundwater trust fund without a lapse provision, while the Senate version reduced the funding to $500,000 and included a lapse at the end of the biennium. Senator Pearl suggested a compromise: reducing the amount to $500,000 but making it non-lapsing, which he believed the Senate would accept. 

Representative Leishman expressed concerns about creating a new fund, noting that the existing water fund already has substantial resources and that the initial Finance Committee recommendation was to reject the bill, though it narrowly passed in the House. Senator Waters emphasized the need for addressing private well issues and agricultural drought, supporting the Senate's position. Representative Vale supported making the fund non-lapsing, arguing it would better address urgent needs like dry or flooded wells.

The discussion revealed differing views on the necessity and structure of the fund, with some members questioning its urgency and suggesting new legislation might be needed to address unresolved issues. The committee ultimately agreed to disagree on the current bill but committed to revisiting the issue in future sessions. The meeting ended amicably, with both sides agreeing to work collaboratively on the matter in the future.
