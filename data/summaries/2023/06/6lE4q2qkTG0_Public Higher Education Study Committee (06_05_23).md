**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Higher Education Study Committee Meeting (06/05/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Higher Education Study Committee meeting on June 5, 2023, focused on addressing the challenges and opportunities within the state’s public higher education system. The discussions emphasized the need for innovation, collaboration, and adaptability to meet workforce demands, support student success, and ensure economic growth. Key themes and takeaways from the meeting include:

### **Lifelong Learning and Workforce Needs**
Educators highlighted the importance of lifelong learning to keep pace with technological and economic changes. The workforce in New Hampshire is projected to grow, with many jobs requiring specific skills rather than traditional degrees. This shift necessitates flexible, responsive educational models, including micro-credentials and badges, which are increasingly valued by employers. Institutions are partnering with industries to provide relevant training and ensure students are career-ready.

### **Integration and Collaboration Across Educational Systems**
The meeting stressed the need for integration between K-12 and post-secondary education to better prepare students for the workforce. Collaboration among higher education institutions is also critical to align missions, avoid unnecessary competition, and optimize resources. Efforts include sharing waitlists, streamlining admissions, and creating clear transfer pathways, as outlined in HB 1530, which establishes curricular transfer pathways between community colleges and universities.

### **High-Impact Educational Practices (HIPs)**
High-impact practices (HIPs), such as service learning, internships, research with faculty, and interdisciplinary projects, were a major focus. These practices enhance student engagement, retention, graduation rates, and career readiness. Institutions like Plymouth State University (PSU), Keene State College, and the University of New Hampshire (UNH) excel in implementing HIPs, as evidenced by data from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). Examples include PSU’s cluster model, which emphasizes project-based learning and community engagement, and initiatives like the Gorham Paper Mill project and Plymouth Creative, a student-run marketing agency.

### **Transferability of Credits and Accreditation**
A significant challenge discussed was the difficulty students face in transferring credits between institutions, particularly in liberal arts and humanities. The accreditation process, which often relies on faculty approval of course syllabi, can create barriers. Efforts are underway to make credit transfer more transparent and consistent, ensuring that students’ educational progress is recognized across institutions.

### **Early Childhood and Non-Traditional Education**
The importance of early childhood education as a foundation for future academic success was emphasized, with the state working to expand high-quality programs and child care. Additionally, there is a growing focus on non-traditional students, with universities shifting strategies to offer flexible options like micro-credentials, non-credit coursework, and early college programs. These initiatives aim to reduce the cost of higher education and allow students to enter the workforce sooner.

### **Workforce Development and Retention**
New Hampshire faces a significant demand for engineers and skilled workers, with UNH’s engineering school noted as one of the best in the country. However, retaining graduates in the state remains a challenge. HIPs, internships, and community engagement projects are effective tools for keeping students in New Hampshire post-graduation. Collaboration between community colleges, universities, and businesses is essential to address workforce needs in fields like robotics and AI.

### **Economic Considerations and State Investment**
The economic impact of educational strategies, including revenue from non-traditional and micro-credential programs, was acknowledged. However, state investment is critical to sustain affordability and expand successful initiatives. The committee emphasized the need to present data on the success of HIPs to the budget committee to secure funding for these programs.

### **Future Directions and Civic Education**
The meeting concluded with a call for continuous innovation in education, including the development of new pathways and the integration of civic education into the curriculum. Improved K-12 education, particularly in civics, is essential to prepare students for higher education and civic engagement. Integrating HIPs into K-12 education could also address issues like truancy and graduation rates.

### **Challenges**
Housing affordability and accessibility emerged as significant challenges, particularly in the North Country, impacting recruitment and retention for students, faculty, and staff. Addressing these issues is crucial to sustaining the state’s educational and workforce goals.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of a cohesive, adaptive approach to higher education in New Hampshire. By fostering collaboration, embracing high-impact practices, and addressing systemic challenges, the state can better serve students, meet workforce demands, and support economic growth. The committee’s focus on data-driven decision-making and legislative support will be key to achieving these objectives.
