**Summary of the NH House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (06/27/23):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened to discuss **House Bill 274**, which proposes significant changes to the state’s administrative rulemaking process. The meeting highlighted constitutional concerns, the role of legislative oversight, and the potential impacts on entities like the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority (NHHFA). Key points from the discussion include:

### **Constitutional and Legislative Oversight Issues**
1. **Constitutional Concerns**: Staff raised questions about the constitutionality of allowing a committee, rather than the full House, to block administrative rules. The director of the Administrative Rules Unit referenced the state constitution and a 1981 Supreme Court opinion (121 N.H. 552), which emphasized the need for full legislative action to reject rules. This raised concerns about potential pocket vetoes if the legislature fails to act on joint resolutions.

2. **Role of Committees**: Members debated the effectiveness of policy committees in reviewing proposed rules to ensure alignment with legislative intent. While some argued that committees often neglect this responsibility, others stressed the importance of oversight, even if it is rarely exercised. The Speaker plans to establish subcommittees to enhance rule review.

3. **Legislator Engagement**: A systemic issue of low legislator engagement in rulemaking was noted. Legislators rarely attend public hearings or review rules, even when they directly impact laws they’ve passed. Suggestions were made to improve awareness and participation in the rulemaking process.

### **Exemptions and Component Units**
4. **Exemptions from Rulemaking**: Concerns were raised about repealing exemptions for certain entities, such as component units and specific sections of Health and Human Services. Questions were posed about why these exemptions existed and whether they should be reinstated.

5. **Component Units**: The committee discussed the relationship between component units (e.g., non-profits) and the state, questioning why they are included in statutes and whether they should be subject to administrative rules.

### **NHHFA’s Role and Concerns**
6. **NHHFA’s Autonomy and Federal Compliance**: Ben Frost, Deputy Executive Director and Chief Legal Officer of NHHFA, expressed serious concerns about the repeal of NHHFA’s rulemaking exemption. NHHFA, created in 1981, operates with a high degree of autonomy to perform essential governmental functions, such as mortgage lending and affordable housing development. It administers federal programs and the state’s affordable housing trust fund but does not receive state operating funds.

7. **Debt and State Liability**: Frost emphasized that NHHFA’s debt (approximately half a billion dollars) is not legally attributable to the state due to the separation between NHHFA and state government. He warned that removing this separation could make the state liable for NHHFA’s debt.

8. **Federal Requirements**: NHHFA’s affiliation with the state is primarily to meet federal requirements for funding and tax-exempt financing, which are critical for its operations.

### **Proposed Rulemaking Process Changes**
9. **Public Hearings and Burden**: The bill proposes requiring committees to hold public hearings on proposed or existing rules (changing "may" to "shall"), which could create a significant administrative burden due to the volume of existing rules.

10. **Broad vs. Specific Rulemaking Authority**: The committee discussed the challenges of broad rulemaking authority granted to agencies, advocating for more specific authority to prevent overreach and ensure accountability.

11. **Vague Terms and Inconsistencies**: Concerns were raised about vague terms like "substantial operational impact" and "excessive burdens," which could lead to inconsistent interpretations and implementation.

### **Next Steps**
12. **Bill Revisions and Future Discussions**: The bill will not move forward in its current form. The committee plans to remove contentious elements and address unresolved issues, with further discussions scheduled for September.

### **Overall Themes**
The session underscored the complexities of the rulemaking process and the potential unintended consequences of the proposed changes. Key challenges included constitutional constraints, the need for clearer legislative oversight, and the delicate balance between autonomy and accountability for entities like NHHFA. The committee emphasized the importance of improving legislator engagement and refining the rulemaking process to ensure efficiency, transparency, and alignment with legislative intent.
