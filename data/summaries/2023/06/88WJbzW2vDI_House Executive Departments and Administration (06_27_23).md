**Summary of the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (06/27/23)**

The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on June 27, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 274**, which focuses on reforming the state’s administrative rulemaking processes. The meeting highlighted key discussions, challenges, and constitutional concerns surrounding the bill. While the first segment of the transcript was incomplete and repetitive, the second segment provided a detailed account of the committee’s deliberations. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **Purpose of House Bill 274**
The bill aims to strengthen legislative oversight of administrative rules to ensure they align with legislative intent and do not impose undue operational or financial burdens. Key proposals include requiring policy committees to review proposed rules and tightening the authority granted to state agencies in rulemaking.

### **Key Discussions and Concerns**

1. **Constitutional Issues**  
   The committee debated the constitutionality of allowing a single committee to block rules without full legislative approval. Members referenced a 1981 New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling (*121 N.H. 552*), which found that such unilateral actions violate the separation of powers.

2. **Role of JLCAR**  
   The Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) currently reviews rules for compliance with legislative intent. While some members argued that JLCAR is already effective, others advocated for additional oversight by policy committees to enhance accountability.

3. **Practical Challenges of Legislative Involvement**  
   Concerns were raised about the feasibility of requiring policy committees to review rules year-round, given that the legislature typically operates from January to June. Legislators often do not engage with rulemaking processes outside of the session, which could hinder effective oversight.

4. **Exemptions from Rulemaking**  
   The committee discussed repealing exemptions for certain entities, such as the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority, from administrative rulemaking. Representatives from these entities argued that their unique structures and federal mandates make such exemptions necessary.

5. **Broad vs. Specific Rulemaking Authority**  
   There was a call to shift from broad rulemaking authority to more specific directives for state agencies. This would reduce ambiguity and ensure that rules align closely with legislative intent.

6. **Public Access to Rules**  
   Concerns were raised about rules that incorporate external documents or internet content, potentially requiring the public to pay to access the full text of rules. This issue was flagged as a barrier to transparency.

7. **Retaliation Protections**  
   The bill includes provisions to prevent retaliation against individuals who object to rules, but no clear enforcement process was outlined, raising questions about its effectiveness.

8. **Fiscal Impact**  
   While the bill lacks a fiscal note, members anticipated significant financial implications from increased oversight and rulemaking requirements.

### **Committee Conclusions**
The committee concluded that **House Bill 274**, in its current form, would create substantial practical and constitutional challenges and may not achieve its intended goals. Members acknowledged the need for further refinement and planned to reconvene in September to address the concerns raised during the session.

### **Overall Context**
The meeting underscored the complexities of balancing legislative oversight with the practicalities of administrative rulemaking. While the bill seeks to enhance accountability and alignment with legislative intent, its implementation faces significant hurdles, including constitutional concerns, resource constraints, and potential impacts on public access and agency operations. The committee’s ongoing work will focus on refining the bill to address these issues while maintaining its core objectives.
