**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on School Building Aid and Charter Schools (June 12, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on June 12, 2023, focused on critical discussions surrounding **school building aid**, with particular attention to **House Bill 354 (HBA 354)**, which addresses **charter school building aid**. The meeting highlighted the complexities of funding school infrastructure, challenges in the current system, and the need for sustainable solutions to support both traditional public schools and charter schools.

### **Key Discussions and Issues**

#### **1. HBA 354: Charter School Building Aid**
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to allow public charter schools that own their buildings to apply for state school building aid. This addresses a contradiction in current law where charter schools are both prohibited and eligible for aid.
   - **Legislative History**: Representative Maureen Mooney, the bill's prime sponsor, explained that previous legislation faced questions about building ownership. HBA 354 clarifies that only charter schools owning their buildings can apply. The bill was retained in committee, included in House Bill 2, passed the House, but was removed in the Senate. It is now being reconsidered.

#### **2. School Building Aid Challenges**
   - **Funding Formula Issues**: The current funding formula, including a proposed per capita model, has been criticized for leaving some districts waiting decades for aid. Smaller projects (e.g., renovations under $3 million) struggle to compete with larger projects (e.g., $20-80 million) due to a scoring system that prioritizes new construction and consolidation.
   - **Funding Cap**: Building aid is capped at $50 million annually, which is insufficient to meet statewide needs. Many districts feel they will never receive aid due to the backlog.
   - **Historical Context**: Building aid has been available since the 1940s, but a 10-year moratorium from 2010-2019 disrupted funding. The moratorium was lifted in 2021, but funding remains limited. The state pays 30-60% of construction costs, depending on district wealth, with an average of 38%. Since 2013, 80% of aid is paid upfront.

#### **3. Charter School Dissolution and Asset Management**
   - **Dissolution Plans**: Charter schools are required to have dissolution plans as part of their charter applications, detailing what happens to assets (e.g., buildings) if the school closes. This includes addressing any state or federal funds used in construction or renovation.
   - **Reimbursement**: If a school changes its use within 20 years of receiving aid, it must repay the full amount of the award. Prorating aid and ensuring funds are used appropriately remain challenges.
   - **Ownership**: Historically, charter schools were not allowed to take on debt, leading many to lease rather than purchase buildings. This has changed, with more charter schools now owning their buildings.

#### **4. Future Considerations and Solutions**
   - **Sustainability**: The committee emphasized the need for long-term funding solutions and consistent criteria for assessing school building conditions.
   - **Special Education Spaces**: Adjustments to the funding formula may be needed to address special education needs.
   - **Construction Costs**: Costs are capped at $550 per square foot, but this excludes additional expenses like engineering fees or equipment.
   - **Pending Applications**: For the 2024-2025 biennium, 17 schools applied for aid, but only three are likely to receive funding due to budget constraints.

#### **5. Proposed Amendments and Research**
   - **Proposed Amendment**: A discussion arose about an amendment related to funding classroom spaces, involving annual commitments to districts based on student numbers.
   - **Research and Resources**: The committee plans to research how other states handle building aid and charter school funding, using resources like the National Charter School Resource Center to inform future decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing limited state resources with the growing infrastructure needs of both traditional public schools and charter schools. Key issues include addressing funding inequities, supporting smaller projects, ensuring accountability in charter school funding, and developing sustainable long-term solutions. The committee plans to continue its work in the fall, focusing on finding equitable and effective ways to support all schools in the state.
