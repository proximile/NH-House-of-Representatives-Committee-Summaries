**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (06/27/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on June 27, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 533**, which addresses the Department of Education’s (DOE) authority to investigate educator misconduct, including the potential granting of subpoena power to the DOE commissioner. The meeting highlighted complex issues surrounding student safety, educator accountability, and the protection of individual rights, with testimony from stakeholders and extensive deliberation among committee members.

### Key Discussions and Concerns:
1. **Subpoena Power and Educator Misconduct**:
   - The central focus of the discussion was the need for the DOE to have subpoena power to access unredacted or complete internal documents from school districts during investigations of educator misconduct. Richard Farrell, an investigator for the DOE, emphasized the challenges in obtaining critical information, particularly when school districts or third-party attorneys withhold or heavily redact documents. This lack of access hampers thorough investigations and due process, potentially allowing educators who pose risks to students to avoid accountability.
   - Farrell cited historical cases, such as the "Conquered Case," where serious educator misconduct was difficult to address due to restricted access to crucial evidence. He noted a decline in cooperation from school districts over the past decade, with increasing legal roadblocks.

2. **Parental Rights and Transparency**:
   - Barrett Christine, the executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, raised concerns about the need for safeguards and parameters if subpoena power is granted. She emphasized protecting parental rights and ensuring transparency in the investigative process.
   - Representative Christine Perez, speaking as a parent, underscored the importance of protecting students from educators who engage in misconduct. She highlighted how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed parents to issues within schools and urged the committee to address the long-term impact of allowing problematic educators to move between districts without consequences.

3. **Origins and Evolution of the Bill**:
   - The bill initially aimed to allow the DOE to file complaints on behalf of parents with the Human Rights Commission. However, a non-germane amendment introduced the idea of granting subpoena power to the DOE commissioner for investigations related to the **New Hampshire Educator Code of Conduct**. This amendment shifted the focus of the bill and created confusion among committee members.

4. **Concerns and Skepticism**:
   - Several representatives expressed hesitation about moving forward with the bill without further clarity and information. Concerns were raised about potential unintended consequences, the need for guardrails to protect student and parent rights, and the complexity of the issues involved.
   - Some questioned whether the bill addresses a genuine need, as no credible violations of the relevant statutes have been reported. Others noted the political sensitivity of the issue, given the contentious relationship between educators and the DOE.

5. **Educator Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Process**:
   - The discussion also touched on the **New Hampshire Educator Code of Conduct**, which outlines ethical standards for educators. Representative Rick Ladd, chair of the House Education Committee, shared insights into ongoing efforts to refine the code and improve the disciplinary process for educators.

### Next Steps:
The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issue and the lack of unanimity among its members. They agreed to revisit the topic in September, with plans to conduct independent research over the summer. This research will include examining how other states handle subpoena power within their public education systems. The committee will consider drafting a new bill or amending the existing one to address concerns and ensure that any legislation is carefully vetted to avoid unintended consequences.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing the need for investigative authority with the protection of individual rights. It highlighted the importance of ensuring transparency, safeguarding parental and student rights, and addressing the complexities of educator misconduct investigations. The committee’s decision to delay further action and conduct additional research reflects a commitment to thoughtful and well-informed policymaking.
