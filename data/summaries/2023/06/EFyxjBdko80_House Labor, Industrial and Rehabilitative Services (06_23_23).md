The **New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Committee** meeting on **June 23, 2023**, addressed a range of labor and employment-related issues, focusing on legislative proposals and safety programs. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing employee protections, workplace safety, and employer responsibilities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered across the four segments:

---

### **1. Protections for Volunteer Firefighters**
The committee extensively discussed a bill aimed at protecting **volunteer firefighters** from employer discipline or discharge when responding to emergencies while on their way to work. Key points included:
- **Intent of the Bill**: The legislation seeks to mirror existing protections for EMTs under **RSA 153-A:17**, ensuring that volunteer firefighters are not penalized for responding to emergencies en route to work. The goal is to encourage volunteer firefighting without fear of job loss.
- **Scope and Amendments**: Concerns were raised about the bill's scope, particularly whether it should extend to firefighters responding to calls via pagers or during other times (e.g., returning from lunch). The committee considered narrowing the language to focus specifically on incidents occurring while en route to work.
- **Employer Concerns**: Legislators debated the potential burden on employers, especially small businesses, and whether municipalities or employers should bear financial responsibility for lost productivity. There was also discussion about whether the bill might discourage employers from hiring firefighters.
- **Future Action**: The committee agreed to draft an amendment to **RSA 153-A:17** to include firefighters, ensuring consistency with EMT protections. The amendment will be circulated for review before the next meeting.

### **2. Safety Programs and Regulatory Compliance**
The committee explored enhancements to workplace **safety programs and training**, with a focus on aligning state standards with federal OSHA regulations. Key discussions included:
- **Safety Training Initiatives**: The Deputy Commissioner highlighted existing safety programs, such as ergonomic training and proper lifting techniques, tailored to specific job roles across state departments.
- **Transition to OSHA Standards**: The committee considered transitioning from Department of Labor (DOL) standards to OSHA standards, which would require evaluating existing statutes and potentially creating new language or appropriations.
- **Future Planning**: Plans were made to involve employers, employee representatives, and other stakeholders in September meetings to gather input on necessary changes and improvements.
- **Resource Allocation**: The need for potential appropriations to support the transition and implementation of new safety standards was acknowledged.

### **3. Unemployment Benefits and Therapeutic Cannabis Protections**
Two key bills were discussed: **House Bill 190** (unemployment benefits duration) and **House Bill 82 FN** (employment protection for therapeutic cannabis program participants). Key points included:
- **House Bill 190**: The bill proposes reducing the duration of unemployment benefits from 26 to 22 weeks while increasing the weekly benefit amount. Concerns were raised about the impact on individuals who take longer to find employment due to disabilities, childcare responsibilities, or retraining needs. The committee debated the balance between cost savings and supporting unemployed individuals.
- **House Bill 82 FN**: This bill seeks to protect employees from discrimination based on their participation in the stateâ€™s **therapeutic cannabis program**. Discussions centered on the Supreme Court ruling requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations for therapeutic cannabis users. Some representatives emphasized the need to protect employees using prescribed medication, while others raised concerns about impairment in safety-sensitive roles (e.g., law enforcement, healthcare, or transportation). Amendments were suggested to narrow the bill's scope.

### **4. Medical Marijuana in the Workplace**
The committee revisited the issue of **medical marijuana** in the workplace, particularly its implications for workplace safety and employment rights. Key points included:
- **Employee Rights**: Some representatives argued that medical marijuana should be recognized as a legitimate therapy, and employees should not be penalized for its use. Others highlighted the need for employers to retain discretion in hiring decisions, especially for safety-sensitive roles.
- **Drug Testing**: There was debate over whether drug testing for marijuana should be eliminated unless there is a clear safety risk.
- **Broader Context**: The discussion reflected the ongoing tension between workplace safety, employer rights, and employee protections, particularly as cannabis legalization becomes more widespread.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Balancing Protections and Responsibilities**: Across all topics, the committee grappled with the challenge of balancing employee protections (e.g., for volunteer firefighters, therapeutic cannabis users) with employer rights and workplace safety concerns.
2. **Legislative Refinement**: The committee emphasized the need for narrowly focused legislation to address specific issues while avoiding unintended consequences.
3. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Future meetings will involve employers, employee representatives, and other stakeholders to ensure comprehensive and practical solutions.
4. **Alignment with Existing Laws**: Efforts were made to align new legislation with existing statutes (e.g., RSA 153-A:17 for EMTs) and federal standards (e.g., OSHA).

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of labor and employment issues, with the committee working to craft legislation that supports employees while addressing the practical concerns of employers and ensuring workplace safety.
