The transcript captures a Committee of Conference meeting in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, focusing on two bills: **HB 211** and **HB 607**. Here’s a summary of the key points:

### **HB 211**
- **Overview**: HB 211 was initially a housekeeping bill. The Senate added two amendments (Senate Bill 60 and Senate Bill 61) but later resolved issues with those bills.
- **Decision**: The Senate agreed to recede from its amendments and concur with the original House position. The committee voted unanimously to accept the Senate’s decision, and no further amendments were needed. The Office of Legislative Services (OLS) would handle the report.

### **HB 607**
- **Overview**: HB 607 was significantly altered by the Senate, primarily addressing charitable gaming and the "rake" (the percentage taken from wagers). The Senate aimed to reduce the rake to make gaming more competitive for charities and players.
- **Key Debate**: The House expressed concerns about the lack of a moratorium on Historic Horse Racing (HHR) machines, which they argued needed further review to assess their impact on charities and communities. The House pushed for at least a two-year moratorium, while the Senate opposed it, citing potential vetoes and the need to pass the bill to benefit charities and operators.
- **Study Commission**: A study commission on charitable gaming, including HHR, was established through the budget. The Senate argued this would address concerns without a moratorium, while the House insisted on immediate action to pause HHR expansion.
- **Outcome**: The committee reached an impasse, with no agreement on the moratorium. Since unanimous agreement is required for a Committee of Conference report, no report was prepared, and the issue remains unresolved.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgment of the disagreement and no further action taken on HB 607.
