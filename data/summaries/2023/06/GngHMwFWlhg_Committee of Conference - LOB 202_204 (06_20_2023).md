The transcript captures a **Committee of Conference** meeting in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, focusing on **House Bill 211** and **House Bill 607**. Here’s a summary of the key points:

### **House Bill 211**:
- **Chair**: Representative Michael Bozen.
- **Discussion**: HB 211 was initially a housekeeping bill, but the Senate added amendments (Senate Bill 60 and 61). The Senate has since resolved issues with those bills. 
- **Outcome**: The Senate agreed to recede from its amendment request and concur with the original House position. No further amendments were needed, and the Office of Legislative Services (OLS) was directed to prepare a report reflecting this agreement.

### **House Bill 607**:
- **Focus**: The bill was significantly altered by the Senate, turning it into a different piece of legislation. The primary issue was the **rake** (the percentage taken from poker pots) in charitable gaming.
- **Senate Position**: The Senate amended the bill to reduce the rake from 20% to a maximum of $250, addressing concerns that high rakes were deterring players and harming charities.
- **House Position**: The House strongly advocated for a **moratorium on Historic Horse Racing (HHR)** machines, citing the need for a thorough review of their impact on charities and communities. The House proposed a minimum five-year moratorium, later suggesting a two-year compromise.
- **Disagreement**: The Senate opposed any moratorium, arguing it would be a "poison pill" leading to a veto by the governor. They emphasized the need to pass the bill to benefit charities, operators, and players.
- **Study Commission**: Both sides acknowledged the importance of a **Charitable Gaming Commission** (established in the budget) to study HHR and its impacts. However, the House insisted on a moratorium during the study period, while the Senate resisted.
- **Outcome**: The Committee of Conference could not reach a unanimous agreement, as required. The meeting ended without a resolution, and OLS was informed of the impasse.

### **Key Themes**:
- **Charitable Gaming**: Concerns about the financial impact on charities and the proliferation of HHR machines.
- **Moratorium Debate**: The House sought a pause on HHR expansion, while the Senate prioritized immediate legislative changes.
- **Governor’s Veto**: The Senate warned that a moratorium would likely lead to a veto, leaving no legislative solution.
- **Study Commission**: Both sides agreed on the need for a commission to review charitable gaming, but disagreed on whether to halt HHR expansion during the study.

The meeting concluded with no consensus, leaving the fate of HB 607 unresolved.
