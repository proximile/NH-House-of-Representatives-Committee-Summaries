The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held an executive session on May 31, 2023, to discuss **Senate Bill 14 (SB14)** and its potential amendment with **House Bill 473 (HB473)**. The session centered on whether to attach HB473, which reduces first-time possession of a controlled substance from a felony to a misdemeanor, to SB14, a bill addressing surveillance cameras on private property. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Advocacy for HB473**: The chair argued that HB473 is crucial to prevent young people, particularly college students, from being labeled felons for minor drug possession, which can ruin their futures by limiting opportunities such as military service, voting, firearm possession, and federal housing. The bill had previously passed the committee unanimously and the House on a voice vote.

2. **Concerns Over Strategy**: Some members, like Representative Muse, expressed concern that attaching HB473 to SB14 could jeopardize the passage of SB14, given the Senate’s previous rejection of HB473. They argued that the Senate is unlikely to support the combined bill, risking the loss of both pieces of legislation.

3. **Support for Amendment**: Despite concerns, the chair and others argued that the House should push its position and advocate for the policy change. They suggested that a committee of conference could be used to negotiate and potentially remove HB473 if the Senate objected, ensuring SB14’s passage.

4. **Voting Outcome**: The committee voted **11-9** to reconsider the bill and **13-7** to amend SB14 by attaching HB473. Later, the committee voted **14-6** to pass SB14 as amended, sending it to the full House for further debate.

5. **Broader Context**: The discussion highlighted a tension between policy priorities and strategic considerations. While many members supported the intent of HB473, they disagreed on whether attaching it to SB14 was the best approach, given the Senate’s resistance and the importance of SB14 to constituents.

Ultimately, the committee moved forward with the amendment, emphasizing the need to address the issue of felony charges for first-time drug possession while acknowledging the risks to SB14’s passage. The amended bill will now proceed to the full House for further deliberation.
