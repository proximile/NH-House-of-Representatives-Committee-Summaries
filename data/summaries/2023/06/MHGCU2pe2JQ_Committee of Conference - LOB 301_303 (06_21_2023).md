### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (June 21, 2023)

The Committee of Conference meeting on June 21, 2023, addressed several key bills: **HB 119**, **HB 221**, **HB 442**, and **HB 75**. The discussions focused on environmental issues, agricultural operations, redistricting, and legislative compromises. Here’s a detailed summary of the proceedings:

---

#### **HB 119: Homestead Food Operations and Meat Sales**
- The bill aimed to regulate **Homestead food operations** and permit the sale of meat from uninspected bison, elk, or red deer.
- The **Senate amended the bill** by removing a $35,000 annual sales cap for homestead food operations and adding provisions for the slaughter of elk, red deer, and bison.
- The **House raised concerns** about disease surveillance (e.g., CWD, brucellosis, tuberculosis) for these animals.
- Representative Bixby proposed an amendment to ensure proper enclosure and propagation of red deer and elk within existing herds, prohibit out-of-state imports, and test animals for CWD in case of atypical deaths.
- A **two-year sunset provision** was added, with a study committee tasked with developing a long-term program by July 1, 2025. The amendment was adopted, and both the House and Senate agreed to the amended bill.

#### **HB 221: Agricultural Land Development, Advanced Deposit Wagering, and Game Cameras**
- The bill initially focused on **agricultural land development rights** but was amended by the Senate to include **game camera regulations** and **advanced deposit wagering** for horse racing.
- The **House non-concurred** with the Senate’s additions, particularly the advanced deposit wagering language, which the House Ways and Means Committee preferred to address separately.
- Representative Sanborn proposed an amendment to **remove the advanced deposit wagering language**, allowing the House to work on it independently in the fall.
- The Senate agreed to the amendment, retaining the **game camera language** and a provision adding a member to the oversight committee. Both sides concurred with the amended bill.

#### **HB 442: Derelict Fishing Gear Cleanup**
- The bill sought to address **derelict fishing gear** in coastal waters, which poses significant environmental and animal welfare concerns.
- The Senate version allocated funds for cleanup but delayed implementation until 2024, which the House found insufficient given the **urgent need** to address the issue.
- Representative Hill proposed amendments to **start cleanup efforts immediately**, allowing divers to locate and report derelict traps and release trapped animals.
- Concerns were raised about **divers touching traps** under current law, and the Senate suggested requiring Fish and Game to submit a **strategic plan by September 30, 2023**, outlining implementation, costs, and funding sources.
- The House emphasized the need for **accountability** and potential follow-up legislation if the plan requires changes to existing laws. While both sides committed to finding a solution, the final agreement was not fully detailed in the transcript.

#### **HB 75 and HB 270: Stratford County Commissioners' Redistricting**
- The primary focus was on **redistricting Stratford County Commissioners**. The Senate amended **HB 75** to include provisions from **HB 270**, which proposed electing commissioners by district rather than countywide.
- The House had previously retained **HB 270**, but the Senate’s amendment revived the issue. Arguments for redistricting included:
  - Ensuring better representation for rural areas.
  - Aligning Stratford County with the nine other counties in New Hampshire that elect commissioners by district.
  - Addressing concerns of disenfranchisement among minority groups in the county.
- **Opponents** argued that the process lacked sufficient stakeholder input and raised concerns about the partisan nature of the redistricting effort.
- The House ultimately voted **3-1 to accede to the Senate’s amended version of HB 75**, which included the redistricting plan.
- General discussions highlighted the complexity of redistricting, the need for fair representation, and concerns about gerrymandering in the current system.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Collaboration and Compromise**: The House and Senate worked together to resolve differences through amendments and discussions, particularly on HB 119 and HB 221.
2. **Urgency and Accountability**: The House pushed for immediate action on derelict fishing gear cleanup (HB 442) and emphasized the need for clear reporting and accountability mechanisms.
3. **Environmental and Public Health Concerns**: Discussions on HB 119 and HB 442 highlighted concerns about animal diseases (e.g., CWD) and environmental damage from derelict fishing gear.
4. **Redistricting and Representation**: The passage of the amended HB 75 marked a significant shift toward district-based elections for Stratford County Commissioners, addressing issues of representation and fairness.
5. **Funding and Implementation**: Across all bills, there was a focus on ensuring proper funding and guardrails for program implementation.
