**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee Meeting (June 13, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee convened on June 13, 2023, to discuss fisheries management, sustainability, and the economic and environmental challenges facing the state’s marine resources. The meeting featured presentations from state officials, international stakeholders, and industry representatives, highlighting the complexities of managing fisheries in the context of climate change, regulatory frameworks, and economic impacts.

### Key Discussions and Themes:

1. **Fisheries Management and Regulation**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of science-based fishery management plans under the **Magnuson-Stevens Act**, which aims to prevent overfishing and ensure sustainable fish populations. The **New England Fisheries Management Council** and the **Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission** play critical roles in setting regulations and quotas based on stock assessments conducted annually or triennially.
   - **Cherie Patterson**, Chief of Marine Fisheries for the NH Fish and Game Department, provided an overview of New Hampshire’s approach to sustainable fisheries management. She highlighted the state’s reliance on data from surveys, netting, and long-term monitoring, often in collaboration with institutions like the **University of New Hampshire**.

2. **Economic Impact of Fisheries**:
   - The **lobster industry** is New Hampshire’s most economically significant fishery, though the state’s short coastline limits large-scale fisheries compared to neighboring states. The industry has faced challenges, such as the collapse of the Atlantic herring population, leading to a shift to menhaden as bait.
   - Other economically viable species include **groundfish (cod, pollock, haddock)**, flounders, and shellfish like oysters and clams. **Aquaculture** is growing, with a focus on oysters, mussels, and kelp, alongside small-scale research on trout and salmon.

3. **Climate Change and Environmental Challenges**:
   - Climate change was a recurring theme, with warmer waters impacting species like **striped bass** and **northern shrimp**. These changes complicate efforts to achieve restoration goals within set timeframes.
   - The state is addressing issues like **ghost gear** (derelict fishing traps) that harm marine life and working on recovery plans for overfished species.

4. **Funding and Licensing**:
   - The **Fish and Game Department** is primarily self-funded through license fees, with some federal support. Commercial fishing licenses are issued based on the department’s needs and public affordability, with flat fees rather than taxes on landings.
   - Enforcement ensures compliance with regulations, such as size and egg-bearing restrictions for lobsters.

5. **Collaboration and Advocacy**:
   - The committee highlighted the importance of collaboration between state, federal, and international entities, as well as the role of volunteer groups, fishermen, and advocacy in shaping fisheries policies.
   - Indonesian representatives shared insights on managing fisheries in their country, emphasizing the need to balance economic interests with conservation.

6. **Legislative and Policy Efforts**:
   - Legislative efforts, such as bills addressing lobster harvesting and ghost gear cleanup, were discussed. Policy decisions aim to balance supporting fishermen’s livelihoods with ensuring sustainable fisheries.

7. **State Representatives’ Role**:
   - Representatives noted that New Hampshire’s legislature is volunteer-based, with members paid $100 annually. This system encourages turnover and citizen representation, fostering pride in serving without financial incentives.

### Future Initiatives:
The state is working on several initiatives to address ongoing challenges, including:
- Improving **aquaculture** practices.
- Cleaning up **ghost gear** to protect marine life.
- Adapting to the impacts of **climate change** on fisheries.
- Enhancing data collection and research to inform sustainable management practices.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and regulatory factors in fisheries management. New Hampshire’s approach emphasizes collaboration, science-based decision-making, and adaptive strategies to ensure the sustainability of its marine resources while supporting the livelihoods of those who depend on them. The session concluded with a Q&A, where committee members and visitors discussed specific issues like stock assessments, policy-making processes, and the role of research in fisheries management.
