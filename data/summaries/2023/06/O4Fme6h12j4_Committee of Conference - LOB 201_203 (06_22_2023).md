The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference met on June 22, 2023, to discuss **HB 315**, a bill addressing the "gay panic defense" and related issues. The primary focus was on whether certain protected classes (e.g., race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation) should be included in the bill and how to prevent unintended consequences while ensuring the bill’s intent was preserved.

### Key Points:
1. **Senate's Position**: The Senate had concerns about the House’s broader inclusion of protected classes, fearing unintended consequences. They proposed narrowing the bill to focus specifically on preventing the use of a defendant’s knowledge of a victim’s gender identity, sexual orientation, etc., as a defense in criminal cases.
2. **House's Position**: The House initially passed the bill with a broader scope, including race, religion, and political beliefs, but acknowledged the Senate’s concerns about potential legal complications.
3. **Proposed Amendment**: Representative Lynn introduced an amendment based on input from a law professor, which aimed to carefully craft language to eliminate the "gay panic defense" while avoiding unintended effects on self-defense claims, particularly for women facing unwanted sexual advances.
4. **Matthew Shepard Reference**: Senator Whitley raised concerns about ensuring the bill addressed scenarios like the Matthew Shepard case, where unwanted sexual advances were part of the defense. However, there was caution about ensuring the language did not inadvertently limit a woman’s right to self-defense.
5. **Final Agreement**: After discussion, the committee agreed on language that narrowly targeted the "gay panic defense" without affecting self-defense claims. The amendment explicitly stated that a defendant’s knowledge of a victim’s gender identity or sexual orientation could not be used as a mitigating factor in criminal cases.
6. **Future Legislation**: Representative Sean Filiou expressed intent to reintroduce legislation in the next session to address the broader protections (e.g., race, religion) originally included in the House version.

### Outcome:
The committee reached a consensus on the amended language, which was approved by both House and Senate conferees. The bill will now move forward with the agreed-upon changes.
