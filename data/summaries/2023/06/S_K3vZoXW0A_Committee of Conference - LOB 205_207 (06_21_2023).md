The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 21, 2023, focused on two key bills: **HB 610** (Bail Reform) and **HB 611** (Therapeutic Cannabis Program and State-Controlled Cannabis Sales). The discussions were marked by intense debate, compromises, and efforts to address complex issues in the criminal justice system and cannabis regulation.

### **HB 611: Therapeutic Cannabis Program and State-Controlled Cannabis Sales**

1. **Commission Structure and Purpose**  
   The primary focus of HB 611 was to address eligibility criteria for the therapeutic cannabis program and establish a commission to study the feasibility of state-controlled sales of cannabis. The commission’s mandate includes proposing legislation for a state-controlled cannabis sales model. Key points of debate included:  
   - **Commission Composition**: There was significant disagreement over the commission’s structure. The House advocated for a broad, inclusive commission with diverse stakeholders, including legislators, the Attorney General, the governor, the Liquor Commission chair, medical professionals, law enforcement, and industry representatives (e.g., the New Hampshire Cannabis Association and alternative treatment centers). The Senate, however, favored a smaller, legislator-only committee. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, with the commission including legislators and key state officials but also allowing for consultation with stakeholders.  
   - **Purpose and Timeline**: The commission will study health risks, legal issues, enforcement mechanisms, and consumer warnings, with a report due by November 1, 2023, to enable legislative action in the next session. The language was clarified to ensure the commission’s work has a clear endpoint focused on proposing legislation.

2. **Enforcement and Regulation**  
   Concerns were raised about the lack of enforcement for THC products, particularly those sold to minors. The discussion highlighted the need for state-level regulation, as federal enforcement is inconsistent. The commission’s study will address enforcement mechanisms to protect youth from access to cannabis.

3. **Sunset Provision for THC Products**  
   A one-year sunset provision was added for THC products, providing businesses with a grace period to adjust to new regulations while ensuring the issue is addressed promptly.

4. **Severe Pain and Cannabis**  
   The bill initially aimed to remove the requirement that patients try opioids before being prescribed cannabis for severe pain, addressing the opioid crisis and providing alternative pain management options.

5. **Synthetic Hemp Derivatives**  
   The bill also addressed synthetic hemp derivatives, which are federally classified as Schedule I drugs. There was debate over how to handle these substances in state law, with concerns about businesses affected by sudden changes in legality.

6. **Effective Date and Sunset Clause**  
   The House proposed an effective date upon passage and a sunset clause to allow for revisiting the law if issues arise.

### **HB 610: Bail Reform**

1. **Reopening the Committee of Conference**  
   The committee reconvened to discuss HB 610, which addresses changes to the bail reform structure. The focus was on ensuring the House’s position was solid and that the bill addressed systemic issues in the criminal justice system.

2. **Bipartisan Concerns**  
   Representatives expressed concerns about unintended consequences, such as individuals being held for 36 hours for minor offenses, potentially losing jobs or facing personal hardships. There were also concerns about the bill being an unfunded mandate for counties.

3. **Bail Tracking System**  
   A significant portion of the discussion centered on the need for a bail tracking system to help law enforcement know if someone is out on bail. While there was agreement on the importance of this system, there were disagreements on other aspects of the bill, particularly around which crimes should be included.

4. **Senate vs. House Positions**  
   The Senate proposed a bill focused on violent crimes, but the House expressed concerns about the constitutionality and practicality of some provisions. The House suggested focusing on the bail tracking system as a first step and revisiting other issues later.

5. **Deadlock and Break**  
   The committee struggled to reach agreement, with the House insisting that certain provisions would not pass. The meeting ended with a decision to take a break and reconvene later, though it was unclear if consensus could be reached.

### **Key Outcomes**

- **HB 611**: The House and Senate reached a compromise on the commission’s structure and purpose, agreeing on the need to study and propose legislation for a state-controlled cannabis sales model. The commission’s report is due by November 1, 2023, and the bill includes a one-year sunset provision for THC products.

- **HB 610**: The committee remained deadlocked on key issues, particularly around which crimes should be subject to stricter bail provisions. The House emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach rather than piecemeal fixes, with a focus on implementing a bail tracking system as a first step.

### **Overall Themes**

The meeting highlighted the challenges of addressing complex issues like bail reform and cannabis legalization. While HB 611 saw progress with a compromise on the commission’s structure and purpose, HB 610 remained contentious, with significant disagreements between the House and Senate. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing diverse perspectives, ensuring practical and constitutional solutions, and addressing unintended consequences in both the criminal justice system and cannabis regulation.
