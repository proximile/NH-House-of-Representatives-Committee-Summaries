The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on June 23, 2023, addressed a wide range of critical health and human services issues, focusing on Medicaid, youth mental health, developmental services, and other key areas. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Medicaid and Health System Updates**
1. **Corrective Action Plan and Provider Readiness**: The committee discussed ongoing efforts to implement a corrective action plan, including hybrid in-person and virtual sessions for families and providers. Training sessions, particularly for Medicaid billing and the New Hampshire Easy system, were emphasized. A dedicated phone line and on-call schedule were established to address provider and individual concerns.

2. **Medicaid Payment System Blackout Period**: A three-week blackout period for the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) began on June 26, with contingency plans in place to mitigate cash flow issues for providers through the New Hampshire First system.

3. **Granite Advantage and Medicaid Enrollment**: Enrollment in Granite Advantage, New Hampshire’s Medicaid expansion program, peaked at 96,515 in March but dropped to 69,024 by June. The committee discussed the unwinding process for ineligible individuals, with approximately 50% retaining coverage. Outreach efforts, including direct calls and postcard campaigns, were highlighted to encourage re-enrollment.

4. **Collaboration with Employment Services**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is working with New Hampshire Employment Security to connect individuals losing Medicaid or unemployment benefits with job training and employment opportunities.

### **Therapeutic Cannabis Program**
The annual report on the Therapeutic Cannabis Program was presented, showing stagnant growth with around 13,600 registered patients. Barriers to access, such as limited dispensary locations and restrictive qualifying conditions, were discussed. Concerns about competition from recreational cannabis and the black market were also raised.

### **Youth Mental Health and Social Media**
1. **Surgeon General’s Advisory on Social Media**: The committee discussed the growing concerns around social media’s impact on youth mental health, including increased rates of cyberbullying, sadness, and hopelessness, particularly among girls. The Surgeon General’s advisory emphasized the need for education, policy changes, and public engagement.

2. **Governor’s Executive Order**: Governor Sununu issued an executive order directing the Department of Education and DHHS to develop a curriculum on social media literacy, review research on social media harms, and create a public engagement plan to protect youth.

3. **Committee Discussions**: Members emphasized the importance of a multi-tiered approach involving stakeholders, addressing both boys’ and girls’ mental health, and balancing regulation with individual freedoms.

### **Developmental Services and Newborn Screening**
1. **Developmental Services Redesign**: The Bureau of Developmental Services is focused on compliance with a CMS corrective action plan, which ends on July 1. Stakeholder engagement through webinars and in-person meetings has been a priority, though no pilot programs for redesign have started yet.

2. **Newborn Screening Program**: New Hampshire’s program screens for 37 disorders, with 99% of newborns screened in 2021. Challenges like timely specimen collection were discussed, and plans for an online ordering system for filter papers were highlighted.

3. **Lead Testing**: The committee explored integrating lead testing into newborn screening but noted that current state law mandates testing at one year of age. A pilot program is testing pregnant women for lead to assess home safety.

### **Facility Updates**
1. **Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF)**: New Hampshire’s first-ever PRTF for youth aged 5-21 with severe behavioral health needs opened recently, marking a significant advancement in the state’s mental health care system.

2. **Youth Development Center (YDC)**: The state is transitioning from a correctional model to a therapeutic, secure facility for youth involved in the juvenile justice system. The pre-design phase is underway, with construction expected to be completed by November 2025, funded through federal ARPA dollars.

### **Alzheimer’s Subcommittee**
The re-establishment of the subcommittee on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias was discussed. Jessica Escalon from the Alzheimer’s Association highlighted the need to fill specific roles, including a person living with Alzheimer’s and a researcher with expertise in the field.

### **Future Meetings and Concerns**
The committee expressed concerns about the lack of meetings in July and August, with the next meeting scheduled for September 22. Members raised the need to address pressing issues during the summer and planned to seek clarification on the committee’s ability to meet during this period.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of addressing Medicaid enrollment, provider readiness, youth mental health, and developmental services in New Hampshire. The discussions highlighted the need for collaboration, policy changes, and public engagement to tackle these complex challenges effectively.
