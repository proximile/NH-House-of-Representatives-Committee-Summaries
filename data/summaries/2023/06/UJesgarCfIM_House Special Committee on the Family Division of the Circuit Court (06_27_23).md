### **Key Issues and Discussions**

1. **Child Support Guidelines and Shared Parenting**  
   - The committee explored methods for calculating child support, emphasizing fairness and consistency. One approach discussed was splitting the difference in costs between parents to ensure equitable financial contributions.  
   - Shared parenting and the presumption of equal (50/50) parenting time were debated. While some members supported this approach to reduce conflict, others highlighted complexities in cases involving domestic violence or differing work schedules.  
   - There was a call for clearer and more workable child support guidelines to improve consistency and fairness in determining financial responsibilities.

2. **Case Timelines and Efficiency**  
   - The need for clearer and more consistent timelines in family court cases was emphasized to reduce delays and improve efficiency.  
   - Specific attention was given to the prompt establishment of parenting plans and the challenges of scheduling and docket management in the courts.

3. **Pro Se Litigants**  
   - The increasing number of pro se (self-represented) litigants, who make up as much as 80% of family court cases in some instances, was a significant concern.  
   - Challenges faced by pro se litigants include understanding court procedures, Rules of Evidence, and accessing legal resources.  
   - Recommendations included providing better resources, such as accessible online systems, informational videos, and easy-to-understand forms, to assist self-represented individuals. The committee also stressed the importance of personal responsibility for those choosing to represent themselves.

4. **Mediation and Neutral Case Evaluation**  
   - The expansion of mediation services and neutral case evaluations was suggested to help families resolve disputes without going to court.  
   - Currently, neutral case evaluations are only offered in Concord, and the committee discussed the benefits of expanding these services to other areas.

5. **Rules of Evidence**  
   - There was debate about the inconsistent application of Rules of Evidence in family court, which can lead to confusion and unfair outcomes.  
   - The possibility of making Rules of Evidence more strictly applicable in family court was considered.

6. **Judicial Training and Accountability**  
   - The need for ongoing training and supervision for judges, especially those new to family court, was highlighted.  
   - The committee discussed whether legislative action could mandate continuing education for judges in family law, with some members noting that judicial training falls under the judicial branch’s purview.  
   - Ensuring judges are well-prepared to handle the complexities of family law cases was a key priority.

7. **Guardian ad Litem (GAL) System**  
   - Concerns were raised about the GAL system, including funding issues, qualifications, and the need for psychological expertise in cases involving domestic violence.  
   - Suggestions included expanding GAL roles to include professionals with psychological backgrounds and improving training to reduce bias.  
   - The committee also discussed the necessity and cost of mental health evaluations in family court cases, with some members arguing that these evaluations are often unnecessary and financially burdensome.

8. **Domestic Violence and Custody Issues**  
   - The intersection of domestic violence cases with family court proceedings was noted, with concerns about how these cases are handled and the potential for misuse of the system.  
   - The committee emphasized the importance of ensuring that the best interests of children are prioritized in cases involving domestic violence.

9. **Parenting and Visitation Centers**  
   - The closure of many parenting and visitation centers was noted, with suggestions to reopen or improve these facilities to better support families.  
   - Concerns were raised about the cost and accessibility of these centers, particularly for low-income families.

10. **Coordination Between Agencies**  
    - The need for better coordination between the family court, DCYF (Division for Children, Youth, and Families), and other agencies was emphasized to address overlapping issues and improve outcomes for families.

### **Legislative and Judicial Responsibilities**  
The committee explored the balance between legislative and judicial responsibilities in addressing family court issues. Key areas where legislative changes might be necessary include GAL roles, child support guidelines, and timelines for cases. Meanwhile, best practices and court rule changes (e.g., Rules of Evidence, one judge per family case) were identified as areas where recommendations could be made to the judiciary. The committee reiterated the importance of respecting the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches.

### **Next Steps and Recommendations**  
- The committee outlined plans for subcommittees to focus on specific issues (e.g., GAL roles, neutral case evaluation, Rules of Evidence) over the summer, with the goal of presenting findings and recommendations in the fall.  
- Members were encouraged to research national resources and best practices to adapt to New Hampshire’s unique context.  
- The committee will reconvene in September to review subcommittee findings and finalize recommendations, with a report expected by November.
