### **Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (06/19/2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 19, 2023, focused on three key bills: **HB 275**, **HB 536**, and **HB 610**. The discussions revolved around amendments, negotiations between House and Senate versions, and addressing contentious issues such as school tuition programs, charter school facilities, therapeutic cannabis, and bail reform. Here’s a detailed summary of the proceedings:

---

### **HB 275: School Tuition Programs**
The committee addressed differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill, which focuses on school tuition programs and the approval of schools by school boards.

- **Key Issues**:
  - The inclusion of "anchor schools" and whether parents should be allowed to pay the difference if a chosen school’s tuition exceeds a district’s cap. Some legislators argued this created inequity, while others supported parental choice.
  - The scope of the bill: whether it should apply only to high schools or include elementary and middle schools.
  - Transportation concerns, particularly regarding who should cover the costs for students attending out-of-district schools.

- **Outcome**:
  - The committee decided to strike certain language to make the bill more flexible, allowing it to apply to all grade levels. The committee agreed to concur with the Senate version of the bill as amended.

### **HB 536: Charter Public Schools and Unused Facilities**
The bill addressed charter schools' use of unused district facilities and established timelines for negotiations between school districts and charter schools.

- **Key Issues**:
  - The Senate version required school districts to engage in good faith negotiations within 60 days of receiving an offer from a charter school.
  - Concerns were raised that the bill unfairly favored charter schools, as it allowed them to accept or reject offers, potentially leaving taxpayers with maintenance costs for unused facilities.
  - Questions about the transfer of public property to private entities (charter schools are 501(c)(3) organizations) and whether this was in the best interest of taxpayers.

- **Outcome**:
  - The committee amended the bill by removing language that gave charter schools sole power to accept or reject offers, aiming to create a more balanced negotiation process.

### **HB 610: Therapeutic Cannabis and Bail Reform**
Originally focused on preventing discrimination against different types of providers in the therapeutic cannabis program, the bill was expanded to include bail reform provisions from Senate Bill 252.

1. **Therapeutic Cannabis**:
   - The bill sought to allow additional healthcare providers (e.g., podiatrists, dentists, optometrists) to certify patients for therapeutic cannabis, addressing gaps in the current system. This section received broad support.

2. **Bail Reform**:
   - **Section 3**: Proposed holding individuals accused of violent crimes without bail, which became a contentious issue. The House expressed concerns that the language would not pass, while the Senate insisted it was crucial for public safety. The House proposed removing Section 3, but the Senate was unwilling to negotiate without it.
   - **Section 4**: Proposed a $1 million appropriation for an electronic bail system to improve tracking of individuals on bail across jurisdictions. This was seen as a necessary but separate issue from the bail reform debate.

3. **Hemp-Derived Products**:
   - Sections 5 and 6 addressed hemp-derived products and labeling. Some members suggested moving these provisions to **HB 611** for a more comprehensive discussion on cannabis legalization.

- **Committee Dynamics**:
  - The House and Senate were at odds over the inclusion of Section 3 (bail reform). The House argued it would not pass, while the Senate viewed it as essential for addressing violent crime.

- **Next Steps**:
  - The committee recessed to allow members to consult with their respective leadership and agreed to reconvene at 9 A.M. on Wednesday to continue discussions, particularly on the contentious bail reform provisions and the electronic bail system.

### **Overall Outcomes**
- **HB 275**: The committee struck language to make the bill more inclusive of all grade levels and concurred with the Senate version.
- **HB 536**: The committee removed language to ensure a fairer negotiation process between school districts and charter schools.
- **HB 610**: The committee found common ground on therapeutic cannabis and the electronic bail system but remained divided on bail reform. Discussions were set to continue on Wednesday.

The meeting highlighted significant disagreements between the House and Senate on bail reform while making progress on other aspects of the bills.
