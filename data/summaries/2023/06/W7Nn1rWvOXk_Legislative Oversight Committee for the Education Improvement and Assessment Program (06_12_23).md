**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program (June 12, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on June 12, 2023, convened the Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program to address critical issues in the state’s education system. The meeting focused on improving educational standards, integrating mental health into the curriculum, and ensuring accountability for new initiatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **1. Agenda and Minutes Approval**  
The committee began by reviewing and approving the agenda and minutes from the previous meeting held on March 27, 2023.

### **2. Ed306 Rules Discussion**  
The committee discussed the proposed Ed306 preliminary minimum standards for public school approval. Concerns were raised about the lack of detailed feedback from public forums conducted by Fred Bramante, who is leading the proposed changes. The committee agreed to invite Bramante to a future meeting to provide more comprehensive information and gather meaningful input.

### **3. Civics Education**  
The committee reviewed the statutory language and funding for a new K-12 Civics education textbook, which was approved in HB2 with a $1 million allocation. The textbook, modeled after a program from Ohio, aims to provide a comprehensive and age-appropriate curriculum. Discussions also explored the potential for digital resources and the importance of ensuring accountability in measuring the effectiveness of the initiative. The committee emphasized the need for local assessment data and planned to request detailed information from the Department of Education, including Statewide NAEP results and citizenship and immigration test data.

### **4. Mental Health in Education**  
A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to integrating mental health education into the curriculum. Key points included:  
- **Placement in the Curriculum**: Members debated whether mental health should be a standalone component of educational adequacy or integrated into existing health and wellness programs under Ed306.40.  
- **Historical Context and Concerns**: A member shared experiences from their time as a principal in the 1970s-1990s, cautioning against over-identifying students for special education due to mental health issues like anxiety. They also highlighted past issues with the overprescription of medications like Ritalin for ADHD.  
- **Impact of COVID-19**: The committee acknowledged the pandemic’s lingering effects on students’ mental health, including isolation and delayed social and emotional development. Members stressed the need for schools to help students “catch up” to age-appropriate maturity levels.  
- **Reports and Compliance**: The committee discussed the need to review biennial reports from the Department of Education on compliance with health and wellness standards, particularly mental health components. Some members expressed frustration that these reports are not consistently shared or acted upon.  
- **Subcommittee Formation**: The committee considered forming a subcommittee to delve deeper into the issue, potentially inviting experts such as school psychologists, counselors, and representatives from organizations like NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) to provide insights.  
- **Language and Frameworks**: Members emphasized the importance of clearly defining mental health and integrating it into existing frameworks like the 306 rules, avoiding redundancy and ensuring clarity in educational standards.

### **5. Assessment and Accountability**  
The committee underscored the importance of accountability in measuring the effectiveness of new educational initiatives, particularly Civics education. They discussed the role of local assessments and requested data on district performance in this area.

### **6. Future Actions**  
The committee outlined several next steps, including:  
- Sending a letter to the Department of Education requesting detailed information on local assessments, Statewide NAEP results, and citizenship and immigration test data.  
- Scheduling a future meeting with Fred Bramante to discuss the proposed Ed306 changes in greater detail.  
- Reconvening in mid-September or October to continue discussions on mental health integration and review relevant reports.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to improving educational standards, addressing mental health in schools, and ensuring accountability for new initiatives. The discussions reflected the complexities of integrating mental health into the curriculum, the importance of expert input, and the need to address the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ well-being. The committee plans to continue its work through subcommittees and future meetings to achieve these goals.
