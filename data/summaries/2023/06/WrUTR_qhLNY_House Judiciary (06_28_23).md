**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on June 28, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on June 28, 2023, to address several key legislative issues, focusing on privacy protections, the Human Rights Commission (HRC), and the handling of discrimination cases. The meeting centered on two primary bills—**House Bill 314 (HB 314)** and **Senate Bill 255 (SB 255)**—as well as concerns related to the HRC’s case management and fairness in discrimination proceedings. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Human Rights Commission (HRC) and Discrimination Cases**
The committee discussed a bill addressing the HRC’s process for handling discrimination cases, particularly focusing on the respondent’s ability to remove cases to Superior Court after a probable cause finding. Key points included:
- **Case Removal to Superior Court**: New Hampshire and Rhode Island are among the few states that allow respondents to remove cases to court, a practice criticized as retaliatory and burdensome for claimants, especially low-wage workers who often cannot afford legal representation.
- **Performance Audit**: Stakeholders advocated for delaying a decision on the bill until fall to allow for the completion of a performance audit of the HRC, which would provide insights into the commission’s efficiency and the impact of increased staffing.
- **Fairness Concerns**: Supporters argued that the bill addresses fairness issues rather than resource allocation, aiming to prevent respondents from restarting the process in court, which disproportionately affects vulnerable employees.
- **Legal and Constitutional Arguments**: It was clarified that employers do not have a constitutional right to a jury trial in discrimination cases, and the burden of proof lies with the claimant.
- **Backlog and Case Outcomes**: The HRC has a backlog of 230 cases, with the oldest case dating back to February 2022. In 2022, 12.8% of cases were removed to court by complainants, 7.4% by respondents, and 24% were settled. The HRC encourages settlements and alternative resolutions to avoid court.
- **Next Steps**: The subcommittee agreed to reconvene in September to review the audit results and make a final decision on the bill.

### **2. Privacy Legislation: House Bill 314 (HB 314) and Senate Bill 255 (SB 255)**
The committee also debated two privacy-related bills, HB 314 and SB 255, which address privacy protections for government entities and private businesses, respectively.

#### **House Bill 314 (HB 314)**
- **Purpose**: HB 314 restricts government entities from acquiring, collecting, retaining, or using personal information from third-party providers without a search warrant based on probable cause. It also creates a private right of action against the government for violations.
- **Concerns**: The bill’s broad language and numerous exceptions raised concerns about clarity and implementation. Testimony from the Municipal Association highlighted issues with definitions of third-party providers and government liability.
- **Third-Party Doctrine**: The bill aims to address the third-party doctrine, which currently allows third-party providers (e.g., Verizon) to share personal information with the government without a warrant.
- **Balancing Privacy and Governance**: The committee discussed the need to balance privacy protections with practical governance, particularly for law enforcement and regulatory agencies.

#### **Senate Bill 255 (SB 255)**
- **Purpose**: SB 255, promoted by Microsoft and adopted in several states, allows consumers to opt out of companies using their personal information. However, it is currently an "opt-out" rather than "opt-in" model.
- **Concerns**:
  - **Opt-Out Process**: Companies can set their own opt-out procedures, making it complicated for consumers. Representative Kirk suggested a uniform opt-out process.
  - **Scope**: The bill only applies to companies with at least 100,000 New Hampshire subscribers, excluding smaller businesses, which was seen as unfair.
  - **Enforcement**: Enforcement is limited to the Attorney General, who must give companies 60 days to correct violations before taking action. The bill lacks a private right of action.
  - **Opt-In vs. Opt-Out**: Representative Kirk argued that an "opt-in" model would better protect privacy by requiring companies to actively seek consumer consent.
  - **Microsoft’s Role**: Microsoft clarified that the bill is not solely its initiative but is supported by a coalition of stakeholders. They emphasized the need for consistency across states.

#### **Combining HB 314 and SB 255**
- **Debate**: Some representatives, including Representative Lynn, suggested combining the bills to create a comprehensive privacy law addressing both government and private sector data practices. Others argued that the bills address distinct issues and may not align neatly.
- **Conflict Between Bills**: Concerns were raised about potential conflicts between the two bills, particularly in how they address privacy expectations for private businesses.
- **Next Steps**: The committee concluded that SB 255 is close to being ready for a vote, while HB 314 requires further refinement. The possibility of combining the bills was left open for future consideration.

### **3. Next Steps and Future Considerations**
The committee outlined several key actions moving forward:
- **Amendments**: Representatives agreed to work on amendments to both HB 314 and SB 255 over the summer and present them in September.
- **Performance Audit**: The pending performance audit of the HRC will provide additional data to inform decisions on discrimination case handling.
- **Consensus**: The committee emphasized the need to prioritize privacy protections for New Hampshire citizens while ensuring that the legislation is effective and fair. They also agreed to keep HB 314 and SB 255 separate for now but will ensure they do not conflict.

### **Conclusion**
The June 28, 2023, meeting of the NH House of Representatives highlighted critical issues related to privacy, fairness in discrimination case handling, and the efficiency of the HRC. The discussions underscored the need for careful consideration of stakeholder input, performance audits, and legislative refinement to ensure that both privacy protections and human rights processes are robust, equitable, and effective. The committee’s decision to delay final decisions until fall reflects a commitment to informed and thoughtful policymaking.
