The transcript details a **Committee of Conference** meeting for **House Bill 281** in the New Hampshire House of Representatives on June 21, 2023. The meeting was chaired by Representative Michael Vose and included House and Senate conferees. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Opening Remarks**:  
   - Representative Vose emphasized the importance of **compromise and bipartisanship**, referencing the recent state budget signing by Governor Sununu as an example of successful bipartisan collaboration.
   - He praised Senator David Waters for his role in facilitating compromises, particularly on HB 281.

2. **Discussion on HB 281**:  
   - The bill had strong support from both the House (176 votes) and Senate (23 votes), with only one Senate member and 180 House members opposed.  
   - The committee’s goal was to reconcile differences and move the bill forward.  
   - Representative Kat McGee proposed amendments to remove two sections of the bill:  
     - **Section 3**: A provision requiring utilities to display renewable portfolio standards (RPS) charges on electric bills, which she argued could confuse customers.  
     - **Section 4**: The dissolution of the **Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy Board (EESEB)**, a 15-year-old board that McGee and others argued remains valuable for addressing energy efficiency and workforce challenges.  
   - McGee’s motion to amend the bill failed due to a lack of a second.

3. **Motion to Pass the Bill**:  
   - Representative Doug Thomas moved that the House **recede from its position of non-concurrence** and accept the Senate’s amendments.  
   - The motion passed unanimously among House and Senate conferees, allowing the bill to move forward as amended by the Senate.

4. **Closing Remarks**:  
   - Conferees acknowledged the need for further work on energy policy, particularly on **site evaluation and grid modernization**.  
   - They expressed commitment to addressing these issues in future sessions.  

The meeting concluded with the committee adjourning after successfully resolving differences on HB 281.
