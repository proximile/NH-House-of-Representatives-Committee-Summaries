### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Purpose of SB 239**  
   The bill aims to integrate **harm reduction** into New Hampshire’s approach to addressing substance misuse, with a focus on preventing diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, reducing health complications (e.g., infections, heart valve replacements), and formalizing **syringe service programs**. It also seeks to improve coordination with law enforcement and codify the **Doorways program**, an access point for substance use disorder services, into state statute to ensure its sustainability beyond federal grant funding.

2. **Harm Reduction Definition**  
   A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to defining **harm reduction** to avoid ambiguity and ensure it does not include **safe injection sites**, which are currently prohibited by federal law. The bill clarifies that harm reduction includes activities such as syringe exchange, wound care, and drug checking but explicitly excludes safe injection sites. Participants emphasized that harm reduction focuses on minimizing the negative effects of drug use rather than promoting it, with examples including infectious disease counseling and connecting individuals to recovery resources.

3. **Opioid Abatement Funds**  
   The bill ties into New Hampshire’s $330 million opioid abatement funds, with discussions on how these funds should be allocated to help individuals avoid long-term opioid therapy and support those who have been abandoned by the healthcare system. The bill also aligns the work of the **Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission** with the **Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs** to ensure better coordination of federal and state funding for substance misuse treatment.

4. **Funding Concerns**  
   The bill addresses the use of **state general funds** for harm reduction programs. While there was debate about whether to prohibit or allow state funding, the consensus was to remove the prohibition, providing flexibility for future funding decisions. Some members expressed concerns about this change, while others argued it was necessary for program sustainability.

5. **Medical Education**  
   The bill includes provisions for **continuing medical education** on harm reduction for healthcare providers, addressing the lack of training in addiction and pain management in medical schools. However, some participants questioned the necessity of specific mandates, such as a three-hour harm reduction course, given existing educational requirements.

6. **Coordination with Law Enforcement**  
   The bill emphasizes collaboration with **local public safety officials**, particularly in cities like Manchester, where syringe exchange programs have faced challenges due to a lack of coordination with local authorities. Ensuring that these programs are established with local input and cooperation was highlighted as critical to their success.

7. **Paraphernalia and Drug Supplies**  
   The bill clarifies the legality of distributing harm reduction supplies (e.g., syringes, pipes, wound care items) by licensed organizations, protecting them from arrest under paraphernalia laws.

8. **Broader Paradigm Shift**  
   Some participants called for a broader shift in how society addresses substance misuse, including decriminalization and a focus on public health rather than punitive measures. The conversation also touched on the tension between reducing stigma around drug use and avoiding the normalization of harmful behaviors.

9. **Lived Experience**  
   There was strong support for including individuals with **lived experience** of addiction in the creation and implementation of harm reduction policies. The term "lived experience" was suggested as a way to recognize their valuable perspective without specifying their current status (active use or recovery).

### Key Concerns Raised:
- **Safe Injection Sites**: Strong opposition to including safe injection sites in the harm reduction definition, with amendments proposed to explicitly exclude them.  
- **Funding Flexibility**: Concerns about removing the prohibition on state funding, balanced by arguments for ensuring program sustainability.  
- **Coordination with Local Authorities**: The importance of establishing syringe exchange programs with local input and coordination was emphasized.

### Next Steps:  
The committee plans to revisit the bill in **September** for further discussion and decision-making. The focus will be on finalizing the definition of harm reduction, addressing funding concerns, and ensuring the bill aligns with public health and law enforcement priorities. Participants expressed gratitude for the collaborative and informative nature of the session.

### Conclusion:  
The meeting highlighted the complexities of implementing harm reduction policies while balancing public health, legal, and societal considerations. Senate Bill 239 represents a significant step toward addressing substance misuse in New Hampshire, with a focus on prevention, education, and collaboration across stakeholders. The discussions underscored the need for a nuanced approach that prioritizes the well-being of individuals while addressing broader systemic challenges.
