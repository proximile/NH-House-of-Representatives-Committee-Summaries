**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Division III Meeting on Senate Bill 239 (June 27, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Division III convened on June 27, 2023, to discuss **Senate Bill 239**, a comprehensive piece of legislation addressing **harm reduction services**, **opioid abatement**, and **substance misuse**. The session, chaired by **Representative Maureen Mooney** in the absence of **Representative Jess Edwards**, focused on refining the bill’s language, addressing stakeholder concerns, and ensuring sustainable funding for harm reduction programs. Key discussions and themes from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **Core Objectives of Senate Bill 239**
1. **Harm Reduction Integration**: The bill seeks to integrate **harm reduction** into New Hampshire’s approach to substance misuse, emphasizing disease prevention (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C), wound care, and heart valve replacements. It also updates terminology, replacing "substance abuse" with "substance misuse" to reduce stigma.
2. **Opioid Abatement**: The bill allocates $330 million in opioid abatement funds to support programs that help individuals avoid long-term opioid therapy, provide integrative care, and assist patients who have been abandoned or need support during opioid therapy.
3. **Public Health Shift**: The legislation represents a **paradigm shift** from criminalizing substance misuse to adopting a public health-focused model, emphasizing prevention, education, and treatment.

### **Key Components and Discussions**
1. **Harm Reduction Programs**:
   - **Syringe Service Programs**: These programs are highlighted as effective tools for preventing disease and reducing healthcare costs. The bill proposes removing prohibitions on using **state general funds** to ensure their sustainability.
   - **Paraphernalia and Supplies**: The bill clarifies the legality of distributing harm reduction supplies (e.g., syringes, pipes, clean straws) by licensed organizations, protecting providers from arrest under paraphernalia laws. It also includes **drug checking equipment** to prevent overdoses.
   - **Safe Injection Sites**: The bill explicitly excludes **safe injection sites** from its definition of harm reduction, addressing concerns raised during previous hearings. Some members suggested adding language to explicitly prohibit funding for such sites.

2. **Coordination and Community Concerns**:
   - **Law Enforcement Collaboration**: The bill emphasizes collaboration with **law enforcement**, particularly in areas like Manchester, where coordination between harm reduction programs and public safety has been a concern.
   - **Manchester’s Needle Exchange Program**: Concerns were raised about a syringe exchange program in Manchester that was initiated without sufficient coordination with local officials, causing community anxieties. Efforts by organizations like **Hope for New Hampshire Recovery** to rebuild trust in the program were noted.

3. **Definitions and Legislative Language**:
   - **Defining "Harm Reduction"**: There was significant debate about explicitly defining "harm reduction" in the bill. Some members argued for a broader definition to include groups like "opioid refugees" (patients who lose access to opioid therapy and turn to illegal sources), while others cautioned that broadening the definition could make the bill more controversial.
   - **Glossary Proposal**: To address the complexity of defining terms like "harm reduction" and "drug misuse," the idea of creating a glossary within the bill was proposed to clarify language and make the bill more acceptable to a broader audience.

4. **Medical Education and Stigma Reduction**:
   - **Continuing Medical Education**: The bill includes a requirement for **continuing medical education** on harm reduction, addiction, and pain management for healthcare providers. This aims to address stigma and improve treatment for substance misuse.
   - **Pain Management Concerns**: **Representative Nagel**, a physician, highlighted the lack of education on addiction and pain management in medical schools and the unintended consequences of restrictive opioid policies, which have harmed patients reliant on opioids for pain management, leading to increased suffering, drug misuse, and even suicide.

5. **Funding and Sustainability**:
   - **State Funding for Harm Reduction**: The bill addresses the need for stable funding for harm reduction programs, which currently rely on federal grants and informal partnerships. It proposes removing restrictions on state funding to ensure program continuity.
   - **Doorways Program**: The bill seeks to codify the **Doorways program**, an access point for substance use disorder services established by the governor, ensuring its continuation and state oversight.

### **Philosophical and Practical Challenges**
1. **Stigma and Normalization**: The conversation explored the tension between reducing stigma around substance use and the potential risk of normalizing harmful behaviors. Some members questioned whether completely removing stigma might inadvertently encourage drug use, while others argued that reducing stigma is essential for effective harm reduction and treatment.
2. **Involving Lived Experience**: There was strong support for including individuals with **lived experience** (those who have used drugs or are in recovery) in the creation and implementation of harm reduction programs, ensuring policies are informed by those directly affected.
3. **Legal and Practical Concerns**: The committee discussed the legal challenges of implementing harm reduction programs, particularly safe injection sites, which face federal prohibitions. There was also debate about whether certain harm reduction practices, like providing drug preparation equipment, should be explicitly included in the legislation.
4. **Alcohol Misuse**: Some members argued that the bill does not go far enough in addressing alcohol misuse, which accounts for 70% of substance misuse in the U.S.

### **Next Steps**
The work session on Senate Bill 239 is scheduled to resume in September, allowing for further deliberation on the bill’s language, focus, and implementation. The committee aims to finalize the bill’s provisions, address remaining concerns, and ensure it aligns with the state’s public health goals.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of crafting legislation around harm reduction, opioid policies, and pain management. Senate Bill 239 represents a significant step toward addressing substance misuse through a public health lens, balancing the needs of diverse stakeholders while avoiding unintended consequences. The discussions underscored the importance of precise legislative language, stable funding, and inclusive policymaking to create effective and sustainable harm reduction programs in New Hampshire.
