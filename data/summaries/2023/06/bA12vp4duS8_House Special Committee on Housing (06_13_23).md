The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing meeting on June 13, 2023, focused on addressing the state’s housing crisis through comprehensive discussions on regulatory challenges, innovative solutions, and policy recommendations. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including septic systems, water management, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), zoning restrictions, and strategies to streamline housing development. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and proposals:

### **Regulatory and Infrastructure Challenges**
1. **Septic Systems and Water Management**:
   - The committee discussed the complexities of septic system approvals, particularly for properties expanding from smaller to larger capacities (e.g., 4 to 8 bedrooms). Once a system is approved for a larger capacity, additional bedrooms can be added without reapproval, provided the system’s capacity isn’t exceeded.
   - Similar issues apply to commercial properties, where occupancy limits are tied to septic system capacity. Reapprovals are only necessary if occupancy exceeds the system’s design.
   - Concerns were raised about developers using multiple wells to avoid community well regulations, potentially compromising water safety. The committee emphasized the importance of proper water testing and management.

2. **Soil-Based Zoning and Lot Sizes**:
   - Soil-based zoning was proposed as a more scientific approach to determining lot sizes, allowing for denser development in areas with suitable soils. However, local zoning boards often impose minimum lot sizes that override soil-based calculations, limiting housing density.

3. **Impact Fees and Subdivision Standards**:
   - The committee debated the impact of fees and high subdivision road standards (e.g., 50-foot right-of-ways) on housing development costs. Suggestions included exploring lower-cost alternatives like gravel roads for less trafficked areas and targeting impact fees toward specific needs like economic development.

### **Affordable Housing and Zoning Barriers**
1. **Zoning and Approval Processes**:
   - Representatives highlighted the difficulties in developing affordable housing due to restrictive zoning, lengthy approval processes, and high costs. Examples included projects delayed by requirements like generators despite consistent power supply.
   - The committee discussed the need to balance local control with state-level standardization to reduce inconsistencies in regulations (e.g., wetland setbacks, slope restrictions).

2. **Incentivizing Affordable Housing**:
   - Proposals included tax credits, redevelopment zones, and allowing developers to build more units in exchange for including affordable units. However, challenges remain in balancing affordability with developers’ profitability and local resistance to denser development.

### **Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**
1. **ADUs as a Housing Solution**:
   - ADUs were presented as a lower-cost alternative to traditional housing, offering flexibility for homeowners to add rental units or accommodate family members. They can increase housing supply without requiring new land development.

2. **Regulatory Barriers**:
   - Current state regulations allow municipalities to impose restrictions, such as owner occupancy, off-street parking, or conditional use permits, which hinder ADU production. Recommendations included amending state laws to allow detached ADUs, eliminate conditional use permits, and override local parking requirements.

3. **Best Practices and Models**:
   - The committee reviewed successful ADU programs in California, Seattle, and Portland. California’s $100 million grant program for pre-development costs and Seattle’s pre-approved ADU plans were highlighted as models for streamlining the process and reducing costs.

### **Innovative Solutions and Policy Recommendations**
1. **Streamlining Processes**:
   - The committee emphasized the need to streamline approval processes for ADUs and other housing developments. This included reducing bureaucratic hurdles, providing technical assistance to homeowners, and adopting pre-approved housing designs to expedite permitting.

2. **Water Usage and Building Codes**:
   - The committee questioned the appropriateness of the current water usage threshold of 150 gallons per bedroom per day, suggesting more flexible standards to reflect modern, efficient technologies like low-flow appliances and compostable toilets.
   - They also acknowledged the lag in adopting updated building codes and the need to stay current with new technologies and standards.

3. **Infill Development and Mixed-Use Zoning**:
   - The committee explored incentivizing infill development in urban and suburban areas, including repurposing existing structures like malls and old schools for housing. Mixed-use zoning, where commercial and residential spaces coexist, was also discussed as a way to increase housing availability.

### **Fire Safety and Septic System Regulations**
1. **Fire Codes**:
   - Concerns were raised about the rigid application of fire codes, which can hinder development. Suggestions included creating a fire code appeals board to streamline decision-making.

2. **Septic System Flexibility**:
   - The committee debated the inflexibility of septic system regulations, particularly the requirement to design systems for four bedrooms even for smaller homes. They proposed allowing more case-by-case assessments based on actual needs.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Subcommittees and Legislation**:
   - The committee planned to form subcommittees to delve deeper into specific issues and draft legislation. They aimed to reconvene in late August or early September to finalize recommendations.
   - Future steps included drafting legislation focused on affordability, design initiatives, and regulatory flexibility, with potential collaboration with the Office of Legislative Services (OLS) to prepare bill language for the next legislative session.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for regulatory reform, innovative solutions, and a balance between local control and state-level standardization to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis. Key priorities included streamlining approval processes, incentivizing affordable housing, encouraging ADU construction, and adopting modern, flexible standards for water usage, septic systems, and building codes. By addressing these challenges, the committee aims to increase housing availability and affordability across the state.
