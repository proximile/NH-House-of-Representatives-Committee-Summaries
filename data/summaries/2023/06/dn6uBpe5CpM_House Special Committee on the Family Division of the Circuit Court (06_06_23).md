### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (06/06/23)

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on June 6, 2023, to address critical issues in family court proceedings, child support, shared parenting, and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods. The meeting featured testimony from stakeholders, including parents, legal experts, and representatives from the Bureau of Child Support Services, and highlighted the need for legislative and procedural reforms to improve the family court system.

#### Key Issues and Discussions:

1. **Child Support and Shared Parenting**:
   - **Child Support Guidelines**: Concerns were raised about the 2013 changes to child support guidelines, affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2018, which prevent deviations based solely on shared or split parenting time. Critics argued these guidelines are based on lifestyle rather than actual support needs, disproportionately affecting parents with significant parenting time. 
   - **Shared Parenting Advocacy**: Rebecca Hutchins, a mother of two, shared her personal experience with the child support system, emphasizing the lack of parenting time adjustments in New Hampshire’s laws. She called for updates to child support guidelines, an increase in the self-support reserve, and the adoption of a shared parenting formula. Michael Dynan discussed ongoing legislative efforts, referencing previous bills (HP 1647 and SB 431) that failed to pass and proposing a "net the difference" formula for shared parenting cases.
   - **Quadrennial Review**: The Bureau of Child Support Services highlighted its quadrennial review of child support guidelines, completed in December 2022, which includes recommendations for updating guidelines and addressing shared parenting arrangements. The committee was urged to consider these recommendations for legislative action.

2. **Mediation and Neutral Case Evaluation (NCE)**:
   - **Mediation**: Mediation, an informal process where parties work with a certified mediator to resolve disputes, is offered to most parties at the first court hearing. However, the cost of mediation is set to increase to $450 on July 1st. Mediation is not suitable for cases involving domestic violence or other statutory exclusions. Financial assistance is available for parties who cannot afford mediation, and a current bill, SB 129, aims to remove the repayment requirement for certain assistance programs.
   - **Neutral Case Evaluation (NCE)**: NCE, a process where a retired judge evaluates a case and provides an opinion on how a judge might decide it, is offered statewide but has seen decreased availability post-pandemic due to judicial resource constraints. NCE resolves about 50% of cases, saving court time and resources. The process is confidential and requires mutual agreement from both parties.

3. **Guardian ad Litem (GAL) and Judicial Oversight**:
   - **GAL Concerns**: Susan Duncan, chairperson of the Guardian Ad Litem Board, addressed concerns about GAL appointments, payment processes, and perceived favoritism or bias when one party pays for the GAL. She emphasized the importance of judges overseeing GAL activities and ensuring transparency in billing. The cost of GALs and the potential for financial assistance for parties who cannot afford them were also discussed.
   - **Judicial Resources and Qualifications**: There is a concern about judges with limited family law experience being assigned to family court cases, potentially affecting the quality of rulings. The importance of having judges who are enthusiastic and qualified to handle family law cases was emphasized.

4. **Family Court Challenges and Reforms**:
   - **Pro Se Litigants and Judicial Bias**: Anthony Kinney shared his ongoing family court case, citing irregularities, conflicts of interest, and judicial bias. He criticized the lack of qualified judges in family court and called for reforms to ensure fair treatment of pro se litigants and protect children’s best interests.
   - **Efficiency and Resources**: The backlog of cases and the impact of the pandemic on court operations were highlighted. There is a need for more resources, particularly staffing, to improve the efficiency of the Family Division.

5. **Committee’s Next Steps**:
   - The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issues and planned to review the testimony and information over the summer. They aim to reconvene in early September to consider recommendations for legislative and procedural changes in the family court system.

#### Overall Takeaways:
The meeting underscored the urgent need for reforms in child support laws, shared parenting policies, and family court procedures to reduce conflict, promote co-parenting, and protect children’s well-being. Key areas for improvement include updating child support guidelines, enhancing access to mediation and NCE, addressing GAL concerns, ensuring judicial qualifications, and providing adequate resources to the Family Division. The committee’s work over the summer will focus on developing actionable recommendations to address these challenges and improve outcomes for families in New Hampshire.
