**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Childcare Meeting (05/31/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare convened on May 31, 2023, to address critical issues impacting the state’s childcare system, including funding challenges, childcare ratios, the Granite Steps for Quality (GSQ) program, and the use of remaining American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds. The discussions underscored the complex interplay between ensuring childcare quality, addressing workforce and financial challenges, and expanding childcare availability.

### Key Discussion Points:

#### 1. **Funding and Financial Challenges**
   - Childcare providers, particularly smaller agencies, highlighted significant financial struggles, including deficits caused by poor enrollment and attendance estimates. Providers emphasized the importance of community support and city-funded building upgrades, which are not universally accessible. These financial challenges are exacerbated by high operational costs and workforce shortages.

#### 2. **Childcare Ratios**
   - The committee debated adjusting childcare ratios to address the supply crisis in New Hampshire. A dynamic ratio system, inspired by Massachusetts’ model, was proposed. This system would allow slightly higher ratios when additional teachers are present, balancing safety, teacher workload, and the need to increase childcare availability.
   - Concerns were raised about potential teacher burnout and the impact on care quality. The committee stressed that any changes must prioritize child safety and teacher well-being.
   - A comparative chart of childcare ratios across Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire was presented, showing that New Hampshire’s current ratios are mid-range among neighboring states.

#### 3. **Granite Steps for Quality (GSQ) Program**
   - The GSQ program, designed to improve childcare quality, has faced challenges, including provider confusion and financial disincentives. Providers reported that participating in GSQ often results in monetary losses and expressed frustration with unclear communication and perceived lowering of program standards.
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is conducting a comprehensive evaluation of GSQ to address these issues. A procurement process is underway to support providers with onboarding, coaching, and professional development.
   - Despite over 80 providers currently in the GSQ system and 30 more applying, adoption rates remain low (less than 20% of licensed providers). This is attributed to the lack of immediate financial benefits and the high demand for childcare services, which reduces the incentive for providers to join the program.

#### 4. **Childcare Workforce Challenges**
   - Providers are grappling with workforce shortages, high turnover, and financial deficits, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges make it difficult for providers to invest in programs like GSQ or improve staff qualifications.
   - The committee discussed integrating professional development opportunities, such as the Child Development Associate (CDA) credential, to enhance the quality of childcare staff.

#### 5. **Use of ARPA Funds**
   - The committee expressed interest in understanding how remaining ARPA funds will be allocated. Concerns were raised about ensuring the sustainability of initiatives supported by ARPA funding, with a focus on long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes.

#### 6. **Legislative and Advisory Roles**
   - The New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, which includes providers, state leaders, and families, plays a key role in informing childcare policy. There was a suggestion to empower the council with greater decision-making authority to ensure provider input in programs like GSQ and other childcare policies.

#### 7. **Public Testimony and Provider Perspectives**
   - Providers and stakeholders, including representatives from Early Learning New Hampshire and Rochester Child Care, shared their experiences and concerns. They emphasized the need for a more equitable and supportive system that does not financially burden providers or reduce childcare capacity.

#### 8. **Future Plans**
   - The committee outlined plans for additional work sessions, including a potential field meeting, to finalize recommendations before the bill filing deadline. The goal is to reach a consensus on key issues and develop actionable, long-term solutions to improve childcare in New Hampshire.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the multifaceted challenges facing New Hampshire’s childcare system, including financial instability, workforce shortages, and the need to balance safety, quality, and accessibility. The committee emphasized the importance of thoughtful, sustainable approaches to these issues, with a focus on collaboration between providers, policymakers, and stakeholders. Efforts to improve programs like GSQ, adjust childcare ratios, and allocate ARPA funds effectively will be critical to addressing the state’s childcare crisis.
