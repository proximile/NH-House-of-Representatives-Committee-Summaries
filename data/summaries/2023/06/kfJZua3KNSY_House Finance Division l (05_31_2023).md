**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting on May 31, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I convened on May 31, 2023, to discuss and vote on several key legislative matters. The meeting included debates, amendments, and decisions on bills addressing mental health legal services, trauma kits in state buildings, and cumulative environmental impact analysis. Here’s a detailed overview of the proceedings:

---

### **Segment 1: Organizational Matters and Initial Discussions**
The meeting began with a series of votes, including a 7-1 decision to retain a chair, with representatives such as Sweeney, Carol McGuire, and Leachman voting in favor. A representative reflected on a proposed environmental project, likening it to a PhD-level effort, possibly at UNH’s Environmental Department, which aimed to identify cumulative impacts across different mediums. The representative expressed strong opposition to forming a legislative commission for this project, citing its complexity and stating they would not want to serve on it. The session concluded with a reminder of the next meeting scheduled for 10 A.M. the following day.

### **Segment 2: Key Bills – SB 128 and SB 204**
The meeting focused on two significant bills:

1. **SB 128: Payment for Legal Services in Involuntary Mental Health Admissions**  
   This bill proposed transferring the responsibility for paying legal services for individuals involuntarily admitted for mental health services from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to the Judicial Council. A contentious issue was the removal of the requirement for individuals who can afford it to reimburse the state for these services, a practice in place since 1986.  
   - **Debate:** Representatives discussed the fiscal impact ($1.5 million annually) and the potential loss of accountability.  
   - **Votes:** The Judiciary Committee supported the bill 17-3, but a floor amendment to retain reimbursement for those who could afford it was defeated (182-201). The bill ultimately passed the House 207-177.  
   - **Finance Division:** The bill was retained for further study due to unresolved questions about funding sources and cost recovery.

2. **SB 204: Trauma Kits in State-Owned Buildings**  
   This bill required trauma kits to be available in state-owned buildings. Discussions centered on implementation scope, costs, and whether this should be mandated by law or handled administratively.  
   - **Fiscal Note:** Initial costs were estimated at $1.5 million, but representatives noted that early implementation could cost significantly less ($10,000-$50,000).  
   - **Concerns:** Practicality of installing kits in all state buildings, especially unoccupied ones, and potential liability if kits were missing or misused.  
   - **Amendment:** Representative Dan McGuire proposed an amendment to remove the dedicated fund, allocate $50,000 for the kits, and streamline the process by having the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) oversee the initiative in consultation with EMTs, rather than forming a new committee. The amendment aimed to simplify the bill and address fiscal concerns.

### **Segment 3: Continued Discussion on SB 204 and SB 267**
The meeting continued with further discussion and voting on SB 204 and introduced SB 267:

1. **SB 204: Trauma Kits in State-Owned Buildings (Continued)**  
   - **Amendment:** An amendment clarifying that trauma kits should be installed in selected state-owned and occupied buildings was passed unanimously.  
   - **Vote:** The bill, as amended, passed unanimously.  

2. **SB 267: Cumulative Impact Analysis for Environmental Permits**  
   This bill required the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to consider cumulative impacts analysis in rules and statutes. The discussion focused on the need for a dedicated staff member to study the cumulative environmental and public health impacts of permitting facilities.  
   - **Concerns:** Representatives raised issues about the broad definition of "facility," potential delays in permitting, and the implications for future regulations.  
   - **Purpose:** The bill aims to assess the combined effects of air, water, and soil pollution from proposed facilities, particularly in industrial areas. DES clarified that this is a scoping study to inform future rulemaking and legislative recommendations, not an immediate regulatory change.  
   - **Vote:** The bill was retained for further study due to unresolved questions about its scope and impact.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **SB 128:** Passed the House but retained for further study due to funding and accountability concerns.  
- **SB 204:** Amended and passed unanimously, focusing on trauma kits in selected state-owned and occupied buildings.  
- **SB 267:** Retained for further study to address concerns about its scope and regulatory implications.  

The meeting underscored the legislative process, with representatives engaging in detailed debates, proposing amendments, and making decisions to advance or refine key pieces of legislation. The next session was scheduled for June 1, 2023, at 10 A.M.
