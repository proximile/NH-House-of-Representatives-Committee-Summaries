**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (June 7, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on June 7, 2023, for a meeting that addressed a range of legislative issues, focusing on educational discrimination, privacy rights, transparency, and government efficiency. The meeting was marked by respectful discourse, collaborative efforts, and detailed discussions on procedural challenges and policy improvements.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **1. Educational Discrimination and Collaboration Between Departments**
The committee extensively discussed the collaboration between the Department of Education (DOE) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in handling educational discrimination cases. Key points included:
- **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):** Members explored the potential for an MOU to streamline the process of addressing educational discrimination complaints. The DOE would consult with the DOJ, which would then make informed decisions on prosecutions. However, frustrations were expressed about the current lack of smooth collaboration between the departments.
- **Subpoena Power:** A significant issue raised was the DOE’s lack of subpoena power, which hampers its ability to obtain necessary records from schools, particularly in special education cases. This limitation complicates investigations and delays resolutions for parents and students.
- **Conflict of Interest Concerns:** Some representatives voiced concerns about potential conflicts of interest if the DOE were to advocate for parents against schools, given its dual role in supporting schools and ensuring compliance with educational laws.

#### **2. Bill Discussions and Subcommittee Assignments**
The committee reviewed several retained bills and formed subcommittees to delve deeper into specific issues. Key bills and discussions included:
- **Privacy Rights (SB 255 & HB 314):** Members expressed interest in combining these bills to address privacy rights comprehensively, particularly regarding government-held information and individual privacy protections.
- **Right-to-Know Law (HB 149 & HB 652):** Discussions focused on delays in record requests and open meeting notice requirements. HB 149 was postponed until October, pending a report from the Ombudsman, while a subcommittee was formed to address HB 652.
- **Human Rights Commission (HB 362):** Concerns were raised about the Commission’s efficiency and case backlogs. A subcommittee was tasked with exploring potential improvements to streamline its operations.
- **Department of Education Subpoena Power (HB 533):** The committee debated whether the DOE should have direct authority to prosecute cases before the Human Rights Commission and the need for subpoena power. A subcommittee was formed to further explore this issue, with broader discussions on agency subpoena authority.
- **Other Bills:** Subcommittees were also formed to review HB 283 (rental application fees) and HB 396 (a controversial bill with divided opinions).

#### **3. Leadership and Committee Culture**
Members expressed gratitude for the chair’s leadership, highlighting the respectful and productive atmosphere of the committee. They also acknowledged the hard work of staff and new members, particularly those who took on significant responsibilities. The importance of civility and respect in committee discussions was emphasized, even when members held deeply opposing views.

#### **4. Logistical and Future Planning**
The committee discussed logistical details for future meetings, including scheduling and notification requirements. It was noted that this might be the last full committee meeting until the weather warms up, with members wishing each other a great summer.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing procedural challenges, improving collaboration between government departments, and advancing policies that promote privacy, transparency, and efficiency. By forming subcommittees and fostering respectful discourse, the committee laid the groundwork for further legislative action on these critical issues. The discussions highlighted the importance of balancing agency authority, addressing systemic inefficiencies, and protecting individual rights in New Hampshire’s legislative process.
