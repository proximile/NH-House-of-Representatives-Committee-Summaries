**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (June 13, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on June 13, 2023, to discuss critical issues in election law, with a primary focus on campaign finance regulations and enforcement. The meeting involved representatives from the Attorney General’s Office, the Secretary of State’s office, and House members, who engaged in detailed discussions aimed at improving transparency, reducing confusion, and streamlining enforcement. Key topics and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Campaign Finance Reporting and Thresholds**
1. **Complexity of Reporting Requirements**: Representatives highlighted the challenges of navigating reporting requirements for different types of political committees, particularly those operating close to spending thresholds. The distinction between electioneering and non-electioneering committees adds to the complexity.
2. **Streamlining Reporting**: There was a proposal to simplify and unify reporting requirements across various phases of the election cycle (exploratory, primary, general) to reduce confusion. While candidates are now better informed about these phases compared to a decade ago, further clarity is needed.
3. **Rolling Over Campaign Funds**: Ambiguity exists regarding the transfer of surplus campaign funds between municipal and state elections. Funds raised in municipal elections, which often lack reporting requirements, could be transferred to state campaigns without oversight, creating a potential loophole.

### **Contribution Limits and Super PACs**
4. **Disparity in Contribution Limits**: The discussion addressed the disparity in contribution limits between individuals and certain committees, as well as the potential for unlimited contributions from PACs to circumvent the spirit of campaign finance laws. While Super PACs are active in New Hampshire, significant enforcement issues have not yet emerged.
5. **Municipal vs. State Elections**: The lack of campaign finance rules for municipal elections was identified as a potential loophole, as funds raised in these races could be transferred to state campaigns without clear reporting requirements.

### **Enforcement Challenges**
6. **Limited Enforcement Authority**: The Secretary of State’s office emphasized that enforcement is constrained to existing laws, with any changes to contribution limits or reporting requirements requiring legislative action.
7. **Future Work**: The subcommittee agreed to continue drafting and reviewing proposed changes collaboratively. They also considered logistical challenges, such as meeting remotely while adhering to transparency laws (RSA 91a).

### **Operational and Administrative Issues**
8. **Alphabetization of Donors**: The requirement to alphabetize donors on campaign finance reports was deemed unnecessary for small numbers of donors (e.g., under 25), leading to confusion and unnecessary refiling.
9. **Late Filings**: Simplifying the reporting schedule and clarifying deadlines could reduce late submissions, which are a recurring issue.
10. **Registration vs. Reporting**: The distinction between registering and reporting was identified as a source of confusion. It was suggested that all entities involved in the campaign finance process should at least register, even if they don’t meet reporting thresholds.
11. **Post-Campaign Reporting**: Many candidates stop filing reports after their campaigns end, even if they have outstanding debts or surpluses. Clearer language in the law could address this issue.
12. **Unitemized Receipts**: Small, unitemized donations (under $50) can add up to significant amounts, making it difficult to track aggregate contributions and raising questions about fundraising practices.
13. **Legibility and Arithmetic Errors**: Illegible reports and arithmetic errors require significant enforcement resources. Fines for repeat offenders were suggested as a deterrent.
14. **Online Filing Challenges**: Some candidates, particularly those who are not tech-savvy, struggle with the online campaign finance system. Solutions, such as providing access to computers at the Secretary of State’s office or local libraries, were discussed.

### **Transparency and Disclosure**
15. **Political Mailers**: The lack of proper identification on political mailers, especially those sent anonymously close to elections, was highlighted as a significant issue. It was recommended that all political committees register, even if they don’t meet reporting thresholds, to improve transparency.
16. **Anonymous Political Advertising**: Tracking the sources of anonymous political mailers is challenging, particularly when they are printed out of state. Holding printers accountable for ensuring proper disclosure was suggested.
17. **Political Advocacy Organizations**: Ambiguity in the law regarding what constitutes a communication that triggers reporting requirements for political advocacy organizations needs clarification to improve compliance.
18. **Simplification of Committee Definitions**: The current system has nine different types of registrants, leading to complexity. Combining similar categories and simplifying definitions could reduce confusion.

### **Penalties and Enforcement**
19. **Expanding Enforcement Authority**: The Attorney General’s office currently has the authority to fine political committees for late filings but not for illegible or inaccurate reports. Expanding this authority could improve compliance.
20. **Transparency and Public Trust**: The importance of transparency in campaign finance was emphasized, particularly in allowing the public to understand who is funding political efforts. However, there are ways to skirt the system, such as creating multiple small committees that stay under reporting thresholds.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for clearer, more consistent election laws to reduce confusion, improve transparency, and streamline enforcement. The Attorney General’s office and the Secretary of State’s office are collaborating to address these issues and provide recommendations to the legislature. The subcommittee agreed to continue working on draft proposals and address remaining questions in future sessions, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the effectiveness of campaign finance regulations in New Hampshire.
