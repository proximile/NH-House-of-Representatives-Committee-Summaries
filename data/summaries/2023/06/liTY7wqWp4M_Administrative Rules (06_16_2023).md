**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (June 16, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on June 16, 2023, to discuss and review a wide range of administrative rules across various sectors. The meeting highlighted the complexities of regulatory oversight, with a focus on licensing, privacy, due process, and compliance with state and federal laws. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

### **Licensing, Fees, and Background Checks**
1. **Criminal Background Checks and Licensing**: The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) was discussed regarding its role in initially denying applications based on criminal background checks. Final decisions are made by respective boards after applicants have an opportunity to explain their history.
2. **Application vs. Licensing Fees**: There was confusion and debate over the distinction between application processing fees and licensing fees, particularly regarding refundability. The committee sought clarity on how these fees are classified and processed.
3. **Fee Refundability**: Concerns were raised about whether application fees should be refundable, especially in cases where applicants withdraw or abandon their applications. Different boards’ handling of these fees was also scrutinized.

### **Foster Care Licensing**
4. **Home Study Requirements**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) explained the process for licensing foster family care, including home studies. The committee questioned the feasibility of the statutory 60-day decision period given the complexity of requirements.
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Representative Leon raised concerns about the privacy of personal health information disclosed during the foster care application process, questioning the constitutionality of waiving federal and state privacy protections. Concerns extended to the handling of sensitive information by consultants, though DHHS clarified that consultants are bound by HIPAA privacy laws.
6. **COVID-19 Vaccine Exemption**: An emergency rule exempting foster families from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for their children was noted to have already expired, rendering the issue moot.

### **Mental Health and Developmental Services**
7. **Eviction Process for Residential Services**: A rule concerning the eviction process for individuals with developmental disabilities or brain injuries from residential services was discussed. Concerns were raised about the lack of pre-eviction due process protections, which are required under federal law. The committee approved the rule but acknowledged the need to balance safety and due process.

### **Driver’s License and DMV Rules**
8. **Driver’s License and Non-Driver ID Rules**: Proposed updates to driver’s license and non-driver identification card rules were reviewed. Concerns were raised about outdated forms and inconsistencies, particularly regarding the surrender of suspended licenses. The department committed to addressing these issues, and the rules were conditionally approved.
9. **License Suspension and DMV Forms**: Concerns were raised about the impact of license suspensions on individuals and the need to ensure that DMV forms do not add unnecessary difficulty. A motion was made to conditionally approve the rules with additional information.

### **Employment and Tax Rules**
10. **Employment Rule (EMP 300)**: An employment rule was approved without significant discussion.
11. **Employment Security Rule Change**: A minor but substantive change to employment security rules was proposed, adjusting the threshold for filing employee tax and wage reports from 500 to 10,500 employees. The change was conditionally approved.

### **Environmental and Wildlife Regulations**
12. **Endangered Species Act and Coyote Hunting**: Concerns were raised that certain fish and game rules, particularly those related to coyote hunting, might violate the Endangered Species Act if a gray wolf were accidentally hunted. It was clarified that gray wolves were removed from the endangered species list in 2021, so the rules currently do not violate the Act. However, if wolves are re-listed, the rules would need reevaluation.
13. **Mobile Source Air Pollution**: Rules regulating vehicle emissions and idling limitations were discussed. Concerns were raised about the uniform enforcement of idling requirements. The committee moved to conditionally accept the rules with an edit to remove the word "commercial" from the idling exception clause.

### **Education and Professional Licensing**
14. **Reading and Writing Teacher Prep Program**: The Department of Education addressed the expiration of a rule paragraph from 2018 and the need to re-adopt it. The committee moved to approve the rule, ensuring no one was denied certification incorrectly during the lapse.
15. **Board of Medicine**: Rules regarding the definition of medical review subcommittee access to public records and draft decisions were discussed. The rules had expired in 2019, and the committee moved to approve them with editorial changes.
16. **Court Reporters Licensing**: The licensing requirements for court reporters were discussed, with concerns about conditional denials and fee structures. The committee sought clarification on the criteria for conditional denials and the rationale behind fee increases.

### **Tax and Land Appeals**
17. **Tax and Land Appeals**: The procedural rules for specific types of appeals were discussed, with concerns about due process and the treatment of taxpayers versus municipalities. A motion was made to preliminary object to the rule, requesting further clarity and adjustments.

### **Allied Health Professionals**
18. **Allied Health Professionals**: The Office of Licensed Allied Health Professionals presented rules that were conditionally approved. The rules were noted to be dependent on another proposal (2023-52) before they could be fully adopted.

### **Motor Carrier Safety Rules**
19. **Motor Carrier Safety Rules**: The committee discussed the incorporation of federal regulations into state rules, with updates to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) being reviewed. The Department of Safety explained the challenges of updating rules annually due to frequent federal changes.

### **Certification of Assessors**
20. **Certification of Assessors**: Changes to the rules governing the certification of assessors and assessor assistants were discussed, particularly the retroactive application of continuing education requirements. The committee moved to approve the rule after clarifying the phased-in approach to the requirements.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored the importance of clarity, consistency, and compliance in administrative rules. Key themes included balancing regulatory requirements with privacy and practical considerations, ensuring due process, and addressing concerns about fee structures and procedural fairness. Several rules were conditionally approved, with the understanding that further clarifications and adjustments would be made. The committee emphasized the need for ongoing oversight and the importance of aligning state rules with federal laws and protections. The next meeting was scheduled for July 20th to continue addressing unresolved issues and gather additional information.
