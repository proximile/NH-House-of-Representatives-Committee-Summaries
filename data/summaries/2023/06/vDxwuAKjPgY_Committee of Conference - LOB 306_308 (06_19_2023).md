The Committee of Conference meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives on June 19, 2023, focused on resolving discrepancies and advancing several key bills, including **HB 532**, **HB 409**, **HB 461**, and **HB 358**. The discussions were marked by collaboration, but also by debates over balancing fairness, local control, and the need for clear, consistent legislation. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

### **HB 532 (Licensing and Professional Standards)**
The committee reviewed amendments related to RSA 310a, particularly focusing on licensing exemptions for out-of-state physicians. There was confusion about whether certain language regarding telehealth and licensing provisions had been moved from HB 409 to HB 532. To avoid duplication and ensure consistency, the committee agreed to align the language with **Senate Bill 49**.

### **HB 409 (Professional Licensing and Fees)**
This bill generated extensive discussion, with several key amendments and debates:
- **Board of Nursing Changes**: The committee agreed to increase the number of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) on the board and removed a requirement for a nurse dedicated to nursing education due to potential conflicts of interest.
- **Social Work Compact**: This was a contentious issue. The Senate strongly supported immediate adoption of the compact to position New Hampshire as an early adopter, while the House preferred further study. Ultimately, the committee decided to remove the compact language from HB 409 to save the rest of the bill, with plans to revisit it in retained legislation.
- **Funding and Language Alignment**: Financial language was adjusted from $5 billion to $3 million to align with **Senate Bill 49**, and the effective date was pushed to **July 15, 2023**.
- **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**: The committee debated the hiring of qualified experts for investigations, agreeing that the board should establish criteria for experts while the executive director retains hiring authority.

### **HB 461 (Retirement System and Part-Time Positions)**
The House proposed penalties for municipalities converting full-time positions to part-time to avoid pension liabilities, arguing that this practice was unfair to the retirement system and other taxpayers. The Senate, however, favored a study committee to assess the impact of such changes before implementing penalties, citing concerns about local control and potential negative effects on municipalities. The discussion highlighted the tension between protecting the retirement system and respecting municipal autonomy.

### **HB 358 (Barbering and Licensing and Workplace Protections)**
The committee addressed multiple aspects of this bill:
- **Booth Licenses**: Amendments were made to align the language with other bills to avoid redundancy.
- **Nursing Mothers Protections**: The bill included provisions for reasonable break periods and private spaces for pumping, aligning with federal **PUMP Act** protections but creating a state-level complaint process through the NH Department of Labor. Concerns were raised about the two-week notice requirement, the definition of "reasonable" space, and potential confusion for employers due to overlapping state and federal regulations. The effective date was pushed to **2025-2026** to give businesses time to adjust, though some members questioned the delay.

### **General Observations**
Throughout the meeting, the committee emphasized the importance of collaboration with stakeholders, including the business community and advocacy groups, to refine the bills. Key themes included:
- **Balancing Protections and Practicality**: The committee worked to balance protections for employees with practical considerations for employers.
- **Clarity and Consistency**: There was a strong focus on ensuring clear, consistent language across bills to avoid conflicts and duplication.
- **State vs. Federal Regulations**: Discussions highlighted the challenges of aligning state legislation with federal regulations, particularly in areas like workplace protections and professional licensing.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with mutual thanks and well-wishes for the continuation of the Committee of Conference. The committee made significant progress in resolving discrepancies between House and Senate versions of the bills, often opting for further study or aligning language with existing legislation to avoid conflicts. Plans were made to reconvene later in the day to finalize agreements on outstanding issues, ensuring that the bills could advance with broad support.
