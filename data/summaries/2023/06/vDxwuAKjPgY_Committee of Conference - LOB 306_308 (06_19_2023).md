**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference Meeting (June 19, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 19, 2023, focused on several key bills, including **HB 409**, **HB 461**, **HB 532**, and **HB 358**, addressing issues ranging from municipal pension liabilities and workplace protections for nursing mothers to licensing fees and the Social Work Compact. The meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between the House and Senate approaches, with the House favoring immediate legislative action and the Senate advocating for further study and stakeholder input.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 461: Position Changes and Retirement System Impact**
- **Issue**: Municipalities converting full-time positions to part-time to avoid unfunded pension liabilities, shifting the burden to other communities.
- **House Position**: Proposed penalties for municipalities that make such changes without covering the unfunded liabilities.
- **Senate Position**: Favored establishing a study committee to assess the issue's scope and impact before taking legislative action.
- **Concerns**: Financial strain on municipalities, school systems, and the New Hampshire Retirement System; need for clear language and enforcement mechanisms; importance of local control and the complexity of applying a blanket solution to diverse municipalities.

#### **HB 409: Protections for Nursing Mothers and Broader Changes**
- **Workplace Protections**: The bill aligns with federal protections under the PUMP Act, providing reasonable break periods and private spaces for expressing milk, and establishing a New Hampshire-specific complaint process.
- **Concerns**: Feasibility for small businesses, the two-week notification requirement, and potential conflicts with existing employer policies.
- **Broader Changes**: Originally about barbering reciprocity, the bill was used as a vehicle for broader changes, including nursing board composition and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs). The committee debated the addition of a dedicated nursing education representative to the board, ultimately deciding to remove it due to potential conflicts of interest.
- **Social Work Compact**: The Senate strongly supported its inclusion in **HB 409**, emphasizing the need to act quickly to be among the first states to adopt it. The House, however, preferred to retain it for further study, leading to a recess to resolve the disagreement.
- **Effective Date and Funding**: Adjusted the effective date to July 15, 2023, to avoid complications with other bills and addressed OPLC funding issues, ensuring that Senate Bill 49 (which reduces the fund to $3 million) would not conflict with **HB 409**.

#### **HB 532: Licensing Fees and Telehealth Provisions**
- **Changes**: The committee reviewed changes to the bill, particularly concerning RSA 310a and Telehealth provisions. There was confusion about whether certain language had been moved from **HB 409** to **HB 532**, but it was clarified that the language was shifted to avoid duplication.
- **Other Topics**: Licensing fees, OPLC funding, and the Social Work Compact were also discussed.

#### **HB 358: Non-Discrimination Statutes and Employer Requirements**
- **Non-Discrimination Statute**: Applied to businesses with six or more employees, with the Department of Labor providing legal advice to align the definition of "employer" with current law.
- **State vs. Federal Law**: Debate about ensuring consistency with federal laws, particularly regarding workplace protections for nursing mothers. The state law would stand independently, even if federal laws were repealed or altered.
- **Workplace Protections**: Specifics included the definition of a "reasonable walk" to access nursing spaces and the role of the Department of Labor in handling complaints. Some representatives argued for more specificity to avoid confusion for employers, while others emphasized flexibility and dialogue between employers and employees.
- **Effective Date and Fiscal Impact**: Set for 2025 to give businesses time to prepare, with no fiscal note attached as the Department of Labor already has the capacity to enforce it. Some representatives questioned the delay, arguing that protections for nursing mothers are long overdue.

### **Other Key Points**
- **Investigators and Expert Witnesses**: Detailed discussion about the authority of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to retain qualified experts for investigations. The board would establish criteria for these experts, but the executive director would independently hire them to avoid conflicts of interest.
- **Retained Bills and Future Legislation**: Acknowledged that some issues, such as the Social Work Compact, would need to be addressed in future legislation. The House retained a bill to work on this issue, but concerns were raised about the timeline and potential delays.

### **Overall Themes**
- **Legislative Approaches**: The House favored immediate legislative action, while the Senate preferred further study and stakeholder input.
- **Complexity and Balance**: The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing state and federal laws, ensuring workplace protections, and addressing technical details in legislation.
- **Resolution Efforts**: The committee worked to resolve differences between the House and Senate while maintaining the integrity of the bills under discussion, including recessing to reach consensus on contentious issues like the Social Work Compact.

This meeting underscored the intricate legislative process and the ongoing efforts to address critical issues affecting municipalities, businesses, and working mothers in New Hampshire.
