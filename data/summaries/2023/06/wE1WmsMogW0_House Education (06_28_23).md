### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (June 28, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on June 28, 2023, to address critical issues surrounding mental health and special education in schools. The discussions highlighted the escalating mental health crisis among students, the challenges schools face in providing adequate support, and the need for systemic reforms to address these issues. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Mental Health Crisis in Schools**
- **Increasing Mental Health Needs**: Mental health issues among students have surged, driven by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, social media, and family instability. This has led to a rise in special education referrals and placements in out-of-district schools due to the complexity of student needs.
- **Referrals to Special Education**: Schools are increasingly referring students to special education for mental health services due to a lack of available resources outside the school system. Long waitlists for counseling services, sometimes lasting years, force schools to use special education as a substitute for mental health support.

#### **2. Staffing and Resource Challenges**
- **Shortages of Professionals**: Schools are grappling with a severe shortage of special education teachers, psychologists, and social workers. This national issue is exacerbated in New Hampshire by low salaries and high demand, leading many professionals to leave the state for better-paying positions.
- **Overburdened School Psychologists**: School psychologists are overwhelmed with testing and evaluation requirements, leaving little time for preventative or therapeutic interventions.
- **One-on-One Educational Assistants**: There is a growing reliance on one-on-one educational assistants for students with behavioral issues, but this is often a temporary solution rather than addressing root causes. Systemic changes, such as Universal Design for Learning and co-teaching, are needed to reduce dependence on aides.

#### **3. Systemic and Collaborative Solutions**
- **Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSSB)**: The implementation of MTSSB, a systemic approach to supporting student behavior and mental health, was discussed. However, only 10-12% of schools currently have MTSSB in place, and full implementation takes years. Schools without MTSSB often rely on other systems like Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) or Response to Intervention (RTI).
- **Collaboration Across Sectors**: Better collaboration between schools, mental health providers, and primary care physicians is essential. Integrating mental health services into schools, possibly through community partnerships, could help address gaps in care.
- **Statewide Inequities**: The lack of a statewide, equitable process for addressing student mental health issues has created a patchwork of approaches across districts, leaving some students without necessary support.

#### **4. Mental Health Education and Curriculum**
- **Outdated Standards**: Mental health is a required component of K-12 health education, but the standards were last updated in 2003. The Department of Education plans to update the frameworks once new national standards are released.
- **Curriculum Compliance**: Concerns were raised about schools not addressing required mental health topics despite statutory obligations. The committee discussed the need for better data collection and monitoring of curriculum implementation.
- **Teacher Training**: Professional development and training for teachers, particularly in mental health first aid and health education, are critical to ensuring educators can effectively support students' mental health needs.

#### **5. Proposed Solutions and Future Steps**
- **Reforming Higher Education Training**: Revamping higher education programs to better prepare professionals for current school challenges is essential.
- **Increasing Salaries**: Raising salaries for school psychologists, special education teachers, and other professionals could help attract and retain staff.
- **Funding and Sustainability**: Sustained funding is needed to support mental health initiatives, especially as federal grants dry up. Braiding multiple funding sources could help ensure long-term support.
- **Data Collection and Measurement**: Better data collection is needed to measure the effectiveness of interventions, with success indicators including reduced special education referrals and alignment with tiered support systems.
- **Legislative Action**: The committee discussed retained bills addressing mental health in schools, emphasizing the need to ensure mental health education is taught effectively and that changes to education standards do not weaken requirements.

#### **6. Presentations and Activities**
- **Youth Mental Health First Aid**: Kendra Lewis from UNH Extension presented on the Youth Mental Health First Aid program, which trains adults to recognize and respond to mental health challenges in youth. An activity simulating auditory hallucinations was conducted to build empathy for those experiencing mental health crises.
- **Department of Education Updates**: Representatives discussed the current state of mental health education in New Hampshire schools and plans to update outdated standards.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for systemic changes, increased resources, and collaboration to address the growing mental health crisis among students in New Hampshire. Key areas of focus include addressing staffing shortages, updating mental health education standards, implementing systemic support models like MTSSB, and ensuring sustained funding for mental health initiatives. The committee plans to continue these discussions in the fall, with a focus on legislative action, teacher training, and equitable statewide solutions.
