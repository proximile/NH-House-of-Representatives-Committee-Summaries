**Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (June 27, 2023)**

On June 27, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss updates and refinements to election law, with a focus on campaign finance regulations, transparency, and operational processes. The meeting was divided into two segments, each addressing key aspects of election law reform. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Key Discussions and Proposals**

1. **Electronic Ballot Counting Devices**  
   A session was scheduled for August 2nd to test new electronic ballot counting devices. Feedback from the ballot law commission will be gathered to ensure the devices meet operational and accuracy standards.

2. **Political Committees and Definitions**  
   Representatives debated the categorization and definitions of political committees, including candidate committees and political advocacy organizations. Some definitions were deemed redundant, and the committee plans to refine these in future drafts to avoid unnecessary complexity.

3. **Election Cycle and Reporting**  
   The election cycle was defined as a two-year period, beginning eight days after the last general election and ending seven days after the current one. This timeline allows candidates to report campaign finances and resolve any surpluses or deficits. The committee also discussed setting clear cutoffs between cycles to streamline reporting.

4. **Independent Expenditures and Super PACs**  
   The need for clearer definitions of independent expenditures, particularly in relation to Super PACs, was acknowledged. However, this topic had not yet been a major focus of the committee’s discussions.

5. **Enforcement and Fines**  
   The Attorney General’s office requested the authority to impose fines for campaign finance violations. While specific enforcement language was not included in the draft, the committee plans to consult legal experts to address this issue.

6. **Business Organizations vs. Corporations**  
   A suggestion was made to replace the term "Corporation" with "business organizations" in the draft to align with existing legal definitions and ensure consistency.

### **Campaign Finance and Transparency**

1. **LLC Contributions**  
   The committee discussed whether Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) should be subject to the same contribution limits and reporting requirements as corporations. Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency in LLC contributions, as they can currently donate unlimited amounts without disclosing the individuals behind the donations.

2. **Campaign Finance Definitions**  
   Deputy Secretary Aaron Hennessey presented a draft of proposed changes to RSA 664, which included consolidating definitions for terms like "political committee," "election cycle," and "Fiscal Agent." The goal was to streamline campaign finance laws and simplify reporting requirements.

3. **Reporting and Registration**  
   The committee debated whether all candidates and committees should be required to use the online campaign finance system. They also considered standardizing reporting requirements across different types of committees and automatically re-registering candidates with surpluses or deficits for the next election cycle.

4. **Transparency and Disclosure**  
   Emphasis was placed on increasing transparency in campaign finance. Proposals included requiring more detailed disclosures on campaign materials and websites to ensure voters know who is funding campaigns.

5. **Special Elections and Contribution Limits**  
   The committee discussed how campaign finance rules apply to special elections and whether contribution limits should be uniform across all phases of the election cycle, rather than having separate limits for primary and general elections.

### **Draft Legislation and Next Steps**

Deputy Secretary Hennessey provided a rough draft of proposed changes to RSA 664, which included redlined additions, deletions, and highlighted areas needing further clarification. The draft aimed to simplify and clarify campaign finance laws, with a focus on making the system more user-friendly and transparent.  

The committee plans to finalize its work by late August, with a draft report to be presented for discussion and approval. The goal is to conclude the subcommittee’s work promptly to avoid confusion with future legislative activities.
