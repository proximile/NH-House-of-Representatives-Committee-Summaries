**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (July 20, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on July 20, 2023, to discuss and approve a series of administrative rules, addressing a wide range of topics from licensing fees and record retention to Medicaid compliance and public health. The meeting underscored the importance of aligning administrative rules with state and federal regulations while ensuring transparency, consistency, and stakeholder input.

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

1. **Retention Rules and Archivist Responsibility**:
   - The committee emphasized the archivist’s role in setting retention rules for state records, which agencies must follow. While the director had implemented an internal policy pending formal rule adoption, committee members stressed the need for codified rules to ensure consistency and enforceability.

2. **Licensing Fees and Professional Regulation**:
   - Significant debate centered on licensing fees for various professions, including court reporters, recreational therapists, and geologists. Discrepancies between proposed fees and existing rules were noted, particularly concerning application fees versus licensing fees. The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) defended the fees as cost recovery measures, but committee members raised concerns about transparency and refundability. The committee also addressed issues related to license terms and statutory conflicts.

3. **Case Management Agencies and Licensing Requirements**:
   - The committee reviewed objections to rules governing case management agencies, particularly around licensing requirements. Stakeholders argued that all entities providing case management services should be licensed, while the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) sought exemptions for already licensed facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. The committee approved the rule but agreed to revisit and clarify licensing requirements.

4. **Medicaid Compliance and Emergency Rules**:
   - The department implemented an emergency rule (HEM 504) to comply with a corrective action plan by July 1, 2023, ensuring continued federal Medicaid funding. The rule revised contracts with area agencies, allowing providers to bill Medicaid directly and addressing historical issues where only area agencies were enrolled Medicaid providers. The committee emphasized the importance of oversight and standardization to avoid risks to individuals and imminent peril.

5. **Driver’s Licensing and Pistol Permits**:
   - The Department of Safety presented rules related to driver’s licensing, suspended licenses, and non-resident pistol permits. The department highlighted efforts to update forms through the rulemaking process and addressed issues arising from a Supreme Court decision on pistol permits.

6. **ESOL Teachers and English Language Learners**:
   - The committee discussed rules for ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) teachers, clarifying that the definition of English language learners in the rule would not affect education funding. The federal definition and law would override any state rule.

7. **Public Health Laboratories and Administrative Fines**:
   - Proposed rules for public health laboratories were reviewed, with concerns raised about conflicting statutes regarding the allocation of administrative fines. The agency acknowledged the need for legislative clarification and committed to addressing the issue.

8. **Geologists and Architects**:
   - The committee examined rules related to the licensing of geologists and architects, focusing on the use of generic seals for licenses. While concerns were raised about potential confusion, the OPLC clarified that the generic seals were intended to designate official state documents, with specific professions identified elsewhere on the licenses.

9. **Legislative Fixes and Rulemaking Challenges**:
   - Several issues, such as conflicting statutes on administrative fines and the need for clearer rules on licensing fees, were identified as requiring legislative fixes. The committee recommended that the OPLC continue working on clarifying these matters, emphasizing the importance of transparency and consistency in rulemaking.

### Conclusion:
The meeting concluded with the approval of several administrative rules, reflecting the committee’s commitment to ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations while addressing stakeholder concerns. The discussions highlighted ongoing challenges in administrative rulemaking, particularly around licensing fees, record retention, and the need for clearer statutory guidance. The committee underscored the importance of transparency and consistency to protect the public and ensure fair administration.
