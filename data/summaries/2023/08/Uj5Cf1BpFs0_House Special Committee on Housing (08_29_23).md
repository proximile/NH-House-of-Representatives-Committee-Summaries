**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Housing Meeting (08/29/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing convened on August 29, 2023, to address critical issues related to the state’s housing shortage. The meeting focused on legislative proposals, regulatory reforms, and innovative solutions to increase housing availability, affordability, and development efficiency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**
The committee debated legislation aimed at expanding the number of ADUs allowed by right from one to two per property. Key points included:
- **Benefits of ADUs**: ADUs were highlighted as a way to help homeowners afford mortgages, provide affordable housing options, and enable aging residents to remain in their homes.
- **Neighborhood Impact**: Concerns were raised about the potential effects on single-family neighborhoods, but supporters argued that gradual adoption would not drastically alter neighborhood character.
- **Workforce Housing**: Provisions were discussed to ensure that one of the ADUs could count toward municipalities’ workforce housing obligations, potentially requiring it to be rented at affordable rates.
- **Lot Size and Design Standards**: Municipalities would retain the ability to set minimum lot size requirements and maintain aesthetic standards to ensure ADUs blend with primary dwellings.
- **Pre-Approved Plans**: The possibility of state-level pre-approval for housing plans, including modular and 3D-printed homes, was explored to streamline construction across municipalities.
- **Housing Champion Program**: Incentives for municipalities to adopt housing-friendly policies, such as reducing lot size requirements, were considered.

### **2. Unconventional Housing Structures**
The committee addressed restrictive municipal zoning regulations that hinder the adoption of non-traditional housing structures, such as 3D-printed homes and Quonset huts:
- **Statewide Approval Mechanism**: A proposal was discussed to establish a statewide approval process for unconventional structures, allowing builders to bypass local zoning restrictions after obtaining state approval.
- **Quonset Huts**: These durable, efficient structures were highlighted as a viable housing option, despite their exclusion by many municipalities due to their non-traditional design.
- **Historic Areas**: Concerns were raised about the placement of atypical homes in historic districts, with Representative Walsh humorously referencing Hooksett Village as an example.

### **3. Building Permits, Septic Systems, and Impact Fees**
The committee explored ways to streamline regulatory processes and reduce development costs:
- **Building Permits and Appeals**: Discussions focused on improving the permitting process, including the potential for conceptual approval with fewer complete drawings and a centralized electronic tracking system. The appeals process for decisions by the State Fire Marshal’s Office was clarified, with proposals to allow property owners to choose their appeals board.
- **Septic Systems**: Representative McConkey presented a comparison of New Hampshire’s septic system regulations with those of Maine, suggesting legislative changes to reduce required lot sizes and construction costs without compromising environmental safety. The NH Department of Environmental Services (DES) supported some of these proposals.
- **Impact Fees**: The committee considered extending the time municipalities can hold impact fees from six to ten years and debated who should receive refunds for unused fees. Concerns were raised about unintended consequences for developers.

### **4. Roadway Standards and Development Costs**
The committee discussed the impact of roadway standards on housing development:
- **Cost Reduction**: Proposals included limiting requirements for sidewalks and curbs in smaller subdivisions to reduce costs. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is implementing an electronic permitting system to streamline processes and reduce delays.
- **Developer Challenges**: The committee acknowledged the significant costs and delays caused by current regulatory requirements.

---

### **5. Building Codes and Zoning Regulations**
The committee addressed concerns related to building codes and zoning:
- **Legislation on Building Codes**: Representative Wallace introduced a bill to ensure that only the zoning ordinances and regulations in effect at the time of a project’s approval are applied. Concerns were raised about applying outdated codes to modern construction.
- **Expert Testimony**: Ben Frost (New Hampshire Housing) and Bill McKinney (NH Building Officials Association) provided insights on the practical challenges of applying old codes and the importance of modern standards for safety and resilience.
- **Grandfathering and Appeals**: The committee debated the concept of grandfathering older developments and considered the jurisdiction of the Housing Appeals Board versus the Building Code Review Board.
- **Proposed Expansion of Housing Appeals Board**: Representative Cullen proposed expanding the board’s jurisdiction to include appeals related to state-issued permits impacting housing development.

### **6. Public Support and Next Steps**
- **Survey Findings**: A St. Anselm College survey revealed that 78% of New Hampshire voters believe their communities need more affordable housing, and 60% support changes to land use regulations to allow more development.
- **Refinement of Legislation**: The committee committed to refining proposed bills and consulting with stakeholders to address concerns and ensure clarity and effectiveness.
- **Next Meeting**: The committee scheduled its next meeting for September 5, 2023, at 10 A.M. to continue discussions on proposed legislation.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting emphasized a multifaceted approach to addressing New Hampshire’s housing crisis, including:
- Expanding housing options through ADUs and unconventional structures.
- Streamlining permitting and regulatory processes to reduce costs and delays.
- Balancing the need for modern building standards with the practical challenges faced by developers.
- Encouraging municipalities to adopt housing-friendly policies through incentives and legislative reforms.

The committee expressed strong support for these efforts while acknowledging the need for careful consideration of potential impacts on neighborhoods, the environment, and infrastructure.
