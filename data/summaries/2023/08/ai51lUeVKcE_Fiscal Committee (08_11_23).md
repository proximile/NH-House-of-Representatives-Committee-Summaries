The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on August 11, 2023, addressed a wide range of financial, operational, and strategic issues, with a focus on litigation expenses, resource management, and procedural improvements. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Operational and Financial Decisions**
1. **Building an Image and Defining Success**: A representative highlighted the importance of establishing a positive image for the committee and defining success metrics. Concerns were raised about a potential backlog of 700 cases in the Superior Court within a year and five months, prompting discussions on necessary changes to address this issue.

2. **Approval of Motions**: The committee approved several motions, including:
   - Minor administrative changes to Item 9.
   - Extension of the school infrastructure fund authorization from June 30, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
   - A retroactive amendment to FIS 22-380, extending its end date to June 30, 2024.
   - Hiring an outside expert for the Office of the Consumer Advocate to argue against high utility return on equity requests.

3. **Purchase vs. Lease Decision**: The committee opted to purchase loaded backhoes rather than leasing them, saving approximately $5 million over five years. A transfer of $4.8 million from the highway fund was approved to facilitate this purchase.

4. **Placement of Teenage Boys**: Two teenage boys placed in residential treatment in Tennessee will return to New Hampshire next week. They will not be placed in a Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF) but will receive equivalent care within the state.

5. **Future Meeting Scheduling**: The next meeting was scheduled for September 14, 2023, to accommodate Rosh Hashanah and other commitments. Senator D'Alessandro will be absent due to a prior commitment, and Representative Edwards will require alternates until December due to surgery.

### **Litigation and YDC Claims**
6. **Litigation Fund Request**: The Department of Justice requested $6.9 million for litigation expenses, a decrease from the previous year's request. This fund supports various legal activities, including defending the state in civil claims, prosecuting criminal cases, and handling consumer protection and environmental cases. A significant portion ($2.9 million) is allocated for YDC-related litigation, which involves over 1,000 claims against the state.

7. **YDC Claims Fund**: The YDC litigation involves claims of abuse from decades ago, with a high volume of document review and discovery responses. The Attorney General's office is also assisting the Department of Health and Human Services with related criminal investigations. The fund has already settled nine cases for approximately $4.8 million, with $2.9 million paid out so far.

8. **Administrative Process**: John Broderick, the administrator of the YDC claims fund, emphasized a trauma-informed, victim-centered approach to handling claims. The process is designed to be more efficient and less adversarial than court proceedings, with the goal of resolving claims quickly and confidentially.

### **Challenges and Future Considerations**
9. **Collaboration and Recommendations**: The committee discussed the need for collaboration between the Attorney Generalâ€™s office and the administrator to expedite the process of handling cases. Suggestions included digital claims to simplify the process and regular progress reports. The committee emphasized relying on experts for recommendations, especially for potential legislative changes.

10. **Challenges and Future Considerations**: Broderick highlighted the challenges of processing a high volume of claims within the December 31, 2024, deadline. He suggested that legislative changes might be needed to encourage more claimants to use the administrative process rather than going to court. He also noted the potential need for additional funding, given the significant number of claims and the associated costs.

11. **Committee Discussions**: Committee members raised questions about the proportion of costs to settlements, the timeline for resolving cases, and the potential for legislative changes to improve the process. There was also discussion about the need for digital claims packets and the importance of consulting with claimants' counsel on forms and procedures.

12. **Motions and Approvals**: The committee moved to approve the litigation expenses and discussed minor adjustments to the administrative claims process. There was a motion to allow the administrator to make future corrections to language and spelling without needing further committee approval.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which was unanimously approved. Overall, the meeting focused on financial approvals, operational decisions, and strategic planning for future actions, with a strong emphasis on collaboration, efficiency, and victim support in handling cases and resources.
