The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on August 17, 2023, focused on administrative rules, with discussions on various proposals and postponements. Key points include:

1. **Quorum and Attendance**: A quorum was established, with Senator Lang arriving late due to car trouble. Representative Hacken Phillips substituted for Representative Hatch, who was absent.

2. **Approval of Minutes**: The minutes from the previous meeting were approved without additions or corrections.

3. **Consent Agenda**: A motion to approve the consent agenda was moved by Senator Ward and seconded by Senator Ennis, passing unanimously.

4. **Postponements**: Six rule proposals were postponed, including those from the Board of Medicine, Board of Professional Engineers, and Mechanical Licensing Board. Waivers were noted for some items.

5. **Board of Education**: A final proposal regarding professional educator preparation programs was discussed. A conditional approval request addressed most comments, with a minor clarification needed.

6. **Board of Engineers**: A proposal on ethical standards and license surrender was postponed due to expired rules and enforcement concerns.

7. **Soil Scientists and Real Estate Appraisers**: Proposals for these boards were also postponed due to expired rules and lack of representation from the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).

8. **Professional Geologists**: A conditional approval request was discussed, with a motion to approve pending the addition of a form title.

9. **Department of Environmental Services**: A final proposal on terrain alteration was discussed, with minor clarifications needed. The department committed to making necessary corrections.

10. **Agriculture Rule**: A proposal adopting a single section from expired rules was objected to due to lack of form submission and long-standing expiration issues.

11. **Broadband Matching Grant Initiative**: A conditional approval request addressed all comments. The proposal was approved despite expired interim rules.

12. **Emergency Rule for Respiratory Care Practitioners**: An emergency rule was discussed to revert continuing education requirements to lower limits due to licensee feedback and a shortage of practitioners.

13. **Future Meetings**: The committee planned an additional meeting on August 31 to address postponed OPLC rules and manage the workload.

The meeting concluded with adjournment, and members were reminded of the upcoming meeting on August 31.
