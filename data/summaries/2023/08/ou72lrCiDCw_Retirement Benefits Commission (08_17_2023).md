The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on August 17, 2023, focused on the Retirement Benefits Commission's work. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Attendance and Replacements**: Several representatives were absent, and replacements were noted, including John McAllister replacing Brian Riddle.

2. **Election of Vice Chair and Clerk**: Senator Gray was nominated and elected as Vice Chair, and Brian Rill was appointed as Clerk.

3. **Agenda and Scheduling**: The commission discussed the need for regular meetings, scheduling weekly Thursday meetings to address their broad charge and ensure progress on their report due by December 1, 2023.

4. **Retirement System Discussion**: The commission reviewed proposals to adjust retirement benefits, particularly for Group 2 employees hired before July 1, 2011. Senator Bradley presented two versions of an amendment to increase the retirement multiplier for these employees, emphasizing the need for accurate actuarial analysis to avoid shifting costs to municipalities or counties.

5. **Actuarial Analysis**: The commission agreed to send both versions of the proposed changes for actuarial analysis to determine costs and feasibility. The analysis is expected to take a couple of weeks.

6. **Broader Retirement System Issues**: While the immediate focus is on Group 2 employees, the commission acknowledged the need to examine broader retirement system issues, including cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), multipliers, and retention strategies for public safety employees.

7. **Funding and Sustainability**: Senators stressed the importance of ensuring any changes are affordable and sustainable, given ongoing fiscal challenges, including potential lawsuits and fluctuating state revenues.

8. **Next Steps**: The next meeting will focus on high-level brainstorming to prioritize areas for further examination and establish criteria for evaluating potential changes to the retirement system.

The meeting concluded with no further comments or concerns, and the commission adjourned.
