### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Retirement Benefits Commission Meeting (08/24/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Retirement Benefits Commission convened on August 24, 2023, to discuss critical issues related to the state’s retirement system, including cost estimates, benefit changes, and strategies to address retention and fiscal sustainability. The meeting focused on two primary segments: (1) cost estimates and proposed changes to the retirement system, and (2) discussions around the 457b deferred compensation plan, cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), and other benefit enhancements.

#### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

1. **Approval of Minutes and Historical Context**  
   The commission began by approving the minutes from two previous meetings. Members were reminded of the commission’s original purpose—to address benefit losses from 2011—while also considering broader reforms to improve the retirement system.

2. **Cost Estimates for Retirement System Changes**  
   Marty Carlin from the New Hampshire Retirement System presented a detailed chart summarizing cost estimates for various proposed bills and amendments. These proposals primarily impacted Group Two (police, fire, and correctional personnel) and Group One (teachers and state employees). The chart highlighted unfunded liabilities (UAL), projected employer rate increases, and the number of members affected by the changes.

3. **Terminal Funding**  
   The concept of terminal funding was introduced as a potential solution to avoid future rate increases. This approach involves paying upfront for benefit changes, particularly for closed groups like Tier B members. However, it is more challenging to calculate for open-ended changes affecting future hires.

4. **Defined Benefit Plans and COLAs**  
   A significant debate centered on whether COLAs should be considered part of defined benefit plans. Some members argued that COLAs were historically integral to the system and should be reinstated, while others noted that COLAs are not inherently part of defined benefit plans. The high cost of reinstating COLAs—past estimates exceeded $1 billion in unfunded liabilities—was acknowledged. Members brainstormed alternative funding mechanisms, such as dedicated COLA accounts funded by employer contributions or using annuities and insurance policies.

5. **Retention and Benefit Enhancements**  
   Senator Gray emphasized the need to improve benefits to retain employees, referencing the federal government’s three-tier retirement system as a potential model. Suggestions included exploring matching programs, reducing the 10-year vesting period to align with shorter periods in other states (e.g., 3 or 5 years), and enhancing the 457b deferred compensation plan. The 457b plan, implemented in 2021 through House Bill 1563, faced challenges due to lack of employee, employer, and union interest. Members proposed revisiting an opt-out approach, which has been successful in states like California.

6. **Funding and Employer Contributions**  
   Members debated whether the state should increase its contribution to retirement benefits for teachers, firefighters, and police officers, as it did historically. This would alleviate the burden on local property taxes. There was also a discussion about slowing the decline in employer contribution rates as unfunded liabilities decrease, which could fund COLAs and other benefit enhancements.

7. **Spiking and Overtime**  
   The issue of pension spiking—where employees work excessive overtime in their final years to inflate their pensions—was addressed. Members considered whether mandatory overtime should be included in base pay calculations for pensions, particularly in light of workforce shortages and burnout.

8. **Historical Data and Future Projections**  
   The commission reviewed historical data on average years of service for retirees and discussed the impact of unfunded liabilities on future employer rates. The unfunded liability is expected to be paid off by 2039, leading to a significant decrease in employer rates.

9. **Next Steps**  
   The commission decided to cancel the next week’s meeting and reconvene in two weeks to review actuarial data on proposed changes. Members planned to continue brainstorming and refining proposals, with the goal of making recommendations for legislative action.

#### **Key Takeaways**  
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing employee benefits, fiscal responsibility, and recruitment/retention challenges in New Hampshire’s public sector workforce. Members recognized the need for creative solutions, such as terminal funding, dedicated COLA accounts, and enhanced deferred compensation plans, while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the retirement system. The commission aims to develop actionable recommendations that address both immediate concerns and future needs.
