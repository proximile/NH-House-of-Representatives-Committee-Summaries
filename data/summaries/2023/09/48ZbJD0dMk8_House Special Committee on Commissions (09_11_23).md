**Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (September 11, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions convened on September 11, 2023, to discuss the review, consolidation, and potential repeal of certain committees and commissions, as well as to address administrative and legislative matters. The meeting began with a moment of silence to honor the 22nd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, setting a solemn tone for the proceedings.

### Key Focus Areas and Discussions:

1. **Process Over Immediate Repeals**:  
   The committee emphasized the importance of establishing a structured and bipartisan process for evaluating commissions rather than pursuing immediate repeals. Discussions highlighted the need for education and awareness to ensure members understand the criteria for retaining or eliminating commissions.

2. **Placeholder Legislation**:  
   The committee considered filing placeholder legislation to initiate the process of repealing commissions. Representative Hunt was identified as the likely prime sponsor for a bill targeting the repeal of the Commission on the Status of Health Coverage Markets for Individuals and Small Employers, which is set to sunset in 2024.

3. **Bipartisan Collaboration**:  
   The committee stressed the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach by inviting both committee chairs and ranking members to provide input on the commissions under their jurisdiction.

4. **Criteria for Repeal**:  
   Discussions centered on establishing clear criteria for determining which commissions should be repealed, such as inactivity, duplication of efforts, or lack of necessity. The committee also highlighted the need to avoid creating new commissions unnecessarily.

5. **Legislation Filing Week**:  
   While it was the week to file legislation, the committee acknowledged they were not yet ready to produce any. They noted the activity around legislative filings and emphasized the need to respect this process.

6. **Committee Updates and Data Management**:  
   Staff updates included the creation of a master list of statutory and study committees and the development of an export function to streamline access to committee data. Efforts to automate processes and improve data accuracy were highlighted, along with ongoing data cleanup initiatives.

7. **Continuing Education Program**:  
   Plans for a continuing education program for legislators were outlined. The program, which has been well-attended in the past, will cover various types of committees and commissions, emphasizing their roles and responsibilities.

8. **Tri-fold Pamphlet**:  
   The committee discussed the creation of a tri-fold pamphlet to educate legislators on the process of forming statutory and study committees. The pamphlet will include tips for drafting legislation, questions to consider, and boilerplate language to standardize committee creation.

9. **Potential Repeals**:  
   The committee reviewed a list of committees and commissions that could potentially be repealed due to inactivity or redundancy. They discussed the process for identifying and addressing these committees, including the possibility of opening a special legislative window to file repeal legislation.

10. **Reporting Requirements**:  
    The committee addressed inconsistencies in reporting requirements for committees and commissions, emphasizing the need for standardized processes to ensure reports are filed and reviewed by relevant authorities.

11. **Speaker’s Expectations**:  
    The House Speaker expressed satisfaction with the committee’s progress but hoped for more concrete actions, such as identifying two or three dozen commissions for potential repeal by the end of the year.

12. **Education for New Members**:  
    The committee discussed the importance of educating new House members about the process of creating and evaluating commissions to avoid unnecessary commitments and costs.

### Upcoming Meetings and Next Steps:  
The next meeting was scheduled for October 2, 2023, with plans to invite committee chairs and ranking members to discuss their commissions. A follow-up meeting was tentatively set for October 16, 2023. The committee aims to continue refining its processes, improving data management, and addressing issues with inactive or redundant committees in the coming months.

### Overall Objective:

Through education, data management, and legislative oversight, the committee seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of New Hampshire’s committee system.
