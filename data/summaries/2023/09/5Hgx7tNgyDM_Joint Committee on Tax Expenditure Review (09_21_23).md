---

### **Key Tax Credits and Expenditures**
1. **Insurance Premium Tax Credits**: Insurance companies can use premium taxes to offset their Business Profits Tax (BPT). In fiscal year 2022, $44 million in credits were utilized by 273 taxpayers.
2. **Cascading vs. Non-Cascading Credits**: Cascading credits can be applied against both the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) and BPT, while non-cascading credits apply to only one.
3. **Community Development Finance Authority (CDFA) Credit**: Administered by the CDFA, claims increased in fiscal year 2022.
4. **Economic Revitalization Zone (ERZ) Credit**: Encourages payroll and capital expenditures in designated zones; set to expire in January 2028.
5. **Research and Development (R&D) Credit**: No sunset date, with a $7 million annual cap. Claims in fiscal year 2022 totaled $5.3 million.
6. **Education Tax Credit**: Encourages donations to scholarship organizations, with a $5.1 million cap.
7. **Qualified Regenerative Manufacturing Companies (QRMC) Exemption**: Exempts qualifying companies from BET and BPT; set to expire in December 2027.
8. **Career and Technical Education Center Credit**: Encourages donations to technical education centers; set to expire after fiscal year 2026.
9. **Net Operating Losses (NOL)**: Changes include a $10 million cap per entity and a 10-year carryover period. The total NOL deduction in fiscal year 2022 was $470 million.

### **Fiscal Impact and Liability**
1. **Credit Carryovers**: The committee discussed the impact of credit carryovers on state revenues. New caps will reduce carryovers from 500% to 250% of tax liability by 2025 and to 100% by 2027. This change will affect state revenues and refunds.
2. **Outstanding Liability and Refunds**: The committee requested detailed information on outstanding liabilities and expected refunds due to the new caps, as these will significantly impact future state revenues.
3. **Tax Credit Refunds**: The committee addressed the process of refunding taxpayers for amounts exceeding the $500 limitation, which reduces future state revenue. They emphasized proactive communication with taxpayers about their credits.

### **Unaddressed Tax Expenditures**
The committee identified four tax expenditures not addressed in the previous year’s report:
- Education Tax Credit
- Revitalization Zone Tax Credit
- Coös County Job Creation Tax Credit
- Community Development Finance Authority Tax Credit  
These will be a focus in upcoming meetings, with presentations scheduled for October 20, 2023.

### **Legislative Considerations**
1. **Spreading Refund Impact**: The committee considered proposing legislation to spread the impact of refunds over a longer period rather than a two-year cycle to mitigate revenue fluctuations.
2. **Ongoing Reviews**: The committee is considering implementing a rotating review of tax expenditures every five years to ensure thorough analysis and accountability.

---

### **Future Reports and Deadlines**
1. **Fiscal Year 2023 Report**: The committee is preparing the fiscal year 2023 report, expected to be issued around December 2023, similar to the fiscal year 2022 report.
2. **Submission Deadline**: The committee must submit its report by November 1, 2023, and aims to finalize it without needing additional meetings.

### **Next Steps**
The committee scheduled its next meeting for **October 20, 2023, at 9 A.M.**, where they will:
- Review presentations on the four unaddressed tax expenditures.
- Discuss the impact of credit carryovers and refunds.
- Finalize the fiscal year 2023 report.
