The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on August 31, 2023, focused on administrative rules across various boards and professions. Key discussions included:

1. **Postponement of Physician Assistants Item**: The item was postponed to the next meeting due to the Board of Medicine's upcoming meeting on September 5th.

2. **Board of Mental Health Practice**: The committee reviewed amended conditional approval for license and registration requirements. Concerns were raised about the collection of Social Security numbers for prerequisite exams, with discussions on statutory authority and privacy implications.

3. **Professional Engineers**: Rules on ethical standards, license surrender, and continued status were discussed. The rules had expired since January 2022, and there were questions about fee collection during the expiration period. The committee objected to one rule due to enforcement issues during expiration.

4. **Board of Natural Scientists**: Ethical standards rules, expired since March 2019, were reviewed. The committee approved the rule, noting that no disciplinary actions were taken during the expiration.

5. **Real Estate Appraiser Board**: Ethical standards and continued status rules, expired since February 2023, were discussed. The committee objected to one rule due to fee discrepancies and enforcement issues during expiration.

6. **Mechanical Licensing Board**: Rules were reviewed, including changes due to the board's transfer from the Department of Safety to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC). Concerns were raised about assessing physical and mental competency in license applications. The committee recommended the OPLC provide further guidance on this issue.

The meeting concluded with plans to address legislative fixes and updates to administrative rules in future sessions. The next meeting was scheduled for September 21st.
