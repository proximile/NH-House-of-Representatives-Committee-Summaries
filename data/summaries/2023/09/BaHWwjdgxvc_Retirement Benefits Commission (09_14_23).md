**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Retirement Benefits Commission Meeting (09/14/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on September 14, 2023, to discuss critical issues and proposed amendments related to the state’s retirement system. The meeting focused on addressing historical challenges, current financial conditions, and potential reforms to improve benefits for affected workers, particularly public safety officers, firefighters, and correctional personnel (Group 2 members). Key discussions and takeaways from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **Historical Context and Current State of the Retirement System**
The New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) has faced significant challenges in the past, including underfunding by employers, poor investment returns, and rising employer contribution rates. These issues created financial strain on cities, towns, and schools, leading to changes in 2011 that increased member contribution rates and altered benefit calculations. While these measures stabilized the system, they disproportionately impacted certain workers, particularly Group 2 members.

Currently, the retirement system is in better financial health, with the fund growing from $6 billion in 2011 to over $11 billion in 2023. However, the legacy of the 2011 changes continues to affect workers who expected certain benefits. Member contributions have also increased by 2% of payroll since 2011, contributing approximately $50 million annually to stabilize the system. Despite this, the system still faces unfunded liabilities, which have grown significantly over time (e.g., from $140 million in 2018 to over $200 million in 2023).

### **Proposed Amendments and Financial Implications**
The commission reviewed two proposed amendments to address retirement benefits for Group 2 members:
1. **Amendment 2258**: Proposes a flat 2.5% multiplier for retirement benefits.
2. **Amendment 2259**: Proposes a graduated multiplier based on years of service.

Actuarial reports presented by Marty Carlin of NHRS highlighted the financial implications of these amendments:
- Amendment 2258 would cost approximately $92.6 million.
- Amendment 2259 would cost approximately $59.1 million.

Both amendments would increase employer contribution rates and add to the unfunded liability (UAL). The commission emphasized the importance of "terminal funding," where the state would cover the entire cost upfront to avoid passing the financial burden onto property taxpayers. However, the state currently lacks surplus funds from the previous budget, making funding these changes challenging.

### **Retention and Recruitment Concerns**
Several representatives expressed concerns about the retention and recruitment of public safety officers, citing the need for competitive retirement benefits to keep experienced personnel. While some members supported the amendments as a way to address this issue, others questioned their effectiveness and fiscal feasibility. Senator Gray proposed alternative solutions, such as:
- Increasing the multiplier at specific service milestones (e.g., 20 and 30 years).
- Allowing unions to negotiate voluntary contribution matches.

These alternatives were suggested as more fiscally responsible ways to improve retention without imposing significant costs on the state or municipalities.

### **Concerns Over Inequities and Tiers**
The commission also discussed the potential for creating inequities within the retirement system by introducing additional tiers. Members raised concerns about employees working side by side with different benefits, which could lead to dissatisfaction and morale issues.

---

### **Deliberation and Next Steps**
The commission debated the merits of Amendment 2258 but ultimately decided to delay a decision until October 5, 2023, to allow for more financial data, particularly September and October revenue figures, to be reviewed. This additional information will help the commission better understand the state’s fiscal capacity to fund the proposed changes.

In the meantime, the commission plans to:
- Meet again on September 28 to discuss proposals and review actuarial analyses.
- Consider other legislative changes, such as counting mandatory overtime as base pay for retirement calculations and enabling voluntary contribution matches.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Historical Issues and Progress**: The NHRS has improved significantly since 2011, but legacy issues continue to affect certain workers.
2. **Proposed Amendments**: Amendments 2258 and 2259 aim to address these issues but come with substantial financial costs.
3. **Fiscal Responsibility**: The commission is committed to ensuring that any changes are fiscally responsible and do not burden property taxpayers.
4. **Retention and Recruitment**: Competitive retirement benefits are seen as crucial for retaining experienced public safety personnel, but the commission is exploring cost-effective alternatives.
5. **Next Steps**: The commission will gather more financial data before making final decisions on the proposed amendments.

The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing the need for equitable retirement benefits with fiscal responsibility, particularly in the context of public safety personnel. The commission’s cautious approach reflects a commitment to addressing these issues thoughtfully and sustainably.
