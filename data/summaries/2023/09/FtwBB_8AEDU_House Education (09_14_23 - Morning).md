**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (09/14/23 - Morning)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on September 14, 2023, to address critical issues surrounding **school building aid**, **funding for charter schools**, and **public school infrastructure**. The meeting highlighted the complexities of funding school construction and renovation projects, with a focus on equity, sustainability, and forward-thinking solutions. Key discussions and takeaways are summarized below:

---

### **1. School Building Aid Program**
The committee extensively reviewed the **current state of New Hampshire’s school building aid program**, which allocates $50 million annually but falls short of addressing the growing needs of aging school facilities. Key points included:
- **Space and Enrollment Challenges**: Schools, especially those providing special education services, require more space per pupil, yet projecting future enrollment remains difficult, complicating long-term planning.
- **Funding Limitations**: The program uses a ranking system to prioritize projects, leaving many schools on the lower end without funding. This has raised concerns about equity and the need for a more comprehensive approach.
- **Historical Context**: The program once funded all eligible projects, but a moratorium and subsequent shift to a ranking system have limited its effectiveness.
- **Comparative Analysis**: The committee examined funding models from other states, including Alaska, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wyoming, which use grants, bonds, and dedicated revenue sources like lottery proceeds and sales taxes. States like Idaho and Tennessee allocate funds based on student attendance or enrollment, while others consider local economic capacity, square footage, and project costs.

### **2. Charter School Funding**
The committee debated **whether charter schools should be included in the building aid program**, given their unique corporate structure and current reliance on lease aid. Key discussions included:
- **Lease Aid Program**: Charter schools currently receive lease aid, capped at $50,000 per school, but this is insufficient for those that own their facilities.
- **Dissolution Concerns**: Questions were raised about asset ownership and dissolution processes for charter schools, with members noting that boilerplate plans may need revision.
- **Funding Eligibility**: While some states explicitly exclude charter schools from construction funding, others, like Oklahoma, include them. The committee explored potential reforms to extend building aid to charter schools, particularly those with significant facility needs.

### **3. Funding Allocation and Reform**
The committee discussed **strategies to improve funding allocation** and address the financial challenges faced by school districts:
- **Formula-Driven Models**: States like North Carolina and New Mexico use sophisticated systems to prioritize projects based on need, facility conditions, and student populations. The committee considered adopting a similar approach for New Hampshire.
- **Debt and Lifecycle Costs**: The high costs of school construction and renovation, including debt repayment and lifecycle expenses, were a major concern. Some states, like Maine, cover nearly 100% of construction costs, while others, like Connecticut, offer grants ranging from 20% to 80% based on local economic capacity.
- **Proposed Changes**: The committee explored reforms such as creating a flat annual appropriation based on a formula, extending the range of state funding from 30%-60% to 20%-80%, and ensuring funds are available only after project approval to provide more predictability.

### **4. House Bill 354**
The committee discussed **House Bill 354**, which proposes a flat rate of 30% of Average Daily Membership (ADM) for charter school funding. Key points included:
- **Building Aid Eligibility**: There was debate about whether charter schools, as public schools, should qualify for building aid, with concerns raised about inconsistencies in statutes.
- **Funding Formula**: The chair presented a detailed formula inspired by models from other states, such as Tennessee, which calculates aid based on square footage per pupil, construction costs, and other factors. The formula aims to provide a predictable, long-term funding mechanism, with funds held in a state-controlled account to ensure sustainability.
- **Emergency Projects**: The formula includes provisions for emergency projects, such as schools with safety hazards like leaking roofs or contaminated water, with interest accrued from state-held funds potentially used for such needs.

### **5. Challenges and Forward-Thinking Solutions**
The committee acknowledged the **challenges of balancing limited funds with growing needs** and emphasized the importance of long-term planning:
- **Aging Infrastructure**: Many schools in New Hampshire are much older than the typical 40-year lifecycle of a school building, requiring significant investment to meet modern standards, particularly for safety and special education needs.
- **Predictability and Sustainability**: The current system’s unpredictability often leaves districts without funding for critical projects. The committee stressed the need for a sustainable funding mechanism that addresses both immediate needs and long-term planning.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to review additional data and examples from other states, refine the proposed funding model, and seek feedback from stakeholders, including a scheduled meeting with former State Board of Education chair Fred Bramonte to discuss rule revisions (ed306) and their alignment with current statutes.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the **urgent need for strategic reforms** to address New Hampshire’s school construction and renovation challenges. By exploring funding models from other states, debating the inclusion of charter schools in building aid programs, and proposing a more predictable and equitable funding formula, the committee aimed to create a sustainable solution that supports both traditional public schools and charter schools. The discussions highlighted the importance of balancing immediate needs with long-term planning, ensuring that all students have access to safe, modern, and adequately equipped learning environments. The committee committed to continuing its work to refine proposals and advance legislative solutions.
