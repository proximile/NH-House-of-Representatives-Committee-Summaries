The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee meeting on September 29, 2023, focused on a bill related to child care workforce retention and recruitment. The discussion revolved around the need for ongoing support for child care providers, the allocation of funds, and the effectiveness of existing programs.

Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Existing Programs and Funding**: Members discussed significant investments already made through federal and state funds, including millions allocated for child care programs, recruitment, and retention bonuses. These efforts were seen as substantial and overlapping with the proposed bill.

2. **Concerns Over Redundancy**: Several representatives expressed doubts about the necessity of the new bill, given the extensive funding and initiatives already in place. They noted that the billâ€™s scope was relatively small compared to existing programs.

3. **Long-Term Solutions**: There was a focus on the need for long-term stabilization in the child care sector, with references to the ARPA plan and its three phases aimed at addressing long-term challenges.

4. **Consultant Costs vs. Direct Support**: Some members raised concerns about the allocation of funds to consultants for developing plans rather than directly supporting child care providers with retention and recruitment bonuses.

5. **Stakeholder Involvement**: The absence of stakeholders at the meeting was noted, leading some to infer that existing efforts might already be addressing their concerns.

6. **Recommendation to Lay the Bill to Rest**: After thorough discussion, the subcommittee recommended not moving forward with the bill, citing the significant ongoing efforts and investments already in place.

7. **Future Monitoring**: Members emphasized the importance of continued monitoring by the Child Care Committee to ensure that the needs of the child care workforce are met and to consider future legislation if necessary.

Overall, the committee concluded that the existing initiatives and funding were sufficient to address the issues at hand, and they recommended against advancing the proposed bill.
