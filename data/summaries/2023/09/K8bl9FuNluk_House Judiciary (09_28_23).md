The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on September 28, 2023, centered on discussions about the Human Rights Commission (HRC) and proposed legislative changes aimed at addressing inefficiencies and fairness in handling employment discrimination cases. The meeting, spanning multiple segments, highlighted systemic issues, debated proposed reforms, and emphasized the need for a balanced approach to ensure due process for both employees and employers. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points discussed:

### **Challenges in HRC Operations**
1. **Case Backlogs and Delays**: The HRC faces significant delays in processing cases, with some cases pending since 2019 and others taking over two years to resolve. Delays were attributed to resource constraints, high turnover, and the complexity of investigations. Concerns were raised about the impact of these delays on both complainants (employees) and respondents (employers), as prolonged cases can harm both parties.
   
2. **Resource and Staffing Issues**: Chronic underfunding and staffing shortages were identified as major contributors to inefficiencies. Investigators are overburdened, and the hiring process for qualified personnel is time-consuming and competitive. The lack of resources hampers the HRC’s ability to conduct thorough and timely investigations.

3. **Investigation Process**: The HRC’s investigation process came under scrutiny. While complainants are always interviewed, respondents and their witnesses are sometimes not given the opportunity to present their side, leading to perceptions of unfairness. Some argued that employer witnesses should be interviewed to ensure fairness, while others noted that in clear-cut cases, such interviews might not be necessary.

4. **Transparency and Data**: Outdated statistics on the HRC website, last updated in 2018, were criticized for lacking transparency. Efforts are underway to improve data tracking and reporting to build trust in the process.

### **Proposed Legislative Changes**
1. **House Bill 362 FN**: The bill proposes to remove the respondent’s (employer’s) right to remove a case to court for a jury trial after the HRC issues a probable cause determination. Proponents argued that this change would level the playing field for unrepresented employees and reduce delays. Opponents, including attorneys and representatives from the Business and Industry Association (BIA), contended that it undermines due process and fairness for employers, who often remove cases to court due to perceived bias or inadequacies in the HRC’s process.

2. **Historical Context**: New Hampshire’s current system, which allows respondents to remove cases to Superior Court, was implemented preemptively following Massachusetts’ lead. While Massachusetts upheld its statute, New Hampshire’s approach has led to ongoing debates about fairness and efficiency.

3. **Impact on Settlement Negotiations**: Removing the right to a jury trial could reduce opportunities for settlements, as the threat of removal often incentivizes parties to negotiate.

### **Fairness and Due Process**
1. **Representation Disparity**: A significant imbalance exists in legal representation, with 90-95% of employers represented by counsel compared to 90-95% of complainants being unrepresented. This disparity affects the fairness and efficiency of the process.

2. **Balancing Rights**: The debate emphasized the need for a balanced approach that considers the rights of both employees and employers. While some argued that the current system disproportionately disadvantages unrepresented employees, others stressed the importance of maintaining due process for employers.

### **Calls for Systemic Reforms**
1. **Audit and Recommendations**: An ongoing audit of the HRC by the legislative audit division is expected to provide recommendations for improving efficiency and effectiveness. Some representatives urged that the proposed bill be considered separately from the broader audit findings.

2. **Funding and Structural Improvements**: Instead of statutory changes, speakers called for addressing the HRC’s underfunding and structural issues, such as hiring trained hearing officers, improving discovery rules, and implementing consequences for delays.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: New Hampshire’s process was compared to other states and federal systems, where respondents typically cannot remove cases to court. However, speakers noted that New Hampshire’s unique structure and underfunding make such comparisons unfair.

### **Next Steps**
The committee decided to schedule another meeting on October 19, 2023, to further discuss the bill and potential amendments. They emphasized the need for careful consideration, given the complexity of the issues and the potential for unintended consequences. Representatives also stressed the importance of hearing from all stakeholders, including those involved in housing, public education, and public accommodations cases, not just employment cases.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges faced by the HRC in handling discrimination cases, including delays, resource constraints, and fairness concerns. While proposed legislative changes aim to address some of these issues, the discussions highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach that balances efficiency, fairness, and due process for all parties. The ongoing audit and potential funding and structural improvements were seen as critical steps toward meaningful reform.
