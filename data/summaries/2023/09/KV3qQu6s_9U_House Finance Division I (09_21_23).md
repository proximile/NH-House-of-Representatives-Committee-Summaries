**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting on September 21, 2023**

The NH House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on September 21, 2023, addressed a range of topics, including environmental regulations, budget concerns, legislative bills, and the resignation of a long-serving representative. The discussions highlighted the ongoing tension between environmental protection, financial responsibility, and the need for evidence-based policymaking.

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

1. **Environmental and Financial Policies**:
   - **PFAS Regulation Debate**: Representative Weiler voiced concerns over the stringent PFAS regulations, particularly the 12 parts per trillion limit, arguing it was scientifically unsubstantiated and financially burdensome. He emphasized that PFAS are widespread and that the costs of reducing their levels in water systems would be excessive.
   - **Support for Environmental Analysis**: Another representative advocated for allocating $200,000 for a comprehensive environmental analysis, citing the state’s pollution and landfill issues. They argued that the investment was justified by the potential environmental and public health benefits.
   - **Budget Concerns**: Representative Sweeney opposed creating a $247,000 salaried position to study a policy not directly requested by the department, referencing the recent bipartisan budget’s expansion of government spending. He suggested revisiting the issue in future budget discussions.

2. **Legislative Bills and Recommendations**:
   - The committee reviewed several bills, most of which were recommended for "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), meaning they should not proceed. These included:
     - **House Bill 212**: Recommended for ITL.
     - **House Bill 230**: Recommended for ITL, concerning the Department of Agriculture's data processing system.
     - **House Bill 300**: Recommended for ITL, related to food waste disposal.
     - **House Bill 311 (Buco Box)**: Recommended for ITL, despite being included in the budget.
     - **House Bill 347**: Recommended for ITL, concerning an additional judgeship.
     - **House Bill 462**: Recommended for ITL, focused on food waste reduction and diversion.
   - **Cumulative Impacts Analysis (House Bill 571)**: A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to this bill, which would require the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to conduct cumulative impacts analyses for environmental permits. The bill was part of a budget compromise, but the Senate modified it to include all retirees rather than a specific group. Concerns were raised about the bill’s vagueness and its potential to slow down permitting processes. After extensive debate, the committee voted 7-1 to recommend ITL.
   - **Senate Bill 128**: This bill, pertaining to legal services for involuntarily admitted mental health patients, was also recommended for ITL as it was not included in the Senate’s budget.

3. **Public and Expert Testimony**:
   - Representatives from the Conservation Law Foundation and DES provided insights on the cumulative impacts analysis bill. They discussed the complexities of defining cumulative impacts and the potential public health benefits. DES indicated they lacked the resources to conduct such analyses currently but did not oppose the bill if funding was provided.

4. **Resignation of Representative Hatch**:
   - The meeting began with remarks acknowledging the resignation of Representative Bill Hatch, who has served since 2006. His contributions to the Ways and Means and Finance committees were highlighted, and his health struggles, including a Vietnam War injury that led to the loss of his leg, were noted. He is moving to Bedford for better access to rehab and hospital care.

5. **Motions and Upcoming Business**:
   - A motion to pass the PFAS-related bill failed with a 5-3 vote. An alternative motion to retain the bill for further consideration was made, seconded, and unanimously approved.
   - The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene at 11:00 AM to discuss **House Bill 436**, with a request from Representative Carol McGuire to delay action until the Retirement Commission provides recommendations.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing environmental regulation, financial prudence, and scientific evidence in policymaking. While some representatives emphasized the importance of stringent environmental protections, others highlighted the financial and logistical burdens associated with such measures. The committee’s recommendations on various bills reflected these tensions, with most bills being deemed inexpedient to legislate. The resignation of Representative Hatch marked a moment of reflection on his significant contributions to the House. The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on pending legislation in future sessions.
