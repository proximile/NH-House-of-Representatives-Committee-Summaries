The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing convened on September 5, 2023, to discuss several key housing-related issues and potential legislative changes. Hereâ€™s a summary of the meeting:

### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Sprinkler Requirements for Residential Conversions**:
   - Representative Damon proposed making sprinklers optional for converting single-family homes into three-unit buildings, provided there is no increase in the number of bedrooms. This aims to reduce costs for workforce housing projects.
   - Concerns were raised about the cost of sprinkler systems, which can range from $60,000 to $100,000, making conversions prohibitive.
   - The committee discussed the need to coordinate with the State Fire Marshal and building officials to navigate potential opposition and update building codes.

2. **Building Code and Fire Code Updates**:
   - Ben Frost from New Hampshire Housing explained that current state law does not require sprinklers in one- and two-family structures, but discussions are ongoing to extend this to three- and four-family units under certain conditions.
   - Any changes would likely require statutory updates to both the building and fire codes.

3. **Driveway Permit Process**:
   - The committee reviewed a draft LSR (Legislative Service Request) to streamline the driveway permit process. The proposal would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to issue permits within 30 or 45 days, depending on the property size. If the DOT fails to act within this timeframe, the permit would be issued by default after an additional 14 days.
   - The committee debated the language and process, ultimately agreeing to simplify the proposal to ensure timely permit issuance without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles.

4. **Housing Champion Advisory Board**:
   - Representative Oh was appointed to the Housing Champion Advisory Board, which will advise on rule-making processes for designating municipalities as housing champions. This initiative aims to encourage municipalities to adopt housing-friendly policies without requiring new legislation.

5. **Zoning and Health/Safety Standards**:
   - Representative Reed proposed legislation to explicitly tie zoning ordinances to health and safety standards, preventing municipalities from imposing arbitrary restrictions (e.g., minimum lot sizes) not based on scientific or safety considerations.
   - The committee discussed the potential for incentivizing municipalities to adopt more flexible zoning practices, particularly for smaller homes and alternative housing types like tiny homes and RVs.

6. **Legislative Process and LSRs**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of communication among members when filing LSRs related to housing. Members were encouraged to notify the committee chair and allow co-sponsorship opportunities within the committee before opening it to the broader legislature.

### Next Steps:
- Members plan to file LSRs based on the discussions, particularly regarding sprinkler requirements, driveway permits, and zoning reforms.
- The committee will continue to refine proposals and coordinate with relevant state agencies and stakeholders.
- Future meetings will be scheduled as needed, with updates provided to the committee on progress and new developments.

The meeting concluded with a focus on streamlining processes, reducing barriers to housing development, and ensuring that zoning and building codes align with health and safety standards.
