**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting on September 19, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on September 19, 2023, to address the complexities and challenges of funding special education, particularly for students with disabilities. The meeting highlighted several critical issues and potential solutions, with a focus on ensuring equitable and sustainable support for school districts.

### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Funding Mechanisms and Cost Sharing**:
   - The state currently reimburses districts for special education costs exceeding 3.5 times the average per-pupil expenditure. However, this high threshold leaves districts to cover significant expenses, especially for catastrophic cases.
   - A proposed bill, **HB 577**, suggests lowering the threshold to 1.5 times the average per-pupil cost, which would increase the number of students eligible for state aid. While this would alleviate some financial burdens on districts, it could triple or quadruple the stateâ€™s current $32 million allocation for special education aid.

2. **Placement and Financial Responsibility**:
   - The committee discussed the financial responsibility for students placed outside their home districts. If the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) places a student, the district bears the full cost, whereas placements by school districts involve shared costs.
   - Concerns were raised about ensuring that costs submitted by private special education providers align with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Providers submit annual budgets and audits, which are used to approve rates.

3. **Data Management and Collection Challenges**:
   - The New Hampshire Special Education Information System (NESSIS) is widely used to manage IEPs and invoices, though some districts use alternative systems, requiring additional data entry.
   - The Department of Education (DOE) currently does not collect detailed cost data for all special education students, only for those exceeding the reimbursement threshold. This lack of comprehensive data makes it difficult to estimate the financial impact of proposed changes.

4. **Equity and Impact on Districts**:
   - Small towns, in particular, struggle with the financial burden of special education costs, often lacking the resources or reserve funds to cover unexpected expenses. Lowering the reimbursement threshold could help these districts but might also spread limited funds more thinly.
   - The committee acknowledged the additional costs associated with special education, including administrative, instructional, and facility-related expenses, and emphasized the need for a clearer understanding of these costs to make informed funding decisions.

5. **Historical Context and Budget Fluctuations**:
   - Funding levels for special education have fluctuated over the years, with the current $32 million budget being the highest in recent history. Past budgets have been as low as $23 million, leading to significant proration when costs exceeded the allocated funds.

6. **Proposed Solutions and Future Steps**:
   - **Commission Proposal**: Representative Heath proposed forming a commission to study special education funding comprehensively, including differentiated aid and catastrophic aid. This commission would aim to develop a more equitable and sustainable funding model.
   - **Potential Solutions**: Suggestions included amending HB 577 to require the DOE to collect more detailed cost data, prorating payments to districts, and exploring weighted funding models based on disability categories, as some other states do.
   - **Federal Mandates**: The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates special education services, but federal funding covers less than half of the promised 40%, leaving states and districts to shoulder the remaining costs.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the complexity of special education funding and the need for a more comprehensive approach to address the financial challenges faced by school districts, particularly smaller ones. The committee plans to continue discussions, gather more data on the average costs of regular and special education, and explore various funding models to ensure districts are adequately supported while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
