The **Long Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee** meeting on **September 1, 2023**, began with a delay due to the absence of a committee member, prompting a brief recess. Once a quorum was achieved, the committee addressed **LRCP 23022**, a request from the **New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT)** to grant a **50-foot-wide access easement** across three DOT-owned parcels to **JCB LLC**. 

**Steve Labonte**, administrator of the DOT's Bureau of Right-of-Way, explained that the easement was necessary to resolve a long-standing issue stemming from the **Franklin Laconia Bypass project** in the 1970s, which severed access to JCB's property. Although the bypass was never built, an encroachment agreement allowed JCB's predecessor to use a gravel driveway over the corridor. The proposed easement would provide permanent access to a signalized intersection on **Route 3**, ensuring safe entry to the property. The DOT requested the committee waive the **$1,100 administrative fee** for the easement.

After no questions were raised, **Representative Mills** moved to approve the easement and waive the fee, which was seconded by **Representative Couillier**. The motion passed unanimously, and the meeting adjourned until **September 15, 2023**.
