The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Long Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee convened on September 1, 2023, to discuss a single agenda item: the disposal of highway turnpike-funded real estate (LRCP 23022). The meeting began with a delay due to the absence of a committee member, resulting in a brief recess. Once the quorum was achieved, Chair Mark McConkie opened the hearing.

Steve Labonte, the administrator of the Bureau of Right-of-Way with the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT), presented the item. The DOT requested authority to grant a 50-foot-wide access easement across three parcels of DOT-owned property to JCB LLC. This easement was necessary to address a long-standing issue stemming from the 1970s Franklin Laconia Bypass project, which severed access to JCB's property. Although the bypass was never built, JCB had been using a gravel driveway over the corridor under an encroachment agreement. The proposed easement would provide JCB with permanent access to a signalized intersection on Route 3, ensuring safety and resolving the issue.

The DOT sought approval to grant the easement at no cost and requested the committee to waive the $1,100 administrative fee. After a brief discussion, Representative Mills moved to approve the easement and waive the fee, which was seconded by Representative Couillier. The motion passed unanimously, and the committee adjourned, scheduling its next meeting for September 15, 2023.
