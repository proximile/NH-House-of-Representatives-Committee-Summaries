**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Bail Reform and Public Safety (September 15, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting focused on bail reform, criminal justice, and public safety, addressing critical issues such as data collection, judicial oversight, and the roles of various stakeholders in the bail system. The discussions spanned three segments, each highlighting key aspects of the ongoing efforts to refine the state’s bail processes.

### **1. Bail Data Collection and Systemic Reforms**
Members emphasized the importance of implementing a real-time bail tracking system to enhance transparency and informed decision-making. New York’s bail data collection model was referenced as a potential template, though its associated costs were noted. Federal funding for updating court systems was identified as a way to mitigate state expenses. Additionally, the need for improved data systems to correlate crime data with bail decisions was highlighted, with representatives pointing out the lack of a comprehensive IT system linking courts, police, probation, and parole as a significant barrier to effective decision-making.

### **2. Bail Commissioners and Judicial Oversight**
The role of bail commissioners and judicial oversight was a central topic. There was debate over whether bail bondsmen or commissioners should have the authority to set bail levels for varying crimes. The current system, which allows judges to review uncertain cases, was defended as a safeguard against blanket approaches to bail decisions. A bail commissioner underscored the subjective nature of bail decisions, focusing on flight risk and danger to society rather than past criminal history. He argued that current laws are sufficient if properly utilized, opposing the need for new legislation. The idea of requiring individuals to see a judge within 24 hours of arrest was proposed to address constitutional concerns, though concerns were raised about its impact on shift workers and caregivers.

### **3. Police and Prosecutorial Roles**
The discussion touched on the potential for overcharging by police and the role of prosecutors in adjusting charges. A prosecutor highlighted challenges in obtaining criminal histories and probation statuses during bail hearings, stressing the need for more time and resources to make informed decisions. The importance of recording police interrogations to prevent wrongful convictions was also emphasized. Additionally, there was debate on whether to amend current statutes to include statutory conditions with summons for misdemeanors, allowing for better enforcement of bail conditions.

### **4. Victim Perspectives and Public Safety**
Members highlighted the need for more victim statements to provide a balanced view in the decision-making process. Concerns were raised about individuals being rearrested while on bail, particularly in Manchester, though data showed overall crime rates in the city have decreased since bail reform was implemented. The Manchester Police Chief testified about the challenges of repeat offenders, noting that 1,500 out of 5,800 arrests involved individuals with active bail conditions. He emphasized the importance of connecting individuals with substance abuse and mental health services and suggested holding individuals until they see a judge, ideally within 24 hours, to address public safety concerns.

### **5. Legal and Constitutional Considerations**
A professor from UNH Law and Police Commissioner in Portsmouth provided a legal perspective, emphasizing that the bail system is designed to ensure court appearances and public safety, not to hold people accountable for crimes. He advocated for a more streamlined system that reduces pre-trial detention for non-violent offenses and focuses on felonies rather than misdemeanors. The discussion also touched on the cost and constitutional implications of holding individuals pre-trial, especially if charges are later dismissed or the individual is found not guilty. The ACLU advocated for individualized assessments, arguing that blanket holds for certain offenses could be unjust.

### **6. Next Steps and Future Focus**
The committee planned to continue discussions in subsequent meetings, focusing on crafting a working document and addressing the payment and roles of bail commissioners. Nonbinding votes were planned to gauge consensus on key issues. Representatives also discussed the need for better education among prosecutors and law enforcement about existing bail laws and tools to prevent unnecessary pre-trial detention.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of the bail system, balancing public safety with individual rights, and the need for data-driven decisions and resource allocation. The committee committed to gathering more input and refining proposals in future sessions, with a focus on improving coordination between police and the court system, enhancing data integration, and ensuring a fair and effective bail process.
