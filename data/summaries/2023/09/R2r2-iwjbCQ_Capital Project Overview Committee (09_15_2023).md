The New Hampshire House of Representatives Capital Project Overview Committee meeting on September 15, 2023, focused on several key topics:

1. **Committee Name Change**: The committee's name was officially changed from the "Capital Budget Committee" to the "Capital Project Overview Committee" via House Bill 384. This change was made to ensure oversight of capital projects occurring outside the traditional capital budget process.

2. **Approval of Minutes**: The minutes from the May 26, 2023, meeting were amended to include the chair's name at the top, and the motion to approve the amended minutes passed unanimously.

3. **Department of Transportation Report**: The Department of Transportation presented its annual status report on local, federal, and airport projects, highlighting the distribution of federal funds (CARES, CRRSA, and ARPA) to airports impacted by the pandemic. Most of these funds have already been expended.

4. **Environmental Services Presentation**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) provided an update on its IT modernization efforts, including the transition to cloud-based systems and the implementation of e-permitting using the Salesforce platform. The focus is on digitizing records, improving data security, and enhancing customer service, particularly for land resource management programs.

5. **Privacy and Data Security**: DES addressed concerns about data security as they transition to cloud-based systems, emphasizing compliance with federal and state standards (FedRAMP and StateRAMP) and conducting third-party audits to ensure data protection.

6. **Capital Project Reporting Guidelines**: The committee discussed and approved guidelines for the quarterly capital project report, which will now include:
   - Capital budget items approved through House Bill 25.
   - Capital projects with appropriations of $1 million or more.
   - Capital projects funded by the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).
   - Any additional projects requested by committee members.

7. **Future Agenda Items**: The committee agreed to invite the Fish and Game Department to its December 15, 2023, meeting to discuss the progress of their computer system upgrades, as there have been concerns about delays in the project.

8. **Next Meeting**: The next meeting is scheduled for December 15, 2023, at 9:00 AM.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which passed unanimously.
