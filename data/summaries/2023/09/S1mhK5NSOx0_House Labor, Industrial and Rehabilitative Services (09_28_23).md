The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee meeting on September 28, 2023, centered on the implementation of **OSHA 1910 standards** to replace the current Department of Labor safety standards for public sector employers. The discussions highlighted the complexities of this transition, balancing the need for comprehensive safety standards with practical considerations for implementation. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **Guidance and Commitment to Standards**
- Representatives emphasized the need for **guidance from the Department of Labor** on how to best implement OSHA standards. There was a suggestion to **commit to these standards** while allowing sufficient time for employers and the department to prepare, potentially delaying the repeal date of current standards.
- The committee discussed **revising the bill** to exclude certain reserved sections (V through Y) that currently have no content, to avoid implementing undefined standards. These sections are likely reserved for future OSHA standards.

### **Implementation Challenges and Timeline**
- Concerns were raised about the **complexity of adopting OSHA standards piecemeal** versus implementing them all at once. Piecemeal adoption could lead to confusion and inconsistency, while full implementation might require significant resources and time.
- There was significant discussion about the **effective date**, with consensus that **60 days is insufficient**. The committee considered a **phased implementation over several years** to allow adequate time for preparation and compliance.
- Suggestions included setting **adoption, effective, and enforcement dates** (e.g., adoption in 2025, effective in 2026, enforcement in 2027) to provide clarity and allow time for employers to prepare.
- The idea of **temporary grandfathering** was proposed to give employers a grace period to budget and plan for compliance without immediate enforcement.

### **Stakeholder Involvement and Advisory Oversight**
- The need for **further input from stakeholders** was emphasized to identify easy, medium, and difficult aspects of implementation. This would help prioritize which standards to adopt first and address potential challenges.
- The possibility of forming an **advisory committee** or a permanent subcommittee to oversee the implementation process was discussed. This committee would ensure that the new standards are rolled out effectively and provide ongoing updates.

### **Department of Labor’s Role and Resources**
- The Department of Labor expressed concerns about **staffing and resource limitations**, particularly for inspecting and enforcing new standards. Additional inspectors and support staff may be needed to manage the increased workload.
- The committee acknowledged the need for **additional training** for Department of Labor inspectors and stakeholders, which could incur significant costs. There was a suggestion to create a **grant program** to help municipalities and state departments cover these costs.

### **Specific Standards and Concerns**
- Certain OSHA standards, like those for **ladders or temporary labor camps**, were highlighted as potentially irrelevant to some public sector employers, raising questions about their necessity.
- There was interest in understanding how **OSHA and national firefighting standards integrate**, particularly regarding safety issues not currently covered, such as slippery stairs in fire stations. The committee aimed to consider these factors as they draft the bill.

### **Communication and Coordination**
- The importance of **ongoing communication** between the Department of Labor and the legislature was emphasized to address potential issues during implementation.
- The discussion underscored the importance of safety standards in reducing workplace injuries and fatalities, with some noting that **insurance companies could benefit** from improved safety measures.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee planned to **meet the following week** to iron out details and finalize amendments. Representatives were asked to suggest meeting times.
- The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene and address outstanding issues, ensuring the bill is comprehensive and considers all relevant stakeholders.

### **General Duties Clause**
- The committee recognized the continued importance of the **General Duties Clause**, which mandates that employers provide a safe working environment, even as they move towards adopting more robust OSHA standards.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, the committee aimed to balance the need for comprehensive safety standards with practical considerations for implementation, ensuring that the transition would be smooth and that all parties involved would have the necessary time and resources to comply. The discussions highlighted the importance of a **clear, phased approach**, adequate **staffing and resources**, and **stakeholder involvement** to ensure the successful adoption of OSHA 1910 standards in New Hampshire.
