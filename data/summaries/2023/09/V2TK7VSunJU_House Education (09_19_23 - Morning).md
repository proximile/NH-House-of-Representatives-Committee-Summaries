**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (09/19/23 - Morning)**

The New Hampshire House Education Committee convened on September 19, 2023, to discuss several bills aimed at addressing mental health education and policies in schools. The meeting focused on **HB 151**, **HB 352**, and **HB 505**, with debates centering on the scope, implementation, and necessity of these legislative proposals. Key themes included the importance of mental health education, concerns about overburdening educators, and the balance between state mandates and local control.

### **Key Discussions and Themes**

1. **Mental Health Education in Schools**  
   The committee extensively discussed **HB 151** and **HB 505**, both of which focus on integrating mental health education into school curricula.  
   - **Purpose and Scope**: HB 505 aims to ensure schools provide education on mental health, including protective factors, risk factors, and available resources, emphasizing **education** rather than treatment.  
   - **Concerns About "Comprehensive"**: Some representatives expressed reservations about the term "comprehensive," arguing it could imply an overly broad scope, potentially leading schools to be perceived as responsible for **treating** mental health issues rather than educating about them. Proposals were made to simplify the language to "mental health education" to avoid ambiguity.  
   - **Existing Frameworks**: Representatives noted that mental health education is already included in New Hampshire’s health education curriculum (e.g., RSA 189:10 and Ed 306 rules). However, there was debate over whether it should be explicitly stated in statute to ensure it remains a priority.  
   - **Role of Schools**: It was emphasized that schools should not be seen as the primary solution for mental health issues but rather as part of a broader community effort. Schools should focus on **educating** students while collaborating with external professionals for treatment.  
   - **Cultural and Ideological Concerns**: Some members raised concerns about the potential for mental health education to incorporate **ideological or cultural elements** (e.g., critical race theory, social justice) that could be divisive.  

2. **Excused Absences for Mental Health (HB 352)**  
   The committee debated **HB 352**, which proposes excused absences for students due to mental or behavioral health reasons.  
   - **Existing Policies**: Some members argued that current school policies already allow for mental health days with parental approval, questioning the necessity of codifying this into law. Concerns were raised that such legislation might incentivize excessive absences or create administrative burdens.  
   - **Stigma and Communication**: Supporters of the bill highlighted its potential to reduce stigma around mental health and improve communication between parents, students, and schools. They stressed the importance of ensuring students are not penalized for taking time off for mental health reasons, similar to physical illness.  
   - **Implementation Concerns**: Practical implications were discussed, including how schools would track and manage mental health absences and whether additional resources or interventions would be required. Questions were also raised about distinguishing between mental health and behavioral health and how these would be diagnosed or verified.  
   - **Local vs. State Control**: Some members expressed concerns about overstepping into local school district policies, suggesting that mental health absences might be better handled at the district level rather than through state legislation.  

3. **Teacher Trust and Burden**  
   Across all discussions, there was a recurring emphasis on the need to avoid overburdening educators.  
   - **Simplified Legislation**: Some representatives advocated for keeping legislation simple, trusting teachers to address mental health within existing frameworks rather than adding more mandates.  
   - **Staff Training**: There was agreement on the importance of **training educators and staff** to recognize and respond to mental health issues, with some suggesting this should be a focus in rulemaking rather than statute.  

4. **Stigma and Sensitivity**  
   Representatives stressed the importance of treating mental health with the same seriousness as physical health and avoiding stigmatization. One member objected to referring to mental health issues as a "malady du jour," emphasizing their seriousness.  

5. **Future Steps and Scheduling**  
   The committee agreed to revisit the bills in October, with members encouraged to propose specific tweaks or bullet points for consideration. Scheduling conflicts were noted, as the next meeting coincided with Columbus Day weekend and professional development days for many schools.  

### **Additional Topics**
- **Declining K-12 Enrollment**: There was a tangential discussion about declining enrollment in New Hampshire schools since the COVID-19 pandemic, with concerns raised about students who have disappeared from public, private, and homeschool settings. Some members suggested exploring amendments to address this issue.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to addressing mental health in schools while balancing the need for clarity, teacher support, and sensitivity to student needs. Discussions underscored the importance of **education** over treatment, collaboration with community resources, and avoiding overreach or ambiguity in legislative language. The committee plans to continue refining the bills in the coming months, with a focus on ensuring effective and practical solutions for New Hampshire’s schools.
