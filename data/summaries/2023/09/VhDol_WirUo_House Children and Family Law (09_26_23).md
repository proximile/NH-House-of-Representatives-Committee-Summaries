**Summary of the New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Committee Meeting (09/26/23)**

The New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Committee convened to discuss two significant bills, **House Bill 535** and **House Bill 618**, both addressing critical issues in child welfare and family law. The meeting highlighted divergent views, urgent concerns, and the need for careful consideration to balance policy, legal, and fiscal implications.

### **House Bill 535: Legal Representation for Children in Abuse and Neglect Cases**
The primary focus of the meeting was **HB 535**, which seeks to provide legal representation for children involved in abuse and neglect proceedings, as they are currently the only parties without guaranteed counsel. Key points from the discussion included:

1. **Bill Overview**: The bill aims to protect children’s legal and constitutional rights by ensuring they have access to legal counsel, particularly in cases involving placement in residential facilities or out-of-state group homes. Many states already guarantee this right, and stakeholders emphasized its importance for safeguarding vulnerable children.

2. **Divergent Views**: There was significant disagreement on the bill’s scope. Advocacy groups like the **Children’s Law Center** and **Disability Rights Center** supported a robust amendment ensuring a **right to counsel** for children at risk of placement. In contrast, **Casa of New Hampshire** advocated for a more limited, **fully discretionary** approach, where judges could appoint counsel without a guaranteed right. Casa expressed concerns that mandatory representation could strain resources and delay permanency for children.

3. **Study Committee Proposal**: Some committee members, including **Representative Greg**, suggested forming a **study committee** to further examine the issue, arguing that the bill was not yet ready for prime time and required more comprehensive review. Others, like **Representative Long**, pushed for immediate action, proposing smaller amendments to address the issue without delay.

4. **Urgency**: Advocates stressed the urgency of addressing the issue, highlighting the risks children face without legal representation, particularly in cases involving placement in facilities like Bledsoe. They argued that delaying action would leave vulnerable children unprotected.

5. **Potential Amendments**: Discussions included potential amendments, such as ensuring children are **notified of their right to counsel**, allowing attorneys access to records, and streamlining processes for funding legal services. However, there was no consensus on the specifics. Casa suggested amending the current statute (RSA 169-C:10) to allow any party in a case to request an attorney for a child at any point during proceedings, rather than mandating representation in all cases.

6. **Next Steps**: The subcommittee agreed to meet again on **October 18th** to review written recommendations from stakeholders, including legal and advocacy groups. The goal is to determine whether to amend the bill or recommend it be **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**.

### **House Bill 618: Wage Garnishment for Child Support**
The committee also discussed **HB 618**, which proposes changes to wage garnishment rules for child support payments. Key points included:

1. **Bill Overview**: The bill seeks to extend the time frame from one month to two months before wage garnishment begins for child support payments. However, concerns were raised about potential conflicts with federal law, particularly the **Title IV-D Security Act of 1975**, which could result in the loss of significant federal funding (approximately $13.6 million) and other incentives.

2. **Amendments**: To avoid federal compliance issues, the committee decided to remove **Section 2** of the bill, which changes the time frame to two months. Other provisions, such as creating a standard form to inform parents about their rights regarding wage garnishment, were retained. The committee also adjusted language to clarify that child support cases may not always involve divorce.

3. **Outcome**: The committee voted to recommend the bill with these amendments, ensuring compliance with federal law while improving clarity and transparency for parents.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**
Throughout the meeting, several key themes emerged:

1. **Policy vs. Fiscal Concerns**: The committee emphasized focusing on policy rather than fiscal implications, though cost concerns were noted, particularly for **HB 535**.

2. **Trauma-Informed Care**: Representatives highlighted the importance of prioritizing resources for therapy and other support services over mandatory legal representation in all cases, emphasizing the need for trauma-informed care.

3. **Language Debate**: There was significant debate over the use of "shall" versus "may" in **HB 535**, with concerns that mandatory representation could complicate cases and delay permanency for children.

### **Outcome and Next Steps**
- For **HB 618**, the committee recommended passing the bill with amendments to avoid federal conflicts and improve clarity.
- For **HB 535**, the committee leaned toward recommending further study or significant amendments to address concerns raised by stakeholders.

The meeting concluded with plans to finalize recommendations and amendments for executive session, underscoring the complexity of the issues and the need for collaboration among stakeholders to find common ground while balancing the urgency of protecting children’s rights.
