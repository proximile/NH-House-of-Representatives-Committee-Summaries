**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study Proposing Legislation for State-Controlled Sale of Cannabis (09/18/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting on September 18, 2023, to discuss and propose legislation for state-controlled sales of cannabis and cannabis products. The Commission to Study this issue addressed a wide range of topics, including supply and demand management, retail and cultivation licensing, child safety, revenue potential, and federal legal conflicts. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed across the three segments:

### **1. Legislative Framework and Model**
- **Franchise Model**: The commission proposed a franchise model for cannabis retail, akin to the state’s liquor store system. The New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC) would act as the franchisor, overseeing licensing, enforcement, and marketing, while retailers would operate as franchisees. This ensures a consistent look, feel, and operational standard across all stores.
- **Operational Structure**: Cannabis operations would be separate from liquor operations to avoid federal legal conflicts, with distinct divisions for finance, marketing, and enforcement.
- **Review of HB 1598**: The commission revisited HB 1598, a previously failed bill proposing a state-run retail model, as a starting point for drafting new legislation. There was debate about merging it with the franchise model to address concerns about state-run stores.

### **2. Licensing and Regulation**
- **Cultivation and Retail Licensing**: Cultivators and manufacturers could apply for retail licenses, but approval would be subject to state discretion. The commission discussed capping cultivation licenses based on projected demand to avoid overproduction or shortages.
- **Licensing Fees**: Retail licenses would cost $25,000 in the first year, decreasing to $2,500 annually over five years. Cultivators and manufacturers could self-distribute but would need separate retail licenses to sell directly to consumers.
- **Third-Party Testing**: All cannabis products must be grown and manufactured in New Hampshire, with third-party testing to ensure safety and compliance with labeling requirements.

### **3. Supply and Demand Management**
- **Balancing Supply and Demand**: The commission emphasized the need to balance supply and demand, citing issues in states like Oklahoma and Vermont. They considered the number of cultivation licenses required to meet demand, referencing Maine’s 48 cultivators as a benchmark.
- **Retail Locations**: The state would limit cannabis retail locations to 65, mirroring the number of liquor stores.

### **4. Public Safety and Child Protection**
- **Packaging and Labeling**: Strict regulations would require tamper-proof seals, clear THC labeling, child-proof packaging, and warning labels to prevent accidental ingestion by minors.
- **Child Safety Concerns**: The commission highlighted the rise in cannabis-related poisonings among minors, particularly from edibles like gummies and brownies. Proposals included stricter packaging and potential restrictions on certain products.
- **Public Safety Information**: Retail locations would prominently display information on the risks of cannabis use.

### **5. Revenue and Market Impact**
- **Revenue Potential**: The commission emphasized the potential for significant state revenue, citing Massachusetts’ $1.75 billion in cannabis sales in 2022. The NHLC would receive 15% of gross monthly sales from each franchisee, with municipalities receiving 1% of that revenue.
- **Capturing Out-of-State Sales**: The model aims to capture revenue currently going to neighboring states with legalized cannabis markets.

### **6. Municipal Involvement**
- **Opt-In Votes**: Municipalities would have the option to allow cannabis retailers through local votes and would receive 1% of state revenue from cannabis sales in their jurisdiction.
- **Zoning Control**: Municipalities would retain zoning control over cannabis store locations.

### **7. Federal Legal Concerns**
- **Federal Law Conflict**: The commission acknowledged that state-controlled cannabis sales conflict with federal law but noted that other states have proceeded similarly. The proposed model aims to separate cannabis operations from liquor operations to mitigate federal legal risks.
- **Potential Reclassification**: There was discussion of the Biden Administration’s potential move to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, which could impact state-level legislation.

### **8. Future Considerations**
- **Online Ordering and Delivery**: The possibility of online ordering and licensed delivery (via UPS, FedEx, or W-2 employees) was discussed for consumer convenience.
- **Future Adjustments**: The model allows for potential future changes, such as importing cannabis from other states if federal regulations evolve.

### **Next Steps**
The commission planned to:
- Schedule further meetings to refine the proposed model.
- Invite regulators from other states and subject matter experts to provide input.
- Address specific issues such as medical cannabis integration, transportation, and legal liability.

### **Conclusion**
The proposed model aims to create a safe, profitable, and regulated cannabis market in New Hampshire. It balances economic opportunities with public health and safety concerns, while navigating the complexities of state and federal laws. The commission emphasized stakeholder engagement and iterative refinement to ensure the legislation’s viability and alignment with best practices.
