### **Key Legislative Items and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 601 (Medicaid Direct Certification for Free and Reduced-Price School Meals)**  
   - HB 601 aims to implement Medicaid direct certification for students eligible for free and reduced-price school meals. The bill was sent to the Senate and assigned to a study committee, which is examining its impact on state aid. A report is due by November 1, and the House is awaiting these findings before taking further action.  
   - Representatives expressed concerns about the financial and logistical implications, particularly regarding Medicaid and differentiated aid for students in the free and reduced lunch (FNR) program. Some suggested introducing a separate pilot program to gather more data.  
   - Brody Deschaine from New Hampshire Hunger Solutions advocated for the bill, emphasizing its potential to feed more students and improve the accuracy of school funding. The Senate had previously removed the provision from the budget due to cost concerns.  
   - The committee moved to pass the bill but discussed possible amendments to address fiscal concerns.  

2. **House Bill 620 (Pre-Kindergarten Pilot Program)**  
   - HB 620 proposes a pre-kindergarten pilot program. The bill has been retained, and there is currently no fiscal note. The Department of Education has initiated a similar effort, but the committee seeks more information before proceeding.  

3. **House Bill 638 (Extraordinary Needs Grant)**  
   - This bill, related to school grants, was addressed in the budget and requires no further action.  

4. **House Bill 468 (Recodification of Education Laws)**  
   - HB 601 proposes a $100,000 appropriation for the Department of Education to hire an attorney to recodify education laws. Diana Fenton from the Department of Education supported the bill, citing the need to address duplicative and contradictory laws.  
   - The committee discussed the appropriation, potential project duration, and the possibility of extending the deadline to September 30, 2025.  

5. **School Building Aid Bills (HB 541, HB 546)**  
   - These bills proposed increasing the statutory cap for school building aid from $50 million to $70 million. Concerns were raised about mismanagement and the need for additional funding to address deteriorating school buildings.  
   - The motion to increase the cap failed, and the bills were recommended for interim study (ITL).

### **Concerns and Unknowns**  
- Representatives expressed uncertainty about the financial and logistical implications of several bills, particularly HB 601 and HB 620.  
- There is a reluctance to amend or advance bills without clearer data, leading to discussions about pilot programs and further study.

### **Next Steps and Timeline**  
- The Finance Division has until November 17 to finalize retained bills, including HB 601 and HB 620.  
- A future work session is planned between November 1 and 17 to review the study committee’s findings and gather more information on pending bills.
