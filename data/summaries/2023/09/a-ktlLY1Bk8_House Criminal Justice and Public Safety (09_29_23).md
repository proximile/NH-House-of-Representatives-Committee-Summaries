**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (09/29/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on September 29, 2023, focused on critical issues within the state’s criminal justice and public safety systems, particularly addressing the high utilization of jail services by individuals with substance use disorders, bail reform, and the integration of healthcare and corrections programs. The discussions underscored the need for systemic reforms to improve outcomes, reduce recidivism, and enhance public safety.

### **High Utilizers of Jail Services and Substance Use Disorders**
A significant portion of the meeting centered on the disproportionate impact of a small segment of the jail population (9%) that accounts for 34% of jail entrances and 29% of costs. These individuals often have complex behavioral health issues, with 84% diagnosed with substance use disorders, primarily opioid-related. The **Justice Reinvestment Act**, initiated in 2022, aims to address the root causes of this issue by studying high jail utilization and developing strategies to reduce recidivism. Key challenges include gaps in re-entry and community services, long wait times for treatment, and inconsistent implementation of court-ordered treatment programs.

**Proposed solutions** include:
- Implementing **mandatory, court-ordered medically assisted treatment programs** during incarceration.
- Expanding **pre-trial services** across all counties to provide consistent support and treatment options.
- Utilizing **opioid abatement funds** from settlements to enhance treatment programs in county jails.

Testimonies from law enforcement, judges, and pre-trial service providers emphasized the need for a coordinated approach, leveraging existing statutes and resources to address the underlying causes of criminal behavior.

### **Bail System Reforms**
The meeting also highlighted systemic issues within the state’s bail process. Key concerns include:
- **Inconsistent Bail Decisions**: Bail commissioners, who often have minimal training, exercise significant discretion, leading to inconsistent outcomes.
- **Failure to Appear**: A high rate of individuals released on personal recognizance (PR) bail fail to appear in court, creating additional burdens on law enforcement and the courts.
- **Lack of Data**: Insufficient data on failures to appear and crimes committed while on bail hampers informed decision-making.
- **Technological Challenges**: The reliance on paper-based processes and lack of integration between electronic court systems cause inefficiencies and delays.

**Proposed reforms** include:
- Limiting the authority of bail commissioners in certain cases and requiring judicial review for repeat offenders.
- Enhancing **pre-trial services**, such as monitoring, drug testing, and electronic tracking, to ensure compliance with court orders.
- Implementing a more integrated electronic filing system to improve access to information and reduce delays.
- Exploring the use of transportation assistance and electronic reminders (e.g., text messages) to reduce no-shows.

The discussion also addressed the societal tolerance for criminal behavior and the need for clearer guidelines on when individuals should be detained pending trial. Some participants advocated for a system that focuses on risk assessment rather than financial status, arguing against cash bail as an unfair determinant of release.

### **Healthcare and Corrections Programs**
The meeting briefly touched on healthcare and corrections programs, including:
- **Medicare and Hospitals**: The committee noted a need for further investigation into hospitals building Medicare, though details were unclear.
- **Corrections Programs**: The new superintendent at Valley Street House Corrections is introducing programs similar to those he initiated in his previous role in Maram County. The committee plans to invite both current and former superintendents to share insights on these programs, particularly in relation to bail and release processes.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting emphasized the need for a holistic, coordinated approach to criminal justice reform, focusing on:
1. Addressing the root causes of high jail utilization, particularly substance use disorders, through treatment programs and re-entry services.
2. Reforming the bail system to reduce inconsistencies, improve efficiency, and enhance public safety.
3. Leveraging opioid abatement funds and expanding pre-trial services to provide consistent support for individuals with behavioral health issues.
4. Enhancing data collection and technological integration to inform policy decisions and improve court processes.

Overall, the discussions highlighted the importance of collaboration between the legislature, judiciary, law enforcement, and healthcare providers to create a more effective and equitable criminal justice system in New Hampshire.
