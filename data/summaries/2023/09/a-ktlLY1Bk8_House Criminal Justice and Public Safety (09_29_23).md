**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (09/29/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on September 29, 2023, to discuss critical issues related to the state's bail system, criminal justice processes, and the intersection of substance use disorders (SUDs) with reoffending. The meeting highlighted systemic inefficiencies, public safety concerns, and the need for comprehensive reforms. Key themes and discussions are summarized below:

---

### **Bail System and Criminal Justice Processes**
1. **Bail System Challenges**:
   - The current bail statute is functional but requires adjustments, particularly in handling individuals with multiple failures to appear or serious offenses. There’s a proposal to limit bail commissioners’ authority for certain cases, ensuring they are reviewed by a judicial officer.
   - Bail commissioners have significant discretion but minimal training, leading to inconsistent decisions. Improved training and standardized criteria are needed to ensure fairness and public safety.
   - Non-appearance for court dates is a significant issue, often due to resource limitations (e.g., lack of transportation) or intentional avoidance. Providing transportation and electronic reminders (e.g., text alerts) could reduce no-shows, especially for vulnerable populations like those experiencing homelessness.

2. **Technology Gaps**:
   - The court system’s reliance on paper-based processes, particularly in Circuit Courts, is outdated and inefficient. While Superior and Supreme Courts have electronic filing systems, inconsistencies and lack of integration create delays and information gaps.

3. **Public Safety and Repeat Offenders**:
   - A major concern is individuals who commit new crimes or fail to appear while on bail. Society’s tolerance for repeat offenses and non-appearances must be addressed, with clearer guidelines on when detention should be presumed.
   - Cash bail was criticized for tying liberty to financial resources. Instead, a risk-based system was advocated, where low-risk individuals are released on personal recognizance (PR bail), while detention is reserved for those who pose a danger or repeatedly violate bail conditions.

4. **Proposals for Reform**:
   - Suggestions included giving prosecutors the ability to appeal bail decisions more quickly, especially in cases involving violent or dangerous crimes, and requiring judges to hold bail reviews on weekends to prevent unnecessary detentions.
   - Improved data collection on bail decisions, including tracking crimes committed while on bail and prior failures to appear, was recommended to inform policy adjustments.

### **Substance Use Disorders and Reoffending**
1. **Cycle of Reoffending**:
   - Many individuals with SUDs repeatedly fail to access treatment and recovery systems, leading to reoffending. Medically assisted incarcerated treatment programs, potentially funded through opioid abatement funds, were proposed to interrupt this cycle.
   - There is a significant gap between multiple offenses and eventual sentencing to drug court, with many individuals falling through the cracks. More effective pre-trial interventions are needed.

2. **Proposed Solutions**:
   - Diversionary programs for frequent offenders with SUDs, court-ordered and mandated treatment, and leveraging the criminal justice system to ensure treatment access were suggested.
   - Judges and bail commissioners should have more authority to mandate treatment for individuals with SUDs, even pre-conviction. The current bail statute already provides mechanisms for addressing repeated failures to appear and bail violations, but these are inconsistently implemented.

3. **Role of Pre-Trial Services**:
   - Expanding pre-trial services in every county is crucial for identifying and addressing substance abuse and mental health issues early in the legal process. This would allow professionals to diagnose and recommend treatment, rather than relying on judges to make these determinations.
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) currently lacks internal processes to handle court referrals for substance abuse treatment, despite existing statutes allowing for such referrals. Addressing this gap is essential for systemic effectiveness.

### **Systemic Issues and Broader Reforms**
1. **Coordination and Integration**:
   - The discussion emphasized the need for better coordination between courts, law enforcement, and human services to address inefficiencies and ensure public safety. An integrated approach to criminal justice reform is critical.
   - The Marram County Navigator Program was highlighted as a successful initiative that helps individuals access services like housing, food assistance, and substance abuse treatment.

2. **Call for a Criminal Justice Summit**:
   - There was a proposal for a statewide summit to address systemic inefficiencies, improve consistency across the criminal justice system, and develop comprehensive reforms.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for modernization, policy adjustments, and systemic reforms to improve New Hampshire’s bail system and criminal justice processes. Key priorities include addressing repeat offenders, integrating technology, expanding pre-trial services, and implementing treatment-focused interventions for individuals with SUDs. The committee expressed a commitment to balancing public safety with fairness and accountability, with a focus on addressing underlying issues like substance abuse and resource disparities. A statewide summit and ongoing legislative action were proposed to drive these reforms forward.
