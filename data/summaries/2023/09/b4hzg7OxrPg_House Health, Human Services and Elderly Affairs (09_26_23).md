The New Hampshire House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs subcommittee met on September 26, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 587**, which aims to create a donor registry for anatomic gifts, allowing New Hampshire residents to designate their organs for preferred recipients within the state. The bill was introduced recently, but federal changes to organ procurement and distribution policies, particularly the **Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transportation Network Act**, have complicated its potential implementation. The federal government is moving toward a more competitive, patient-centric system, breaking up the monopoly of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and increasing funding for organ procurement.

The subcommittee considered three options for the bill:  
1. **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**: Recommending the bill not move forward.  
2. **Ought to Pass (OTP)**: Recommending the bill proceed for full House debate.  
3. **Interim Study**: Delaying the bill for further discussion and stakeholder input, potentially revisiting it in 2025.  

Key concerns raised during the meeting included:  
- **Federal Preemption**: The federal government’s authority over organ procurement and distribution may render state-level legislation ineffective.  
- **Potential Negative Impact**: Restricting organ allocation to New Hampshire residents could harm patients who rely on out-of-state transplants, particularly since many New Hampshire patients receive transplants in Massachusetts.  
- **Legal Uncertainty**: The subcommittee questioned the legality of the bill in light of recent federal changes.  

John Fitzpatrick, Chief Public Affairs Officer at **New England Donor Services**, testified that the current federal system prioritizes patient needs based on factors like wait time, severity of illness, and proximity to the donor, which he argued is more effective than state-based allocation. He emphasized that the new federal law aims to improve the system by increasing funding and breaking up UNOS’s responsibilities into multiple contracts.  

The subcommittee decided to **postpone making a recommendation** until they could consult with the House legal counsel to clarify the implications of federal preemption. They plan to reconvene before the full committee meeting in late October or early November to finalize their recommendation.  

The meeting ended with a motion to adjourn, pending further legal analysis and discussion.
