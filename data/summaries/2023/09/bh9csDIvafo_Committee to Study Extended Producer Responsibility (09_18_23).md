**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee to Study Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Meeting (09/18/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee to Study Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) convened on September 18, 2023, to explore strategies for reducing municipal costs associated with solid waste disposal and improving recycling systems. The meeting focused on implementing EPR for packaging and printed paper, with discussions emphasizing the need for a complementary bottle bill system, a clear regulatory framework, and a data-driven approach tailored to New Hampshire’s waste management challenges.

### Key Discussion Points:

#### **1. Complementary Bottle Bill System**
The committee highlighted the benefits of separating beverage container recycling from general packaging through a bottle bill system, citing three main reasons:
   - **Litter Reduction**: Refundable deposits incentivize consumers to return beverage containers, reducing litter.
   - **Recycling Efficiency**: Beverage containers are highly recyclable when kept clean, ensuring high-quality recycled materials.
   - **Reuse and Refill Value**: Programs like Oregon’s demonstrate the potential for shifting from single-use to reusable and refillable containers.

#### **2. EPR Regulatory Framework**
The proposed EPR program emphasizes a tiered approach targeting large producers responsible for packaging design, with exemptions for small businesses. Key components include:
   - **State and Producer Responsibilities**: The state sets performance standards, while a producer responsibility organization (PRO) manages compliance and fee collection.
   - **Fee Structure**: Fees should cover program costs, including waste management, administration, and investments in recycling improvements. Eco-modulation can incentivize environmentally friendly packaging by adjusting fees based on recyclability and toxic content.
   - **Packaging Reduction and Recycling Grants**: Funds should support system improvements, such as transitioning to reusable packaging and enhancing recycling infrastructure.
   - **Consumer Education**: Producers should play a key role in educating consumers about proper recycling practices.

#### **3. Current Recycling Challenges**
Recycling rates in the U.S. are stagnating around 30%, with valuable materials often ending up in landfills or the environment. Municipalities bear the burden of inefficient systems, necessitating systemic change through EPR.

#### **4. EPR Principles**
Effective EPR programs should focus on:
   - Strong environmental outcomes (e.g., reducing waste in nature).
   - Consumer convenience (e.g., making recycling as easy as disposal).
   - Financial efficiency (e.g., keeping recycling funds within the system).
   - Access to recycled materials for producers to create a circular economy.

#### **5. Global and U.S. Examples**
EPR has been successfully implemented in countries like Canada and Europe, as well as in U.S. states such as Maine, Oregon, Colorado, and California. These programs vary in design, with some achieving better environmental outcomes than others.

#### **6. Industry and Environmental Perspectives**
   - **Industry Perspective**: Megan Dom from the American Beverage Association emphasized the importance of producer involvement in funding and operating recycling systems while ensuring access to recycled materials.
   - **Environmental Advocacy**: Christine Barber and Ann Podlipny from the New Hampshire Network Plastics Working Group stressed the need to include single-use plastics in EPR legislation, citing the low U.S. plastic recycling rate (around 5%) and the hazards of plastic pollution.

#### **7. Economic and Environmental Benefits**
EPR can reduce municipal costs, increase recycling rates, create jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Studies show that well-designed EPR programs can recover millions in lost material value and significantly boost recycling participation.

#### **8. Model Legislation**
Organizations like Just Zero and Beyond Plastics have developed model EPR bills that include strong oversight, accountability, and performance standards to ensure effective implementation.

#### **9. Challenges and Considerations**
Key challenges include avoiding loopholes, ensuring transparency in funding, and addressing concerns from industries like waste haulers. Comprehensive EPR programs should cover all packaging materials (primary, secondary, and tertiary) with minimal exemptions.

#### **10. Public Support**
Polls show bipartisan support for EPR, with a majority of voters favoring shifting the cost of plastic waste management from taxpayers to producers.

### Conclusion
The meeting concluded with a call for New Hampshire to adopt a strong EPR law, leveraging existing models and addressing the state’s specific needs to reduce waste, protect the environment, and save taxpayer money. The committee plans to review the presented materials and consult absent members before scheduling the next session.
