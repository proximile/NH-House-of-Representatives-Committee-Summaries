**Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (09/26/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on September 26, 2023, to discuss several key education-related bills and initiatives. The meeting focused on three main areas: **mentoring programs for early educators**, **legislation addressing teacher shortages and child safety**, and **background checks for school employees**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

---

### **1. Mentoring Programs for Early Educators**
The committee explored a proposed mentoring program aimed at supporting new educators, particularly those working with newborn to grade 3 or preschool-aged children. Key discussions included:

- **Funding Confusion**: There was uncertainty about whether Title II federal funds could be used for mentoring programs, with concerns raised about unspent Title II funds and the need to prioritize state funds first. Questions were raised about whether districts might misallocate Title II funds, leaving mentoring programs underfunded.
- **Program Definition**: The mentoring program is designed to help new teachers acclimate to their specific school districts, focusing on orientation and district-specific practices. It was clarified that this program is distinct from broader professional development initiatives, which address curriculum and skill-building for entire staff.
- **Accountability**: Representatives called for an accounting of how Title II funds have been used and whether unspent funds could be redirected to support mentoring programs. They emphasized the need for clarity on the program’s purpose and funding mechanisms.
- **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to gather more data, refine definitions, and revisit the topic in October to finalize decisions on the mentoring program and funding allocations.

### **2. Legislation Addressing Teacher Shortages and Child Safety**
The committee reviewed several bills aimed at addressing teacher shortages and ensuring child safety in educational settings:

- **House Bill 628**: This bill requires non-public schools or education service providers accepting public funds to perform background checks on employees and volunteers. Prime sponsor Representative Tanner clarified that the bill does not apply to homeschooling parents but emphasizes the state’s interest in child safety. Concerns were raised about the bill’s scope, including its potential impact on volunteers and co-ops. The subcommittee scheduled a follow-up meeting for further discussion.
- **House Bill 623**: This bill establishes a teacher candidate loan forgiveness program to address teacher shortages, particularly in rural and underperforming schools. The proposed amendment outlines a reimbursement structure of up to $12,000 over five years for eligible educators. The committee discussed clarifying eligibility criteria, such as including teachers in underperforming schools regardless of location, and addressing administrative burdens on districts. The subcommittee agreed to revisit the bill after further input from the teacher shortage committee.
- **Senate Bill 218**: This bill establishes an early educator professional development grant program to support mentoring for new educators. The committee discussed the definition of “early educator” and whether the program should include educators transitioning to new roles or districts. Additional information was requested from the Department of Education to refine the bill’s language.

### **3. Background Checks for School Employees**
The committee focused on **House Bill 267**, which would allow school districts to require periodic background checks for employees, particularly those who have not had one in a long time. Key points included:

- **Intent of the Bill**: The bill was initiated by the Goffstown superintendent to enable school districts to negotiate more frequent background checks during union contract negotiations.
- **Concerns**: The bill’s language was criticized for being too vague, with concerns about inconsistent application, potential targeting of specific employees, and the financial burden on districts or employees. Some members questioned the necessity of the bill, noting that most educators have already undergone background checks.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included specifying time frames (e.g., every 3, 5, or 10 years) and ensuring that background checks are negotiated through collective bargaining rather than imposed unilaterally by school boards.
- **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to hold a second subcommittee meeting to address concerns and potentially draft amended language to avoid a deadlock.

### **Overall Themes and Next Steps**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on **supporting early-career educators**, **addressing teacher shortages**, and **ensuring child safety**. Key takeaways include:

- The need for clarity on funding mechanisms, particularly the use of Title II federal funds for mentoring programs.
- The importance of refining legislative language to avoid ambiguity and unintended consequences, particularly in bills addressing background checks and loan forgiveness programs.
- Plans for further discussions and amendments, with subcommittee meetings scheduled to address unresolved issues and gather additional data.

The committee emphasized collaboration with the Department of Education and other stakeholders to ensure that proposed initiatives are effective, equitable, and aligned with the state’s educational goals.
