The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on September 12, 2023, for a comprehensive meeting addressing a range of legislative, regulatory, and administrative matters. The meeting was divided into three main segments, focusing on subcommittee updates, retained bills, and key legislative discussions. Below is a cohesive summary of the proceedings:

### **Subcommittee Updates and Administrative Matters**
The meeting began with updates on various subcommittees and administrative tasks:
- **Subcommittee Formation**: The committee awaited guidance from House leadership on forming a subcommittee, with three names needed for participation.
- **EPR Study Committee**: Representatives Davis and Brouillard were identified as members of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) study committee, alongside Representative Partial and Senator Alsoehler.
- **Department of Agriculture Report**: Members were encouraged to review a report from the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food, which examined dedicated funds' reporting requirements.
- **Big E Event**: House members were informed of an opportunity to receive two free tickets to the Big E fair in Springfield, Massachusetts.
- **Non-Amittable Species Study Committee**: The status of this committee was discussed, with Representative Bixby mentioned as a member. The speaker planned to follow up with the speaker’s office for confirmation.
- **Out-of-State Trash Study Committee**: Representative Germano shared updates on this committee, which was set to meet with the Attorney General’s office to discuss the interstate commerce clause and a municipally owned landfill in Mount Carvery. Germano expressed cautious optimism about potential legislation by November.
- **Solid Waste Working Group**: The importance of information sharing from the EPR study committee and other groups was highlighted to inform the Solid Waste Working Group’s monthly meetings.
- **Closing Remarks**: The meeting concluded with appreciation for the committee’s lively discussions. The next meeting was scheduled for October 24th, with Democrats asked to stay for further discussion.

### **Retained Bills**
The committee deliberated on several retained bills, focusing on the following key topics:
1. **HB 37: Companion Animal Groomers**  
   The committee debated whether to establish a study committee to explore best practices for companion animal groomers. While some members argued for safety standards and certification, others felt the industry was already over-regulated and capable of self-regulation. The committee leaned toward not advancing the bill, citing redundancy.

2. **HB 122: Micro Enterprise Home Kitchen Operations**  
   The committee considered amendments to this bill, which addresses home-based food operations. Representative Comtois proposed adjusting gross sales limits and labeling requirements. The discussion emphasized balancing regulation with support for small-scale food producers. The committee agreed to revisit the bill with proposed amendments.

3. **HB 326: Second Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides**  
   The committee reviewed a preliminary report from the Pesticide Control Board on the use of SGARs and their impact on wildlife. While acknowledging anecdotal evidence of harm to predator populations, members noted the lack of definitive data. Representative Bixby suggested drafting an amendment to make SGARs restricted-use pesticides in New Hampshire, contingent on EPA action. The committee agreed to revisit the issue with proposed amendments in late October.

### **Key Legislative Discussions**
The final segment focused on several legislative proposals and administrative reviews:
1. **Pesticide Control Board**: Members emphasized the importance of relying on the Pesticide Control Board’s expertise, warning against bypassing it through legislation.
2. **HB 369 – Energy Relief on Farms**: Representative Bixby proposed creating a field specialist within Cooperative Extension to assist farms with energy efficiency and grant applications, particularly for USDA’s REAP program. While some members questioned the need for a new position, others highlighted the challenges small farmers face in accessing federal funds.
3. **HB 493 – Eliminating State Meat Inspection Program**: Representative Bixby stated the bill should not move forward, ending the discussion.
4. **HB 602 – Landfill Siting**: Representatives Potenza and Bixby proposed an amendment to focus on transparency, public input, and protection in landfill siting processes. The amendment introduced a two-phase permitting process, though concerns were raised about the need for a public hearing.
5. **Organic Certification**: Representative Bixby introduced a bill to fund a position in the Department of Agriculture for organic certification, emphasizing its importance to New Hampshire’s organic farmers.
6. **Administrative Rules Review**: The committee discussed a broader effort to review administrative rules for agencies under its purview, ensuring alignment with statutes and preventing overreach.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with scheduling follow-up work sessions and an executive session for October 17th and 24th to discuss amendments and finalize decisions on the bills. Throughout the meeting, members emphasized the importance of balancing regulation with practical considerations, collaboration, and information sharing.
