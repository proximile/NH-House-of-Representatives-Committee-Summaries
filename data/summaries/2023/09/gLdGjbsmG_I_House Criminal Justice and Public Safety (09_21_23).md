**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (09/21/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on September 21, 2023, to address critical issues related to the stateâ€™s bail system, with a particular focus on domestic violence cases, the role of bail commissioners, and the broader challenges of bail reform. The discussions highlighted systemic inefficiencies, constitutional considerations, and the need for technological and procedural improvements to enhance public safety and ensure due process.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

#### **1. Bail System and Domestic Violence**
The committee delved into the complexities of handling domestic violence cases within the bail system. There was debate over whether detaining individuals for 24 hours or longer after a domestic violence arrest effectively protects victims or prevents further violence. Concerns were raised that the bail system alone cannot adequately address the underlying issues of domestic violence. The committee emphasized the seriousness of domestic violence and stalking, noting that these crimes often involve repeat offenders and pose significant risks to victims. Challenges in enforcing bail conditions, particularly when victims are reluctant to cooperate, were also discussed.

#### **2. Role and Challenges of Bail Commissioners**
Bail commissioners, who are volunteers, play a crucial role in setting bail conditions, including no-contact orders, to protect victims. However, they face significant challenges, including inconsistent access to criminal histories and restraining orders, especially in smaller police departments. Commissioners often work around the clock and must provide their own equipment, such as iPads and printers. They also expressed frustration with the lack of communication from the courts and the difficulty in deciphering handwritten court documents. The committee acknowledged that the issues are systemic and not solely the fault of bail commissioners.

#### **3. Bail Reform and Decision-Making**
The 2018 bail reform introduced changes that have complicated the bail process. Commissioners noted that the reforms have led to confusion and a lack of discretion in setting bail, particularly in cases involving intoxication or domestic violence. The committee discussed a proposed list of crimes that should not be bailable by a bail commissioner, including homicide, first-degree assault, and second-degree assault. They debated whether these should require a judge's decision rather than a bail commissioner's. There was also discussion about replacing bail commissioners with magistrates, but concerns were raised about whether 15 magistrates could handle the workload currently managed by approximately 100 commissioners.

#### **4. Technology and Information Sharing**
The discussion highlighted the lack of modern technology in the bail process, with bail commissioners often relying on outdated methods like fax machines. There was a call for improved electronic systems to expedite the sharing of bail orders and criminal histories. The committee also discussed the need for better communication and technology across law enforcement agencies to track warrants and criminal records, particularly in rural areas where resources are limited.

#### **5. Training and Resources**
The committee considered the need for mandatory training for bail commissioners and judges, particularly in handling domestic violence cases. Commissioners shared their experiences and the difficulties they face in accessing probation and parole officers, especially during off-hours. There was a lack of consistent training for bail commissioners, leading to variability in how they perform their duties.

#### **6. Constitutional and Practical Considerations**
The committee explored the constitutional implications of bail decisions, particularly the balance between public safety and individual rights. There was a focus on ensuring that bail conditions are set quickly and effectively, especially in emergency situations. Members emphasized the complexity of bail reform, noting that changes affect multiple parts of the criminal justice system, including judges, clerks, and law enforcement.

#### **7. Payment Issues for Bail Commissioners**
There was a discussion about a previous bill that aimed to ensure bail commissioners were paid. The bill was ultimately killed after bail commissioners expressed concerns that it would complicate their ability to receive their $40 fees. Commissioners preferred to focus on being paid consistently rather than increasing fees or adding new ones. A retired police chief, now a bail commissioner, shared his experience of taking on the role and the financial burden he has faced, being over $51,000 in the hole due to unpaid fees and expenses.

#### **8. Proposed Changes and Future Discussions**
The committee discussed the potential for judges to handle certain bail decisions more efficiently and the need for financial support for technology and temporary court positions. Members were assigned homework to review specific forms and prepare for upcoming discussions. They also planned to discuss flight risk in future meetings, as it had not been thoroughly addressed. The committee agreed that public defenders and victims should be consulted before finalizing the list of crimes subject to bail reform, ensuring that the changes address public safety and due process concerns.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, the meeting underscored the need for a more coordinated and technologically advanced approach to the bail system, with a focus on protecting victims of domestic violence while upholding constitutional rights. The committee highlighted the challenges faced by bail commissioners, the need for systemic reforms, and the importance of balancing public safety with defendants' rights. The discussions set the stage for future meetings aimed at addressing these complex issues and improving the criminal justice system in New Hampshire.
