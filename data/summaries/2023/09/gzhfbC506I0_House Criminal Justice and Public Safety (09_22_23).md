### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (09/22/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee meeting on September 22, 2023, addressed two major topics: **physical fitness standards for police officers** and **compensation and professionalization of bail commissioners**. Both discussions highlighted systemic challenges and proposed solutions to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of these critical roles within the state’s criminal justice system.

#### **1. Police Officer Physical Fitness Standards**

**Key Issues:**
- **Legislative vs. Agency Oversight**: The committee debated whether physical fitness standards for police officers should remain legislatively mandated or be delegated to police standards and training agencies. Current standards, established in 2001, were criticized as outdated and arbitrary, with some arguing that experts in law enforcement training should determine appropriate requirements.
- **Retention and Liability Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the impact of stringent fitness standards on officer retention, particularly for experienced officers who may struggle to meet requirements as they age. Low pay and staffing shortages were identified as more significant retention issues than fitness standards. Liability risks for departments with unfit officers were also discussed.
- **Frequency and Implementation of Testing**: The current requirement for fitness testing every three years was criticized as insufficient. Some representatives advocated for more frequent testing (e.g., every six months) to ensure officers maintain physical readiness.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Proposals included creating wellness programs or alternative pathways for officers who fail fitness tests, rather than immediate decertification, to retain experienced personnel while addressing fitness concerns.

**Outcome:**
The committee voted 4-2 to retain the existing law (HB 113) without changes, reflecting a preference for police standards and training agencies to address any necessary updates rather than legislative intervention. Further discussions are expected to balance public safety needs with recruitment and retention challenges.

#### **2. Bail Commissioners: Compensation and Professionalization**

**Key Issues:**
- **Compensation Challenges**: Bail commissioners, who are volunteers, are often unpaid or underpaid for their services, with some owed significant amounts (e.g., $50,000 over two years). They also bear the cost of using personal resources, such as vehicles and equipment, which has become increasingly burdensome due to rising expenses.
- **Proposed Payment Solutions**: Suggestions included increasing the bail commissioner fee from $40 to $50 per bail, ensuring timely payment (e.g., within two weeks), and having the court pay bail commissioners upfront while recovering costs from defendants. Reimbursement for outstanding debts was also discussed to start with a clean slate.
- **Training and Certification**: Concerns were raised about inconsistent training for bail commissioners, with some receiving as little as four hours of instruction before making critical bail decisions. The need for standardized initial and annual training, competency assessments, and shadowing programs was emphasized.
- **Professionalization and Oversight**: The lack of formal employment or contractual status for bail commissioners has led to fragmented oversight and limited access to resources. Proposals included creating a **part-time bail commissioner coordinator** position to oversee training, recruitment, and consistency across districts.
- **Systemic Challenges**: The number of active bail commissioners has declined from 120 pre-COVID to about 85, exacerbating operational issues such as remote bailing, handling cash, and traveling in adverse conditions. Police departments’ reluctance to hold bail money overnight was also noted.

**Outcome:**
The committee plans to collaborate with the Chief Justice and court officials to address these issues, proposing legislative solutions such as improved compensation, mandatory training, and professionalization of the role. A part-time coordinator position will be recommended to the courts, with funding discussions ongoing.

#### **Key Themes and Future Directions**

- **Balancing Standards and Practicality**: Both discussions emphasized the need to balance high standards (e.g., physical fitness for officers, competency for bail commissioners) with practical concerns such as retention, compensation, and resource constraints.
- **Expert Oversight vs. Legislative Mandates**: There was a recurring theme of delegating specific responsibilities (e.g., fitness standards, bail commissioner training) to specialized agencies or professionals rather than relying on legislative mandates.
- **Systemic Reforms**: Both topics highlighted systemic issues within New Hampshire’s criminal justice system, including fragmented oversight, inconsistent training, and resource limitations. Proposed reforms aim to address these challenges through professionalization, improved funding, and centralized oversight.
- **Collaboration and Legislation**: The committee plans to work closely with stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies and the courts, to draft and implement legislation addressing these concerns. Further deliberation is expected on both the police fitness standards and bail commissioner reforms.
