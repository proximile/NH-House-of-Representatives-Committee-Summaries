**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Administrative Rules Committee Meeting (09/21/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Administrative Rules Committee convened on September 21, 2023, to discuss and review a wide range of administrative rules across various state departments. The meeting emphasized transparency, statutory compliance, and collaboration with relevant boards and agencies. Key discussions and decisions included:

### **Procedural Matters**
- The meeting began with the seating of alternates and motions to approve previous meeting minutes.
- Several agenda items, including those related to Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Board of Medicine, were postponed to allow for further review or conditional approvals.

### **Consent Agenda**
- The committee addressed a late-filed conditional approval related to Employment Security, which required a waiver. The consent agenda was approved with amendments.

### **Board of Medicine Rules**
- Detailed discussions were held regarding physician assistant rules, focusing on supervision requirements, fee discrepancies, and application forms. The committee sought clarification from the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) on conflicting fee structures and statutory requirements.

### **Pease Development Authority (PDA) Rules**
- The committee reviewed PDA rules concerning state-owned commercial piers and associated facilities. Discrepancies between rule text and forms were noted, and the agency agreed to make recommended changes.

### **Health and Human Services (HHS) Rules**
- Rules related to family-centered early supports and services were reviewed, with particular attention to issues with waiver forms and ensuring consistency between rule text and forms.

### **Fish and Game Rules**
- New rules prohibiting interference with hunting, trapping, or fishing were discussed. The agency explained the delay in adopting these rules since the statute was enacted in 1989 and amended in 2016.

### **Interim Rules by OPLC**
- The OPLC presented interim rules for license endorsement, focusing on streamlining requirements for certain professions. Public comments raised concerns about educational requirements and reciprocity agreements. The committee emphasized the need for transparency and cooperation with boards during the rulemaking process.

### **Environmental Fines**
- Rules establishing fines for hazardous waste management violations were discussed. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) acknowledged past enforcement of expired rules and committed to fixing the issue by promulgating new rules.

### **Administrative Fines and Expired Rules**
- The committee discussed a motion to dismiss a case based on expired administrative rules regarding fines. The motion was granted, and the practice of enforcing expired rules was halted.
- A statute passed in 2015 prohibits the enforcement of expired rules, but the department continued to impose fines between 2015 and 2020, using expired rules as guidance. This practice was challenged in court, leading to the dismissal of cases based on expired rules.
- The committee debated whether the commissioner had the authority to impose fines without a valid schedule of fines. Further discussion on the issue was postponed to the next meeting, with a request for more information on how fines are determined and applied.

### **Foster Family Care Licensing Requirements**
- The committee reviewed an objection response from DHHS regarding foster family care licensing requirements. The objection was based on three points: clarity of when an application is considered complete, protection of health care information, and the enforceability of certain rules due to a new law (HB 48).
- DHHS addressed the first two points by clarifying language in the rules. The third point, related to vaccination requirements for caregivers, was discussed in detail. The committee agreed to revise the objection to specify that only adult caregivers are required to have certain vaccinations, aligning with the new law.

### **Approval of Revised Forms**
- The committee approved three revised forms related to administrative rulemaking, updated to comply with changes from House Bill 358. The forms included a cover sheet for proposed interim rules, a notice for expedited revisions, and a form for agency rulemaking actions.

### **Memorandums from Boards**
- The committee reviewed memos from the Mechanical Licensing Board and the Real Estate Appraiser Board. The Mechanical Licensing Board explained how they assess mental and physical competence of applicants, while the Real Estate Appraiser Board clarified that they continued to collect fees during a period when some rules were expired, as the rule governing fees remained in effect.

### **Legislative Updates**
- The committee discussed recent changes to RSA 541a, particularly from House Bill 358, which impacts administrative rulemaking. A memo summarizing these changes was sent to agencies, and committee members requested a copy of the detailed summary.

### **Next Meeting**
- The committeeâ€™s next meeting was scheduled for October 19, 2023, where they will continue discussions on pending issues, including the administrative fines and the revised foster care licensing rules.

The meeting concluded with the committee adjourning after addressing all agenda items, ensuring that all discussed rules and procedures align with statutory requirements and promote transparency and efficiency in administrative rulemaking.
