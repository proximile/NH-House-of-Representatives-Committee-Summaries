**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (09/21/23)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on September 21, 2023, to address a wide range of administrative rules and legislative updates. The meeting focused on ensuring compliance with statutory requirements, clarifying rulemaking processes, and resolving objections to proposed rules. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:  

### **Administrative Fines and Rulemaking**  
1. **Enforcement of Expired Rules**:  
   - The committee extensively debated the legality of imposing administrative fines under expired rules, referencing a 2015 statute (RSA 541-A) that prohibits enforcing expired rules.  
   - Concerns were raised about the Department of Environmental Services (DES) issuing fines based on expired rules, using them as guidelines despite statutory prohibitions.  
   - The agency acknowledged the issue and stated they had ceased issuing fines after a legal challenge, aiming to rectify the problem.  

2. **Legislative Intent and Authority**:  
   - Discussions centered on whether the commissioner had the authority to impose fines without specific rules and whether expired rules could still serve as guidance.  
   - The committee emphasized the need for clarity in rulemaking, particularly regarding the imposition of fines and the inclusion of mitigating factors.  

3. **Postponement of Rule Approval**:  
   - Due to unresolved issues and the need for further clarification, the committee postponed the approval of certain rules until the next meeting in October. This delay would allow agencies to address concerns and provide additional information on fine determination and imposition.  

### **Rule Changes and Objections**  
1. **HB 358 and Administrative Forms**:  
   - The committee reviewed updates to administrative rule forms necessitated by HB 358, which amended RSA 541-A. The forms were revised to comply with new requirements, including the submission of agency forms and clarification on whether proposed rules implement a state statute for the first time.  

2. **Health and Human Services (HHS) Rules**:  
   - The committee addressed preliminary objections from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding foster family care licensing requirements. The objections stemmed from clarity issues and enforceability concerns in light of new legislation (HB 48).  
   - The committee agreed to issue a revised objection to allow the department to make necessary corrections.  

3. **Family-Centered Early Supports and Services**:  
   - The committee reviewed rules for family-centered early supports and services, focusing on discrepancies between rule text and waiver forms. The agency committed to revising the form to resolve conflicts.  

### **Board and Agency Rules**  
1. **Board of Medicine**:  
   - The committee reviewed rules related to physician assistants, including application and renewal forms, fees, and supervision requirements. Discrepancies between rule text and forms prompted the committee to seek clarification from the agency.  

2. **Pease Development Authority**:  
   - The committee addressed discrepancies between rule text and forms related to state-owned commercial piers and associated facilities. The agency agreed to make necessary changes.  

3. **Fish and Game Rules**:  
   - New rules prohibiting interference with hunting, trapping, or fishing were discussed. These rules were long overdue, as the enabling statute was enacted in 1989. The agency explained the delay and the need for the rules.  

4. **OPLC Interim Rules**:  
   - The committee reviewed interim rules for licensing by endorsement, focusing on the appendix and statutory references. A debate ensued on whether to include certain statutory requirements in the appendix, with the agency expressing concerns about overstepping board authority.  

### **Public and Industry Concerns**  
1. **Electricians' Concerns**:  
   - A licensed electrician raised concerns about the interim rules, particularly regarding education and experience requirements. The committee discussed the need for better communication and cooperation with the boards to address such issues.  

### **Consent Agenda and Late-Filed Items**  
- The committee discussed and voted on the consent agenda, including a late-filed conditional approval from Employment Security, which required a waiver.  

### **Next Steps**  
- The committee scheduled its next meeting for October 19, 2023, to continue discussions on unresolved issues and review additional rule changes.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the importance of transparency, cooperation with boards, and adherence to statutory requirements in the rulemaking process. The committee emphasized the need for clarity and compliance, particularly in cases involving expired rules and the imposition of fines. The postponement of certain rule approvals underscored the committeeâ€™s commitment to addressing unresolved issues thoroughly and ensuring that administrative rules align with legislative intent.
