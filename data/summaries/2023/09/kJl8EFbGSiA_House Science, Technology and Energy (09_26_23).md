**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (09/26/23)**

The September 26, 2023, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee covered a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence (AI), energy grid reliability, renewable energy policies, and legislative bills related to energy and technology. The meeting featured presentations, discussions, and the formation of subcommittees to address complex issues.

### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
Professor Soroush Vosoughi from Dartmouth College’s Department of Computer Science delivered a presentation on AI, emphasizing the distinction between AI technologies and their applications. Key points included:
- **AI Technologies vs. Applications**: AI technologies, such as machine learning and deep neural networks, are neutral, but their applications (e.g., ChatGPT, deepfakes) can have significant societal impacts, both positive and negative.
- **Challenges with AI**:
  - **Bias and Hallucinations**: AI models trained on flawed data can produce biased or false outputs, such as ChatGPT inventing legal cases.
  - **Black Box Problem**: The complexity of deep neural networks makes it difficult to understand how decisions are made.
  - **Feedback Loops**: Inaccurate outputs can perpetuate errors if fed back into training data.
- **Regulation and Oversight**: Professor Vosoughi advocated for regulating AI applications rather than the technology itself, proposing "model nutrition labels" to provide transparency about data sources and potential biases.
- **Blockchain and Data Verification**: Blockchain was briefly discussed as a potential tool for verifying the authenticity of data, particularly for combating deepfakes.

The Q&A session highlighted the need for legislative awareness and potential regulatory frameworks to address ethical and technical challenges in AI.

### **Energy Grid Reliability**
The committee discussed the importance of grid reliability, particularly in light of lessons from the 2021 Texas energy crisis. Key points included:
- **Winter Grid Challenges**: Over-reliance on intermittent renewables, just-in-time natural gas delivery, and dependence on neighboring grids pose risks to grid stability, especially during winter.
- **On-Site Fuel Storage**: Programs like ISO New England’s underwriting of oil storage for power plants were highlighted as successful strategies for ensuring winter reliability.
- **Renewables and Storage**: While renewables like offshore wind and solar are important, their intermittency and the high costs of battery storage limit their ability to provide long-term grid stability.
- **Nuclear Energy**: Nuclear power was advocated as a reliable, low-carbon base load option that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels and provide grid stability.
- **Policy and Market Structures**: The committee criticized complex market structures in grid governance and introduced new programs like "pay for performance" and "inventoried energy" to incentivize reliable power generation.

### **Renewable Energy and Legislative Bills**
The committee debated several bills and policies related to renewable energy and grid modernization:
- **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**: There was significant discussion about transitioning the RPS to a Clean Energy Portfolio Standard, potentially including nuclear energy. Concerns were raised about the costs of RPS and its impact on energy prices, with some suggesting phasing it out by 2028.
- **Microgrids and Grid Resiliency (HB 558)**: A subcommittee was proposed to study amendments to the bill on microgrids and grid resiliency, in collaboration with the Department of Energy and utilities.
- **Energy Facility Siting (HB 609)**: The committee recommended forming a subcommittee to explore further reforms to the site evaluation process for energy facilities.
- **Smart Meters (HB 631)**: The bill proposing optional smart meter purchases was debated, with some representatives seeing value in allowing early adopters to invest in the technology.
- **Transmission Costs and Renewables**: The committee discussed whether distributed renewable energy generation increases transmission costs, highlighting the need for backup power sources and new infrastructure to address the intermittent nature of renewables.
- **Grid Modernization**: Questions were raised about the costs and benefits of modernizing the grid, particularly in light of increased demand from electric vehicles and the need for quicker outage responses.
- **Capacity Planning**: The closure of nuclear and coal plants raised concerns about grid reliability during peak demand periods, emphasizing the need for backup power sources like natural gas.

### **Subcommittees and Amendments**
The committee formed subcommittees to study specific issues, such as laddering of default service procurement (HB 159), the site evaluation committee rules (HB 176), and the future of the RPS (HB 509). Amendments were proposed to refine certain bills, ensuring they align with legislative goals and address specific concerns.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for balanced energy policies that prioritize grid reliability, reduce carbon emissions, and ensure public safety. It also highlighted the importance of transparency and oversight in AI development to address ethical and technical challenges. The committee emphasized the complexities of transitioning to renewable energy and the need for careful study, bipartisan collaboration, and regulatory frameworks to address these challenges effectively.
