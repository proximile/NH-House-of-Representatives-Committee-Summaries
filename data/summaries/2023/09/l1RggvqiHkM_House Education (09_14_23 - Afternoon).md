The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on September 14, 2023, focused on discussing two bills: **House Bill 625** and **House Bill 637**. The primary topics of discussion revolved around the calculation of **average daily membership (ADM)** for school districts and **local education improvement plans**, particularly concerning reimbursement for homeschooled students participating in public school courses.

### Key Points:
1. **House Bill 625**:
   - The bill addresses the **0.15 FTE (Full-Time Equivalency)** reimbursement for school districts when homeschoolers or other students take academic courses in public schools.
   - The current law applies only to **high school courses (grades 9-12)**, but the bill proposes extending this to **grades 1-12**.
   - Concerns were raised about how to **define courses** in elementary and middle schools, as their curriculum is less structured than high schools. Some members suggested limiting the bill to **grades 6-12** or **7-12** to avoid complications.
   - Questions were also raised about whether **co-curricular activities** (e.g., sports, clubs) should be included in the reimbursement, with some members arguing that these activities are already handled separately and should not be part of the ADM calculation.

2. **House Bill 637**:
   - This bill is about **local education improvement plans** and disparities in education.
   - It was noted that the bill originated from the **Department of Education** and aimed to address concerns about **homeschoolers** participating in public school programs.
   - The discussion highlighted the need for clarity on how to define **elementary school courses** and whether the bill should apply to **middle school students** taking high school-level courses.

### Key Concerns and Questions:
- **Definition of Courses**: Members debated how to clearly define academic courses in elementary and middle schools, as they are often integrated and less distinct than high school courses.
- **Reimbursement Scope**: There was uncertainty about whether the bill should apply to **homeschoolers**, **EFA (Education Freedom Account) students**, and **public school students** taking courses outside their district.
- **Co-Curricular Activities**: Some members argued that extracurricular activities should not be included in the ADM reimbursement, as they are not part of the adequacy funding.
- **Middle School Courses**: The committee discussed whether middle school students taking high school-level courses (e.g., Algebra 1) should qualify for reimbursement.

### Next Steps:
- The committee decided to **seek further clarification** from the **Department of Education** on the specific issues the bills aim to address.
- Members also agreed to **contact school administrators** for input on how the proposed changes might impact schools.
- The committee opted to **delay action** on the bills until they had more information and could refine the language to address the identified concerns.

### Overall Tone:
The meeting was marked by detailed technical discussions and a focus on ensuring the bills would not create unintended consequences, particularly in elementary and middle schools. Members emphasized the need for clarity and simplicity in the language to avoid confusion and potential misuse.
