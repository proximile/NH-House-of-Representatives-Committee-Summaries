### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Retirement Benefits (September 28, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on September 28, 2023, to discuss and debate various proposals and issues related to retirement benefits for state employees and other public workers. The discussions centered on balancing fair and competitive retirement benefits with fiscal responsibility, addressing retention and recruitment challenges, and preventing abuses in the retirement system. Key topics and proposals included:

#### 1. **Part-Time vs. Full-Time Retirement Benefits**
   - A representative emphasized that part-time workers should receive part-time retirement benefits, while full-time workers should receive full-time benefits. Safeguards were proposed to prevent potential abuses, such as individuals working part-time for most of their career and then switching to full-time briefly to claim higher benefits.

#### 2. **Pension Calculation Changes**
   - There was a proposal to revert the pension calculation method from the highest five years of earnings back to the highest three years, as it was before 2011. Proponents argued that this would benefit employees and align with standard practices in large public employer plans. However, opponents cautioned that this could reintroduce pension "spiking," where employees inflate their earnings in their final years to boost retirement benefits. Historical safeguards, such as the 150% earnings limitation and the 85% maximum benefit rule, were highlighted as measures to prevent excessive payouts.

#### 3. **Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)**
   - A proposal suggested implementing a COLA based on half of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), funded through general fund surpluses, appropriations, and investment earnings. Concerns were raised about the affordability of COLAs, particularly in light of potential liabilities like the YDC settlements and the volatility of investment earnings. Some argued that COLAs should be funded through employer and employee contributions rather than relying on general funds.

#### 4. **Multiplier Changes and Retention Issues**
   - Senator Gray proposed changes to the retirement multiplier to address retention issues among state employees, particularly for Group 2 (employees hired after July 1, 2011). The proposal aimed to increase the multiplier to 2.5% at 20 years and 2.75% at 30 years of service, with the goal of improving retention across the board. Additionally, a matching contribution system similar to 401(k) plans was suggested, where the state would match up to 5% of employee contributions, estimated to cost around $15 million initially.

#### 5. **Part-Time Employees and Vesting**
   - There was discussion about lowering the threshold for part-time employees to be eligible for retirement benefits from 30 hours per week to 20 hours. This proposal was seen as a way to attract and retain more workers, particularly in roles like school bus drivers and food service workers. However, concerns were raised about the potential cost to employers and the impact on the retirement system. Another proposal was to reduce the vesting period from 10 years to 5 years, making it easier for employees to qualify for retirement benefits and improving recruitment and retention in competitive labor markets.

#### 6. **Earnable Compensation**
   - A proposal was made to reinstate certain types of compensation (e.g., end-of-career payouts) into the retirement benefit calculation, which had been removed about 10 years ago. This was seen as a way to improve retention by offering more attractive retirement benefits.

#### 7. **Alternative Retirement Savings Plans**
   - Some representatives suggested exploring tax-advantaged savings plans or supplemental retirement accounts as alternatives to traditional pensions. These plans would allow for optional employee contributions with potential state matching, providing additional retirement savings options for employees.

#### 8. **Cost Concerns and Further Analysis**
   - Throughout the discussions, there were concerns about the financial impact of these proposals on the retirement system and employers. The New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) provided input on how the proposed changes might affect costs and the overall system. The committee agreed to seek further actuarial analysis on the proposed changes, particularly regarding their cost implications, before making any decisions.

#### 9. **Historical Context and Fairness**
   - Discussions referenced past reforms in 2011 aimed at curbing pension spiking and reducing benefits. There was a strong emphasis on fair compensation and benefits to attract and retain state employees, as well as equitable treatment of employees regardless of when they were hired, to avoid creating disparities in benefits.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the ongoing challenges of balancing fair retirement benefits for state employees with fiscal responsibility and system sustainability. The proposals and discussions reflected a concerted effort to address retention and recruitment issues, prevent abuses in the retirement system, and ensure equitable treatment of all employees. Further analysis and careful consideration of the financial implications will be essential as the committee moves forward with potential changes to the retirement benefits system.
