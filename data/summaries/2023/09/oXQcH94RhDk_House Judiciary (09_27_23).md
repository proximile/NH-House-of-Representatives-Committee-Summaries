The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on September 27, 2023, to discuss two interconnected issues related to the state's Right-to-Know Law (RSA 91-A), focusing on transparency, due process, and the operational needs of public bodies. The discussions centered on proposed amendments to RSA 91-A:3 II(c), which governs non-public sessions of public bodies, and whether individuals discussed in these sessions should be notified and allowed to attend or have representation.

### Key Points of Discussion:

1. **Notification of Discussion**:
   - The proposed amendments would require public bodies to notify individuals if they are discussed in non-public sessions, even if no formal action is taken. This is intended to protect citizens' rights to know when they are being discussed, particularly in contexts that could affect their reputation or rights.

2. **Purpose of HB 652**:
   - **HB 652**, retained from a previous session, seeks to amend RSA 91-A:3 II(c) to require public bodies to notify individuals whose reputations might be adversely affected by non-public discussions and allow them to attend or have representation. The intent is to protect private citizens from false accusations or reputational harm during closed sessions.

3. **Due Process Concerns**:
   - Participants debated the necessity of such notification, especially in cases where no action is taken. Some argued that due process rights only come into play when formal action is taken, while others insisted that individuals have a right to know and defend themselves against any accusations or discussions, regardless of whether action is taken.

4. **Concerns and Criticisms**:
   - Some committee members expressed concerns that the bill is too broad and could hinder investigations, particularly in cases where early notification might compromise evidence or allow individuals to obstruct proceedings. Examples included a town clerk accused of embezzlement or a public official under investigation.

5. **Balancing Rights and Practicality**:
   - Representative Perez argued that individuals should have the right to know and defend themselves before any adverse action is taken, emphasizing due process. Others, including Representative Lynn, raised concerns about the potential for the bill to disrupt investigative processes, comparing it to requiring police to notify suspects before gathering evidence.

6. **Examples and Scenarios**:
   - Several hypothetical scenarios were discussed, such as banning someone from a public library or discussing allegations of misconduct. The conversation highlighted the tension between protecting citizens' rights and ensuring that public bodies can function efficiently without unnecessary legal burdens.

7. **Proposed Amendments**:
   - Suggestions were made to modify the amendment to clarify that notification is only required before any adverse action is taken, rather than before any discussion occurs. This would balance the need for transparency with the practicalities of governance. Other proposals included limiting the bill’s scope to residents of the jurisdiction or focusing on non-criminal matters, and expanding protections to include public officials, not just employees.

8. **Administrative Procedure Act (RSA 541-A)**:
   - The discussion touched on whether the **Administrative Procedure Act (RSA 541-A)**, which governs state-level due process, could be expanded to cover municipalities, potentially offering a more structured framework for protecting private citizens.

9. **Private Citizens vs. Public Employees**:
   - The bill’s primary focus is on protecting private citizens, as public employees already have protections under existing law. However, there was debate over whether the bill should also cover public officials or remain focused on private individuals.

10. **Due Process and Reputation**:
    - Committee members emphasized the importance of protecting individuals from false accusations while balancing the need for public bodies to conduct confidential investigations.

11. **Focus on Accessibility**:
    - Some representatives emphasized the importance of making laws understandable and accessible to the average citizen, particularly those without legal training, to ensure that people can effectively exercise their rights.

### Conclusion:
The committee grappled with finding a balance between protecting individual rights and ensuring public bodies can effectively conduct their duties. Proposals to refine the bill’s language and scope were discussed, with a focus on limiting its impact on investigations while safeguarding due process for private citizens. The discussion also explored the potential for leveraging RSA 541-A to address these concerns at the municipal level. The committee did not reach a final decision but indicated a need for further refinement of the bill’s language and scope. Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing transparency, due process, and the operational needs of public bodies.
