**Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting on September 26, 2023**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on September 26, 2023, to address critical issues surrounding **landlord-tenant regulations**, specifically focusing on **administrative and rental application fees**. The discussions centered on two key segments: proposed amendments to a bill concerning landlord-tenant regulations and deliberations on **HB 283**, which targets rental application fees. The overarching goal was to protect tenants, particularly low-income renters, from excessive fees while ensuring landlords can cover legitimate costs in a challenging housing market.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

#### **1. Administrative Fees and Landlord-Tenant Regulations**
   - **Concerns Over Fees**: Legislators raised concerns about the broad and potentially exploitative nature of administrative fees charged by landlords for background and credit checks. These fees disproportionately burden low-income tenants, many of whom cannot afford them or pursue legal action to recover overcharged amounts.
   - **Proposed Amendments**: Representative Alexander proposed amendments to limit administrative fees, including capping fees at a percentage of the rent (e.g., 1-2%). While some legislators favored caps to prevent abuse, others preferred relying on courts to address overcharging.
   - **Fair Housing and Transparency**: The discussion emphasized the importance of fair housing laws, ensuring landlords treat all applicants equally. Maurice Warble, CEO of the Front Door Agency, testified as both a landlord and advocate for low-income tenants, supporting reasonable fees but stressing the need for transparency and affordability.
   - **Compromise Language**: The committee worked on compromise language, adding terms like "reasonable" to administrative fees and requiring documentation of costs. They also debated the appropriate section of the law to place these amendments to avoid unintended penalties.
   - **Committee Consensus**: After adjustments, the committee reached a tentative consensus, though further legal review was needed to ensure proper implementation.

#### **2. HB 283: Rental Application Fees**
   - **Initial Proposal**: HB 283 aimed to cap rental application fees at **$35** or the cost of background and credit checks, whichever is lower, to prevent landlords from profiting off application fees.
   - **Amendments Proposed**:
     - **Alexander-Reed Amendment**: Requires landlords to disclose background and credit check criteria upfront and mandates refunds for fees exceeding actual costs.
     - **Reed-Kutab Amendment**: Similar to the Alexander-Reed Amendment but adds a cap of **7% of the monthly rent** on application fees to ensure reasonableness and growth-proofing.
   - **Concerns Raised**:
     - **Landlord Perspective**: Representatives from the housing industry argued that codifying specific criteria for background checks and credit scores could disadvantage marginal applicants. They also objected to penalties and the potential for illegal actions under the proposed amendments.
     - **Renter Perspective**: Advocates highlighted the financial strain of multiple application fees on low-income renters, especially in a market with a **0.6% vacancy rate**. Reports indicated some landlords collect fees without conducting checks, turning application fees into a profit center.
   - **Debate Highlights**:
     - **Transparency and Fairness**: The amendments aim to ensure tenants are informed about application criteria and receive refunds for excessive fees.
     - **Capping Fees**: The 7% cap was proposed to balance renter protection with landlords' legitimate costs, though some argued even this cap might be too high for low-income renters.
     - **Housing Crisis**: The severe lack of affordable housing in New Hampshire was a recurring theme, with renters facing significant barriers to securing housing.
   - **Next Steps**: The subcommittee will decide between the proposed amendments or consider alternative solutions to address predatory application fees.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need to protect renters from exploitation while addressing the financial realities faced by landlords in a tight housing market. The committee worked toward compromise solutions, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and affordability. Further legal review and finalization of amendments are expected before moving forward. These efforts reflect New Hampshire's commitment to addressing its housing crisis and ensuring equitable treatment for all parties in the rental market.
