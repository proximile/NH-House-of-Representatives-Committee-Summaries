**Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting (09/26/23)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on September 26, 2023, addressing both procedural matters and substantive legislative issues, with a focus on **HB 283**, a bill aimed at regulating **rental application fees** in the context of the state's severe housing crisis, which has a vacancy rate of just 0.6%. The meeting was characterized by a collaborative and occasionally lighthearted tone, reflecting the committee's efforts to balance competing interests while addressing pressing concerns.

### **Procedural Segment**
The meeting began with a discussion of procedural matters, where representatives deliberated on an amendment and determined that a formal vote was unnecessary. After reaching consensus on the proposed change, the session concluded with a humorous invitation to Representative Reed to "take a stroll," marking a lighthearted end to the day. The informal and cooperative tone set the stage for the subsequent substantive discussions.

### **Discussion of HB 283: Rental Application Fees**
The committee then turned its attention to **HB 283**, which seeks to regulate rental application fees charged to prospective tenants. The bill aims to address concerns that landlords are using these fees as a profit center, particularly in a market where tenants face significant financial pressures and housing insecurity. Key points of the discussion included:

1. **Purpose of the Bill**:  
   The original bill proposed capping application fees at $35 or the cost of background and credit checks, whichever is lower. This aligns with similar laws in over a dozen other states. The bill seeks to protect tenants from excessive fees while ensuring landlords can cover legitimate costs.

2. **Proposed Amendments**:  
   - **Reed-Alexander Amendment**: Requires landlords to disclose in writing the criteria for a successful application and mandates the return of any fees exceeding the actual cost of background checks, credit checks, and documented administrative fees.  
   - **Reed-Kutab Amendment**: Similar to the Reed-Alexander Amendment but introduces a **7% cap** on application fees based on the monthly rental amount.  
   - **Amendment 2286**: Addresses concerns about landlords profiting from application fees but removes specific criteria for criminal background checks, allowing landlords greater flexibility in tenant selection.

3. **Concerns Raised**:  
   - **Landlords**: Representatives from the housing industry expressed concerns about the complexity of defining acceptable criteria for background checks and the potential for increased administrative burdens.  
   - **Tenants**: Advocates highlighted the financial strain on renters, particularly low-income families, who often must pay multiple application fees with no guarantee of securing housing.  

4. **Debate on Administrative Costs**:  
   The committee debated whether landlords should be allowed to charge for administrative costs, such as time spent processing applications. Some members argued that these costs should be absorbed as part of doing business, while others advocated for reasonable reimbursement.  

5. **Fair Housing Concerns**:  
   One representative raised concerns about potential violations of fair housing laws if landlords are allowed to selectively apply background checks or other criteria to different applicants.  

6. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee discussed potential adjustments to the amendments, including adding the word "reasonable" to administrative costs and relocating penalty provisions to a different section of the law to avoid excessive fines.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing tenant protections with the operational needs of landlords in a tight housing market. The committee aimed to find a **middle ground** that prevents exploitation of tenants while addressing landlords' legitimate costs. The discussion highlighted the importance of clear, fair regulations in addressing the state's housing crisis.  

The session concluded with no further business, and the meeting was adjourned. The collaborative and occasionally lighthearted tone of the proceedings reflected the committee's commitment to constructive dialogue and problem-solving.
