### Comprehensive Summary:  
**New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Worldwide Combined Reporting (September 25, 2023)**  
The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting of the **Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting for Unitary Business Under the Business Profits Tax** on September 25, 2023. The session focused on the potential adoption of **Worldwide Combined Reporting (WCR)**, a tax policy that would require multinational corporations to report and pay taxes on their global income, rather than limiting taxation to U.S. activities under the current **"Water's Edge"** provision. The meeting featured testimony from stakeholders, including advocates, opponents, tax experts, and representatives from the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA). Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Background and Context**  
- **Worldwide Combined Reporting (WCR)**: WCR is a tax method that combines the income of all related entities worldwide and apportions it to the state based on factors like property, payroll, and sales. It is designed to prevent **profit shifting**, where multinational corporations move profits to low-tax jurisdictions, reducing their tax liability.  
- **Current System**: New Hampshire currently uses the **"Water's Edge"** method, which limits taxation to U.S. activities. However, the state already taxes a significant portion of **foreign-source income** through mechanisms like **Subpart F** and **foreign dividends**, which are taxed at 100% when distributed to shareholders.

### **Arguments in Favor of WCR**  
1. **Fairness and Revenue**:  
   - Proponents, including Thomas Opel (Coalition for a Prosperous America), Dan Collins (small business owner), and Peter Garr (former tax auditor), argued that WCR ensures **fair taxation** by requiring multinational corporations to pay their fair share.  
   - A 2019 study estimated that New Hampshire loses **$177 million annually** due to profit shifting, which WCR could recapture.  
   - WCR is seen as the **most effective method** to prevent artificial losses and tax foreign income.  

2. **Legal and Constitutional Validity**:  
   - The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld WCR as constitutional in cases like **Container Corp. (1983)** and **Barclays Bank (1994)**, rejecting claims of excessive compliance costs or international double taxation.  
   - States like **California**, **Montana**, and **Alaska** have successfully administered WCR, demonstrating its feasibility.  

3. **Global Trends**:  
   - The **OECD** and other international bodies are increasingly adopting formula-based methods (e.g., **Pillar Two**) to address profit shifting, reflecting a shift away from the **arm’s length principle**.  
   - WCR aligns with these global efforts to combat **base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)**.

### **Arguments Against WCR**  
1. **Economic and Administrative Concerns**:  
   - Opponents, including Meredith Beeson (Global Business Alliance) and Carl Frieden (Council on State Taxation), argued that WCR would create **revenue volatility**, administrative burdens, and compliance challenges.  
   - The DRA highlighted practical implementation challenges, such as increased audit complexity, international travel, language barriers, and currency exchange issues.  

2. **Outlier Status**:  
   - New Hampshire would become an outlier, as **no other state** currently uses WCR (except Alaska for oil and gas). This could harm the state’s economic competitiveness and deter foreign direct investment (FDI).  

3. **Redundancy and Revenue Estimates**:  
   - Critics noted that New Hampshire already taxes a substantial portion of foreign income, making WCR potentially redundant.  
   - The estimated **$177 million in revenue gains** was contested, as it does not account for existing taxation or the impact of apportionment factors.  

4. **Potential Retaliation**:  
   - Opponents warned that WCR could lead to international disputes, double taxation, and retaliation from key trading partners.  

---

### **Historical and Legal Context**  
- New Hampshire previously used WCR from **1981 to 1986** before reverting to Water’s Edge. The commission reviewed historical data to assess the potential revenue impact but acknowledged that such data might not be readily available.  
- The Supreme Court has upheld WCR, but most states have chosen **Water’s Edge** reporting due to political and lobbying pressures.  

---

### **Practical Implementation Challenges**  
1. **Audit Complexity**:  
   - Transitioning to WCR would require the DRA to audit global income, necessitating expertise in international tax rules and accounting standards like **IFRS** and **GAAP**.  
   - The DRA would face increased resource needs, including additional staffing and higher audit costs.  

2. **Legislative Considerations**:  
   - The commission emphasized the need for robust enforcement mechanisms and audit capabilities to ensure compliance.  
   - The potential for litigation and the burden of proof in disputes were also noted.  

---

### **Global and Federal Context**  
- The **OECD’s Pillar Two** initiative aims to establish a global minimum tax, but this is implemented at the national level, not sub-nationally.  
- The U.S. federal **GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income)** tax is a partial form of formula apportionment, reflecting federal recognition of the need to address profit shifting.  

---

### **Next Steps**  
- The commission planned to hold two additional meetings on **October 2nd** and **October 17th**, aiming to finalize its report by **November 1st**.  
- The report will inform deliberations on **HB121**, a bill proposing the shift to WCR, and will be presented to the **Ways and Means Committee**.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The debate highlighted the tension between ensuring **fair taxation** of multinational corporations and maintaining a **business-friendly tax environment**. Proponents argued that WCR is necessary to address profit shifting and ensure equity, while opponents stressed the potential for increased complexity, administrative burdens, and economic harm. The commission will weigh these factors in deciding whether to recommend the adoption of WCR, considering New Hampshire’s unique tax structure, historical context, and global trends.
