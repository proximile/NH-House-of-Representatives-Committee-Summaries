### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (09/12/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on September 12, 2023, to address critical issues within the family court system, with a particular focus on domestic violence cases, restraining orders, and broader systemic challenges. The meeting included historical context, legislative recommendations, and powerful testimonies from survivors, all aimed at improving the family court’s operations and outcomes.

#### Key Discussions and Recommendations:

1. **Historical Context of Family Courts**:
   - Former Representative Dan Itza provided a history of family courts in New Hampshire, which were established in 1995 to separate family cases from petty criminal cases. He highlighted ongoing issues such as parental alienation, custody laws, and the shift from litigation to negotiation in parenting time disputes.

2. **Domestic Violence Cases**:
   - Significant concerns were raised about domestic violence cases being moved from District Court to Family Court, where the rules of evidence are less stringent. Recommendations included returning domestic violence cases to District Court and establishing clearer evidentiary standards in Family Court.

3. **Legislative Recommendations**:
   - The committee discussed various legislative proposals, including:
     - Revising custody laws to better address parental rights and responsibilities.
     - Addressing parental access to children’s medical records.
     - Prohibiting reunification therapy, which has been criticized for its potential harm.
     - Specific bills related to wage garnishment for child support and special immigrant juvenile status were also mentioned.

4. **Work Groups and Assignments**:
   - The committee formed several work groups to focus on specific issues, including:
     - The role and oversight of Guardians ad Litem.
     - Judicial training to improve handling of family court cases.
     - Improving court forms and processes.
     - Reviewing and clarifying rules of evidence in family court.
   - These groups will explore potential legislative changes or recommendations to address systemic issues.

5. **Upcoming Meetings and Deadlines**:
   - The next meeting was scheduled for October 3, 2023, which will be a work session on retained bills and family law.
   - The committee discussed timelines for bill submissions and reviews, with bills related to family law expected to be addressed by the Children and Family Law Committee and voted on in January 2024.

6. **Judicial Resources**:
   - The need for additional judges to address case backlogs was emphasized. Seven judges were added in the current budget, with hopes for more in the next budget cycle to improve efficiency and reduce delays.

#### Testimonies on Domestic Violence and Restraining Orders**:
   - **Lindsey Smith**, a domestic violence survivor, shared her harrowing experience of being denied a restraining order by Judge Polly Hall. She believes this decision could have prevented her ex-partner from attempting to murder her. Lindsey criticized the system’s failure to treat her case as criminal, despite clear evidence of abuse.
   - **Cindy Smith**, Lindsey’s mother, echoed these concerns, describing the court’s decision as capricious and negligent. She argued that the burden of proving abuse should not fall solely on survivors, especially when their safety is at risk.

#### Overall Focus and Goals:
The meeting underscored the urgent need to address systemic issues within the family court system, particularly in cases involving domestic violence. The committee emphasized legislative reforms, improved judicial training, and additional resources to ensure fair and efficient outcomes for families and survivors. The testimonies highlighted the real-world consequences of court failures, reinforcing the importance of these efforts to protect vulnerable individuals and improve the justice system.
