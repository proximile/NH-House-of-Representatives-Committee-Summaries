The NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Committee met on September 14, 2023, to discuss **HB 232**, which addresses private sector OSHA standards. The committee is considering adopting OSHA's **1910 standards** (general industry standards) without pursuing a full state OSHA plan. A study committee had previously recommended retaining the bill to gather more stakeholder input, which is why the hearing was held.

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **OSHA Standards Adoption**: The committee aims to adopt OSHA standards to modernize safety regulations, as New Hampshire’s current Department of Labor (DOL) safety standards have not been updated in decades. The 1910 standards are seen as the most appropriate for general application.

2. **Stakeholder Input**: The committee emphasized the importance of stakeholder feedback, particularly from public sector employers like schools, police, and fire departments. Susie Nord from the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (National COSH) supported the bill, noting that adopting OSHA standards is a logical step toward improving workplace safety.

3. **Public Sector Concerns**: There were discussions about how OSHA standards interact with public sector services like police and fire departments. Nord shared examples from Washington State, where a public sector OSHA plan successfully addressed safety issues without conflict.

4. **Department of Labor’s Role**: Wesley Gardner, an attorney for the NH DOL, explained that the department currently uses OSHA standards as guidance when there are gaps in state regulations. If HB 232 passes, OSHA standards would become law rather than just guidance, potentially requiring more resources for implementation.

5. **State Plan vs. Adopting Standards**: The committee decided against pursuing a state OSHA plan (which would involve federal funding and oversight) and instead opted to adopt OSHA standards independently. This approach avoids the complexities of a state plan but still enhances safety regulations.

6. **Resource Needs**: The DOL anticipates needing additional staff, including inspectors and consultants, to implement the new standards effectively. However, the exact number of positions required remains unclear.

7. **Next Steps**: The committee will continue to hear from stakeholders, including public sector employers and employee groups, in future meetings. The goal is to ensure that the bill balances safety improvements with practical implementation.

The meeting concluded with an invitation for further input from stakeholders, particularly those in public sector employment, to refine the bill before it advances.
