The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee met on September 14, 2023, to discuss bail reform and related issues. The committee chair outlined the agenda, focusing on several key areas:

1. **Bail Bills Review**: The committee will review and rewrite multiple bail-related bills (HP 38, HB 318, HP 653, SB 252, and SB 249) over the next three to four weeks, meeting twice a week.

2. **IT System Overhaul**: The outdated IT system for the criminal justice and court system in New Hampshire will be revamped to enable real-time information sharing across courts, probation, parole, and law enforcement. Companies with experience in other states will present potential solutions, though the committee’s role is to set policy, not select vendors.

3. **Bail Commissioners’ Pay**: The committee will address the issue of bail commissioners not being adequately paid for their work, which has led to a shortage of commissioners. Ensuring fair compensation is a priority to maintain the system’s functionality.

4. **Bail Eligibility**: The committee will create a list of crimes that require a judge’s decision for bail, rather than a bail commissioner. They will also explore having on-call judges available on weekends to prevent unnecessary delays in bail hearings.

5. **Training and Continuing Education**: Improved training and continuing education for bail commissioners were discussed, as well as the need to update bail handbooks regularly to reflect changes in the law.

6. **Constitutional and Practical Considerations**: The committee emphasized the importance of balancing public safety with constitutional rights, avoiding overly simplistic solutions, and ensuring the system does not further criminalize mental health issues.

The committee plans to collaborate with the courts, finance committees, and the Senate to ensure the proposed reforms are practical and have broad support. The next meetings will focus on specific issues, including the list of bailable crimes and bail commissioners’ reimbursement. The chair stressed the need for a comprehensive, long-term solution to fix systemic issues in the bail system.
