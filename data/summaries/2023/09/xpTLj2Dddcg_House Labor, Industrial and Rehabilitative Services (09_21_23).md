**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services (09/21/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on September 21, 2023, centered on discussions regarding **HB 232**, a bill proposing the adoption of OSHA 1910 safety standards for public sector workers in the state. The meeting highlighted both the potential benefits and significant challenges of implementing these standards, particularly for public sector employers such as counties, municipalities, and state agencies. Key points from the discussion include:

### **Purpose and Goals of HB 232**
HB 232 seeks to modernize safety regulations by replacing outdated New Hampshire Department of Labor (DOL) standards with OSHA 1910 standards. The bill aims to align public sector safety practices with OSHA’s continuously updated regulations, ensuring consistency and improved worker safety. Notably, the bill does not establish an OSHA state plan but adopts OSHA standards for public sector compliance.

### **Challenges and Concerns**
1. **Complexity and Volume of OSHA Standards**: Representatives and state agencies expressed concerns about the complexity and extensive requirements of OSHA 1910 standards, particularly for public sector employers like counties and municipalities. Implementing and monitoring compliance would require significant resources, training, and time.
   
2. **Financial and Operational Burdens**:
   - **Cost of Compliance**: Agencies, including the Department of Environmental Services (DES) and Sullivan County, highlighted the high costs of certifying specialized equipment under OSHA’s National Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) requirements. Replacing uncertified equipment would be financially prohibitive.
   - **Training and Staffing**: The need for qualified trainers, dedicated personnel, and additional management positions to handle compliance was emphasized. For example, Hillsborough County Nursing Home noted the necessity of hiring more staff to manage the regulatory burden.
   - **Redundancy with Existing Regulations**: Some agencies, like Sullivan County, argued that existing regulations (e.g., CMS, NFPA) already provide robust oversight, making OSHA adoption redundant and unnecessarily costly.

3. **Implementation Timeline**: The proposed 60-day implementation period was widely criticized as unrealistic. Representatives and agencies advocated for a longer timeline, such as three to five years, to allow for proper adaptation, training, and restructuring.

4. **County and Municipal Autonomy**: Coordinating resources across independently operated counties and municipalities was identified as a significant challenge. Combining resources to create shared compliance positions was viewed as impractical due to differing budgets and priorities.

5. **Specific Safety Concerns**: Some representatives questioned whether OSHA 1910 standards would effectively address the most common public sector injuries, such as slips, falls, and injuries from combative incidents. They argued that existing state-level safety programs are more flexible and responsive to these unique needs.

### **Role of the Department of Labor**
The DOL would enforce the new standards, maintaining a non-punitive, educational approach focused on resolving safety issues rather than issuing fines. However, concerns were raised about the DOL’s capacity to provide adequate training and consultation, with calls for increased staffing and funding to support the transition.

### **Safety Plans and Audits**
Public employers would be required to update safety plans every two years, with the DOL conducting audits to ensure compliance. Representatives stressed the importance of addressing safety concerns promptly and maintaining accessible safety plans for employees.

### **Potential Solutions**
Suggestions to mitigate challenges included:
- Establishing a coordinating council among counties to share resources and costs.
- Extending the implementation timeline to allow for thorough preparation.
- Granting rulemaking authority to the DOL to address exemptions for specialized equipment.

### **Safety Benefits vs. Costs**
While the bill aims to improve worker safety, concerns were raised about whether the financial burden on taxpayers would yield significant safety benefits. The tension between improving standards and practical implementation challenges was a recurring theme.

### **Next Steps**
The committee acknowledged the need for further discussion and input, scheduling additional meetings to refine the proposed legislation. Key areas for future consideration include implementation timelines, exemptions for specialized equipment, and potential financial support for counties and agencies.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of adopting OSHA 1910 standards in New Hampshire’s public sector. While the bill seeks to enhance worker safety, significant concerns about financial burdens, implementation challenges, and the relevance of OSHA standards to public sector needs remain unresolved. Further collaboration and refinement of the legislation will be essential to balance safety improvements with practical feasibility.
