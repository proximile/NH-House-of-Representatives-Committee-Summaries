**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (09/26/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on September 26, 2023, to address several key issues related to vehicle inspections, driver's education, and window tinting regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting:

### **1. Vehicle Inspections and House Bill 646**
The committee focused on **House Bill 646**, which seeks to eliminate the **vehicle inspection mandate for non-commercial vehicles**. While a full repeal was not favored, the committee identified areas for improvement in the inspection program and decided to retain the bill for further work. Key discussion points included:
- **Clarifying Inspection Rules**: The committee aims to make inspection rules more objective, addressing subjective interpretations by inspection stations, such as failing vehicles for **rust on brake rotors** or **cosmetic damage** that does not affect safety.
- **Addressing Predatory Practices**: Concerns were raised about **predatory inspection shops** overselling unnecessary repairs. The committee discussed adding a **hotline or phone number** to inspection reports for consumer complaints and exploring stricter enforcement, including license revocation for repeated violations.
- **Exempting New Vehicles**: A proposal to exempt **brand-new vehicles** from inspections for the first year was considered, though this may be addressed in a separate bill.
- **Data on Complaints**: The committee acknowledged the lack of centralized data on inspection-related complaints and is working to centralize tracking for better oversight.
- **Safety Focus**: The committee emphasized that the inspection program should prioritize **safety** over revenue generation, citing examples of shops charging exorbitant fees for unnecessary repairs.
- **Environmental Compliance**: Any changes to inspection rules will ensure compliance with **air quality standards** and environmental regulations.

### **2. Driver's Education (HB 55 FN)**
The committee discussed **HB 55 FN**, focusing on making driver's education more accessible for 16-year-olds and addressing instructor shortages. Key points included:
- **Reduced Instructor Training Hours**: The Department of Safety proposed reducing required supervision hours for new instructors from 300 to 65 hours (30 classroom, 15 in-vehicle, and 20 mentoring hours) to increase recruitment and retention.
- **Scholarship Program**: A new driver's education scholarship fund is being developed to assist students who cannot afford the full cost of driver's education.
- **Parental Involvement**: The committee debated allowing parents to teach driver's education, with concerns raised about the quality of instruction and safety, particularly regarding motorcycles.
- **Hybrid System Proposal**: Some members suggested a hybrid system where parents could complete a shorter training course to teach their children, potentially reducing costs for families with multiple children.

### **3. Vehicle Window Tinting (HB 370 and HB 537)**
The committee reviewed proposed changes to state laws regarding vehicle window tinting, particularly focusing on medical waivers for darker tints. Key discussion points included:
- **Current and Proposed Standards**: Federal regulations require a minimum of 70% light transmittance for windshields and side windows. The committee considered lowering the allowable tint darkness for medical waivers from 35% to 50% transmittance, citing safety and enforcement concerns.
- **Medical Conditions**: The committee reviewed the list of medical conditions eligible for tint waivers, including lupus, melanoma, and photosensitivity, and debated whether the proposed 50% transmittance would adequately address these conditions.
- **Enforcement and Safety**: Law enforcement raised concerns about identifying vehicles with legal tint waivers and the safety risks of overly dark tints, especially at night. Suggestions included adding a notation to vehicle registrations to indicate a tint waiver.
- **Comparative State Standards**: The committee noted that many states allow tints as dark as 35% transmittance and considered aligning more closely with these standards while balancing safety concerns.
- **Administrative Simplification**: The committee aimed to clarify and simplify the language in relevant statutes to reduce confusion for citizens, law enforcement, and inspection stations.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to consolidate proposed changes into a single bill (HP 370) and forward it to the full committee for further consideration, including potential testimony from medical professionals and stakeholders.

### **Conclusion**
The committee concluded the meeting with plans for further subcommittee work on vehicle inspections, driver's education, and window tinting regulations. Key priorities include refining inspection rules to focus on safety and fairness, increasing accessibility and affordability of driver's education, and balancing the needs of individuals requiring medical tint waivers with public safety and enforcement practicality. The committee will reconvene to finalize decisions on these issues.
