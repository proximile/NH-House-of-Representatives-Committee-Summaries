The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee met on October 3, 2023, to discuss comprehensive reforms to the **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)** process, with a focus on improving efficiency, transparency, and expertise. The discussions centered on **House Bill 609** and its overlap with **HB 281**, which had recently been signed into law. Key themes and proposals emerged across three segments of the meeting:

### **SEC Structure and Membership**
1. **Size Reduction**: There was significant debate about reducing the SEC's size from nine to five members to address issues of member turnover ("churn") and improve continuity. Drew Bremer, the SEC administrator, highlighted the challenges of maintaining expertise with frequent changes in membership.
2. **Composition**: Proposals included restructuring the SEC to include the three Public Utilities Commission (PUC) commissioners, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Services (DES), and the Commissioner of the Department of Energy (DOE) or a public member. The role of public members was contentious, with some advocating for at least one public member to ensure representation, while others argued that public members added unnecessary complexity. Suggestions were made to require public members to have legal or land-use expertise.
3. **Administrative Changes**: The idea of moving the SEC under the PUC administrative umbrella was discussed to improve efficiency and resource sharing. This would involve transferring the SEC administrator to the PUC and potentially hiring additional staff to manage workload fluctuations.

### **Process Reforms**
1. **Streamlining for Existing Sites**: A key proposal was to create a separate, expedited track for projects at existing sites. Jim Monahan of the New England Power Generators suggested condensing public hearings and leveraging existing permits to reduce the timeline from 12-14 months to 6-8 months. This "special track" would avoid redundant reviews and reference existing environmental and land-use permits.
2. **Defining "Substantial Change"**: Clearer definitions of "substantial change" for existing facilities were debated, particularly regarding footprint, nameplate capacity, and investment thresholds. This would help determine whether a project requires SEC review or local planning board approval.
3. **One-Stop Shop Concept**: The idea of a "one-stop shop" for permitting was considered, though concerns were raised about overlapping federal and state regulatory authorities.

### **Public Involvement and Transparency**
1. **Public Participation**: Members emphasized the importance of public deliberation and transparency in SEC meetings. Suggestions included ensuring public access to decision-making processes and maintaining opportunities for public involvement.
2. **Professional Adjudication**: There was a focus on ensuring consistent and professional adjudication, with proposals to hire consultants for specific projects and clarify the roles of state agencies like the PUC and DES.

### **Funding and Resources**
1. **Self-Financing Model**: The SEC’s funding model was discussed, with most expenses currently covered by applicants. The removal of enforcement responsibilities from the SEC has reduced its workload, making it more likely that the SEC’s siting function could be self-financed. HB 281 allowed the DOE to charge applicants for monitoring and enforcement costs, but further funding mechanisms were considered.
2. **Staffing and Expertise**: Concerns were raised about the lack of expertise and resources within the SEC and DOE. Suggestions included hiring additional staff and leveraging existing state agency expertise.

### **Next Steps**
The subcommittee agreed to reconvene on October 17, 2023, to review a concrete proposal incorporating these changes. The proposal would focus on defining substantial change, creating a special track for site reuse, and potentially reducing the SEC's size. The committee also considered waiting to see how HB 281’s changes play out before making further reforms.

### **Overall Goals**
The meeting aimed to balance efficiency, expertise, and public representation in the SEC process. The proposed reforms sought to make the SEC process less cumbersome, lengthy, and costly while maintaining public accountability and ensuring consistent, professional adjudication. The committee emphasized the need for structural and procedural improvements to enhance the SEC’s effectiveness, particularly in handling projects at existing sites and maintaining continuity among its members.
