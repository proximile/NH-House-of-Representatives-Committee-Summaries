**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (October 17, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on October 17, 2023, to refine **House Bill 378**, which focuses on expanding and clarifying the rights of sexual assault survivors. The bill aims to ensure that survivors are fully informed of their rights, particularly regarding medical treatment, evidence collection, and consent during examinations. Key discussions and outcomes from the meeting include:

### **1. Clarifying Language and Intent**
The committee worked to ensure the bill’s language clearly communicates survivors’ rights to control their medical treatment and consent during examinations. This includes specifying which samples or tests a survivor consents to, emphasizing autonomy and reclaiming control after an assault. The bill also defines "sexual assault survivor" to include cases of non-penetrative assault and drugging for sexual purposes.

### **2. Addressing Current Gaps in Implementation**
Despite existing statutes (e.g., RSA 21-M18 and 21-M19) that outline survivors' rights, healthcare providers often fail to inform patients of these rights. The bill seeks to close this gap by mandating that providers inform survivors of their rights and the policies governing evidence collection. This includes the right to have evidence collected (e.g., rape kits) even in cases of non-penetrative sexual assault or drugging.

### **3. Proposed Changes**
The bill proposes three key changes:
   - Clarifying that survivors have the right to individual elements of a sexual assault evidence collection kit.
   - Defining "sexual assault survivor" to include non-penetrative assaults and drugging for sexual purposes.
   - Mandating that healthcare providers, law enforcement, and other entities inform survivors of their rights in writing.

### **4. Practical Implementation**
Representatives discussed the need for a simplified, one-page document outlining survivors' rights, as the current Attorney General's guidance is a 124-page document that providers rarely read. There was debate over whether to require a specific form or rely on existing mechanisms like memos from professional organizations. The committee emphasized that the bill aligns with existing best practices and ensures survivors are informed without overburdening providers, particularly in emergency rooms.

### **5. Focus on Survivor Control**
The bill emphasizes that survivors must give consent for each part of the exam, ensuring they retain control over their bodies. This is crucial to prevent survivors from feeling re-victimized during the evidence collection process.

### **6. Stakeholder Feedback and Legal Concerns**
The committee acknowledged previous opposition from the New Hampshire Association Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, attributing it to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the bill’s intent. They emphasized the need to ensure the bill is consistent with existing practices and addresses stakeholders' concerns. Legal and practical concerns were also raised, particularly around the wording potentially misleading or causing confusion, such as around drug testing and the scope of the bill.

### **7. Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations**
The bill also considers vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, who may not explicitly report assault but should still be informed of their rights.

### **8. Procedural Steps**
The committee planned to draft an amendment incorporating the refined language and solicit feedback from stakeholders by the following Monday. If no significant pushback is received, the bill would move to an executive session for further consideration.

### **9. Implementation**
The bill does not require formal rulemaking, as it builds on existing guidelines. Instead, it directs the Attorney General’s office to provide the updated information to healthcare providers, ensuring it is prominently available for survivors.

### **Overall Goal**
The committee aimed to create a clear, effective bill that supports survivors’ rights and autonomy while addressing practical and legal concerns raised during the discussion. The bill seeks to codify and simplify existing guidance to better serve survivors of sexual assault, ensuring they are aware of their rights and that healthcare providers consistently implement these rights.
