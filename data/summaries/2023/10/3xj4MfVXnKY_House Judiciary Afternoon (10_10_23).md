The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee meeting on October 10, 2023, focused on **House Bill 533**, which addresses public school human rights complaints. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to allow the Department of Education to file complaints on behalf of individuals aggrieved by discriminatory practices in schools or school districts, including retaliation.

2. **Subpoena Power Amendment**: Representative Lynn proposed an amendment to grant the Department of Education subpoena power for investigations, prompted by testimony from the Department of Education investigator, Richard Frel, who reported difficulties obtaining records from school districts in some cases.

3. **Concerns Raised**:
   - The Human Rights Commission expressed concerns about the bill, noting it would grant unprecedented power to the Department of Education, potentially complicating investigations due to anonymous complaints.
   - Some committee members, including Representative L, questioned the necessity of subpoena power, arguing that existing mechanisms, such as the Attorney Generalâ€™s office, already provide adequate oversight.
   - There were concerns about the bill being politically motivated and potentially overstepping into areas already covered by state law.

4. **Recommendation**: The subcommittee agreed to recommend **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** the bill, meaning they suggest it should not move forward. They acknowledged the existence of a pending Legislative Service Request (LSR) related to the subpoena power amendment, which could be addressed separately.

5. **Next Steps**: The subcommittee will present its recommendation to the full committee on November 8th, emphasizing that while they recognize the importance of addressing discrimination in schools, HB 533 is not the appropriate solution.

The meeting concluded with agreement on the recommendation and a call to further discuss the subpoena power issue in a separate bill.
