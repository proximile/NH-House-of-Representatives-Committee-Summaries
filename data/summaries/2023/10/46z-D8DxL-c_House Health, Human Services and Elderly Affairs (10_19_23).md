**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (10/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on October 19, 2023, to address critical challenges related to the implementation of new billing and service systems for developmental services. The meeting focused on the financial and operational disruptions caused by the transition to a conflict-free case management system and compliance with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements. Key discussions centered on **House Bill 608**, introduced by Representative Jess Edwards, which proposed pilot programs to test system changes before full implementation, though the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) did not adopt this approach. Below is a cohesive summary of the key issues and outcomes:

---

### **Key Challenges and Issues**

1. **Billing System Implementation**:
   - The transition to the new electronic billing system, implemented on July 1, 2023, has caused **significant delays in reimbursements** to service providers, leading to **cash flow crises**.
   - Manual billing has been used as a stopgap, with $87 million paid out through a combination of electronic and manual systems. However, providers are still only receiving **45 cents on the dollar** for services rendered, exacerbating financial strain.
   - Some area agencies are facing **deficits as high as $900,000**, with many relying on lines of credit or emergency funding to stay operational.

2. **Financial and Operational Stress**:
   - Providers, including area agencies and private vendors, are experiencing **acute financial stress**, with some considering **layoffs and service cuts**.
   - Emergency funding of **$1.6 million** was provided as a "bridge loan," but agencies must repay this by December 31, 2023, further compounding their financial burden.

3. **CMS Compliance**:
   - Concerns were raised about compliance with CMS requirements, particularly around **direct billing** and **electronic visit verification (EVV)**.
   - Representatives suggested exploring **flexibility or waivers** from CMS to ease the transition and stabilize the system.

4. **Lack of Pilot Programs**:
   - The failure to implement pilot programs for the new billing system led to **widespread chaos** and financial disruptions.
   - Representative Edwards and others emphasized the importance of piloting major system changes, such as EVV and rate adjustments, to avoid similar issues in the future.

### **Proposed Solutions and Legislative Oversight**

1. **Repurposing House Bill 608**:
   - The committee discussed repurposing HB 608 to **mandate pilot programs** for future system changes, including EVV and rate adjustments, as part of the Alvarez and Marcel plan (a five-step process for system reform).
   - Concerns were raised about the **scope of the bill** and the need for **proper notice** if it is repurposed for different programs.

2. **Financial Interventions**:
   - Suggestions included using **state funds** to temporarily backfill CMS requirements and stabilize the system.
   - The fiscal committee could potentially reallocate funds within the existing budget, but any such request must originate from the executive branch (DHHS).

3. **Delaying Further Changes**:
   - The committee considered delaying upcoming system changes, such as EVV and rate adjustments, to focus on resolving the current billing crisis.

4. **Legislative Oversight**:
   - The committee emphasized its role in ensuring DHHS and the Bureau of Developmental Services (BDS) take a more **measured approach** to implementation, including requiring pilot programs through legislation.

### **Next Steps and Future Planning**

1. **Additional Meetings and Information Gathering**:
   - The committee agreed to hold at least one more meeting to gather additional feedback from providers, the associate commissioner, and other stakeholders.
   - Plans were made to explore **reallocating funds** to support providers during the transition.

2. **Communication and Transparency**:
   - Representatives stressed the need for **better communication** with stakeholders, including families, providers, and agencies, to address concerns and ensure transparency throughout the process.

3. **Long-Term System Reform**:
   - The committee discussed requiring **pilot programs for each phase** of the Alvarez and Marcel plan to prevent future disruptions and ensure smoother transitions.

### **Key Takeaways**

- The transition to the new billing system has caused **significant financial and operational challenges** for providers, with delayed reimbursements and cash flow crises threatening the sustainability of vital services.
- **Pilot programs** are essential for testing major system changes before full implementation to avoid disruptions.
- The committee is considering **repurposing HB 608** to mandate pilot programs for upcoming changes, but procedural and financial hurdles remain.
- Immediate action is needed to stabilize the system, including potential **financial interventions**, **delaying further changes**, and ensuring **legislative oversight** to guide the transition effectively.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexity of the transition and the need for **careful planning**, **pilot testing**, and **stakeholder engagement** to address ongoing challenges and ensure the system works effectively for all involved.
