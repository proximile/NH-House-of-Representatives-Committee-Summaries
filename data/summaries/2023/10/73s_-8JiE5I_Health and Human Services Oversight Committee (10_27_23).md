**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (10/27/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on October 27, 2023, addressed a wide range of topics, showcasing progress in mental health, Medicaid, dental care, and public health initiatives while highlighting ongoing challenges and future priorities. Key discussions and updates included:

### **Mental Health Plan and Workforce Development**
- **10-Year Mental Health Plan Update**: The Division for Behavioral Health presented significant progress, including the New Hampshire Rapid Response Crisis System, which has handled over 40,000 calls and deployed mobile crisis teams more than 9,000 times since June 2022. The expansion of Critical Time Intervention, which supports adults transitioning from hospitals to the community, was also highlighted.  
- **Prevention and Early Intervention**: Efforts to address Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) included Medicaid-approved wraparound services for children aged birth to five and their caregivers.  
- **Workforce Development**: Initiatives to combat workforce shortages included partnerships with colleges to create new career pathways, certifications for peer specialists and crisis responders, and training programs to improve retention and job satisfaction in mental health centers.  

### **Public Awareness Campaign on Alzheimer’s**
Wendy Alman, Bureau Chief for Elderly and Adult Services, discussed a $500,000 public awareness campaign on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, funded by House Bill 2. The campaign, set to launch in 2024, will include multi-modal outreach (TV, radio, social media), focus groups, and collaboration with stakeholders like the Alzheimer’s Association. Legislators raised concerns about potential redundancy with existing public health efforts and emphasized alignment with Public Health’s mission for sustainability.

### **Medicaid Unwind and Redetermination Efforts**
Henry Lipman, the state’s Medicaid director, provided updates on the Medicaid unwind process, which involves re-evaluating eligibility for Medicaid recipients following the end of the federal COVID-19 public health emergency. Outreach efforts, including pink and yellow letter campaigns, phone calls, and collaboration with Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and community mental health centers, were emphasized. Challenges included communication gaps, understaffing, and ensuring vulnerable populations, such as nursing home residents, retain coverage.  

### **Adult Dental Benefit Program**
Dr. Sarah Finny, Medicaid Dental Director, reported on the successful implementation of the adult dental benefit program, which has served over 8,000 unique members since its launch in April 2023. Recruitment efforts have enrolled 20 of 39 oral surgeons in the state, and mobile dental clinics were deployed to underserved areas. Concerns about no-show rates and provider compensation were addressed, with ongoing efforts to improve appointment adherence and care management.

### **Legislative Review and Subcommittee Nominations**
- The committee reviewed legislative items passed in the previous session that require reporting or action, noting the increasing workload and the need for more time or additional meetings.  
- Jay Gupta, director of Pharmacy and Integrative Health at HarborCare, was nominated to serve on a subcommittee focused on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, with Representative Merchant praising his extensive background and contributions to pharmacy and patient care.  

### **Workplace Safety and DHHS Updates**
- The committee discussed the transfer of responsibility for workplace safety in clinical settings from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to the Department of Labor, suggesting legislative tweaks may be needed to formalize the process.  
- DHHS Commissioner Lori Shibinette introduced Jeff Fler, the new Deputy Commissioner for the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). Fler outlined his vision for improving the juvenile justice system and reducing reliance on residential placements for children.  

### **Medicaid Unwind and Behavioral Health Challenges**
Kendall Snow, a former representative and social worker, addressed the committee about the challenges faced by mental health centers due to the Medicaid unwind, which has led to lost revenue as individuals are re-evaluated for eligibility. Snow suggested mitigating the impact by waiving certain maintenance of effort requirements and improving inter-agency communication. Representative Merchant raised concerns about the loss of Medicaid eligibility affecting access to pharmaceutical care for mental health patients, particularly those relying on medication for persistent mental illness.

### **Future Meetings**
The next meeting is scheduled for November 17, 2023, with updates on complaint protocols, waitlists for developmental disabilities, and patient transportation issues. Additional meetings may extend by 30 minutes to accommodate discussions, and a potential session in December was also discussed.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the state’s progress in mental health services, Medicaid redetermination, and dental care, while highlighting the complexities of managing healthcare and social services. Key challenges included workforce shortages, communication gaps, and the impact of the Medicaid unwind on vulnerable populations. The committee emphasized the need for continued collaboration, legislative oversight, and alignment with public health goals to ensure sustainable and effective service delivery.
