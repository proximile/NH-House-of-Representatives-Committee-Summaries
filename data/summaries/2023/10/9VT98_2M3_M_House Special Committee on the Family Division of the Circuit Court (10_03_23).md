**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (10/03/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on October 3, 2023, for a full committee work session and a subcommittee meeting focused on judicial training, education, supervision, and accountability. The meeting brought together members of the judiciary, including Administrative Judge David King and other judges, to discuss the challenges facing the Family Division and explore potential legislative solutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions:

---

### **1. Challenges in the Family Division**
The Family Division of the Circuit Court handles a high volume of cases, including marital disputes, parenting cases, domestic violence, guardianship, and abuse/neglect matters. Key challenges highlighted include:
- **High Caseloads**: Approximately 7,000 new marital and parenting cases are filed annually, with additional reopened cases.
- **Self-Represented Litigants**: 85% of litigants are self-represented, creating complexities in navigating court processes and applying evidentiary standards.
- **Staffing Shortages**: Over 70 positions in the Circuit Court remain vacant due to low salaries and demanding workloads, despite the legislature approving 31 new positions.
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited funding for essential services like Guardian ad Litem (GAL) investigations, parenting coordinators, and mental health evaluations restricts the court’s ability to address high-conflict cases effectively.

---

### **2. Judicial Training, Education, and Accountability**
Judicial training was a central focus, with discussions emphasizing the need for:
- **Onboarding and Ongoing Training**: Tailored training for new judges, continuous education for existing judges, and specialized training in areas like domestic violence and probate law.
- **Accountability Measures**: Regular judicial evaluations, audio reviews of hearings, and feedback mechanisms to address complaints and ensure high standards of conduct.
- **Secondary Trauma Support**: Judges and staff face emotional tolls from handling traumatic cases, necessitating mental health support and respite opportunities through case rotation.
- **Training Resources**: The judiciary expressed a need for a dedicated training coordinator, law clerks, and external experts to enhance the quality and efficiency of judicial orders.

---

### **3. Domestic Violence and High-Conflict Cases**
The committee explored the complexities of domestic violence and high-conflict parenting cases, noting:
- **Domestic Violence Proceedings**: Cases often involve protective orders and require evidence of a protected relationship, a prohibited act, and a credible threat. Judges provide Fifth Amendment warnings due to potential criminal proceedings.
- **High-Conflict Parenting**: Judges aim to reduce adversarial dynamics by avoiding terms like "custody" and "visitation" and promoting parenting plans. However, cases where parents cannot communicate effectively remain challenging.
- **Resource Gaps**: Financial barriers limit access to GALs, parenting coordinators, and mental health services, which are critical for resolving disputes and protecting children’s best interests.

---

### **4. Procedural Fairness and Accessibility**
Efforts to improve court processes and accessibility for litigants were discussed, including:
- **Simplified Forms**: Ongoing work to simplify court forms, particularly for pro se litigants, through guided interviews and ADA-compliant designs.
- **Evidentiary Standards**: While the Rules of Evidence are relaxed in family court, varying burdens of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence vs. clear and convincing evidence) create challenges in ensuring fairness.
- **Public Input**: Collaboration with the Access to Justice Commission and public feedback mechanisms to enhance user experience and procedural fairness.

---

### **5. Gender Diversity and Representation**
The committee acknowledged progress in gender diversity within the judiciary, with women now comprising 47% of the full-time bench in the Circuit Court, surpassing the 37% representation in the New Hampshire Bar. This was attributed to recent appointments by Governor Sununu.

---

### **6. Proposed Solutions and Legislative Collaboration**
Judges and committee members discussed potential legislative and systemic reforms, including:
- **Increased Funding**: Addressing staffing shortages, enhancing training programs, and providing mental health resources within the court system.
- **Triage Systems**: Experimenting with triage systems in smaller counties to streamline case management.
- **Collaborative Efforts**: Strengthening dialogue between the judiciary and legislature to address procedural inconsistencies and improve the quality of justice.

---

### **7. Historical Context and Future Directions**
Judge David King provided historical context on the evolution of judicial training in New Hampshire, noting the transition from part-time judges to a more structured Circuit Court system. The increasing complexity of cases, particularly in probate and family law, underscores the need for sustained investment in training and resources.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the significant challenges facing the Family Division, including resource constraints, staffing shortages, and the complexities of handling domestic violence and high-conflict cases. The committee emphasized the need for enhanced training, accountability, and legislative support to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the court system. By addressing these issues, the judiciary aims to better serve families and children while maintaining public trust in the judicial process.
