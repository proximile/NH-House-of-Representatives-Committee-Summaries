### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Meeting (10/11/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 11, 2023, focused on **House Bill 229 (HB 229)**, which seeks to restrict the deployment of the New Hampshire National Guard into active combat without a formal declaration of war by Congress. The discussions spanned multiple segments, addressing the bill’s intent, potential impacts, constitutional considerations, and stakeholder perspectives. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

#### **1. Bill Intent and Background**
HB 229 aims to restore trust in governmental institutions by ensuring National Guard members are not deployed into active combat unless Congress formally declares war, a process that has not occurred in 82 years. The bill is designed to protect National Guard members, who cannot control deployments for broader military branches. Supporters argue that the bill reinforces constitutional checks and balances, as Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to declare war. The bill is bipartisan, with both Democratic and Republican representatives advocating for greater congressional oversight over military deployments.

#### **2. Key Concerns and Proposed Amendments**
- **Language of the Bill**: Representative Diane Power raised concerns about **line 17** of the bill, which defines active duty combat as the "performance of a duty through an instrumentality of war." She argued this could unintentionally restrict essential National Guard functions, such as training, humanitarian assistance, and the State Partnership Program with foreign countries.  
- **Proposed Amendment**: Representative Power proposed deleting **line 17** to prevent unintended consequences. Colonel Eric Power, a retired Air Force officer, supported the amendment, emphasizing the National Guard’s dual mission of supporting both state and federal needs.  
- **Amendment Outcome**: The amendment failed with 8 votes in favor and 11 against, leaving the original language intact.

#### **3. Stakeholder Testimony and Opposition**
- **State Veterans Advisory Committee (SVAC)**: Kevin Grady, representing the SVAC, testified that the committee unanimously opposes HB 229. He argued that the National Guard operates under **Title 10 of U.S. law**, which governs the activation of reserve forces, and that Guard members are essential to national defense. Grady stressed that changes to activation rules should be made at the federal level, not the state level.  
- **Veterans’ Perspectives**: While some veterans supported the bill, citing concerns about unnecessary deployments and exploitation, others opposed it, fearing it could compromise national security and limit the Guard’s flexibility.  
- **Historical Context**: Representatives referenced historical conflicts like the Korean War, Vietnam War, and post-9/11 operations, highlighting the lack of formal war declarations and the impact on veterans, including high suicide rates.  

---

#### **4. Recruitment and Deployment Concerns**
- **Recruitment Challenges**: Representatives acknowledged the difficulty in recruiting for the National Guard, attributing part of the issue to the potential for deployment, which deters some individuals.  
- **Deployment’s Role**: While some argued that deployment has a "chilling effect" on recruitment, others emphasized that deployment is a fundamental part of military service and essential for national defense.  

---

#### **5. Constitutional and Practical Considerations**
- **War Powers**: The bill is framed as a way to ensure compliance with the U.S. Constitution, specifically Article I, Section 8. Supporters argue that requiring a formal declaration of war ensures transparency and accountability, allowing the public to hold elected officials responsible for military decisions.  
- **State vs. Federal Authority**: The discussion touched on the balance between state and federal authority over the National Guard. Some emphasized the need for the Guard to remain a state-focused force while still being available for federal missions.  

---

#### **6. Broader Implications**
- **Military-Industrial Complex**: Some representatives referenced President Truman’s warning about the military-industrial complex, suggesting the bill addresses concerns about the misuse of military power for economic or political gain.  
- **Domestic and International Missions**: Opponents of the bill highlighted the Guard’s critical role in both domestic emergencies (e.g., Hurricane Katrina) and international conflicts, arguing that HB 229 could undermine its ability to respond effectively.  

---

#### **7. Voting and Next Steps**
- **Committee Vote**: The committee voted on the original bill, resulting in a 10-10 tie. This means the bill will proceed to the Full House without a committee recommendation.  
- **Future Discussions**: The committee acknowledged the need for further discussion on military funding, recruitment incentives, and veterans’ mental health services, with another bill on these topics expected in January.  

---

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing state and federal responsibilities, protecting veterans’ interests, and ensuring the National Guard’s readiness for both domestic and international missions. HB 229 sparked significant debate over the constitutional process for declaring war, the Guard’s dual mission, and the broader implications of military deployment decisions. The bill’s fate will now be decided by the Full House, with continued discussions expected on related issues.
