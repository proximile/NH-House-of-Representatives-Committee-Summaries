The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 11, 2023, focused on **HB 229**, a bill aimed at restricting the deployment of the New Hampshire National Guard into active combat zones without a formal declaration of war by Congress. The discussion, which spanned multiple segments, highlighted deep divisions over the bill’s implications for state and federal authority, the National Guard’s dual mission, and the constitutional oversight of military deployments.

### Key Points of Discussion:

1. **Bill Overview**:
   - **HB 229** seeks to ensure that the National Guard is not deployed into combat without a formal declaration of war by Congress. It emphasizes congressional responsibility over executive authority in military decisions.

2. **Amendments and Language Concerns**:
   - An amendment was proposed to remove the phrase "performance of a duty through an instrumentality of war" from the bill, which opponents argued could unintentionally restrict training and humanitarian missions abroad. The amendment failed with **11 opposed** and **8 in favor**.
   - Concerns were raised about the bill’s wording potentially impacting the Guard’s state partnership programs (e.g., with El Salvador and Cabo Verde) and its ability to conduct training and assistance missions.

3. **Debate on the Bill**:
   - **Supporters** argued that the bill would protect National Guard members from being sent into conflicts without clear national security interests, citing the psychological toll of wars like Iraq and Afghanistan and the high veteran suicide rate. They emphasized the need for constitutional oversight and accountability in military decisions.
   - **Opponents**, including veterans and representatives, expressed concerns that the bill could compromise national security, limit the Guard’s ability to respond to emergencies, and disrupt its integration into federal defense efforts. They highlighted the Guard’s dual mission—supporting both state emergencies (e.g., natural disasters) and federal military operations—and argued that the bill could create inconsistencies with federal law and deter recruitment.

4. **Veteran Perspectives**:
   - Several veterans shared personal experiences, including deployments to conflicts like Desert Storm and Iraq, to underscore the Guard’s importance in both wartime and peacetime operations. They criticized past wars as lacking clear purpose and contributing to veteran suffering.
   - **Kevin Grady**, representing the State Veterans Advisory Committee (SVAC), opposed the bill, arguing that the National Guard is integral to national defense and operates under federal law, which allows for activation without a formal war declaration.

5. **Historical and Constitutional Context**:
   - The discussion touched on the evolution of military deployments, noting that the U.S. has not formally declared war since World War II but has engaged in numerous conflicts under authorizations like the 2001 AUMF (Authorization for Use of Military Force). Participants debated whether these authorizations comply with the Constitution’s war powers clause.
   - Some representatives referenced President Truman’s warning about the military-industrial complex, suggesting the bill could curb the misuse of military power for non-essential conflicts.

6. **Voting Outcomes**:
   - The **motion to ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**, which would have effectively killed the bill, failed with **12 opposed** and **8 in favor**.
   - The **motion to OTP (Ought to Pass)**, recommending the bill’s passage, resulted in a **10-10 tie**, allowing the bill to proceed to the Full House for further consideration.

7. **Final Decision and Committee Plans**:
   - The committee ultimately decided against recommending the bill for further consideration, though it will proceed to the Full House due to the tie vote on the OTP motion.
   - The committee discussed upcoming announcements, including a presentation by Stella Laro from the Veterans Administration on mental health services available to veterans, tentatively scheduled for January.

### Key Takeaways:
- **HB 229** seeks to restrict National Guard deployments to instances of a formal declaration of war, sparking debate over the Guard’s role, state-federal relations, and constitutional war powers.
- Opponents argued that the bill could hinder the Guard’s effectiveness in both federal and state missions, while supporters emphasized the need for congressional oversight and accountability.
- The discussion highlighted the Guard’s dual mission, historical context of military deployments, and concerns about the bill’s potential impact on national security, recruitment, and morale.
- The bill will proceed to the Full House for further debate, with the committee acknowledging the need for continued discussion and potential amendments to address unintended consequences.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of balancing state and federal authority, the importance of the National Guard’s dual mission, and the ongoing debate over the constitutional oversight of military deployments.
