The New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee meeting on October 6, 2023, focused on pressing issues within the state’s criminal justice system, particularly bail processes, pretrial programs, and law enforcement coordination. The discussions highlighted systemic inefficiencies, resource challenges, and the need for reform to improve public safety and outcomes for individuals involved in the justice system. Key points from the meeting include:

### **Bail System and Pretrial Challenges**
1. **Revolving Door of Bail**: Concerns were raised about the "revolving door" of individuals being released on bail, often without significant consequences, leading to repeat offenses. Restraining orders and bail conditions were criticized as ineffective due to a lack of enforcement, enabling further criminal activity.
2. **Bail Process and Shortages**: The bail process involves bail commissioners determining conditions such as cash bail, personal recognizance (PR), or preventive detention. A significant issue is the **shortage of bail commissioners**, attributed to inadequate payment and reimbursement for their services. Additionally, bail decisions are inconsistent due to the absence of a standardized matrix, leading to disparities in outcomes.
3. **Pretrial Programs**: While pretrial programs, such as electronic monitoring, are effective, they are costly and labor-intensive. Rockingham County’s pretrial program was highlighted as a model, but liability concerns remain, as jails bear responsibility for monitoring rather than the courts.

### **Law Enforcement and Resource Challenges**
4. **Small Town Struggles**: Small towns and police departments with limited resources face difficulties, particularly in transporting prisoners to jails. While some counties, like Rockingham and Carroll, have partnerships or sheriff departments to assist, smaller towns often struggle with logistics and staffing.
5. **Mental Health and Substance Abuse**: Nearly 99% of incoming inmates have substance abuse or mental health issues. Jails provide 24/7 medical and mental health screenings, but treatment is often delayed as inmates must stabilize first. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated overdoses and mental health crises, further straining resources.
6. **Repeat Offenders**: Frustration was expressed over repeat offenders who violate bail conditions (e.g., committing new crimes or failing drug tests) without immediate consequences. The system lacks efficient mechanisms to track and address these violations.

### **Proposals for Systemic Reform**
7. **Study Commission**: A proposal was made for a study commission or "law enforcement summit" to address systemic issues in the criminal justice system. This initiative would bring together sheriffs, police, judges, and other stakeholders to create a more uniform and efficient system.
8. **Community-Based Solutions**: Superintendent Henry of Rockingham County Jail advocated for more **community resources**, such as mental health crisis centers, to divert individuals from jails and reduce recidivism. He also suggested that counties could benefit from greater control over probation and post-release programs.
9. **Diversion Programs**: Representative Rhodes shared positive experiences with diversion programs in Cheshire County, including drug and youth diversion initiatives, and offered to provide budget details for committee review.

### **Costs and Future Plans**
10. **Funding Challenges**: Jails incur significant costs for medical care, mental health services, and pretrial monitoring, with no clear mechanism for reimbursement from the state or federal government. These financial burdens highlight the need for better funding and resource allocation.
11. **Next Steps**: The committee planned to hold public hearings and review pretrial program costs and best practices. Final witness testimony would be heard by October 20, with recommendations to be submitted by early November.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for systemic reform in New Hampshire’s criminal justice system. Key areas for improvement include addressing the inefficiencies of the bail process, enhancing pretrial programs, providing better support for law enforcement, and investing in community-based solutions for mental health and substance abuse. Collaboration among stakeholders, standardized practices, and increased funding were identified as critical steps toward creating a more effective and equitable system that prioritizes public safety and rehabilitation.
