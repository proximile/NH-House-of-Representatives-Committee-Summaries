The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee held a subcommittee work session on **House Bill 406**, which pertains to parental access to children's medical records. The session focused on making recommendations to the full committee, which would then decide whether to advance the bill when the House reconvenes in January.

**Key Points Discussed:**

1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to ensure parents have access to their children's medical records, particularly addressing concerns raised by parents who received letters from hospitals stating they would lose access to their child’s medical portal once the child turns 12. This was seen as an infringement on parental rights.

2. **Complexity of the Issue**: The issue is complicated by federal (HIPAA) and state laws that restrict access to certain medical records, such as those related to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or other sensitive treatments for minors. Hospitals currently face challenges in filtering sensitive information in patient portals, leading some to shut off parental access entirely at age 12 to comply with privacy laws.

3. **Technical Challenges**: Electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic health record (EHR) systems are not currently equipped to distinguish between information that parents should and should not see. Updating these systems would require significant time and resources, with no clear federal guidance on how to proceed.

4. **Information Blocking Rule**: The federal information blocking rule, which prevents healthcare providers from withholding patient records, has a carve-out acknowledging the technical limitations of current systems. This allows hospitals to shut off parental portal access without violating the rule.

5. **Committee Concerns**: Some committee members expressed frustration with the lack of parental access to portals but acknowledged the technical and legal complexities. Others argued that HIPAA already provides parents with access to their children’s records, making the bill potentially redundant.

6. **Recommendation**: After discussion, the subcommittee voted unanimously (4-0) to recommend **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**, effectively killing the bill in its current form. Members agreed that while the issue is important, the bill is not ready for implementation due to technical and regulatory challenges. They suggested further study or federal-level solutions to address the problem.

**Outcome**: The subcommittee concluded that the bill is not currently feasible but emphasized the need for continued dialogue and potential future legislation to resolve the issue of parental access to children's medical records.
