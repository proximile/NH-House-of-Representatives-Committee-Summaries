The NH House of Representatives meeting focused on several bills related to criminal justice and public safety. Here are the key points discussed:

1. **House Bill 144**: The committee discussed a bill related to firearm rights for felons. Representatives noted that there is already a process in place (annulment) for restoring firearm rights for non-violent offenders. However, concerns were raised about the billâ€™s effectiveness, especially since state courts have no authority over federal courts, which could still restrict firearm rights. The committee ultimately voted to recommend the bill be "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL).

2. **House Bill 512**: This bill aimed to exempt firearms manufactured in New Hampshire from federal laws and regulations. A representative shared insights from a class at the Sig Sauer Academy, highlighting that manufacturers like Sig Sauer would not risk their federal licenses by selling firearms without following federal processes, even if the bill passed. The committee voted to recommend the bill be ITL due to potential conflicts with federal regulations and the risks to manufacturers.

3. **House Bill 344**: The bill proposed legalizing the home cultivation of marijuana for personal use. Concerns were raised about the lack of provisions for apartment dwellers, potential contamination risks (e.g., fentanyl), and the impact on federally subsidized housing. One co-sponsor reportedly did not support the bill, citing missing protections and guidelines. The committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill be ITL, noting the need for more comprehensive legislation.

The meeting concluded with a short recess after the votes.
