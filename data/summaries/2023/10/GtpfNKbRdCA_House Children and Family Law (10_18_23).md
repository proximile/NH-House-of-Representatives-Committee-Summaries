### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Children and Family Law Meeting (10/18/23)

On October 18, 2023, the New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Subcommittee convened to discuss **House Bill 535**, which focuses on child protection statutes and the appointment of legal counsel for children in abuse and neglect cases. The meeting centered on proposed amendments aimed at expanding the court's discretion to appoint attorneys for children at any stage of proceedings, particularly for those at risk of or already placed in residential facilities. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing children’s rights, resource limitations, and administrative feasibility. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and debates from the meeting:

### **Key Discussion Points**

1. **Legal Representation for Children**  
   - There was strong agreement that children in residential facilities or at risk of placement should have access to legal counsel.  
   - The debate centered on whether attorney appointments should be **discretionary** (judges decide based on need) or **mandatory** (required by law). Currently, appointments are tied to dispositional orders, which typically occur within 30 days of a case filing.  
   - Proposed amendments sought to allow any party to request an attorney for a child at any point in the proceedings, particularly for children in residential placements or at imminent risk of placement.  

2. **Adjudicatory Hearings**  
   - A significant debate arose over whether children and their attorneys should participate in **adjudicatory hearings**, where decisions about abuse or neglect are made.  
   - **CASA New Hampshire** argued that involving children in these hearings could be harmful, especially in cases of abuse or neglect.  
   - Others, including representatives from the **Disability Rights Center**, emphasized the importance of children’s voices being heard and respected in legal proceedings.  
   - Judges were seen as capable of determining the best course of action on a case-by-case basis.  

3. **Resource Constraints**  
   - A major concern was the lack of resources to support the proposed legislation, including a shortage of trained attorneys and foster families.  
   - **CASA New Hampshire** and the **Judiciary** highlighted the challenges of mandatory appointments if there are insufficient resources or attorneys available, particularly in rural areas.  
   - The discussion emphasized the need for adequate funding and training to ensure the policy’s effectiveness.  

4. **Emergency Situations and Placements**  
   - The group debated how to define "emergency" situations where children might need immediate placement or legal representation.  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential trauma to children waiting for placements and the need for timely legal representation.  
   - The process for emergency placements and assessments (e.g., CANs and CAT assessments) was examined, with a focus on ensuring children’s rights are protected during these critical moments.  

5. **Foster Care Bill of Rights**  
   - The amendments proposed updating the **Foster Care Children’s Bill of Rights** to include the right to request an attorney, ensuring children are informed of their expanded rights.  

6. **Massachusetts Model**  
   - The experience in **Massachusetts**, where all children in the child protection system are assigned attorneys from the start, was referenced as a potential model.  
   - However, it was noted that New Hampshire’s system may require adjustments to accommodate similar practices, particularly given resource constraints.  

7. **Financial Concerns and Implementation**  
   - Significant discussion revolved around the financial implications of implementing the bill, particularly the cost of appointing attorneys to represent children.  
   - There were suggestions to explore federal funding through the **Social Security Act** and to phase in mandatory appointments, starting with discretionary appointments in 2024 and moving to mandatory appointments in 2025 to allow time to build resources.  
   - The judiciary sought clearer guidance from the legislature on how to implement the proposed changes, particularly regarding the balance between a child’s expressed interests and their best interests.  

8. **Study Committee and Policy vs. Funding**  
   - There was debate about establishing a **study committee** to examine the financial and logistical aspects of the bill. Some members argued that this would provide a clearer understanding of costs and ensure all entities are represented, while others worried it could delay implementation and leave children’s needs unmet.  
   - Some representatives advocated for passing the policy first and then addressing funding through the **Finance Committee**, emphasizing the importance of setting a clear policy direction. Others cautioned against passing a bill without guaranteed funding, as it may render the policy ineffective.  

9. **Consensus and Next Steps**  
   - The committee reached partial consensus on the need to improve legal representation for children but acknowledged the challenges of resource allocation and funding.  
   - The **CASA amendment** was agreed upon as a first step, with additional consideration of a study committee to address financial and logistical details.  
   - The goal is to present recommendations to the full committee by **October 31, 2023**, with potential implementation phased in to align with budget cycles (e.g., July 2025).

### **Overall Themes and Challenges**

- **Balancing Rights and Resources**: The discussions underscored the importance of protecting children’s rights while addressing the practical challenges of resource limitations and administrative feasibility.  
- **Judicial Discretion**: There was broad agreement that judges should have the discretion to appoint attorneys when needed, without being constrained by specific timeframes or procedural stages.  
- **Urgency vs. Practicality**: While there was a strong sense of urgency to address the needs of vulnerable children, the committee recognized the importance of ensuring that the policy is financially sustainable and effectively implemented.  

The meeting highlighted the complexity of crafting legislation to protect vulnerable children in New Hampshire, with a focus on immediate, feasible steps while planning for more comprehensive changes in the future.
