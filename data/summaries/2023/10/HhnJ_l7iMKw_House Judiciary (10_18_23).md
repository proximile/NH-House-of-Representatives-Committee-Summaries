The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee subcommittee meeting on October 18, 2023, focused on **House Bill 396**, which addresses state recognition of biological sex in areas such as athletics, incarceration, and private spaces. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and an acknowledgment of a quorum, though some representatives were absent.

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to provide clarity on the classification of individuals based on biological sex, particularly in public facilities, sports, and prisons. It asserts that such classification is reasonable and does not constitute discrimination under state law.

2. **Public Testimony**:
   - **Lind Jake House**, a transgender advocate and co-founder of 603 Equality, opposed the bill, arguing it sends a harmful message by prioritizing biological sex over gender identity. They highlighted the bipartisan support for New Hampshire’s 2018 transgender non-discrimination law and emphasized the importance of inclusion for transgender individuals in public spaces, sports, and incarceration facilities.
   - **Courtney Reid**, representing the ACLU of New Hampshire, echoed concerns that the bill undermines existing protections for transgender individuals and could lead to invasive surveillance or exclusion in public facilities and prisons.

3. **Sponsor’s Perspective**: **Representative Jim Kofalt**, the bill’s prime sponsor, defended the legislation, stating it is necessary to address confusion in the law, particularly in school districts. He argued that the bill respects privacy, modesty, and safety, especially for young students, and does not intend to be hostile toward transgender individuals.

4. **Amendments**: Two amendments were discussed:
   - The **Lynn Amendment** focused on athletic competitions, emphasizing physical strength and speed as factors for classification.
   - The **Perez Amendment** expanded the bill’s scope to include private organizations and reinforced the state’s commitment to treating all individuals with dignity while allowing for biological sex classification in certain contexts.

5. **Committee Discussion**:
   - Representatives debated the bill’s intent, with some supporting it as a common-sense measure to protect privacy and safety, while others viewed it as exclusionary and harmful to transgender individuals.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential impact on intersex individuals and the broader implications for transgender rights.

6. **Vote**: The subcommittee voted 3 to 1 to recommend the bill, as amended by the Perez Amendment, to the full Judiciary Committee for further consideration.

### Outcome:
The subcommittee decided to move the bill forward to the full Judiciary Committee, with the Perez Amendment included, to allow for further debate and potential amendments. The motion to close the meeting was approved, concluding the session.
