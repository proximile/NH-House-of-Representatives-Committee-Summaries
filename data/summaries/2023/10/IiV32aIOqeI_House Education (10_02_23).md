### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (October 2, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on October 2, 2023, to discuss a range of critical education issues, including state assessments, literacy instruction, and legislative updates aimed at improving educational outcomes. The meeting was divided into three main segments, each focusing on specific aspects of education policy and reform.

#### Segment 1: State Assessment and Accountability Systems
The first segment centered on New Hampshire’s assessment and accountability systems under the **Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)**. Key discussions included:

1. **Test Question Analysis**: Representatives emphasized the importance of analyzing test questions for fairness and appropriateness, particularly for diverse student groups. Biased or unfair questions are removed and replaced for future assessments.
   
2. **Federal Compliance**: The state must meet federal requirements, including providing evidence of test analysis to the U.S. Department of Education and evaluating performance across demographic groups such as gender and ethnicity.

3. **Graduation Rates**: The state uses a four-year cohort model to calculate graduation rates, excluding students who graduate in five or more years or earn alternative credentials like GEDs. There was debate over whether the state’s graduation rate threshold (currently 67%) should align with federal standards.

4. **School Support and Funding**: The committee discussed identifying **Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI)** and **Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI)** schools. CSI schools, the lowest-performing, receive federal funds, but non-Title I schools in need of assistance lack additional state support.

5. **Proficiency Standards**: The committee addressed the removal of an unrealistic statute requiring all students to be proficient by a specific year, shifting the focus to student growth and progress toward proficiency.

6. **Legislative Amendments**: Amendments were proposed to streamline and clarify state education laws, particularly around accountability and assessments. The committee agreed to move forward with a targeted amendment rather than overhauling the entire system.

7. **Teacher Shortage**: The segment concluded with a reminder about an upcoming committee meeting focused on addressing the teacher shortage.

#### Segment 2: Evidence-Based Reading Instruction and State Assessments
The second segment focused on **evidence-based reading instruction** and updates to state assessments. Key points included:

1. **Reading Instruction**: The Department of Education will provide guidance on research-based instructional materials, emphasizing local control over mandates. Concerns were raised about the **three-cueing system**, which some argue is harmful to students with reading deficiencies. The proposed bill mandates **universal screening** (three times a year for K-3 students) and the use of **science of reading-based methods** for K-5 students.

2. **State Assessments**: Updates to state assessments align with ESSA, including testing in **grades 3-8** and once in high school, with science assessments in **grades 5, 8, and 11**. The **minimum group size (n=11)** for public reporting was reaffirmed to protect student privacy, though this can limit data visibility for small, rural districts.

3. **Alternative Assessments**: Districts can pursue alternative assessments (e.g., **Iowa Test of Basic Skills**) but must seek state and federal approval to retain **Title I funding**. The **PACE program** was highlighted as an approved alternative.

4. **Teacher Preparation**: Concerns were raised about teacher prep programs still teaching **balanced literacy** alongside the science of reading, leading to inconsistent instruction. Funding and support were emphasized for transitioning from outdated materials (e.g., **Lucy Calkins**) to evidence-based resources.

5. **Public Input and Accountability**: A **roundtable discussion** was suggested to gather educator and stakeholder insights. The importance of **data-driven decision-making** and ensuring assessments inform instructional improvements was stressed.

6. **Broader Context**: The decline in **NAEP scores** during the COVID-19 pandemic was noted, but caution was advised against over-reliance on pandemic-era data.

#### Segment 3: House Bill 437 and Literacy Education Reforms
The final segment focused on **House Bill 437**, which aims to improve reading proficiency through evidence-based practices. Key components and discussions included:

1. **Purpose of HB 437**: The bill addresses stagnant literacy rates by emphasizing the **science of reading**, which focuses on phonics, phonemic awareness, and other foundational skills.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Universal Reading Screeners**: Mandates screening for K-3 students three times a year.
   - **Individual Reading Plans**: Requires tailored plans for students not meeting benchmarks, excluding the **three-cueing method**.
   - **Parental Involvement**: Parents must be notified within 14 days of a reading deficiency and provided with support strategies.
   - **Teacher Training**: Highlights the **LETRS program**, which has trained over 3,000 New Hampshire educators.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement**: Encourages local districts to involve community stakeholders.
   - **Reporting and Accountability**: Districts must report annually on reading progress and use evidence-based materials.

3. **Concerns**:
   - **Exclusion of Three-Cueing Method**: Some questioned its outright exclusion, but experts argued it is harmful and not evidence-based.
   - **Teacher Preparation Programs**: Concerns were raised about the quality of teacher training programs.
   - **Special Education Referrals**: Debates arose over the timeline for referring struggling students to special education.
   - **Parental Education**: Suggestions were made to offer workshops and resources for parents.

4. **Broader Context**: The bill aligns with efforts in 26 other states that have revamped reading instruction. Mississippi was cited as a success story, where similar reforms led to significant improvements.

5. **Next Steps**: The bill is still being refined, with final amendments expected by November. The subcommittee plans to address concerns about teacher preparation and ensure accountability.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the urgency of improving New Hampshire’s education system through evidence-based practices, compliance with federal standards, and targeted legislative reforms. Key priorities include refining state assessments, addressing literacy deficiencies, supporting struggling schools, and ensuring accountability in implementation. The committee’s discussions highlighted the need for collaboration among educators, stakeholders, and policymakers to achieve meaningful progress in student outcomes.
