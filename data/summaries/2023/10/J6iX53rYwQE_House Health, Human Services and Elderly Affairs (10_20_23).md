**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (10/20/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on October 20, 2023, to discuss several critical issues related to gender and sexuality education in schools, gender-affirming care for minors, and the role of parents and medical professionals in these matters. The meeting centered on **House Bill 619**, which addresses medical issues, school policies, and conversion therapy related to gender dysphoria care for minors. The discussions were wide-ranging and touched on education, medical practices, parental rights, and legislative oversight. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and debates from the meeting:

---

### **1. Gender and Sexuality Education in Schools**
The committee explored concerns about how schools handle discussions and counseling related to gender and sexuality, emphasizing the need for professionalism and parental involvement. Key points included:
- **School Counseling Concerns**: Some representatives raised concerns that teachers and school staff might be providing counseling on gender and sexuality issues without proper training or licensure, potentially leading to misinformation or harm. They stressed the importance of referring students to trained medical professionals for such discussions.
- **Parental Involvement**: There was strong consensus on the importance of parental involvement in decisions about their children’s gender and sexuality. Representatives argued that parents have both the right and responsibility to be informed and engaged in these sensitive matters.
- **Guidelines and Training**: The committee discussed establishing clear guidelines to ensure that only qualified professionals provide counseling on these issues. They also considered refining language around conversion therapy to reduce confusion and controversy.
- **School Policies and Statutes**: The committee debated whether to codify these guidelines into state law to ensure consistency across schools. Some members expressed concerns that local school boards might interpret or implement policies differently, leading to inconsistencies.

### **2. Gender-Affirming Care for Minors**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on gender-affirming medical and surgical treatments for minors, including puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and gender reassignment surgeries. Key discussions included:
- **Concerns About Medical Practices**: Some representatives expressed concerns about the potential risks and long-term consequences of gender-affirming treatments for minors, such as sterilization, cardiovascular risks, osteoporosis, and mental health impacts. They emphasized the need for caution, given the relatively new and rapidly evolving nature of these medical practices.
- **Parental Involvement**: There was strong emphasis on the importance of parental involvement in decision-making for minors undergoing gender-affirming care. Representatives debated whether parental consent should be explicitly required by statute.
- **Medical Guidelines and Oversight**: The committee referenced guidelines from organizations like the **World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)** and the **Endocrine Society**, which recommend prolonged therapy and hormonal treatment before considering surgery. Some members raised concerns about providers potentially deviating from these guidelines.
- **Global Context**: The committee noted that some countries, such as Norway and Sweden, have paused certain gender-affirming treatments for minors due to emerging data on long-term effects. However, others cautioned against relying on outdated or incomplete studies.

### **3. Conversion Therapy and Legislative Language**
The committee discussed refining the definition of conversion therapy to align with WPATH guidelines, which emphasize avoiding coercion of gender-diverse individuals. Key points included:
- **Conversion Therapy Concerns**: Some members expressed concerns about the chilling effects of existing laws and the need for clearer language to reduce confusion and controversy.
- **Surgical Procedures for Minors**: While no definitive evidence was presented that gender reassignment surgeries are performed on minors in New Hampshire, the committee tentatively agreed to explore language prohibiting such procedures for those under 18, with exceptions for intersex conditions or medical necessity.

### **4. Medical Provider Qualifications and Oversight**
The committee emphasized the importance of ensuring that healthcare providers offering gender-affirming care are adequately trained and qualified. Discussions included:
- **Provider Qualifications**: Representatives highlighted the need for specific certifications and ongoing education in transgender health to ensure safe and effective care.
- **Demographics and Scope**: It was noted that the population of minors experiencing gender dysphoria in New Hampshire is very small, leading to questions about whether specific legislation is necessary for such a limited group.

### **5. Balancing Protection and Access**
The meeting underscored the need to balance protecting minors from potential harm with ensuring access to appropriate medical care. Key considerations included:
- **Stakeholder Input**: The committee emphasized the importance of seeking input from medical professionals and stakeholders to ensure any legislative changes align with current practices and avoid unintended consequences.

- Draft language for potential legislation, particularly around conversion therapy and surgical procedures for minors.
