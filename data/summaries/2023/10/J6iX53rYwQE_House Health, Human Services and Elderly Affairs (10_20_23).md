Concerns were raised about parents being unaware of potential side effects, such as **fertility issues**, **cardiac events**, and **depression**.
- **Surgical Procedures**: The committee debated whether **surgical gender reassignment procedures** should be allowed for minors. Such surgeries are rare in New Hampshire and typically require **parental consent**, **medical diagnosis**, and **multi-year therapy**.

### **3. Conversion Therapy**
- **Refining Definitions**: The committee discussed refining the language around **conversion therapy** to clarify its intent and reduce confusion. There was debate over whether to include **same-sex attraction** in the definition and how to better align the statute with WPATH guidelines.
