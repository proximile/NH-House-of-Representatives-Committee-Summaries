The NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on October 31, 2023, focused on several bills and amendments related to transportation and motor vehicle regulations. Here’s a summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **House Bill 370: Aftermarket Window Tinting for Medical Conditions**
- **Amendment 2023-2395H** was adopted, clarifying that individuals with medical conditions can apply for a waiver to use aftermarket tinting on windshields and side windows, with a minimum light transmittance of 35% (down from 70%).
- The effective date was changed to 90 days after passage.
- The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill **Ought to Pass as Amended** and moved it to consent.

### **House Bill 537: Aftermarket Window Tinting**
- The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**, as the passage of HB 370 addressed the same issue.
- The bill was moved to consent.

### **House Bill 646: Eliminating Vehicle Inspection Mandate for Non-Commercial Vehicles**
- The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill for **Interim Study**, citing the need for further discussion and potential changes to the inspection program.
- The bill was moved to consent.

### **Senate Bill 13: Recovery of Search and Rescue Expenses**
- The committee voted **16-2** to recommend the bill **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**, as members felt it was unnecessary and could hinder individuals’ ability to pay expenses by suspending their licenses.
- The bill was moved to consent.

### **Other Bills:**
- **House Bill 55 (Driver’s Education)** was recommended for **Interim Study** by a **18-0** vote.
- **House Bill 375 (Licensure for Non-Resident Aliens)** and **House Bill 570 (Real ID Compliant Licenses)** were not discussed due to unresolved issues and will be revisited on November 14, 2023.

### **Additional Notes:**
