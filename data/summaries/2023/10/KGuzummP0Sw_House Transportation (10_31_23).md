The NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on October 31, 2023, focused on several bills related to transportation regulations. Key discussions and decisions included:

1. **House Bill 370**: The committee discussed an amendment to the bill regarding aftermarket window tinting for drivers with medical conditions. The amendment clarified the language to include tinting on windshields and side windows, reducing the light transmittance requirement from 70% to 35%. The committee voted 18-0 to recommend the bill ought to pass as amended.

2. **House Bill 537**: This bill was deemed redundant after the passage of HB 370, so the committee voted 18-0 to recommend it be inexpedient to legislate (ITL).

3. **House Bill 646**: The committee discussed eliminating vehicle inspection mandates for non-commercial vehicles. Due to complexities and upcoming bills on the topic, the committee voted 18-0 to recommend an interim study rather than an ITL.

4. **Senate Bill 13**: This bill addressed the recovery of search and rescue expenses and included provisions for suspending driverâ€™s licenses for nonpayment. The committee voted 16-2 to recommend ITL, with concerns about linking non-driving offenses to license suspensions.

The committee also discussed other bills, including HB 375 (licensure for non-resident aliens) and HB 570 (Real ID compliance), but postponed decisions on these due to unresolved issues. The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene on November 14th to address the remaining bills and form a subcommittee to review rules consistency with legislation.
