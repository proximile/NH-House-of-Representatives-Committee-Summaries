The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions convened on October 30, 2023, to review and discuss the reduction and restructuring of various state commissions. The meeting focused on identifying which commissions to prioritize for elimination or reform, with a deadline to submit amendments to the Legislative Administration Committee. Key discussions and outcomes from the meeting are summarized below:

1. **Winant Memorial Commission**: The committee reviewed **4:9-1**, the commission overseeing the John G. Winant Memorial, which honors former Governor John G. Winant, a significant figure in New Hampshire and U.S. history. Former Speaker Steve Shurtleff provided historical context and advocated against abolishing the commission, emphasizing its role in maintaining the memorial. He suggested transferring its oversight to the Joint Legislative Historic Committee rather than eliminating it entirely. After debate, the committee unanimously voted to remove the Winant Memorial commission from the immediate repeal list, with plans to consider transferring its responsibilities in the future through a rules committee or special legislation.

2. **Broader Commission Review**: The committee discussed the broader issue of the proliferation of commissions and the need for a structured process to evaluate their necessity. Proposals included forming an advisory group to vet new commission proposals and balancing efficiency with the long-term value of existing commissions.

3. **Contentious Commissions**: The committee agreed to focus on commissions with broad agreement for removal to avoid unnecessary conflicts. They reviewed a list of commissions marked for potential elimination, removing several based on feedback, leaving approximately eight or nine still under consideration.

4. **Commission on Demographic Trends**: Concerns were raised about including the Commission on Demographic Trends on the removal list, as the Senate had previously rejected its repeal. The committee debated whether to set it aside temporarily to avoid complicating other repeal efforts.

5. **Collaboration with the Senate**: The committee acknowledged the need to collaborate with the Senate to ensure successful repeals, as Senate approval is required.

6. **Feedback and Legislative Process**: Representatives provided feedback on specific commissions, including discussions with chairs and members, to determine their necessity. The committee also discussed the legislative process for repealing commissions, including potential amendments, the role of the Rules Committee, and the possibility of some commissions being removed from the consent calendar during floor debates.

7. **Public Hearing and Next Steps**: The committee planned to attend a public hearing on the removal list to address stakeholder concerns. Additional meetings were scheduled to finalize the removal list and prepare for the legislative process, ensuring a cooperative and well-informed approach to repealing unnecessary commissions.

The meeting concluded with an emphasis on gathering comprehensive information and rationale for each commissionâ€™s removal to strengthen their case during legislative debates, while balancing efficiency with the preservation of historically and functionally significant commissions.
