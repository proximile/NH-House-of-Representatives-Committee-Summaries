**Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (10/30/23)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions convened on October 30, 2023, to address the streamlining of government operations through the reduction, consolidation, or reevaluation of various commissions. The meeting featured discussions on the operational challenges of certain commissions, historical significance, and the need for clearer communication and efficiency.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Ad Hoc Commission Review**:  
   The committee examined a commission that has been meeting on an ad hoc basis since 2012. Concerns were raised about its lack of visibility, as its activities were not consistently tracked or reported to staff, nor were its meetings reflected on the official calendar. While the agency involved expressed comfort with the ad hoc structure, the committee emphasized the need for clearer communication and rationale for its operations. No strong push to repeal the commission was made, but further discussions were planned.

2. **Working Session for SB84**:  
   The meeting served as a working session to finalize inputs for legislative amendments, particularly for SB84, which aims to reduce the number of committees and commissions. The committee reviewed a list of potential commissions for repeal or consolidation.

3. **John G. Winant Memorial Commission**:  
   Former Speaker Steve Shurtleff advocated against abolishing the commission overseeing the John G. Winant Memorial, citing its historical significance and the private funding raised for it. The committee decided to remove it from the repeal list and explore transferring its oversight to the Joint Historic Commission in the future.

4. **Review of Other Commissions**:  
   - **Demographic Trends Commission**: Concerns were raised about repealing this commission due to recent Senate opposition. The committee opted to delay action on it.  
   - **Other Commissions**: Several commissions were marked for repeal after confirming with relevant representatives that they were no longer necessary or were duplicative.

5. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee planned to draft amendments for SB84 and present them to the Legislative Administration Committee. Follow-up meetings were scheduled for November 13 and 27 to continue the work. Additionally, the committee discussed the importance of attending the Legislative Administration Committeeâ€™s public hearing on November 10 to address questions or concerns about the proposed repeals.

### Overall Goals:  
The committee aimed to balance efficiency with respect for the historical and functional value of certain commissions. By streamlining operations and ensuring clearer communication, the committee sought to address both operational challenges and potential legislative hurdles. The meeting concluded with a commitment to continued collaboration and further discussions in the coming weeks.
