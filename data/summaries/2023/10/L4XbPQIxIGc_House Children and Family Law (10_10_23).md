**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Children and Family Law Subcommittee Meeting (10/10/23)**

On October 10, 2023, the New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Subcommittee convened to discuss **House Bill 499** and **House Bill 475**, both of which address the **Rules of Evidence** in family court proceedings, particularly in cases involving **abuse, neglect, and domestic violence (DV)**. The meeting centered on ensuring fairness, transparency, and consistency in family court while balancing **judicial discretion** with accountability. Key points from the discussion include:

### **Key Issues and Discussions**

1. **Conflicts and Clarity in Legislation**  
   Members debated whether certain sections of the bills created contradictions, particularly regarding judges' discretion in admitting or denying evidence and the requirement to provide rationale for such decisions. Concerns were raised about the potential for ambiguity in how evidence rules are applied, especially in sensitive cases like domestic violence.

2. **Judicial Discretion and Transparency**  
   A significant portion of the discussion focused on balancing judicial discretion with the need for transparency. Members expressed concerns that judges often fail to provide sufficient reasoning for their decisions, particularly when evidence is admitted or denied over objections. This lack of transparency can lead to perceived biases or unfair outcomes, especially for **pro se litigants** (self-represented parties) who may lack knowledge of the Rules of Evidence.

3. **Pro Se Litigants**  
   The high percentage of pro se litigants in family court was a recurring theme. Many of these individuals struggle to navigate the complexities of the Rules of Evidence, leading to frustration when evidence is admitted or excluded without clear explanation. The committee emphasized the need for better **education and resources** to help pro se litigants understand and effectively participate in court proceedings.

4. **Domestic Violence Cases**  
   A specific concern was raised about the treatment of domestic violence cases, where false allegations or misuse of evidence can weaponize the court system. The committee debated whether DV cases should have different evidentiary standards or carve-outs to ensure fairness for both parties. This included discussions on how to prevent the misuse of evidence while protecting genuine victims.

5. **Proposed Amendments**  
   The subcommittee considered several amendments to address the identified issues:  
   - For **HB 475**, the focus was on requiring judges to note their reasons for excluding evidence, particularly when a litigant objects.  
   - For **HB 499**, the discussion centered on whether respondents should be allowed to submit evidence they believe is favorable, even if it might not align with their case.  
   The committee also discussed crafting new amendments to improve clarity and consistency in evidentiary rulings.

6. **Voting and Reconsideration**  
   The subcommittee initially voted 3-2 to recommend killing HB 499 but later reconsidered after further discussion. Ultimately, they moved to recommend HB 499 with amendments and continued refining proposed changes for HB 475.

7. **Education and Oversight**  
   To address concerns of bias or inconsistency, the committee highlighted the need for **better training and oversight** for judges. Suggestions included more frequent monitoring, mentoring by retired judges, and ongoing education to ensure judges apply evidence rules fairly and consistently.

### **Broader Implications**  
The meeting underscored the complexities of family court proceedings, particularly in cases involving domestic violence and pro se litigants. Members emphasized the importance of **greater clarity and consistency** in how evidence rules are applied, as well as the need for **transparency and accountability** in judicial decision-making. The discussion also highlighted the challenges of balancing judicial flexibility with the need for clear guidelines to ensure fairness.

### **Next Steps**  
The subcommittee agreed to finalize and submit their recommendations to the full committee. They plan to continue refining amendments to address the identified issues, with a focus on improving transparency, consistency, and fairness in family court evidentiary rulings. The committee also emphasized the importance of ongoing education for both judges and pro se litigants to enhance the integrity of family court proceedings.

Overall, the session highlighted the critical need for reforms to ensure that family court proceedings are fair, transparent, and accessible to all parties, particularly in sensitive cases involving domestic violence and self-represented litigants.
