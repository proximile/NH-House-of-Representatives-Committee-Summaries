The NH House of Representatives subcommittee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on October 24, 2023, to discuss **Senate Bill 236**, which proposes establishing a committee to study nonprofit organizations contracting with the Department of Health and Human Services for children's services. The discussion focused on the challenges nonprofits face in obtaining affordable insurance coverage, particularly for programs serving vulnerable populations.

**Key Points:**
1. **Bill Overview:** SB 236 aims to address the insurance coverage difficulties nonprofits encounter, which threaten their ability to provide critical services, such as foster care and community-based programs for children with intensive needs.
2. **Testimony:** Emily Lawrence, Deputy Advocacy Director of Waypoint, highlighted the struggles of nonprofits in securing affordable liability insurance. She emphasized the risk of losing essential services if insurance costs remain unsustainable.
3. **Insurance Department Input:** James Fox from the NH Insurance Department explained the hardening insurance market, driven by reinsurers pulling back, making it harder for nonprofits to obtain coverage. The department supports the bill and is committed to finding solutions.
4. **Committee Discussion:** Representative Weber and others suggested that the study committee include members from the Commerce Committee (for insurance expertise) and the Children and Family Law Committee (for child welfare expertise). They emphasized the need for a focused, nimble committee rather than a large commission.
5. **Motion:** The subcommittee unanimously recommended that the full committee pass SB 236 and suggested including in their report that the Speaker appoint members from the Commerce and Children and Family Law committees.

The meeting concluded with the subcommittee voting unanimously to move the bill forward for further consideration.
