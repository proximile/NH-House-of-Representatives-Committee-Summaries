The New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety subcommittee convened on October 16, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 470**, which focuses on **fentanyl test strips** and other **drug-checking equipment**. The bill aims to support harm reduction efforts by enabling individuals to test illicit substances for dangerous components like fentanyl and xylazine. The discussions highlighted a commitment to harm reduction while addressing the complexities of rural infrastructure, legal implications, and practical implementation. Key points from the meeting include:

### **Infrastructure and Access Challenges**
Representatives emphasized the lack of **infrastructure in rural areas**, particularly in regions like the North Country, which limits residents’ access to essential services, including drug testing resources. The importance of **mobile testing units** was highlighted as a way to provide harm reduction services in these underserved areas. These units allow individuals to test substances safely without fear of prosecution, though concerns were raised about potential misuse by drug traffickers.

### **Types of Testing Equipment**
The discussion focused on the types of drug-testing equipment needed. **Fentanyl test strips** were likened to pregnancy tests, providing a simple yes/no result but not quantifying the substance or testing for multiple drugs. There was also debate about access to **more advanced equipment**, such as spectrometers, which provide detailed substance analysis. While these tools are valuable for monitoring drug supplies, there were concerns about their potential misuse for drug trafficking.

### **Amendment and Language Concerns**
An amendment (**Amendment 515**) was proposed to clarify the bill’s language, particularly around the definition of **drug paraphernalia**. The amendment sought to exclude drug-checking equipment and small amounts of substances (up to **10 milligrams**) used for testing from being classified as paraphernalia. However, some representatives, particularly those with law enforcement backgrounds, raised concerns that the language was too broad and could inadvertently enable illicit activities or be exploited by drug traffickers. Specific concerns were raised about terms like “preparing, packaging, repackaging, and storing,” which could be interpreted too broadly.

### **Balancing Harm Reduction and Legal Concerns**
The debate centered on whether the bill strikes the right balance between **harm reduction** and **enabling illicit activity**. Supporters argued that providing testing tools empowers individuals to make informed decisions about substance use, potentially saving lives and encouraging them to seek help. Opponents expressed concerns that the bill could perpetuate addiction cycles by reducing barriers to drug use. The discussion also focused on defining **nominal amounts** of drugs for testing purposes to ensure the bill targets harm reduction without facilitating drug trafficking.

### **Next Steps**
The subcommittee decided to **recess** to refine the amendment’s language, particularly narrowing the definition of paraphernalia to ensure it aligns with harm reduction goals without enabling illicit activities. They planned to reconvene to vote on the revised amendment and make a recommendation to the full committee. Additionally, there was a commitment to involve more stakeholders to address unresolved issues and refine the bill’s language.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the tension between **saving lives** through harm reduction and **preventing the enabling of illegal drug use**. Representatives emphasized the importance of carefully crafting the bill’s language to avoid unintended consequences while ensuring individuals feel safe accessing testing services. The discussions reflected a commitment to addressing the opioid crisis and improving public safety, particularly in rural areas with limited resources.
