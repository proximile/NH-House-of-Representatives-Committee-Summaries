**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Meeting (10/12/23)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on October 12, 2023, centered on a broad range of education-related topics, with a particular focus on **student voice and choice**, **mental health accommodations**, **competency-based education**, and **legislative oversight of educational standards**. The discussions highlighted the need for modernizing the state’s education system while addressing equity, local control, and practical implementation challenges.

### Key Themes and Discussions:

#### 1. **Student Voice and Choice**
   - Representatives emphasized the importance of incorporating **student voice and choice** into education to enhance engagement and motivation. 
   - Extracurricular activities, electives, and personalized learning paths were cited as key factors in making education more meaningful and aligned with students’ interests and future goals.

#### 2. **Mental Health in Education**
   - The committee debated **House Bill 352**, which proposes excusing student absences for mental or behavioral health reasons. Concerns were raised about potential abuse and redundancy, as existing policies like **504 plans** and **Individualized Education Programs (IEPs)** already address these issues.
   - There was also significant discussion about whether **mental health education** should be explicitly included in the state’s **educational adequacy standards (RSA 193-E)** or remain under the broader umbrella of health and wellness. Some representatives advocated for explicit inclusion to ensure mental health is taught, while others argued it is already covered under existing standards.

#### 3. **Transition to Competency-Based Education**
   - A major focus of the meeting was the transition to a **competency-based education system**, where students progress by demonstrating mastery of skills and knowledge rather than time spent in class. This model, which New Hampshire has been developing since 2005, aims to make high school diplomas more meaningful and aligned with students’ career and post-secondary goals.
   - **Fred Branti** and his task force presented proposed updates to the **Ed 306 rules**, which set the minimum standards for public school approval. The process has involved extensive stakeholder engagement, with over 40 meetings held across the state to gather feedback.
   - Challenges were acknowledged, including the slow progress toward fully implementing competency-based learning and the need for systemic changes to address dismal student performance in core subjects like reading, math, and science.

#### 4. **Equity and Local Control**
   - Representatives stressed the importance of **equity in education**, ensuring all students have access to opportunities regardless of their background or needs. Discussions highlighted disparities in school budgets, per-student costs, and property taxes between communities.
   - The tension between **state mandates** and **local control** was a recurring theme, with concerns raised about funding disparities and the need for adequate resources to implement competency-based and equitable education models.

#### 5. **Legislative and Administrative Processes**
   - The committee discussed the **rule-making process** for educational standards, which involves the **Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR)** and the **State Board of Education**. Concerns were raised about ensuring mental health remains in the curriculum and maintaining clear, enforceable standards for all schools.
   - Legislative oversight was emphasized, with representatives noting that the State Board of Education cannot amend or approve new academic standards without prior review and recommendation from the legislative oversight committee.
   - The lack of funding and staffing at the **Department of Education** was highlighted as a barrier to enforcing compliance with educational standards.

#### 6. **Graduation Requirements and Personalized Learning**
   - The task force is working on defining **graduation competencies** to ensure all New Hampshire high school graduates meet a consistent standard. Debates included whether local districts should have flexibility to adjust these standards.
   - While **personalized learning plans** were proposed, they were deemed too costly and complex to implement immediately. Instead, there will be a statewide conversation on integrating them in the future.
   - Some representatives advocated for including **social and emotional competencies** in graduation requirements, though this remains a local decision.

#### 7. **Next Steps**
   - The committee planned to revisit **House Bill 352** in their November meeting, potentially moving to table it. They also discussed upcoming bills related to mental health and education standards.
   - The task force will present a revised draft of the **Ed 306 rules** to the State Board of Education in November, with public hearings and a 180-day timeline for finalizing the rules.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the complexities of modernizing New Hampshire’s education system, balancing student needs, equity, and practical implementation while respecting local control and existing frameworks. The transition to a **competency-based education system**, the inclusion of **mental health education**, and the need for **legislative oversight** were central themes. The process will require continued collaboration among stakeholders, adequate funding, and a unified effort to ensure all students are prepared for future success.
