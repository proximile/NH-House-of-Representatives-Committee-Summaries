**Summary of the New Hampshire House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (October 16, 2023)**

On October 16, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened to discuss several key energy-related topics, including microgrids, energy procurement, and default service rates. The meeting focused on refining legislative amendments and exploring strategies to enhance energy reliability, affordability, and resilience in the state. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **Microgrids and Clean Energy Innovation**
1. **Amendment 2023-23 21h and HB 558 Amendment**:  
   The committee discussed amendments aimed at advancing microgrid development in New Hampshire. **Amendment 2023-23 21h** proposed requiring the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct a comprehensive study on microgrids to assess their feasibility, costs, and potential implementation. The study would explore economic growth, clean energy innovation, and grid reliability, with a final report due within 120 days of completion.  
   - **Feasibility and Costs**: Concerns were raised about the indeterminate fiscal note and the technical and regulatory complexities of microgrids. The DOE emphasized the need for competitive solicitation of consultants to estimate costs within a range.  
   - **Timeline**: The proposed 1.5-year timeline for the study was defended by the DOE as necessary for thoroughness, though some committee members questioned its length.  
   - **Definition and Scope**: Discussions centered on defining microgrids and their potential inclusion of renewable energy sources like solar and wind. The DOE aimed to keep the study flexible and inclusive.  
   - **Benefits**: Microgrids were highlighted for their potential to enhance energy resilience, particularly for critical facilities like hospitals and universities, and to support economic development in regions like the North Country.  
   - **Federal Funding**: The DOE expressed interest in leveraging federal funding opportunities, such as those under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), though microgrid-specific funding was not yet identified.  
   - **Utility Involvement**: Eversource shared its experience with microgrids in Connecticut and Massachusetts, emphasizing the need for a clear regulatory framework to address technical and administrative challenges.  
   - **Outcome**: The subcommittee unanimously recommended the amendment for further consideration by the full committee.

2. **Pilot Programs and Legislative Direction**:  
   There was interest in accelerating microgrid pilot programs, but concerns about administrative costs and technical complexities were raised. The DOE stressed the importance of resolving these issues before implementation. The committee underscored the need for clear legislative guidance to define the purpose of microgrids and ensure their contribution to grid stability.

### **Energy Procurement and Default Service Rates (HB 159)**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 159 (HB 159)**, which addresses the default service rate for electricity and energy procurement plans. The focus was on amending the bill to improve price stability for consumers by allowing utilities to procure energy more frequently than the current six-month intervals, a strategy known as **"laddering."**

1. **Current Challenges**:  
   The six-month procurement cycle has led to significant price spikes, impacting businesses and homeowners. The goal of HB 159 is to provide more consistent and predictable electric rates, helping consumers budget effectively.

2. **Laddering Concept**:  
   Laddering involves diversifying energy procurement across short, medium, and long-term contracts to smooth out price fluctuations. While effective during periods of rising costs, it may not be as beneficial in stable or declining markets. The DOE is investigating this approach, with a report expected in December 2023.

3. **Utility Concerns**:  
   Utilities like Eversource emphasized the need for a clear framework to implement laddering without exposing them to excessive risk. They preferred structured guidelines over discretionary decision-making, which could lead to criticism if prices rise due to procurement choices.

4. **Community Power and Self-Supply**:  
   The rise of community power programs, which allow municipalities to procure energy collectively, was discussed. While these programs can reduce costs, they introduce new risks for wholesale suppliers and utilities. In cases of failed auctions, utilities may resort to self-supply, purchasing energy directly from the ISO New England market, which is highly volatile.

5. **Residential vs. Commercial Customers**:  
   Residential customers are less likely to switch to third-party suppliers due to complexity and fear of variable rates, leaving 85% reliant on default service. In contrast, large commercial and industrial customers are more active in seeking competitive supply options.

6. **Legislative Recommendations**:  
   The committee explored whether legislation should provide specific guidelines for laddering or set broader policy goals for the Public Utilities Commission to implement. Utilities expressed a preference for clear, structured processes to minimize risk.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a commitment to further explore microgrids, laddering, and other procurement strategies. The DOE’s upcoming report in December 2023 is expected to provide additional insights, guiding the committee’s efforts to develop solutions that balance **price stability, risk management, and consumer protection**. The discussions highlighted the importance of structured legislative guidance, thorough technical studies, and leveraging federal funding to advance New Hampshire’s energy infrastructure and resilience.
