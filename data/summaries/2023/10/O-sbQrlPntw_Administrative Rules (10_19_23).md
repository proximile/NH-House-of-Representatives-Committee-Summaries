**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (October 19, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on October 19, 2023, to discuss various administrative rules, focusing on their implications for housing development, professional licensing, environmental management, and other regulatory areas. The meeting highlighted the need for careful consideration of rule changes, balancing stakeholder interests, and ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Housing Development and Stormwater Management**
The meeting began with a discussion on a recently implemented administrative rule affecting housing development, particularly concerning bio-retention ponds and stormwater management. Key points included:
- **Rule Impact**: Described as a "minor technical cleanup," the rule has led to significant financial and logistical challenges for developers. For example, a project in Waterville Valley incurred a $250,000 cost increase due to re-engineering and new environmental studies.
- **Proposed Actions**: Senator Lang suggested petitioning the responsible agency to either stay the rule’s implementation or consider an emergency rule to mitigate its unintended fiscal impact. However, concerns were raised about acting hastily without fully understanding the rule’s implications.
- **Need for Information**: Representatives emphasized the importance of gathering detailed information, including the specific language of the old and new rules, the intent behind the change, and its broader impact on developers and taxpayers. They cautioned against rushing to address the issue, which could set a problematic precedent.
- **Next Steps**: The committee postponed further action until the next meeting on November 16, 2023, to allow time for additional data collection, review of the home builders' letter, and input from the Department of Environmental Services (DES). DES representatives, unaware of the issue until the meeting, requested the letter to address concerns.
- **Broader Concerns**: Some members highlighted the potential for the rule to shift costs from developers to taxpayers, particularly in relation to federal stormwater management requirements. They stressed the importance of balancing developer needs with community interests.

### **Professional Licensing and Regulatory Updates**
The committee reviewed several proposals related to professional licensing and regulatory updates:
- **Podiatry Board Rules**:
  - **Proposal 2022-233**: Involved expired rules since April 2019, raising questions about enforcement and fee collection. The committee considered postponing the proposal to allow the board to update the rules in alignment with House Bill 409, which shifted licensing responsibilities to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).
  - **Proposal 2023-118**: Addressed an expired rule on the code of ethics, with no disciplinary actions taken during the expiration period. The committee also considered postponing this proposal for further review.
- **Landscape Architects**: Proposal 2023-12 was discussed, with an amended conditional approval filed after the deadline. The committee voted to accept the amended approval and conditionally approved the proposal.
- **Physical Therapists**: A proposal involving continued status rules for physical therapists was discussed, with several sections expired since 2021 and 2022. The committee voted to postpone the proposal to allow updates related to a new online licensing system and address inconsistencies in the rules.

### **Environmental and Safety Regulations**
The committee addressed several environmental and safety-related proposals:
- **Watercraft Safety Rules**: The agency requested a postponement to work on a conditional approval, which the committee granted without requiring a waiver.
- **HHS Rules on Radiological Health**: A proposal involving radiological health rules was discussed, with an amended conditional approval filed after the deadline. The committee voted to accept the amended approval, noting that the program may need a legislative carveout due to federal regulatory compliance requirements.
- **Hazardous Waste Management**: A proposal involving hazardous waste fines was discussed, with concerns about expired rules and the use of "proposed" fines. The department adjusted the language to specify that fines are proposed and can be adjusted based on circumstances. The committee approved the proposal.
- **Sporting Club Youth Pheasant Events**: Proposal 2023-187 for youth pheasant hunting events was discussed, with the rules having expired in May 2023. The committee conditionally approved the proposal.

### **Objection Responses and New Processes**
The committee reviewed and approved responses to preliminary objections and discussed new forms and processes:
- **Board of Engineers**: A revised preliminary objection response was approved.
- **Department of Agriculture**: Addressed a preliminary objection regarding rule AGR 700, part of a larger set of expired rules. The department planned to update the entire chapter, and the committee approved the rule.
- **Department of Health and Human Services**: The committee reviewed a revised objection response for foster care licensing requirements, which addressed concerns about mandatory immunizations. The revised response was approved.
- **Board of Education Interim Rule**: The board requested a postponement to work on a conditional approval request, which the committee granted.
