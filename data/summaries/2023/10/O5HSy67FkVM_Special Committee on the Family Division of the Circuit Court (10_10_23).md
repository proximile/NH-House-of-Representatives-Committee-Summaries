The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court meeting on October 10, 2023, focused on improving the accessibility and usability of court forms, particularly for self-represented litigants in family court cases. Key points discussed include:

1. **Form Accessibility and Simplification**: Committee members emphasized the importance of making court forms easier to understand and fill out, especially for pro se litigants who make up 80% of family court cases. Concerns were raised about forms not being fillable online and the need for clearer instructions and navigation.

2. **Public Education and Guidance**: The committee discussed how to better educate the public about available forms and processes, including improving the court's website to make it more intuitive and providing step-by-step guidance for different types of cases, such as divorce and parenting.

3. **Form Updates and Standardization**: The court system is in the process of standardizing forms across all courts and updating high-use forms that are frequently filled out incorrectly. A Request for Proposal (RFP) is being prepared to hire external help for this project, with a goal of completing updates within six to nine months.

4. **Collaboration with the Committee**: The committee expressed interest in working closely with the court system during the form update process, sharing feedback from the public and offering suggestions for improvement.

5. **Filing Fees and Financial Assistance**: The process for filing fees was explained, including options for waiving fees for those who cannot afford them. Fees are required at the time of filing, but motions to waive fees can be filed with a financial affidavit.

6. **Support for Pro Se Litigants**: Court staff provide assistance with filling out forms but cannot offer legal advice. Pro se litigants are directed to legal referral services, mediation, and advocacy groups for additional support.

7. **Specific Case Examples**: The committee discussed specific scenarios, such as filing for protection orders (stalking vs. domestic abuse) and small claims cases, highlighting the need for clearer guidance to help individuals choose the correct forms and processes.

8. **Public Feedback and Continuous Improvement**: The court system welcomes feedback from the public and court staff to identify areas for improvement and increase access to justice.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to maintaining open communication between the committee and the court system to ensure ongoing collaboration and improvement in court processes and forms.
