### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 70 (HB 70)**  
The committee discussed an amendment to HB 70, which clarifies that deputy town clerks must be residents of the municipality they serve. The amendment received support from the Secretary of State and the New Hampshire Municipal Association, who highlighted the importance of residency for privacy, recordkeeping, and election responsibilities. The amendment passed with a vote of 19 to 1, and the bill was moved to the consent calendar.

#### **House Bill 202 (HB 202)**  
HB 202 addresses inequities in property tax abatement calculations by standardizing the equalization rates used. The bill passed with a vote of 18 to 1, with one member absent, and was also moved to the consent calendar.

#### **House Bill 270 (HB 270)**  
The committee voted unanimously to indefinitely postpone HB 270, as its contents had already been addressed in another bill (HB 313), which was signed into law.

#### **House Bill 313 (HB 313)**  
HB 313, which adjusts default budgets for official ballot town meetings, sparked significant debate. An amendment was proposed to ensure that default budgets reflect the actual salaries of filled positions rather than budgeted amounts. Supporters argued the amendment would bring clarity and fairness, while opponents expressed concerns that it could override local governance. After extensive discussion, the amendment failed with a vote of 9-1. The underlying bill was subsequently voted on and passed with an 11-9 vote.

#### **House Bill 433 (HB 433)**  
A motion was made to indefinitely postpone HB 433, which addressed property tax exemptions and their application after home sales. The motion passed unanimously (20-0), and the bill was placed on the consent calendar without objections.

#### **House Bill 526 (HB 526)**  
The committee debated an amendment to HB 526, which allows municipalities to use flaggers or police officers for traffic control on certain highways. The amendment was described as enabling and clarifying, giving municipalities flexibility while maintaining safety standards. Concerns were raised about police brutality and the need for clear guidelines, but the amendment passed with a 15-4 vote. The amended bill then passed with a 17-1 vote and was placed on the consent calendar.
