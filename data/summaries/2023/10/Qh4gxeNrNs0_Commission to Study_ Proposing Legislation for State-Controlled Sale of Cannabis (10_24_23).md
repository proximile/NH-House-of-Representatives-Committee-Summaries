**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Proposing Legislation for State-Controlled Sale of Cannabis (10/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on October 24, 2023, to discuss and propose legislation for a state-controlled model of cannabis sales. The meeting, led by the Commission to Study Proposing Legislation for State-Controlled Sale of Cannabis, focused on balancing public health and safety with regulatory and economic considerations. Key themes included youth protection, public health risks, regulatory frameworks, and revenue allocation. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Public Health and Youth Concerns**
1. **Youth Access and Mental Health Risks**:  
   - Testimonies highlighted the irreversible harm of cannabis on youth mental health, including increased risks of **psychotic disorders**, **addiction**, and **poor educational outcomes**. Data from Massachusetts showed a rise in youth cannabis use post-legalization, with minors accessing legal products through social sources.  
   - Experts emphasized that **cannabis use during adolescence** can impair brain development, leading to long-term mental health issues. Marketing and accessibility of appealing products like **edibles** were identified as significant contributors to youth use.  

2. **Public Health Framework**:  
   - Speakers advocated for a **public health framework** to mitigate harms, including **THC potency caps**, **banning appealing products**, and **clear health warnings** on packaging.  
   - **Public awareness campaigns** were recommended to educate consumers about risks such as **psychosis**, **anxiety**, and **cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)**, particularly for **pregnant women** and **young adults**.  

3. **Prevention and Funding**:  
   - Adequate funding for **substance abuse prevention** and **treatment programs** was deemed essential. However, examples from Maine revealed mismanagement of prevention funds and ineffective public health campaigns.  
   - Suggestions included creating a **dedicated fund** for substance abuse programs, separate from the alcohol fund, to ensure transparency and accountability.

### **Regulatory and Legislative Challenges**
1. **State-Controlled Model**:  
   - The commission’s charge was to propose a **state-controlled cannabis model**, focusing on robust regulation rather than debating legalization. The goal was to protect citizens while minimizing public health risks.  
   - Key components included **strict licensing requirements**, a **closed-loop system** for transportation, and **testing and quality control** to ensure product safety.  

2. **Testing and Lab Regulations**:  
   - There was debate over whether testing should be conducted by **private labs** or the state. A compromise was suggested: private labs would perform testing, with the state auditing results to ensure accuracy and oversight.  
   - Concerns were raised about **conflicts of interest** if the state tested its own products.  

3. **Possession Limits and Sales Models**:  
   - The commission debated **consumer possession limits**, with some advocating for lower limits (e.g., 2 ounces of flower, 5 grams of concentrate, 500 milligrams of edibles) to align with medical cannabis laws and public health concerns. Others supported higher limits to bolster the **franchise model** and **out-of-state sales**.  
   - Discussions included whether **therapeutic (medical) cannabis products** should be sold in retail stores and whether the **Liquor Commission** should oversee these sales instead of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  

4. **Online Sales and Delivery**:  
   - The commission leaned toward **in-person sales only** to ensure proper identification and prevent misuse, with **online sales and delivery** deemed too risky.

### **Economic and Revenue Considerations**
1. **Revenue Allocation**:  
   - The discussion emphasized the importance of **out-of-state consumers** in the revenue model, similar to New Hampshire’s liquor sales.  
   - Revenue from cannabis sales was proposed to fund **substance abuse prevention**, **treatment**, and **recovery programs**, with the **Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs** overseeing fund allocation.  

2. **Franchise Model and Taxation**:  
   - The commission debated whether to tax **cannabis accessories** (e.g., pipes) under the proposed legislation, ultimately deciding against it to avoid unfair burdens on businesses.  
   - A **15% franchise fee** was proposed for cannabis products, with discussions on how to balance state control with private sector involvement.

### **Protecting Existing Businesses and Defining Terms**
1. **CBD and Hemp Products**:  
   - The commission highlighted the need to protect existing businesses selling **CBD products** from unnecessary regulation. Concerns were raised about **THC levels** in CBD products and the potential for unintended regulation of low-potency THC products.  

2. **Definitions and Licensing**:  
   - Extensive discussion focused on defining terms like **"cannabis establishment,"** **"cannabis product,"** and **"testing facility."** The commission emphasized the need for clarity in licensing requirements and the distinction between **medical dispensaries** and **retail stores**.  

3. **Retail Stores and Medical Dispensaries**:  
   - It was clarified that **alternative treatment centers (ATCs)** could operate retail stores but must keep them separate from medical dispensaries to avoid regulatory conflicts.

### **Future Steps**
The commission planned to continue refining the bill in subsequent meetings, focusing on **possession limits**, **revenue models**, and **regulatory details**. Key unresolved issues included the **passport identification error**, **drug forfeiture funds**, and the definition of **low-potency THC products**.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of cannabis legalization, emphasizing the need for a **balanced approach** that prioritizes **public health and safety** while addressing economic and regulatory challenges. The commission’s goal was to craft legislation that minimizes risks, protects vulnerable populations, and ensures a controlled and accountable cannabis market in New Hampshire.
