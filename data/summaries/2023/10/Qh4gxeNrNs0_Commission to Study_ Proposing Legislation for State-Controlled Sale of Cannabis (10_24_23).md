**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study Proposing Legislation for State-Controlled Sale of Cannabis (10/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on October 24, 2023, to discuss proposed legislation for a state-controlled cannabis sales model. The commission’s primary focus was on drafting legislation that prioritizes public safety, effective regulation, and consumer protection, rather than debating the merits of legalization itself. The meeting featured extensive discussions on various aspects of cannabis regulation, including testing, taxation, youth access, public health concerns, and market viability. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Testing and Regulation**
The commission debated whether cannabis testing should be conducted by state-run facilities or private labs. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts of interest if the state tests its own products, leading to a preference for independent lab testing. A hybrid model was proposed, where private labs handle testing while the state oversees audits and spot checks. The discussion emphasized the importance of ensuring consumer safety, environmental protection, and regulatory oversight throughout the supply chain.

---

### **2. Tax Revenue Allocation**
There was broad agreement on allocating tax revenue from cannabis sales to support public health programs, particularly substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery. Suggestions were made to establish a dedicated cannabis fund separate from the alcohol fund to ensure transparency and prevent commingling of resources. The commission also discussed the need for regular reporting on the effectiveness of these programs, with oversight from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs.

---

### **3. Youth Access and Advertising Restrictions**
Preventing youth access to cannabis was a recurring theme. The commission unanimously supported prohibiting the marketing and advertising of cannabis to minors. Experts highlighted the risks of early cannabis use, particularly high-potency THC products, which are linked to psychosis, addiction, and irreversible brain damage in young users. Witnesses recommended implementing strict regulations, such as THC potency caps, banning appealing products like edibles, and restricting advertising. Concerns were also raised about the proliferation of dispensaries in border communities and their impact on youth access.

---

### **4. Public Health and Safety**
Health experts, including psychiatrists and neurobiologists, testified about the risks of cannabis use, particularly for youth. They emphasized that THC is harmful to brain development and linked to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis. The rise in cannabis-related health problems, including lung injuries from vaping, was also noted. Experts called for a public health framework that includes warning labels, public education campaigns, and prevention programs to mitigate harm. They also warned against the normalization of cannabis use, which could lead to increased youth consumption.

### **5. Medical Marijuana and CBD Products**
The commission discussed the regulation of medical marijuana and CBD products. While medical marijuana is FDA-approved for specific conditions like severe seizures and terminal pain, experts cautioned against its overuse and the development of cannabis use disorder. Concerns were raised about inconsistencies in federal and state regulations regarding CBD and THC content. The commission emphasized the need to protect existing businesses selling CBD oils and creams while ensuring consumer safety.

---

### **6. Licensing and Definitions**
The commission reviewed and refined definitions related to cannabis establishments, including cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, and retail stores. It was agreed that all cannabis-related businesses should be explicitly licensed by the state. The commission also debated the separation of medical dispensaries and retail cannabis stores, as well as the need for separate licenses for transporting cannabis to ensure a closed-loop system.

---

### **7. Possession Limits and Market Viability**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on determining personal possession limits for cannabis. The commission considered aligning New Hampshire’s limits with neighboring states like Maine and Massachusetts, proposing 2 ounces of flower, 5 grams of concentrate, and 500 milligrams of edibles. Concerns were raised about the impact of lower limits on out-of-state consumers and the viability of the retail model. The commission acknowledged the importance of out-of-state consumers in generating revenue and debated how to balance public health concerns with economic considerations.

---

### **8. Legislative Challenges and Recommendations**
Witnesses from states with legalized cannabis, such as Maine, shared experiences with legislative challenges, noting that even well-crafted laws can be watered down without ongoing legislative support. The commission was advised to incorporate strict regulations, public education, and prevention programs into any proposed legislation. There was also a call to allocate a significant portion of cannabis tax revenue to public health and prevention efforts, rather than relying solely on PSA campaigns.

---

### **9. Next Steps and Action Items**
The meeting concluded with plans to continue reviewing the draft bill section by section, with a focus on cultivation, manufacturing, and retail licenses. Specific action items included:
- Analyzing the impact of bulk sales on the proposed cannabis model.
- Discussing the funding formula for the Alcohol and Other Drug Fund, with an emphasis on treatment.
- Preparing for further deliberations on regulatory clarity and public health safeguards.

Participants acknowledged the complexity of the issue and the need for continued deliberation, with plans to reconvene on November 3, 2023.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the complexities of implementing a state-controlled cannabis model, balancing public health and safety concerns with economic viability. Key themes included:
- Ensuring consumer safety through rigorous testing and regulation.
- Preventing youth access through strict advertising restrictions and possession limits.
- Allocating tax revenue to support public health programs, particularly substance abuse prevention and treatment.
