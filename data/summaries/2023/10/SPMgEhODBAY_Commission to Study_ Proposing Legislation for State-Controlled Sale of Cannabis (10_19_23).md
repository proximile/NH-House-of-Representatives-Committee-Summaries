**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on State-Controlled Cannabis Sales (10/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on October 19, 2023, to discuss the proposed legislation for state-controlled cannabis sales. The commission focused on the transition from the current Therapeutic Cannabis Program (TCP) to a regulated adult-use market, addressing key challenges related to public health, market dynamics, enforcement, and legal risks. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed across all segments:

---

### **1. Therapeutic Cannabis Program and Transition to Adult Use**
- **Criteria and Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the criteria for therapeutic cannabis use, particularly ensuring patients are not abusing other drugs or experiencing acute psychiatric episodes. The verification process for patient eligibility and the potential for rule circumvention were discussed.
- **Integration of Markets**: The commission explored how the existing TCP could integrate with a new adult-use market. Dual-use dispensaries (serving both medical and recreational customers) were proposed, with separate counters or sections for each. The need to prioritize patient access and maintain education and support services for medical users was emphasized.
- **Product Differentiation**: The distinction between therapeutic and recreational cannabis products was debated, including the potential for higher potency products in the recreational market. Clear regulations were deemed necessary to prevent misuse and ensure therapeutic products remain distinct.

### **2. State-Controlled Model and Regulation**
- **Franchise Model**: The commission discussed a state-controlled cannabis model, similar to the control state model for alcohol, to ensure safety and regulation. A 15% franchise fee on cannabis sales was proposed, but concerns were raised about its impact on pricing and the potential to drive consumers to the illicit market. Suggestions included exempting therapeutic products from this fee.
- **Enforcement and Oversight**: The need for enforceable rules, particularly if cannabis sales are moved under the Liquor Commission, was emphasized. Concerns about bad actors in the industry and the expansion of the illicit market were significant topics. Strategies to mitigate this included keeping prices low, limiting the number of stores, and ensuring efficient licensing processes.
- **Testing and Quality Control**: Rigorous testing for contaminants like mold, pesticides, and heavy metals was highlighted as essential. The role of the Department of Health and Human Services in monitoring compliance and maintaining quality standards was discussed.

### **3. Legal and Financial Risks**
- **Federal vs. State Law**: The tension between state and federal cannabis laws was a recurring theme. Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, and state-controlled systems could expose the state to criminal and civil liabilities. The risk of federal prosecution for state employees involved in cannabis operations was noted, particularly given the potential for shifts in federal enforcement priorities with changes in administration.
- **Liability Concerns**: The Attorney General’s office emphasized potential state liability, particularly regarding THC limits and civil tort actions. A recent lawsuit in New York challenging cannabis legalization was cited as a cautionary example.
- **Financial Risks**: Members raised concerns about the financial risks to the state, including the potential for federal seizure of funds derived from cannabis sales and the legal implications of co-mingling these funds with other state revenues.

### **4. Market Dynamics and Pricing**
- **Cost and Pricing**: The high cost of producing cannabis in New Hampshire, due to stringent regulations and indoor growing requirements, was noted. Comparisons were made with states like Maine, where regulations are less strict and costs are lower. The potential for adult-use legalization to reduce costs for medical cannabis through economies of scale was discussed, but concerns about maintaining affordable access for patients were raised.
- **Black Market Concerns**: The expansion of the illicit cannabis market in states that have legalized adult-use cannabis was a significant topic. Strategies to combat this included competitive pricing, limiting store numbers, and efficient licensing processes.
- **Nonprofit Status and Taxation**: The financial challenges faced by Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs), which are currently required to be nonprofits at the state level but not federally, were discussed. The proposal included allowing ATCs to convert to for-profit entities to better compete in the adult-use market.

---

### **5. Education, Support, and Medical Oversight**
- **Patient Education and Support**: The importance of patient education and support services, particularly for individuals with serious medical conditions, was emphasized. Current ATCs provide consultations and educational resources, and there was concern about maintaining these services in a dual-use system.
- **Doctor Recommendations**: The role of medical providers in recommending cannabis for patients was discussed, along with the challenges of ensuring that ATCs follow these recommendations. Clearer communication between providers and ATCs was highlighted as a need.

---

### **6. Future Considerations and Next Steps**
- **Branding and Separation**: The need for clear separation between medical and recreational cannabis sales, either through separate facilities or distinct branding, was emphasized to avoid confusion and ensure compliance with regulations.
- **Further Guidance**: The commission acknowledged the complexities and uncertainties surrounding state-controlled cannabis sales, including legal, financial, and enforcement risks. Further guidance from the Attorney General’s office was requested to structure the state’s cannabis program in a way that mitigates potential liabilities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the multifaceted challenges New Hampshire faces in transitioning to a regulated cannabis market. Balancing public health, market dynamics, enforcement, and legal risks will require careful planning and collaboration across stakeholders. The commission emphasized the need for a cautious approach, with a focus on maintaining patient access, ensuring product quality, and mitigating the illicit market while navigating the complexities of federal prohibition.
