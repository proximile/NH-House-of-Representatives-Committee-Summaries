### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on the Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting (10/23/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss the Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting for Unitary Businesses under the Business Profits Tax. The central focus was whether to recommend implementing worldwide combined reporting, a tax method that would tax multinational businesses on their global income rather than just their domestic income. The meeting featured robust debate, thorough analysis, and the drafting of reports to outline the commission’s findings and recommendations. Key points from the discussion are summarized below:

### **Key Discussions and Findings**

1. **Firm Conclusions and Consensus**:  
   One commission member expressed confidence that the proposal had been thoroughly examined, and a consensus had been reached. However, other members emphasized the need for additional analysis, particularly to ensure the report’s content was sufficient to support its recommendations. They noted that gaps might require further context or “bridges” to strengthen the report’s arguments.

2. **Neutrality and Complexity**:  
   Maintaining neutrality was acknowledged as challenging, especially given the intricate issues of transfer pricing and the perception of an unlevel playing field. However, the commission agreed that the available evidence was insufficient to confirm such disparities or justify a significant policy change.

3. **Insufficient Evidence for Change**:  
   Several members highlighted that moving to worldwide combined reporting would be a radical shift with substantial administrative burdens. They argued that there was not enough data to quantify the potential benefits or justify the change. Collecting more information was suggested but deemed resource-intensive.

4. **Transfer Pricing**:  
   A significant portion of the discussion centered on transfer pricing, a practice where related entities set prices for transactions between themselves. The commission debated how to describe this practice neutrally, distinguishing between legitimate business operations and abusive profit-shifting. They also noted mitigating factors, such as changes in federal tax law and international efforts like the OECD’s BEPS project, which reduce incentives for abusive practices.

5. **Revenue Impact**:  
   The commission acknowledged the difficulty in estimating the revenue impact of adopting worldwide combined reporting, as New Hampshire lacks the necessary data to make precise projections.

### **Reports and Recommendations**

1. **Minority Report**:  
   Representative Schamberg submitted a passionate Minority Report advocating for worldwide combined reporting, though he was not present and indicated he would revise it. While the majority disagreed with his position, they respected his perspective and opted not to alter his report.

2. **Draft Report**:  
   The commission reviewed a draft report summarizing the process, testimony, and expert positions on the issue. The report aimed to remain balanced and factual in its testimony section, avoiding any explicit stance.

3. **Majority Analysis**:  
   The chair proposed drafting a succinct majority analysis to clearly outline why the majority opposes implementing worldwide combined reporting at this time. Key points included insufficient evidence, the radical nature of the change, and the administrative burdens it would impose. The chair planned to present this analysis for review at the next meeting, aiming for unanimous support.

4. **Findings and Recommendations**:  
   The commission discussed structuring the findings and recommendations section, emphasizing the need for factual, declarative statements. While the final report will include recommendations, they were not yet prepared during this meeting.
