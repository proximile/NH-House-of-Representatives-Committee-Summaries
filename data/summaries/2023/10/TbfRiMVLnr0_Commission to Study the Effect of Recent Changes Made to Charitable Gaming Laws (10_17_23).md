**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws (10/17/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on October 17, 2023, to discuss the **Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws**, with a particular focus on the newly authorized **historical horse racing (HHR)**. The meeting brought together key stakeholders, including **Charlie McIntyre**, Director of the NH Lottery, and other experts, to evaluate the evolving landscape of charitable gaming in the state. The discussions centered on regulatory challenges, revenue distribution, societal impacts, and future directions for charitable gaming. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **1. Overview of Charitable Gaming Evolution**
- **Traditional vs. Modern Gaming**: Charitable gaming in New Hampshire has transitioned from traditional games like **bingo** and **Lucky Seven** to more modern, casino-style games and **HHR**. While traditional games are declining in profitability, HHR has emerged as a major revenue driver, with over 1,600 machines in operation as of August 2023.
- **Historical Horse Racing (HHR)**: HHR involves replaying historical horse races with randomized outcomes and operates on a pari-mutuel wagering system. Approved in the last legislative session, HHR has significantly impacted the charitable gaming landscape, raising questions about its regulation and long-term effects.

### **2. Revenue Sharing and Distribution**
- **Revenue Models**: Revenue from HHR is split among operators (75%), the state (16.25%), and charities (8.75%). Charitable gaming revenue has exceeded expectations, but there are concerns about ensuring equitable distribution to charities, particularly **legacy charities** that operated before HHR’s introduction.
- **Rent and Fees**: Charitable gaming facilities pay rent based on fair market value, with rents capped to ensure charities do not lose money. On average, about 10% of a charity’s revenue goes to operators. The commission explored applying similar revenue-sharing mechanisms to other gaming activities, such as simcast racing, which generates significant fees for municipalities.

---

### **3. Regulatory and Security Challenges**
- **Security Requirements**: While HHR facilities are required to have security plans, similar regulations do not exist for other games of chance. This regulatory gap was identified as an area needing attention.
- **Licensing and Oversight**: Operators must undergo a rigorous suitability review to obtain HHR licenses, with potential investigation costs but no additional license fees. The commission highlighted the need for clearer definitions in gaming laws, as terms like “casino” are not defined in New Hampshire statutes, despite many facilities marketing themselves as such.
- **Consolidation and Growth**: The gaming industry is experiencing consolidation, with larger facilities emerging. This raises questions about the number of charitable gaming locations and how to ensure equitable distribution of funds to charities. A moratorium on new HHR licenses is set to expire in June 2024.

---

### **4. Local and Societal Impacts**
- **Community Demands**: Communities hosting gaming facilities are experiencing increased demands for services, such as law enforcement and infrastructure. The commission suggested establishing a **mitigation fund** to reimburse local communities for these costs, similar to provisions in previous casino bills.
- **Problem Gambling**: While there has been a slight increase in calls related to problem gambling, it has not escalated at the same rate as gaming growth. The current dedicated fund for problem gambling services is deemed insufficient and may need to be expanded. **Breakage** (unclaimed winnings) is earmarked for problem gambling services.

---

### **5. Need for Expertise and Comparative Analysis**
- **Consultant and Expert Help**: The commission acknowledged the need for external expertise to analyze gaming regulations and revenue models. They discussed hiring consultants, potentially through a bidding process, and leveraging resources from organizations like **NICELG** (National Council of Legislators from Gaming States) for research and comparative analysis.
- **Regional Trends**: The commission emphasized studying gaming trends and regulations across New England, particularly how neighboring states like Massachusetts handle licensing fees and revenue distribution. This comparative analysis would help inform New Hampshire’s approach.

---

### **6. Long-Term Goals and Future Directions**
- **Roadmap for Charitable Gaming**: The commission aims to create a comprehensive guide for the legislature on how charitable gaming should evolve. This includes addressing regulatory gaps, ensuring equitable revenue distribution, and balancing the growth of gaming with the protection of charitable interests and responsible gambling practices.
- **Next Steps**: The commission plans to hold meetings every third week, starting November 6th, to stay on track for their November 2024 deadline. They also discussed logistical challenges, such as meeting room availability during legislative sessions.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need to balance the growth of charitable gaming with effective regulation, equitable revenue distribution, and the protection of local communities and problem gambling services. The commission’s work will focus on providing recommendations to the legislature, ensuring that charitable gaming in New Hampshire evolves in a way that maximizes benefits for charities while addressing regulatory and societal challenges. Future meetings will delve deeper into data on charity earnings, operator expenses, and regional gaming trends to inform these recommendations.
