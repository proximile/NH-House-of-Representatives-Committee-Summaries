The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee held a subcommittee work session on **House Bill 194 FN**, which aims to require the state's Division of Historical Resources to maintain and update a list of historical monuments and markers every 10 years, making it accessible to the public via a website. The bill is intended to support education and public awareness of historical sites in the state.

Key points from the discussion:

1. **Intent and Scope**: The bill's intent is to ensure the Division of Historical Resources maintains an updated inventory of historical monuments, markers, and sites. However, questions arose about the scope of what constitutes a historical item (e.g., graveyards, individual graves, plaques on houses) and how far the list should go.

2. **Cost and Implementation**: Concerns were raised about the potential cost and feasibility of implementing the bill. Representatives noted that the Division of Historical Resources had previously indicated in an email that the task could be absorbed within existing resources without additional funding. However, the absence of the division's director, Mr. Wilson, to provide direct testimony left some committee members uneasy about moving forward.

3. **Voluntary vs. Mandatory**: The bill does not mandate historical societies or local groups to provide information but encourages collaboration. Some representatives emphasized that historical societies are volunteer-based and should not be burdened with mandatory reporting.

4. **Amendment and Clarifications**: An amendment was proposed to clarify the bill's language and ensure it directs the correct department (Division of Historical Resources) to handle the task. However, without Mr. Wilson's input, there was uncertainty about whether the amendment fully addressed concerns.

5. **Next Steps**: The committee debated whether to recommend the bill for further study, send it to interim study, or proceed to a vote. Some members suggested requesting a formal letter from Mr. Wilson outlining the division's ability to implement the bill without additional costs, which could then be reviewed at the executive session on November 1st. If the letter satisfies concerns, the committee could vote to approve the amendment and the bill as amended. If not, the bill may be tabled or sent to interim study for further refinement.

Ultimately, the committee decided to leave the decision to the full committee, pending further input from the Division of Historical Resources. The subcommittee adjourned without taking a formal vote, deferring action until the executive session.
