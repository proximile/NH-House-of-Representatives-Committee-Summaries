**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (10/31/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on October 31, 2023, to discuss and vote on a series of bills and amendments related to election law. The session was marked by extensive debates on ranked-choice voting (RCV), primary election dates, and other procedural reforms, reflecting deep divisions and complex considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)**:
   - **HB 345 and HB 350**: The committee debated RCV for state primary and municipal elections. An amendment to HB 350 (2377H) sought to limit RCV to gubernatorial and federal Congressional races, but it failed. Both bills were ultimately reported as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), with votes of 12-8 and 14-6, respectively.
   - **Amendment 227Z and HB 115**: Amendment 227Z, added to HB 115, passed, but RCV-related measures faced significant opposition. Representative Howard introduced Amendment 2370 to enable RCV for gubernatorial and federal races, but it was ruled non-germane and pulled back.
   - **Arguments for and Against RCV**: Supporters argued that RCV ensures majority support for winners, reduces the spoiler effect, and is more efficient than runoff elections. Opponents raised concerns about transparency, complexity, and potential erosion of public trust in elections.

2. **Primary Election Dates**:
   - **HB 115**: The committee debated moving the primary election date from August to June. Amendment 2270H proposed setting the date to the third Tuesday in August, but some representatives preferred a June primary, citing benefits like stronger party cohesion and better general election preparation. The amendment and bill were still under discussion at the end of the session.
   - **HB 333**: This bill proposed changing the primary date and adding a runoff election if necessary. It was reported as ITL due to lack of consensus.

3. **Election Transparency and Procedures**:
   - **HB 243**: This bill involved establishing an election law portal and public tabulation of votes. Amendment 2394H extended the timeline for posting election tapes from 30 to 60 minutes, which passed 19-1. The bill was reported as "ought to pass as amended" (OTP) with a vote of 19-1.
   - **HB 476**: This bill allows the Secretary of State to conduct a second recount after an election. It was amended to address a specific recount issue in Manchester Ward 6 and passed unanimously (19-0).
   - **HB 447**: This bill authorized the Secretary of State to use funds for purchasing election equipment. An amendment made the funds less discretionary, and the bill was reported as OTP.

4. **Voter Registration and Ballot Access**:
   - **HB 463**: This bill establishes an election law portal. Amendment 2385H clarified that the portal would not allow verification of identity, age, or domicile by affidavit but would permit verification of citizenship by sworn statement. The bill passed as amended with a vote of 16-4.
   - **HB 116**: This bill adjusted filing fees for various offices. Amendment 2382H removed the $2 filing fee for state representatives, which passed 17-3. The bill was reported as OTP with a vote of 16-4.

5. **Other Bills and Amendments**:
   - **HB 387**: This bill allowed election ballots to be viewed upon request. It was reported as ITL after debate.
   - **HB 395**: This bill addressed the voter's guide for constitutional amendments. It was reported as ITL due to unresolved issues about drafting the guide.
   - **SB 156 and SB 158**: These bills focused on voter registration, identity verification, and absentee ballot outer envelopes. Both were reported as ITL.

### **Final Outcomes**
The meeting concluded with mixed results for election reform efforts. RCV-related measures largely failed to gain sufficient support, while bills focused on transparency, recounts, and procedural updates moved forward with amendments. The session highlighted the complexity of election law reform and the challenges of balancing innovation with public trust and efficiency.
