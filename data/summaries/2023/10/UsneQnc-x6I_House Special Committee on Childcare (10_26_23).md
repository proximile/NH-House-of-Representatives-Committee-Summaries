The transcript captures the opening and proceedings of a New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Childcare meeting on October 26, 2023. The chairperson called the meeting to order, led the Pledge of Allegiance, and initiated an executive session to discuss a retained bill, SB221. A motion to address the bill was made by Representative D. Simone and seconded. After no discussion, a roll call vote was conducted, resulting in a unanimous decision to pass the bill. The chairperson outlined plans to prioritize retained bills based on potential consensus, scheduling contentious issues for later. The meeting concluded with a reminder for committee members to sign in for mileage reimbursement, as the meeting fell outside standard constitutional provisions.
