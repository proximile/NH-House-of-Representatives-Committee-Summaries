The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare meeting, held on October 26, 2023, began with the chair calling the session to order and leading the Pledge of Allegiance. The committee moved into an executive session to discuss retained bill SB 221. A motion to retain the bill was made by Representative D. Simone and seconded, with no discussion. The committee then proceeded to a unanimous vote (8-0) in favor of retaining the bill. 

The chair outlined plans to schedule retained bills, prioritizing those with potential consensus for early discussion and deferring more contentious bills to later sessions. Before adjourning, the chair mentioned that Representative MC Williams might be eligible to claim mileage for attending the committee meeting, though this was not confirmed. The meeting concluded with instructions for members to sign in at the speaker's office.
