The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Retirement Benefits Commission meeting on October 12, 2023, focused on reviewing and discussing potential changes to the state’s retirement system, addressing funding constraints, benefit adjustments, and recruitment and retention challenges. The meeting was divided into two segments, covering a range of topics and proposals aimed at improving the retirement system while considering financial sustainability.

### Key Discussions and Proposals:

1. **Quorum and Minutes Approval**:  
   The meeting began with the confirmation of a quorum and the approval of previous meeting minutes without corrections.

2. **Revenue and Funding Constraints**:  
   Senator Bradley reported that September revenues were $37 million above expectations, bringing the year-to-date surplus to $36.4 million. However, he emphasized the need to account for the financial impact of the YDC settlement and the high costs associated with proposed retirement benefit adjustments.

3. **Proposed Retirement Benefit Adjustments**:  
   - **Senator Bradley’s Amendments**: Two amendments (2258 and 2259) were discussed, proposing changes to the retirement multiplier (2.25% and 2.5%) for group two members. These amendments aim to reduce the financial burden while enhancing benefits.  
   - **Senator Gray’s Proposal**: A suggestion to increase the multiplier to 2.5% for all group two members with over 20 years of service was introduced. This proposal was seen as a way to improve retention and attract new employees but would require further actuarial analysis.  
   - **Vesting Period Reduction**: The commission debated reducing the vesting period for pension eligibility from 10 to 5 years. Senator Waters and others noted that the financial impact might be minimal, but an actuarial analysis would be necessary to confirm this. Senator Bradley suggested filing a separate bill to allow for a full public hearing and analysis. A motion was made and amended to have Senator Waters or Senator Susi file the bill, which would then undergo a full actuarial review.

4. **Actuarial Analysis**:  
   The commission voted to request actuarial analyses for both Senator Bradley’s amended proposal (with changes suggested by Mr. R) and Senator Gray’s proposal. The cost for these analyses was estimated to be less than $10,000 and would be covered by the legislature.

5. **Broader Retirement System Issues**:  
   - **Part-Time Employees**: There was a discussion about extending retirement benefits to part-time employees, but concerns were raised about the complexity and potential costs. The commission decided not to pursue this idea at this time.  
   - **Earnable Compensation and AFC Calculations**: The commission briefly touched on changes to earnable compensation definitions and average final compensation (AFC) calculations, noting significant financial implications from previous legislative changes.

### Key Concerns and Themes:  
- **Financial Impact**: The commission is cautious about the financial implications of any changes, especially given the uncertainty of future revenues and the need to terminal fund any adjustments.  
- **Retention and Recruitment**: There is a strong focus on improving the retirement system to retain current employees and attract new ones, particularly in critical areas like public safety.  
- **Broader System Reforms**: While immediate changes are being considered, there is recognition of the need for broader reforms to address long-term sustainability and fairness in the retirement system.

### Conclusion and Next Steps:  
The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue exploring these issues and to make informed decisions based on the forthcoming actuarial analyses and revenue updates. The next meeting was scheduled for November 2, 2023, where updates on October revenues and the results of the actuarial analyses would be discussed.
