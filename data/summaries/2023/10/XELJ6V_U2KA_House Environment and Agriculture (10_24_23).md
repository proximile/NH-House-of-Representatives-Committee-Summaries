**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (10/24/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on October 24, 2023, to discuss and vote on several bills and amendments. The meeting also included the formation of a subcommittee to address landfill-related rulemaking. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Key Bills and Amendments:**

1. **HB 369 - Farm Energy Systems and Infrastructure**  
   The committee debated an amendment to create a program within the Department of Agriculture focused on farm energy systems and infrastructure, aiming to provide education and advising for farmers. Concerns were raised about the criteria defining a "farm," with some members arguing it could exclude beginning farmers or those with crops that take years to yield income. Despite these concerns, the amendment passed 11-8, and the bill was approved with the amendment. Additionally, the committee discussed a related task force for energy relief on farms, proposing an amendment to clarify the appropriation timeline and ensure program continuity.

2. **HB 493 - State Meat Inspection Program**  
   The committee voted to retain this bill, which proposes eliminating the state meat inspection program. The decision was influenced by an ongoing study of slaughterhouse facilities in the state, with members agreeing it was premature to remove the program before the study's completion. The bill passed unanimously on consent.

3. **HB 602 - Landfill Siting Permitting Process**  
   The committee debated an amendment to establish a two-step permitting process for landfill siting, with a preliminary application phase to identify unsuitable sites early. Supporters argued it would save time and resources for both applicants and the Department of Environmental Services (DES). Critics questioned its necessity, suggesting businesses already conduct thorough research. The amendment passed 13-6, and the bill was approved with the amendment.

4. **HB 37 - Study Committee on Companion Animal Groomers**  
   The committee voted to recommend Interim Study (ITL) for HB 37, which proposed establishing a committee to study best practices for companion animal groomers. The decision was based on the fact that a consumer guide for animal groomers is already being developed, making the study redundant.

5. **HB 122 - Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operations**  
   The committee voted ITL for HB 122, which aimed to regulate microenterprise home kitchen operations. An amendment was deemed non-germane, and the bill was considered not ready for prime time without further public input.

6. **HB 326 - Prohibiting Second-Generation Anticoagulants for Rodent Control**  
   The committee voted ITL for HB 326, which sought to prohibit the use of second-generation anticoagulants for rodent control. The decision was based on pending federal regulations expected to address the issue more comprehensively.

### **Subcommittee on Landfill Rules:**  
A subcommittee was formed to monitor the progress of rulemaking related to waste facility siting and landfill permitting. The subcommittee reviewed proposed amendments to the Env-Sw 800 rules, which govern landfill siting, design, operation, and closure. Key proposed changes include:
- Increasing setback requirements for landfills from 200 feet to 500 feet from surface water bodies.
- Updating flood hazard zone standards.
- Enhancing groundwater and surface water protection measures.  

The subcommittee discussed the need for follow-up meetings and public input, with a formal public hearing expected in early 2024.

### **Conclusion:**  
Throughout the meeting, committee members expressed varying opinions on the bills, with discussions focusing on balancing environmental protection, industry needs, and efficient government processes. The committee concluded its work for the year, with bills moving to the House floor for further consideration in January. Plans were also made for future discussions and follow-up sessions, particularly on landfill rules and the task force for energy relief on farms.
