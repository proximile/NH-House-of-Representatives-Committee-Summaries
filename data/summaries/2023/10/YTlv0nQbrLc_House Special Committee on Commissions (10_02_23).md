**Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (10/02/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Commissions convened on October 2, 2023, to review and evaluate the state's commissions and retained bills, with a focus on streamlining governance, reducing redundancy, and improving efficiency. The meeting highlighted several key discussions and action items:

1. **Review and Evaluation Process**:  
   The committee emphasized the importance of inviting agency representatives and commission chairs to provide insights into the necessity and status of specific commissions. This collaborative approach ensures informed decisions about whether to retain, amend, or repeal commissions. The committee noted that each commission would require approximately 15 minutes of discussion to assess its relevance or need for repeal.

2. **Amending Retained Bills**:  
   To enhance efficiency, the committee explored the possibility of amending retained bills rather than introducing new ones. This approach allows for quicker decision-making and reduces administrative burdens. Senate Bill 84 was identified as a potential model for amendments and will be reviewed during an upcoming work session on October 11.

3. **Educational Initiatives**:  
   The committee is developing a trifold brochure to guide legislators in proposing new committees or commissions. The brochure includes sections on purpose, research, and methods of study, and feedback is requested by the next meeting. Additionally, a continuing education program, initially scheduled for October 12, has been rescheduled to December 14. This session will focus on study committees and commissions to ensure legislators understand the process and best practices.

4. **Master List of Commissions**:  
   The committee is compiling a comprehensive master list of all commissions and committees, which will be updated by the next meeting on October 16. This list includes details such as creation year, current members, associated agencies, and status (e.g., active, inactive, or recommended for repeal). Commissions related to Health and Human Services and Education were identified as areas requiring significant review.

5. **Focus on Inactive or Redundant Commissions**:  
   The committee is prioritizing the review of commissions that have not met recently or are deemed redundant. The goal is to consolidate or eliminate unnecessary commissions to improve governance efficiency. The Speaker of the House recommended using existing retained bills to repeal such commissions.

6. **Collaboration with Agency Representatives and Committee Chairs**:  
   The committee stressed the importance of working closely with agency representatives to understand federal regulations and other factors influencing commission decisions. Additionally, involving chairs of various committees will enhance oversight and ownership of commissions under their purview.

7. **LSR Worksheet Development**:  
   A worksheet is being developed to assist legislators in drafting Legislative Service Requests (LSRs). This tool will serve as a guide rather than a formal template, ensuring clarity and consistency in proposals.

8. **Upcoming Meetings and Work Sessions**:  
   The committee scheduled a work session for October 11 to review specific retained bills, including Senate Bill 84. Another meeting is planned for October 16 to finalize the master list and continue discussions. The committee will also meet on October 30 to advance its work on commission reviews and recommendations.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the hard work by committee members and staff in compiling and analyzing the necessary information. The committee remains committed to efficient governance, clear guidelines, and collaborative efforts to streamline the stateâ€™s commission structure.
