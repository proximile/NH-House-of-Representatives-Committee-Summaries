The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on October 19, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 362-FN**, which addresses complaint procedures and cases before the Commission for Human Rights. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to streamline the process for human rights complaints, particularly focusing on allowing only complainants to remove cases to Superior Court. The original intent was to speed up the resolution of cases, which often take years to conclude.

2. **Performance Audit**: A performance audit of the Human Rights Commission is underway, expected to be completed by mid-February 2024. Some committee members argued that legislative action should wait until the audit results are available to address systemic issues comprehensively.

3. **Delays in Case Processing**: Concerns were raised about the lengthy delays in resolving cases, with some cases pending for several years. The backlog has persisted for decades, with historical data showing similar issues as far back as 2000.

4. **Committee Discussions**:
   - **Rep. Andrew**: Argued that throwing money at the problem isn’t the solution and emphasized the need to improve the system for the public.
   - **Rep. Lorenzo**: Suggested waiting for the audit results before making decisions, as the audit could reveal broader issues.
   - **Rep. Smith**: Advocated for a comprehensive approach rather than addressing small issues piecemeal, citing a history of unresolved problems.
   - **Rep. Katab**: Expressed concern about the immediate impact on complainants and the need to expedite cases, even while waiting for the audit.

5. **Human Rights Commission Challenges**:
   - The Commission is understaffed, with delays in posting new investigator positions despite budget allocations.
   - The Commission is moving to a larger office space to accommodate its growing needs.
   - There is a lack of a robust case management system, relying on outdated tools like Word and Excel.

6. **Legislative Action**:
   - The subcommittee voted **3-2** to recommend **“ITL” (Inexpedient to Legislate)**, meaning they recommend against passing the bill in its current form.
   - The committee agreed to revisit the issue after the performance audit is completed, with the possibility of introducing new legislation based on the audit’s findings.

7. **Public Testimony**: An employment lawyer, Beth Daran, emphasized that the bill was never intended to solve the overarching issues but to address a specific procedural concern. She urged the committee to consider the bill’s narrow focus.

8. **Follow-Up**: The committee plans to engage with stakeholders, including the Human Rights Commission and the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) audit team, to develop comprehensive solutions based on the audit results.

Overall, the committee acknowledged the long-standing issues with the Human Rights Commission but opted to wait for the audit before taking significant legislative action. The focus remains on improving the system to provide timely justice for New Hampshire citizens.
