**Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Commissions Meeting (October 16, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on Commissions convened on October 12, 2023, to discuss streamlining the state’s committees and commissions by reducing redundancies, improving efficiency, and ensuring their continued relevance. The meeting focused on reviewing specific commissions for potential repeal or amendment, refining legislative processes, and enhancing resources for lawmakers.

### Key Discussions and Actions:

1. **Review of Commissions and Committees**:
   - The committee examined a list of commissions and committees recommended for repeal or consolidation. Representative John Hunt shared feedback from members of four commissions—the County State Finance Committee, Air Pollution Advisory Committee, Commission on the Status of Health Coverage Markets, and Wet Memorial Committee—all of whom agreed their commissions could be dissolved.
   - The Wet Memorial Committee was a particular focus, with Representative Hunt suggesting the state assume its maintenance responsibilities rather than maintaining a separate commission.
   - Other commissions reviewed included the Wier Memorial Commission, the Commission on Demographic Trends, and the Interbranch Criminal and Juvenile Justice Council. Discussions centered on their necessity, effectiveness, and potential overlap with other state agencies.
   - The Long-Term Seacoast Commission on Drinking Water was highlighted for operational challenges, including difficulties in recruiting and retaining members, raising questions about its viability.

2. **Repeal and Amendment Proposals**:
   - The Air Pollution Advisory Committee was flagged for repeal, as it has not met in years and was deemed unnecessary by the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Services (DES).
   - The committee emphasized the importance of eliminating redundancies and consolidating efforts where possible, ensuring that remaining commissions are effective and necessary.

3. **Legislative Process and Training**:
   - The committee reviewed a trifold pamphlet distributed by Representative Fitzgerald, which outlines the process for establishing study committees and commissions. Members suggested improvements, such as converting bullet points to questions to encourage engagement, adding a QR code or URL for additional information, and making the pamphlet more user-friendly for new legislators.
   - Training sessions for new and returning members were discussed to ensure a proper understanding of the process for establishing and managing committees and commissions.

4. **Coordination and Communication**:
   - The committee outlined the legislative process for repealing or amending commissions, emphasizing the need for public hearings, executive sessions, and coordination between the House and Senate.
   - Clear communication with stakeholders and the public regarding proposed changes was identified as a priority.

5. **Future Actions**:
   - The committee planned to finalize a list of commissions to be repealed or amended by the next meeting on October 30th.
   - Continued refinement of the pamphlet and encouragement of participation in training sessions were highlighted as essential next steps.

### Overall Focus:
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to streamlining state commissions, eliminating redundancies, and ensuring that existing committees are effective and necessary. By refining legislative processes, improving resources for lawmakers, and fostering clear communication, the committee aimed to move forward with actionable recommendations in the coming weeks.
