**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Pt 2 (10/06/23)**  

The NH House of Representatives meeting on October 6, 2023, focused on **House Bill 554 (HB 554)** and **House Bill 303 (HB 303)**, which address issues related to healthcare, insurance, and access to non-opioid pain management therapies such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, and behavioral medicine. The discussion highlighted systemic challenges in healthcare, including provider reimbursement, insurance coverage, and the need for evidence-based, cost-effective care.  

### **Key Points from the Discussion:**  

#### **1. Chiropractors' Concerns and Insurance Dynamics**  
- Chiropractors expressed frustration with being "crowded out" of the healthcare market due to reduced insurance coverage for their services, such as fewer annual visits being covered.  
- The shift toward employer-driven healthcare plans (e.g., self-funded plans) and Medicare Advantage has further complicated reimbursement models, leading some providers to avoid insurance networks altogether and rely on cash-paying patients.  

#### **2. Healthcare Costs and Evidence-Based Care**  
- Participants debated the high costs of invasive medical procedures (e.g., spine surgery, epidural injections) compared to lower-cost alternatives (e.g., acupuncture, physical therapy).  
- Concerns were raised about insurance coverage favoring costly, invasive treatments with limited long-term effectiveness while excluding cheaper, evidence-based options.  
- The **fee-for-service model** was criticized for incentivizing high-cost procedures over preventive or low-cost care, underscoring the need for systemic changes to align financial incentives with high-value care.  

#### **3. Legislative Proposals: HB 554 vs. HB 303**  
- **HB 554**, introduced by Representative Lungren, was retained from the previous session but faced criticism for micromanaging medicine, duplicating existing statutes, and including unnecessary provisions. An ad hoc group revised the bill, eliminating about 90% of its content to focus on essential elements.  
- **HB 303** emerged from collaborative efforts among stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Acupuncture Association, Chiropractic Association, and behavioral health professionals. It emphasizes licensed practitioners, transparency in insurance coverage, and was inspired by a successful Massachusetts law that increased access to alternative therapies.  
- The committee leaned toward amending HB 554 to incorporate HB 303's language while retaining Representative Lungren's name on the bill for continuity.  

#### **4. Stakeholder Involvement and Strategic Considerations**  
- HB 303 was developed with significant stakeholder input, ensuring a balanced approach to addressing concerns with HB 554.  
- A key debate centered on whether to use "shall" (mandatory) or "may" (permissive) language in the bill. Proponents of "may" argued it aligns with existing laws and avoids conflicts with federal mandates, while others felt "shall" would ensure broader access to services.  

#### **5. Insurance Coverage and Market Dynamics**  
- Representatives discussed the inconsistent coverage of alternative therapies by insurance companies. While some services (e.g., chiropractic care, physical therapy) are already covered, others (e.g., acupuncture, massage) are not consistently included.  
- The conversation touched on the complexities of the insurance market, including fully insured vs. self-funded plans, and the impact of mandates on small businesses and individual markets.  

#### **6. Patient Education and Transparency**  
- There was a strong emphasis on the need for better patient education and transparency in insurance coverage. Representatives highlighted the challenges patients face in understanding their benefits and the importance of simplifying plan comparisons.  

#### **7. Legislative Recommendations and Next Steps**  
- After a lengthy discussion, the committee recommended **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** for HB 554 in its original form, concluding it would not significantly address underlying issues.  
- The focus shifted to supporting **HB 66**, which aims to pilot a more integrated, cost-effective healthcare model, as a more promising solution.  
- The committee also considered submitting an amendment to HB 554 to streamline it with HB 303's provisions, ensuring it moves forward without competing versions in different committees.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the complexities of legislating alternative pain management therapies, balancing stakeholder interests, and ensuring patient access while navigating insurance and market dynamics. The discussions highlighted the need for systemic healthcare reform to address cost, evidence-based care, and provider compensation models, with HB 303 and HB 66 emerging as more viable solutions compared to HB 554.
