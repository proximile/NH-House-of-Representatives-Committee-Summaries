### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Children and Family Law Subcommittee Meeting (10/03/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law subcommittee met on October 3, 2023, to discuss amendments to **House Bill 306** and **House Bill 455**, addressing key issues in parenting, family law, and child welfare. The discussions centered on parenting time, reunification therapy, access to children’s records, shared parenting, and judicial consistency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and debates:

---

### **Parenting Time and Travel Logistics**
The committee addressed challenges related to parenting time, particularly when one parent lives or works a significant distance from the child’s school. Amendments were considered to ensure that such logistical arrangements do not interfere with parenting time. The committee worked to define "significant distance" to provide clarity and address specific concerns in these cases.

---

### **Reunification Therapy**
House Bill 306 focused on defining and regulating **reunification therapy**, a practice aimed at repairing relationships between children and estranged parents. Concerns were raised about harmful practices under this umbrella, such as forced isolation, threats, or coercive tactics. A proposed amendment sought to explicitly prohibit court-ordered programs that could harm children, ensuring that only licensed, ethical therapists are involved. The committee also discussed the role of **forensic therapists**, questioning whether they should be explicitly excluded from performing clinical therapy to prevent misrepresentation.

---

### **Insurance Coverage for Court-Ordered Therapy**
The committee emphasized the importance of ensuring that court-ordered therapy is covered by insurance plans to avoid financial hardship for families. This was seen as a way to make therapeutic interventions more accessible and equitable.

---

### **Access to Children’s Records**
House Bill 455 sparked debate over whether both parents should have equal access to their children’s school, medical, and psychological records, even if one parent is not the primary custodian. Concerns were raised about schools and medical facilities sometimes denying access to one parent, despite existing parenting plans that ensure equal access. The committee explored ways to reinforce this right in the bill.

---

### **Shared Parenting Presumption**
A central debate revolved around whether the bill should include a **presumption of shared or equal parenting time** (e.g., 50/50 custody). Proponents argued that such a presumption would ensure both parents remain actively involved in their children’s lives. Opponents, however, expressed concerns that this could harm children in cases of domestic violence or abuse. Some representatives maintained that the current language of "frequent and continuing contact" is sufficient and avoids potential risks.

---

### **Fit Parent Definition**
The committee discussed defining a **"fit parent"** in the bill, drawing from existing DCYF (Division for Children, Youth, and Families) guidelines. A fit parent was generally understood as someone capable of providing for a child’s basic needs, including shelter, financial support, and safety.

---

### **Judicial Consistency**
Concerns were raised about inconsistencies in how judges interpret and apply parenting laws, with some judges not presuming equal parenting time. The bill aims to standardize judicial approaches to ensure fairness across cases. Additionally, the committee agreed to remove language requiring **"clear and convincing evidence"** in cases where one parent seeks sole custody, as it was deemed unnecessary.

---

### **Amendments and Refinements**
Several amendments were proposed to clarify language and address specific concerns. For example, the committee worked to refine definitions like "significant distance" and ensure that the bill’s language aligns with the best interests of the child. The committee unanimously agreed to bring the proposed amendments to the full committee for further consideration.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing parental rights, child welfare, and judicial discretion in family law cases. The committee aimed to create a fair and consistent framework that prioritizes the best interests of the child while addressing potential risks. The discussions reflected a collaborative effort to refine legislation and ensure equitable outcomes for families in New Hampshire. The meeting concluded with procedural discussions and adjournment.
