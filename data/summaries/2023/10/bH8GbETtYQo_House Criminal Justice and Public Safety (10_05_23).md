The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 5, 2023, centered on critical discussions around criminal justice and public safety, with a particular focus on bail reform, detention statutes, and systemic challenges in the stateâ€™s legal framework. The meeting highlighted the complexities of the bail system, the role of bail commissioners, and the need for equitable and consistent practices across the state. Key themes and takeaways from the session include:

### **Bail and Detention Statutes**
The committee examined the intricacies of bail and detention statutes, particularly for serious offenses such as murder and human trafficking. In cases where the maximum penalty is life without parole, state law mandates initial detention without bail. However, the discussion emphasized that bail decisions should be individualized, considering the specific circumstances of each case rather than applying blanket rules based on the offense type. This approach aims to balance public safety with fairness for defendants.

### **Role of Bail Commissioners**
Bail commissioners were identified as pivotal in the bail process, especially during off-hours and weekends. The committee underscored the importance of their independence, proper training, and fair compensation. Commissioners are tasked with determining the least restrictive conditions appropriate for each case, ensuring that bail decisions align with the principles of justice and public safety.

### **Challenges and Inconsistencies**
The committee acknowledged significant inconsistencies in bail practices across different counties, with some regions having more robust community corrections programs than others. Training for bail commissioners and uniformity in bail decisions were highlighted as areas needing improvement to ensure fairness and consistency statewide.

### **Electronic Monitoring and Alternatives to Incarceration**
Electronic monitoring was discussed as a viable alternative to incarceration, particularly for cases involving domestic violence or flight risk. However, its implementation depends on the availability of community corrections programs and adequate funding. While electronic monitoring is generally less costly than incarceration, it requires infrastructure and third-party oversight to be effective.

### **Pre-Trial Services and Community Corrections**
The committee explored the potential for expanding pre-trial services statewide to manage low-level offenders and reduce recurrent failures to appear in court. Such a system would involve tracking individuals and ensuring compliance with court requirements. Additionally, community corrections programs and diversion initiatives were emphasized as essential tools to reduce reliance on incarceration and improve outcomes for individuals in the criminal justice system.

### **New Hampshire Community Bail Fund**
Testimony from the New Hampshire Community Bail Fund highlighted its role in assisting individuals who cannot afford low cash bail. Established in 2018, the fund relies on grassroots donations and volunteers, primarily helping with misdemeanors such as trespassing, shoplifting, and driving with a suspended license. The fund has seen a significant increase in demand since 2020, with 215 bails averaging $331 in 2023. Many clients struggle with mental health and substance abuse issues, and the fund advocates for stable housing and treatment over incarceration.

### **Bail Reform Impact**
Bail reform in 2018 initially reduced the need for the bail fund, but subsequent legislative changes in 2020 increased demand. Testimony criticized the current bail system for being punitive rather than ensuring court appearances or public safety, particularly for low-level offenses. The fund and defense attorneys argued that many individuals are detained unnecessarily, leading to adverse consequences like job loss and family disruption.

### **Legal and Systemic Issues**
The meeting addressed systemic challenges, including delays in assigning public defenders, long pretrial detention periods, and inconsistencies in bail decisions. Public defender shortages were particularly concerning, with some individuals waiting up to a week for legal representation. These delays exacerbate the negative impacts of pretrial detention on defendants, especially those with mental health or substance abuse issues.

### **Proposed Changes**
The committee discussed potential reforms to the bail system, including lowering the burden of proof for bail decisions from "clear and convincing" to "preponderance of the evidence." While this change could streamline the process, concerns were raised about the potential for increased pretrial detention based on lower evidentiary standards.

### **Looking Ahead**
The committee plans to gather further insights by hearing from the superintendent of Rockingham County and pre-trial service providers. These testimonies will inform best practices and potential costs for implementing a statewide pre-trial system.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for systemic reforms to address inequities in the bail system, improve access to legal representation, and provide better support for individuals with mental health and substance abuse issues. By focusing on training, consistency, and alternatives to incarceration, New Hampshire aims to create a more just and effective criminal justice system.
