**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (10/20/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 20, 2023, focused on critical issues related to criminal justice and public safety, particularly the ongoing drug crisis, bail reform, and alternative sentencing programs. The discussions emphasized the need for a multifaceted approach to address these challenges, combining stricter enforcement, community engagement, and expanded support systems. Here are the key highlights:

### **Addressing the Drug Crisis**
1. **Prevalence of Fentanyl and Methamphetamine**: The meeting highlighted the dominance of fentanyl and methamphetamine in the drug market, with fentanyl being significantly stronger and cheaper than heroin. Concerns were raised about these substances being laced into other drugs, such as marijuana, leading to unintentional addiction.

2. **Stricter Measures for Drug Dealers**: Speakers advocated for stricter measures against drug dealers, particularly those involved in large-scale operations. Proposals included implementing mandatory minimum sentences and creating a RICO-like law specifically targeting drug dealers to deter trafficking.

3. **Support for Addicts**: While emphasizing accountability for dealers, speakers stressed the need for treatment and alternatives to incarceration for low-level addicts. Personal stories, such as that of a former drug dealer and addict, underscored the transformative power of education and support received during incarceration.

4. **Community and Policing**: The lack of police presence in high-crime areas was criticized, with calls for better relationships between law enforcement and communities. Specific officers, like Abby Coet, were praised for their community engagement efforts.

5. **Call for Action**: Speakers urged lawmakers to take decisive action, warning that without meaningful changes, the drug problem will persist and continue to affect future generations.

### **Criminal Justice and Bail Reform**
1. **Alternative Sentencing Programs**: Testimonies from experts like Allison Welsh, the Treatment Court Coordinator from Cheshire County, highlighted the success of drug courts and behavioral health courts in reducing incarceration rates and providing alternative sentencing options. These programs have also resulted in significant cost savings compared to traditional incarceration.

2. **Juvenile Diversion and Restorative Justice**: The Juvenile Diversion Program in Cheshire County was discussed as an effective way to redirect young offenders away from the criminal justice system. Additionally, the Restorative Justice Program, overseen by Patrick Henahan, was noted for its focus on problem-solving and community collaboration.

3. **Challenges and Resource Needs**: Workforce shortages in behavioral health services and the need for expanded resources, especially in rural communities, were identified as ongoing challenges. The role of electronic monitoring (EM) in pre-trial programs was also discussed.

4. **Criticism of Current Reforms**: Community member Jesus Lopez shared his personal experiences growing up in a challenging environment and criticized current bail and prison reform efforts as ineffective. He advocated for minimum mandatory sentences for drug dealers and more visible law enforcement actions, such as buy-and-bust operations, to deter drug trafficking and restore community trust.

### **Call for Legislative Action**
Speakers across both segments emphasized the urgent need for bipartisan cooperation to implement effective solutions. They called for a combination of stricter enforcement for drug dealers, expanded support systems for addicts, and community-based initiatives to address the root causes of crime and addiction.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of addressing the drug crisis and criminal justice reform. While alternative sentencing programs have shown promise, there is a pressing need for stricter measures against drug dealers and expanded resources for treatment and community engagement. Lawmakers were urged to act decisively to ensure public safety and prevent future generations from facing the same challenges.
