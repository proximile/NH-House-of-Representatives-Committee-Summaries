**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting for Unitary Business Under the Business Profits Tax (10/02/2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a commission to evaluate the implications of adopting **Worldwide Combined Reporting (WCR)** for unitary businesses under the Business Profits Tax (BPT). The commission’s goal is to assess whether requiring multinational corporations to report and pay taxes on their global income in New Hampshire, rather than just income earned within the state (the current "water’s edge" method), would be beneficial or detrimental. The discussion highlighted a range of arguments, concerns, and uncertainties surrounding the potential implementation of WCR.

### **Key Arguments for WCR:**
1. **Tax Fairness**: Proponents argue that WCR would address **transfer pricing abuses**, where multinational corporations shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, reducing their tax liability in New Hampshire. This would ensure that all businesses, including multinationals, pay their "fair share."
2. **Revenue Potential**: WCR could capture more income, particularly from foreign entities, potentially increasing state tax revenues. However, estimates like the $177 million figure from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) were questioned for methodological flaws, and the exact revenue impact remains uncertain.
3. **Moral Imperative**: Some legislators believe it is a **moral issue** to ensure equal tax treatment for all businesses, regardless of their ability to use transfer pricing strategies.

---

### **Key Arguments Against WCR:**
1. **Complexity and Burden**: WCR would significantly increase the **administrative burden** for businesses, tax practitioners, and the New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration (DRA). Compliance and auditing would become more complex and resource-intensive, involving challenges like currency exchange, international accounting standards, and language barriers.
2. **Risk of Retaliation**: New Hampshire could face **retaliation from other countries** or states, potentially harming local businesses and the state’s economic competitiveness.
3. **Dilution of Revenue**: By including global income in the tax base, the **denominator of the apportionment formula** would increase, potentially diluting New Hampshire’s tax revenue rather than increasing it.
4. **Outlier Status**: New Hampshire would become an **outlier** as no other state or the federal government uses WCR. This could deter investment and business activity in the state.
5. **Uncertain Outcomes**: The impact of WCR is **unpredictable**, with winners and losers among businesses varying year to year, making it difficult to estimate revenue gains or losses.

### **Additional Considerations:**
1. **Transfer Pricing**: While WCR would neutralize transfer pricing by eliminating related-party transactions, it may not fully address profit-shifting to tax havens.
2. **Guilty Tax**: New Hampshire already taxes **Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)** at 50%, which partially captures foreign income. Moving to WCR would eliminate this tax but introduce new uncertainties.
3. **Market-Based Sourcing**: New Hampshire’s recent shift to **market-based sourcing** adds complexity, as it requires determining where the benefit of a service is received, potentially diluting New Hampshire’s tax base further.
4. **Federal vs. State Approach**: The federal government uses **arm’s length pricing** and tax credits for foreign taxes paid, while states rely on formulary apportionment. This distinction complicates the adoption of WCR.
5. **Historical Context**: The discussion referenced changes in federal and state tax laws since the 1980s, which may have mitigated some of the issues that WCR aims to address. Historical data from the 1986 transition from worldwide to water’s edge reporting provided limited insight into potential impacts.

### **Stakeholder Perspectives:**
The commission heard from various stakeholders, including proponents (e.g., Mr. Opal, Mr. Garros) and opponents (e.g., Ms. Beeson, Mr. Pasetsky from the Global Business Alliance) of the proposal. Neutral perspectives were provided by Professor Hellerstein, who offered historical context. Practitioners, represented by Matt Foley of the New Hampshire Society of CPAs, highlighted the significant compliance burden on businesses, including the need to gather and report apportionment data for foreign entities.

### **Next Steps:**
The commission agreed to draft sections of the report reflecting different viewpoints (pro, con, and neutral) and to finalize the report in the next meeting on October 17th. The final report will be submitted by November 1, 2023, to assist the House Ways and Means Committee in evaluating HB 121, a bill on combined worldwide reporting. The commission will dissolve thereafter.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the complexity of the issue, with members weighing potential benefits against significant challenges and uncertainties. While the **moral and fairness arguments** for WCR were acknowledged, concerns about its **complexity, unpredictability, and potential negative economic impacts** were prominent. The commission emphasized the need for further analysis to determine whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks, particularly given New Hampshire’s unique tax structure and the lack of precedent for WCR in other states. The final report will aim to provide a comprehensive analysis to guide legislative decisions.
