**Summary of the New Hampshire Joint Committee on Tax Expenditure Review Meeting (10/20/23)**

The New Hampshire Joint Committee on Tax Expenditure Review convened on October 20, 2023, to evaluate various tax credit programs and their impacts on the state budget. The committee reviewed several key programs, discussed their effectiveness, and considered potential adjustments. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Key Programs Reviewed:**

1. **Business Enterprise Tax (BET) Credits**:  
   The committee examined the auditing and verification process for BET credits, emphasizing improved information sharing between the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and the New Hampshire Insurance Department, facilitated by RSA 21-J:14. No significant issues were identified, and the program was left unchanged.

2. **Community Development Finance Authority (CDFA) Credits**:  
   Under RSA 162-L:10, businesses can claim a tax credit equal to 75% of their contributions to the CDFA, with an annual cap of $5 million and a five-year carryforward provision. The committee considered increasing the cap to $7.2 million but ultimately recommended maintaining the current program. However, the CDFA later requested an increase to $10 million to meet growing demand, citing significant economic benefits from the program.

3. **Economic Revitalization Zone (ERZ) Credits**:  
   The ERZ program, which supports job creation and infrastructure improvements in designated zones, is oversubscribed, with applicants receiving only 37.4% of requested credits. In 2022, the program generated $192 million in investments and 858 jobs, with 94% of jobs paying at least $18 per hour. While the program’s effectiveness was debated, the committee decided not to recommend changes.

4. **Coos County Job Creation Credits**:  
   This program provides tax credits for new full-time jobs in Coos County, ranging from $750 to $1,000 per employee depending on wage levels. In 2022, $222,200 in credits supported 225 jobs across 39 businesses. With no cap and no significant issues, the program was left unchanged.

5. **Insurance Premium Tax Credits**:  
   Credits against insurance premium taxes totaled $3.7 million in FY2023, with 141 companies claiming the majority under the BET. No credits had been taken in the previous four years, and the committee decided not to recommend changes to this program.

6. **Credit Carryover and Carry Forward Liabilities**:  
   The committee expressed concern about the fiscal impact of the credit carryover program, particularly a potential $61 million hit to the state budget in 2027. They recommended that the DRA review the program and consider spreading out the impact over a longer period, such as reducing the credit by 50 basis points each biennium until it reaches 100%.

   Additionally, the DRA provided an update on credit carry forward liabilities, estimating a fiscal impact of $38.8 million in refunds from 2023 to 2030. The largest impact is expected in 2029 due to the 100% cut-off.

### **Next Steps and Recommendations:**  
The committee agreed to draft a report summarizing their recommendations and review it at their next meeting. They also discussed scheduling future meetings to evaluate other tax credit programs, such as the Children’s Scholarship Fund.  

### **Overall Focus:**  
The committee’s primary focus was on assessing the effectiveness of various tax credit programs and their fiscal impacts on the state budget. While most programs were left unchanged due to their current effectiveness, there was notable discussion about increasing funding for the CDFA and addressing the fiscal challenges posed by credit carryover liabilities. The meeting highlighted the need for continued evaluation and potential adjustments to ensure these programs align with the state’s economic and budgetary goals.
