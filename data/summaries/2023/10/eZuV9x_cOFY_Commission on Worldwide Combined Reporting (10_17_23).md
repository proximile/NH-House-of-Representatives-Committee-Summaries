### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting Meeting (10/17/23)

**Description:**  
The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting convened to examine the implications of shifting from the current "Water's Edge" method to "Worldwide Combined Reporting" for unitary businesses under the Business Profits Tax (BPT). The meeting focused on the potential benefits, challenges, and fairness of adopting a worldwide reporting system, with extensive discussions on administrative burdens, tax fairness, and economic impacts.

### Key Discussions and Themes:

1. **Challenges of Worldwide Combined Reporting**  
   - Members expressed concerns about the administrative and compliance burdens associated with adopting worldwide reporting. The current system, which uses federal tax returns as a starting point, simplifies tax determination for New Hampshire businesses. A shift to worldwide reporting could complicate the process for both taxpayers and the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA).  
   - The complexity of auditing and enforcing worldwide reporting was highlighted, particularly given that no other state or the federal government has implemented such a system.

2. **Transfer Pricing and Tax Fairness**  
   - The commission discussed how multinational corporations might use transfer pricing to shift profits out of New Hampshire, creating an uneven playing field between domestic and foreign businesses.  
   - Representative Shamberg argued that the Water's Edge method disadvantages domestic businesses by favoring foreign multinationals, emphasizing the need for tax fairness, transparency, and a level playing field.  
   - Other members debated whether the current system is neutral or inherently biased, with some arguing that multinationals exploit accounting methods unavailable to domestic companies.

3. **Historical Context and Legal Precedents**  
   - The commission reviewed the history of New Hampshire's tax laws, including the 1986 repeal of certain tax laws and the shift to the Water's Edge method. Legal cases like *Smith v. Department of Revenue* were referenced to argue that long-standing tax policies may need reevaluation if they lead to inequities.  
   - It was noted that New Hampshire has never enforced worldwide combined reporting, even when it was technically the law, raising questions about the state's ability to implement such a system.

4. **Economic Impact and Alternatives**  
   - Members discussed the potential economic impact of adopting worldwide reporting, including the possibility of increased tax revenue. However, concerns were raised about the lack of clear benefits, as evidenced by reports from Maine and Rhode Island, which opted against adopting the system due to administrative challenges.  
   - Alternatives to worldwide reporting were proposed, such as adjusting the taxation of foreign income or increasing transparency through country-by-country reporting.

5. **Constitutional and Practical Considerations**  
   - The commission explored constitutional issues related to tax policy, including the Commerce Clause and equal protection.  
   - Practical concerns were raised about the state's ability to enforce worldwide reporting and the potential for unintended consequences, such as increased complexity and compliance costs for businesses.

6. **Next Steps and Final Report**  
   - The commission planned to meet again to finalize its report, incorporating feedback and refining recommendations. Drafts of the report were to be circulated for review, with the final report due by November 1st.  
   - Members emphasized the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach to tax policy reform, considering both the potential benefits and drawbacks of worldwide combined reporting.

### Conclusion:  
The meeting reflected a complex and nuanced debate over the potential shift to worldwide combined reporting. While some members argued for the system as a means of ensuring tax fairness and transparency, others highlighted the administrative, legal, and practical challenges of such a change. The commission's discussions underscored the need for careful consideration of the economic, constitutional, and operational implications before making any significant changes to New Hampshire's tax policy. The final report will aim to provide a balanced assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of adopting worldwide combined reporting for unitary businesses under the BPT.
