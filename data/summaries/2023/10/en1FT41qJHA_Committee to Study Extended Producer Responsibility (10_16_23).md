**Comprehensive Summary: Committee to Study Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Meeting (10/16/23)**

On October 16, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee to Study Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) convened to explore legislation aimed at reducing the financial burden on municipalities for solid waste disposal. The meeting focused on EPR policies, which hold producers accountable for the end-of-life management of their products, particularly packaging. The discussions and testimonies highlighted the urgency of addressing waste reduction and the potential benefits of EPR for public health, the environment, and economic opportunities.

### Key Points and Discussions:

1. **EPR Policies and Benefits**:  
   The committee noted that over 100 EPR policies exist across 33 states, targeting products such as plastics, electronics, paint, carpet, mattresses, and pharmaceuticals. EPR can reduce waste, lower toxins, and decrease costs for municipalities while protecting public health and the environment. New Hampshire has the opportunity to adopt EPR legislation, drawing from successful policies in other states and countries like Canada, which has implemented EPR since the 1990s.

2. **Shared Responsibility**:  
   The committee emphasized the need for shared responsibility among producers, consumers, and municipalities. While producers would take on more accountability for waste management, consumer education and behavior changes were also deemed essential for reducing waste.

3. **Industry Involvement**:  
   Representatives from the American Chemistry Council acknowledged the inevitability of EPR legislation and stressed the importance of industry involvement in the legislative process. They expressed concerns but recognized the need for collaboration.

4. **Draft Legislation**:  
   A draft EPR bill, modeled after policies in New York and Maine, was discussed. The draft aims to minimize consumer packaging and set reduction goals. However, some committee members felt the draft was one-sided and lacked a consumer education component.

5. **Consumer Education**:  
   Several members highlighted the importance of an education campaign to inform consumers about recycling and sustainable practices. They argued that combining consumer behavior changes with producer responsibility is critical for effective waste reduction.

6. **Free Market vs. Regulation**:  
   The debate included differing views on the role of the free market versus government regulation. Some members argued that the free market could drive change if consumers were educated, while others pointed to the failures of unregulated markets in addressing public health and environmental issues.

7. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee voted to move forward with the draft legislation, allowing for further amendments, particularly to include an education component. The goal is to submit the bill to the Legislative Service Request (LSR) list for consideration in the next legislative session.

### Testimonies and Perspectives:

- **Clark Corson**, co-founder of Collaborative Solid Waste Strategies, emphasized the importance of shifting the burden of waste management from consumers to manufacturers. He highlighted that EPR is a relatively new concept in the U.S., with 23 bills pending in New England states, eight of which are likely to pass soon. Corson urged the committee to allow the full House to debate the proposed bill, calling it a matter of serious importance.

- **Cynthia Walter**, a retired scientist and co-director of the Dover New Hampshire Plastic Reduction Group, provided detailed testimony on the health impacts of toxic chemicals in packaging. She explained how EPR could reduce exposure to harmful substances, improve public health, and create economic opportunities by promoting non-toxic packaging solutions. Walter also stressed the importance of defining safe recycling practices to prevent the spread of toxins.

- **Cindy Heath**, convenor of the New Hampshire Network Plastics Working Group, shared insights from her experience in community planning and waste management. She noted that municipalities, businesses, and consumers in New Hampshire are already taking steps to reduce plastic waste and pollution. Heath supported EPR legislation as a way to expand existing programs, increase waste diversion, and ensure the safe disposal of toxic products. She referenced Maine's EPR law as a potential model for New Hampshire, highlighting its comprehensive list of chemicals of concern.

### Conclusion:  
The meeting underscored the growing challenges of waste management and the need for EPR legislation to address these issues. The testimonies and discussions highlighted the potential benefits of EPR, including reducing environmental and health impacts, promoting sustainable packaging solutions, and alleviating municipal costs. The committee recognized the importance of collaborative efforts between producers, consumers, and government to implement effective EPR policies in New Hampshire. The next steps involve refining the draft legislation, incorporating consumer education, and advancing the bill for further legislative review.
