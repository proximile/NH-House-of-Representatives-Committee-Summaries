The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting, chaired by Representative Sellers, began with the Pledge of Allegiance. The primary agenda was to vote on **HB 55 FN**, a bill related to driver education. The committee had previously failed to vote on the bill, so this meeting was convened to address it. Representative Sellers invited additional testimony or comments on the bill but received none. 

A motion was made and seconded to place the bill in **interim study**, meaning further examination and analysis would be conducted before any final decision. Committee members agreed that the bill involved complex and "dicey" moving parts, and further study was necessary to avoid rushing into a decision. The motion passed unanimously, and the bill was referred to interim study. 

The meeting concluded shortly after the vote, with no further business or discussion.
