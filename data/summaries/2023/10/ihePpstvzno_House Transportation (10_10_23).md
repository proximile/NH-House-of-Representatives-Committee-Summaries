The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting, chaired by Representative Sellers, focused on discussing and voting on **HB 55 FN**, a bill related to driver education. The committee reconvened to address the bill, as it had not been voted on in the previous session. Representative Sellers opened the meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance and invited any additional testimony or discussion on the bill.

A motion was made to recommend the bill for **interim study**, citing the complexity of the issue and the need for further examination of its moving parts. Committee members agreed that the bill required more thorough study rather than rushing into a decision. The motion was seconded, and after brief discussion, the committee voted unanimously in favor of sending the bill to interim study.

The meeting concluded shortly after the vote, with no further business to address.
