### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Meeting (10/17/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on October 17, 2023, addressed a wide range of topics, including blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), PFAS regulation, healthcare insurance claims processing, and other consumer affairs issues. Here’s a detailed overview of the discussions:

---

### **1. Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**  
The committee focused on a proposed amendment to create a legal framework for DAOs in New Hampshire, aiming to modernize the state’s legal infrastructure to support blockchain-based organizations. Key points included:  
- **Purpose**: The amendment seeks to grant DAOs legal personhood, similar to LLCs or corporations, enabling them to own property, hire employees, and limit liability for members.  
- **Definition and Examples**: DAOs are decentralized, internet-based entities governed by blockchain technology, used in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), crowdfunding, and humanitarian efforts (e.g., Ukraine DAO).  
- **Legal Safeguards**: To address concerns about misuse (e.g., fraud, terrorism), the amendment includes provisions for compliance with anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws. The Attorney General would have authority to revoke legal protections for illegal activities.  
- **Registration and Transparency**: DAOs would need to register with the Secretary of State, post their code and bylaws publicly, and appoint a legal agent for accountability.  
- **Economic Benefits**: The initiative could position New Hampshire as a leader in blockchain innovation, attracting economic development.  
- **Implementation**: Most provisions would take effect on January 1, 2025, with immediate action required to develop registration procedures.  
- **Philosophical Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the alignment of DAOs’ decentralization and autonomy with libertarian ideals, but the bill emphasizes that DAOs remain subject to state laws.  
- **Future Refinements**: The bill is considered a starting point, with expectations of further amendments as the technology and legal landscape evolve.

### **2. PFAS Regulation**  
The committee reviewed bills aimed at banning PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in products like food packaging, carpets, children’s toys, and dental floss. PFAS, linked to cancer and environmental contamination, was a major concern.  
- **Proposed Measures**: A clearinghouse system would require vendors to certify their products as PFAS-free.  
- **Interim Study**: The committee decided to place the bills on interim study to refine them and ensure alignment with EPA regulations.

### **3. Toilet Facilities in Restaurants**  
A bill to repeal the requirement for restaurants to provide toilet facilities was discussed, as building codes already address this issue. The committee unanimously passed the bill as amended.  

---

### **4. Liquor Commission Bill**  
A brief discussion occurred on a bill related to the Liquor Commission, with proposed amendments to maintain current penalties for violations while allowing flexibility for the commission.

### **5. Healthcare Insurance Claims Processing**  
Significant attention was given to the complexities of healthcare claims processing, particularly under the **Prompt Pay Law (RSA 420-J)**. Key points included:  
- **Timely Processing**: The law requires claims to be processed within **15 days (electronic)** or **30 days (paper)** if they are "clean" (complete and accurate). If additional information is requested, the clock stops and restarts once the information is received, with **45 days** to adjudicate the claim.  
- **Delays and Denials**: Claims often remain in "pending" status indefinitely, creating financial burdens for providers and patients. Common reasons for denials include incomplete information, duplicate claims, and disputes over medical necessity.  
- **Proposed Legislation**: A bill would require insurers to pay claims as "clean claims" if not processed within 45 days after receiving additional information.  
- **Interest Penalties**: Current law mandates interest on late payments, but enforcement is inconsistent.  
- **Systemic Issues**: Challenges include electronic medical record glitches, staffing shortages, and ongoing issues with certain carriers.  
- **Provider and Patient Impact**: Delayed payments strain providers, who are contractually prohibited from balance billing patients for in-network services.  
- **Insurance Department Oversight**: The New Hampshire Insurance Department monitors compliance and mediates disputes but cannot intervene in contractual matters.  
- **Future Steps**: The committee plans to revisit the bill on November 7th and explore alternative solutions, such as better tracking and reporting mechanisms.

### **6. Health Insurance Mandates and Coverage**  
Discussions also covered health insurance mandates, reproductive health coverage, and chronic pain management:  
- **Health Insurance Mandates**: Implementing new mandates without imposing costs on small employers and individuals remains a challenge.  
- **Reproductive Health Coverage**: A cost study highlighted the broad range of services that could be covered, leading to high cost estimates. More specific parameters are needed to reduce costs.  
- **Chronic Pain Management**: A bill aimed to expand insurance coverage for non-pharmaceutical treatments like acupuncture and chiropractic care, with the goal of reducing emergency room visits and improving patient outcomes.

### **7. Collaborative Efforts and Regulatory Role**  
Throughout the meeting, representatives and stakeholders emphasized the importance of collaboration between providers, carriers, and regulators to address billing and payment issues. The New Hampshire Insurance Department plays a key role in enforcing regulations and mediating disputes, though legislative solutions have limitations.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s efforts to balance innovation with legal safeguards, particularly in emerging areas like blockchain technology, while addressing pressing consumer and healthcare issues. The discussions underscored the complexities of legislative solutions and the need for ongoing collaboration and refinement to achieve effective outcomes. Future sessions will focus on advancing the blockchain registry initiative, refining PFAS legislation, and improving the healthcare claims process.
