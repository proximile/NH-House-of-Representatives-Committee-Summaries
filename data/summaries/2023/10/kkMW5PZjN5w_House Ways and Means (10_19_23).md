**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (10/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on October 19, 2023, to address a range of legislative issues, including gaming, taxation, and agricultural funding. The meeting focused on several key bills, amendments, and scheduling matters, with significant discussions on revenue recovery, charitable gaming, and tax policy. Here’s a cohesive summary of the proceedings:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

#### **1. Gaming and Revenue Recovery**
   - **SP 190 (Betting and Revenue Recovery)**: The committee debated SP 190, which addressed companies taking bets under federal law without adhering to New Hampshire regulations, potentially costing the state significant revenue. Concerns were raised about simulcast racing and unlicensed betting operations. The committee voted 15-4 to "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate) the bill, effectively killing it for the session. However, Senator Lang is expected to introduce a related bill in January 2024 to address these issues.
   - **Historic Horse Racing (HHR) and Charitable Gaming**: The committee discussed the impact of HHR on charitable gaming revenues, noting that only 3% of gross HHR revenues go to charities, compared to 35% from table games. Concerns were raised about HHR potentially cannibalizing other charitable gaming revenues. An amendment (2336) proposed by Representative Ducet seeks to impose a moratorium on new HHR licenses and eliminate rent payments from charities to casino owners. A public hearing on this amendment is planned before a final decision is made.
   - **SP 112 Amendment (HHR Moratorium)**: Senator Lang proposed an amendment to SP 112, extending a moratorium on HHR licenses for four years while allowing incremental growth for existing operators. The amendment aims to balance free market concerns with the need for data from the Charitable Gaming Commission before making long-term decisions.

#### **2. Tax Policy Amendments**
   - **HP 450 (Net Operating Loss Deduction)**: The committee reviewed several amendments to HP 450, including removing the 80% cap on net operating loss deductions and extending the carryover period from 10 to 20 years. The committee approved an amendment to restore the deduction to 100% while maintaining a 10-year carryforward limit and capping the amount at $10 million. The bill passed unanimously but raised questions about its fiscal impact and placement on the consent calendar.
   - **SB 190 (Advanced Deposit Wagering Tax)**: The committee considered SB 190, which modernizes the tax structure for advanced deposit wagering (ADW) in horse racing. The bill aligns the tax rate for online wagering with in-person wagering at 1.25%, ensuring consistency and legality in taxing ADW.

#### **3. Agricultural Funding**
   - **HB 494 (Agricultural Product Testing Fund)**: The committee discussed an amendment to HB 494, which renames the "Scale Testing Fund" to the "Agricultural Products Regulatory Fund" to better reflect its purpose. The amendment aims to streamline funding for testing and regulating agricultural products like fertilizers and animal feed. It passed unanimously and is expected to improve efficiency in agricultural regulatory activities.

#### **4. Scheduling and Future Plans**
   - **Final Meeting of the Year**: The committee scheduled its final meeting for November 9, 2023, at 9:30 AM. The agenda includes public hearings and executive sessions on several bills:
     - HP 11 (Worldwide Combined Reporting)
     - HP 192 (Interest and Dividend Tax)
     - HP 569 (State Education Property Tax)
     - SP 112 (Public hearing and executive session)
   - **Minority and Majority Reports**: Representatives DuSet and Aly were tasked with preparing the majority and minority blurbs, respectively, for the ITL decision on SP 190.
   - **Interim Study Request**: Representative Aly expressed interest in arguing for an interim study on the issues discussed, though it was unclear if this would be allowed.

### **Key Takeaways**
- The committee is focused on addressing revenue recovery issues, particularly in gaming, with a strong push for the Attorney General to pursue unlicensed betting operations.
- Concerns about the impact of HHR on charitable gaming revenues led to proposals for a moratorium on new licenses and the elimination of rent payments from charities to casino owners.
- Tax policy amendments, particularly to HP 450, aim to provide relief to businesses by restoring full net operating loss deductions and extending carryover periods.
- HB 494’s amendment seeks to streamline agricultural funding and improve regulatory efficiency.
- The committee plans to hold a public hearing on the HHR moratorium amendment and finalize decisions on several bills at its November 9 meeting.

The meeting concluded with final scheduling details and a reminder of the November 9 meeting to wrap up all remaining business for the year.
