The NH House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Subcommittee held a work session on October 24, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 609**. The focus was on finalizing a proposed amendment to the bill, which aims to improve the **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)** process for energy and transmission projects in New Hampshire. The subcommittee had previously reviewed the draft amendment, and members expressed general agreement that while the amendment may not be perfect, it represents a significant step toward streamlining the process and improving efficiency.

Key points discussed:
1. **Purpose of the Amendment**: The amendment seeks to address inefficiencies in the SEC process, which has faced criticism for delays and opposition to new energy projects, such as the Northern Pass and a wind project that took six years to license.
2. **Chair of the SEC**: The amendment retains the existing structure where the chair of the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)** also serves as the chair of the SEC. This structure has been in place since the late 1990s, and there was no compelling reason proposed to change it.
3. **Public Interest Safeguards**: The amendment aims to balance streamlining the process with protecting public interests.
4. **Next Steps**: The subcommittee voted unanimously to recommend the amendment to the full committee. The amendment will be formalized and debated further at the full committee's executive session on **November 6, 2023**, before potentially moving to the full House and Senate for additional discussion and possible tweaks.

The meeting was brief, with members acknowledging the amendment as a positive step forward, despite its imperfections.
