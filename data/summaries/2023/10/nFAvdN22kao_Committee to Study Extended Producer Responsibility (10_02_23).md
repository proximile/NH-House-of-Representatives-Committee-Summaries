### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Committee to Study Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Meeting (10/02/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee to Study Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) convened on October 2, 2023, to explore EPR as a mechanism to reduce waste, lower municipal tax burdens, and achieve waste reduction goals. The discussions focused on shifting the responsibility and costs of managing waste, particularly packaging, from municipalities and consumers to producers. Key points from the meeting include:

#### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **EPR Goals and Scope**:
   - The committee emphasized its narrow statutory mandate: to study EPR and propose legislation aimed at reducing municipal tax burdens, rather than addressing broader waste management issues like composting or waste-to-energy technologies.
   - The overarching goal of EPR is to incentivize producers to adopt more sustainable packaging and waste management practices, thereby reducing waste flow and environmental impact.

2. **EPR Models and Implementation**:
   - The committee explored various EPR models, including state oversight versus Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs). PROs, funded by industry, manage day-to-day operations, while the government sets guidelines and enforces regulations. This model was seen as potentially more efficient due to industry input.
   - The committee discussed modeling EPR after Maine’s sustainability fund, where businesses using problematic packaging are charged fees to cover disposal costs, incentivizing better packaging design.

3. **Monitoring and Oversight**:
   - Questions were raised about how to monitor packaging materials entering the state and the associated costs. Suggestions included involving the Department of Environmental Services (DES) or private organizations to track and charge fees for disposal.
   - Michael Norc from DES testified that the department is not currently resourced to administer an EPR program, highlighting the need for proper oversight and funding if such a policy is implemented.

4. **Incentives and Costs**:
   - The committee discussed whether businesses adopting EPR could receive tax incentives to produce more environmentally friendly packaging without passing costs to consumers. However, creating a new tax structure for this purpose was not advocated.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential for EPR costs to be passed on to consumers, particularly low-income individuals. The committee debated how to ensure that manufacturers bear the costs rather than shifting them to consumers.

5. **Packaging and Waste Streams**:
   - The discussion focused on the need to address single-use packaging and other waste streams like electronics, paint, and mercury. The committee considered whether EPR should be comprehensive or targeted at specific problem areas.
   - The importance of incentivizing producers to use recyclable or biodegradable packaging, rather than mandating specific packaging types, was emphasized. The aim is to reduce environmental impact and waste disposal costs.

6. **Examples from Other Jurisdictions**:
   - The committee referenced EPR programs in states like Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, and Colorado, as well as in Europe. These examples were used to argue for proactive measures in New Hampshire to avoid becoming a dumping ground for waste from other states.
   - Successful programs like PaintCare were highlighted as models for industry-led EPR initiatives.

7. **Concerns and Challenges**:
   - Some committee members expressed concerns about the effectiveness of EPR in other states and whether it benefits all parties. Others emphasized the urgency of addressing waste issues in New Hampshire, advocating for immediate action rather than a "wait-and-see" approach.
   - The complexities of implementing EPR, including balancing costs, ensuring industry accountability, and protecting consumers, were acknowledged.

#### **Next Steps and Legislative Action**:
- The committee aimed to draft a report by November, summarizing findings from other states and international jurisdictions, and possibly recommend legislation. Members acknowledged the limited time frame (45 days) but emphasized the importance of making progress.
- The committee agreed to continue exploring EPR models, gather more data from other states, and consider how to structure legislation that balances industry responsibility, consumer costs, and environmental benefits.
- The goal is to develop a policy that reduces waste flow, lowers municipal costs, and encourages sustainable practices among producers, with the possibility of presenting legislation based on the committee’s findings.

#### **Conclusion**:
The meeting highlighted the complexities of implementing EPR legislation, including the need for further study, proper oversight, and funding. While there were concerns about costs and effectiveness, the committee recognized the urgency of addressing New Hampshire’s waste management challenges. By drawing on successful models from other states and regions, the committee aims to develop a balanced and effective EPR policy that benefits the environment, municipalities, and consumers.
