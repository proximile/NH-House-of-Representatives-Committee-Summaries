**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Resources, Recreation and Development – 10/11/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 11, 2023, focused on several key legislative topics, including the protection of loon nesting sites, regulation of temporary seasonal docks, drone usage in state parks, and the preservation of public monuments. The discussions emphasized balancing environmental protection, public safety, and historical preservation with practical enforcement and cost considerations.

### **1. Protection of Loon Nesting Sites and Temporary Seasonal Docks**
The meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to protect loon nesting sites from disturbances caused by temporary seasonal docks, inflatables, and boat traffic. Key points included:
- **Legislative Gaps and Enforcement**: The original bill aimed to address gaps in oversight by empowering the Fish and Game Department to enforce temporary restrictions near nesting sites. The Lakes Region Conservation Council (LPC) and Loon Preservation Committee (LPC) currently monitor nesting areas but lack comprehensive enforcement mechanisms.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Amendments sought to expand existing statutes (e.g., RSA 212-A) to include temporary docks and inflatables as potential threats to nesting sites. However, concerns were raised about the broadness of the amendment and its enforceability, with Fish and Game noting that existing laws already protect endangered species.
- **Balancing Act**: The bill emphasized the need for Fish and Game to assess specific circumstances, such as the distance of a dock from a nest, to determine necessary restrictions. Collaboration with stakeholders like the LPC was highlighted as essential for effective protection.

### **2. Drone Regulations in State Parks**
The committee debated proposed amendments to regulate drone usage in state parks, focusing on takeoff and landing within park boundaries. Key discussions included:
- **Safety and Privacy Concerns**: The amendment aimed to address privacy and safety issues by regulating drone operations, particularly in crowded park areas. It avoided overlapping with federal regulations by focusing solely on takeoff and landing, which fall under state jurisdiction.
- **Federal vs. State Jurisdiction**: Representatives acknowledged the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) authority over airspace but sought to establish state-level rules for ground operations. California’s drone regulations were cited as a potential model for designated launch areas and time restrictions.
- **Liability and Enforcement**: Concerns about liability for drone-related incidents were addressed, with clarification that the state would not be liable, similar to other recreational activities. The amendment aimed to provide a framework for safer and more controlled drone usage in parks.

### **3. Public Monuments and Historical Preservation (House Bill 194)**
The committee reviewed House Bill 194, which requires the Division of Archives and Records Management to compile and maintain a list of public monuments in New Hampshire. Key points included:
- **Scope and Costs**: Representatives debated whether the bill should include monuments maintained by local and state authorities, such as historical markers, cemeteries, and war memorials. Concerns were raised about the feasibility, workload, and costs associated with compiling and maintaining the list.
- **Educational and Historical Value**: The bill was framed as a way to enhance civic education and preserve state history, with an emphasis on making historical information accessible to students and the public.
- **Bipartisan Subcommittee**: Due to the bill’s complexity and divided opinions, the committee decided to form a bipartisan subcommittee to refine the bill’s scope, costs, and implementation details.

### **4. Sewer Company Issues (House Bill 186)**
House Bill 186 addressed issues with a sewer company relationship that resulted in taxpayers bearing a disproportionate financial burden (25% of their county budget). Key points included:
- **Flaws and Amendments**: The bill was found to have significant flaws during initial hearings, and no amendments were proposed at the time. The sponsor requested the opportunity to revise the bill based on feedback.
- **Retention for Further Work**: The committee agreed to retain the bill for further review and potential amendments in an executive session.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Environmental Protection**: Discussions on loon nesting sites and temporary docks highlighted the importance of balancing wildlife protection with practical enforcement, relying on Fish and Game’s expertise and collaboration with stakeholders.
2. **Regulation and Safety**: The drone regulation amendment focused on state-level control of takeoff and landing in parks, addressing safety and privacy concerns while avoiding federal overlap.
3. **Historical Preservation**: House Bill 194 emphasized the educational and historical value of public monuments, though concerns about scope and costs led to further refinement.
4. **Legislative Process**: The committee demonstrated a cautious approach, retaining bills like HB 186 and HB 194 for additional review and amendments to address concerns before moving forward.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of collaboration, flexibility, and careful consideration in crafting legislation that addresses environmental, safety, and historical priorities.
