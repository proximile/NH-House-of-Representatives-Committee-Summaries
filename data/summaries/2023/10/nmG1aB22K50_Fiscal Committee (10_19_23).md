**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (10/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on October 19, 2023, to address a wide range of issues, including COVID-19 vaccine distribution, Medicaid funding, mental health workforce licensing, refugee programs, and the sustainability of federally funded initiatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **COVID-19 Vaccines and Vaccine Mandates**
1. **Vaccine Distribution Challenges**: Representative F highlighted difficulties faced by nursing homes in accessing COVID-19 vaccines, which are more readily available in pharmacies for the general public. The state is exploring ways to assist long-term care facilities, especially since the federal government’s role in vaccine distribution has diminished following commercialization.
2. **School Vaccine Mandates**: The committee confirmed that COVID-19 vaccines would not be added to the list of required vaccinations for school entry. There are no plans to mandate the vaccine for children in schools or childcare settings.
3. **Safety and Efficacy Concerns**: Representative Edwards raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for children under 18, requesting specific clinical studies to support their use. The state emphasized that vaccine decisions should be made in consultation with primary care physicians.

### **Health and Human Services Issues**
1. **Hampstead Hospital**: Senator Rosenwald inquired about ongoing issues at Hampstead Hospital, including frequent police calls for assaults and the status of the contract with service provider Wellpath. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) acknowledged challenges and noted leadership changes to improve safety and care. A new Request for Proposal (RFP) for the contract is expected in November.
2. **Medicaid Expansion Funding**: Representative Edwards questioned the funding mechanisms for Medicaid expansion, particularly the sources of the non-federal share. Discussions included the roles of the Liquor Commission, the Health Plan assessment, and premium tax revenue. Detailed written responses were promised.
3. **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**: The committee congratulated DHHS on the successful implementation of Medicaid reimbursement rate adjustments, which have received positive feedback from industry professionals.
4. **Medicaid Eligibility for Asylum Seekers**: Representative Ver asked about Medicaid eligibility for asylum seekers who are in the country lawfully but have not yet been adjudicated. The response clarified that only emergency medical situations are covered for those not legally authorized to be in the U.S.

### **Mental Health Workforce Licensing**
1. **Performance Audit Findings**: The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) presented a performance audit on mental health workforce licensing, identifying barriers such as prolonged application processes and inconsistent requirements for out-of-state applicants. Twelve recommendations were made, with six requiring legislative action.
2. **Key Recommendations**: The committee discussed streamlining licensing processes, addressing exam requirements, and enhancing license portability through compacts and reciprocity agreements. Senator Rosenell offered to include these recommendations in a bill she has already filed.
3. **Collaboration**: The LBA, the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), and licensing boards were commended for their collaborative efforts in addressing these issues.

### **Refugee Programs and Federal Funds**
1. **Concerns About Refugee Influx**: Representative Edwards expressed concerns about the potential strain on state resources due to an influx of refugees and asylum seekers, particularly given the challenges faced by neighboring states like Massachusetts. He requested information on how federal funds would be used to manage impacts on housing, workforce, and general funds.
2. **Eligibility Clarifications**: The response clarified that the refugee program only serves individuals who have been vetted and granted status prior to entering the U.S., and asylum seekers are not eligible for these funds.

### **Sustainability of Federally Funded Programs**
1. **Rebalancing Demonstration Program**: Representative Edwards questioned the sustainability of a rebalancing demonstration program funded by federal dollars, expressing concern that it might eventually require state funds if federal support ends. The response indicated that the program is expected to continue receiving federal funding.
2. **ARPA Funds**: The committee reviewed the acceptance of ARPA funds, with discussions on how these funds would address long-term care and hospital boarding issues.
