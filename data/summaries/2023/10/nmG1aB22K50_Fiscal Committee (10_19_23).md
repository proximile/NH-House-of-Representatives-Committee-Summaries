**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting on October 19, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on October 19, 2023, addressing a wide range of fiscal, health, and human services issues, as well as legislative and procedural challenges. The meeting was structured into several segments, covering opening formalities, old and new business, and concluding with a focus on Medicaid funding and mental health professional licensing.

**Opening and Administrative Matters**
The meeting began with the chairperson calling the session to order and the committee accepting the minutes from the previous meeting without discussion. The consent calendar was reviewed, with several items, particularly those related to Health and Human Services (HHS), removed for further discussion. The remaining items on the consent calendar were adopted.

**Old Business and Ongoing Concerns**
Committee members expressed frustration over the absence of key officials, including the Attorney General and the administrator of a fund, who were expected to provide updates on legislative changes to address a specific problem. This lack of communication and delays were a recurring theme throughout the meeting, highlighting broader concerns about the state's ability to manage critical issues effectively.

**Health and Human Services Discussions**
1. **Refugee Program**: Representative Edwards raised questions about the state’s preparedness for potential refugee influxes, particularly from the southern border, and the impact on state resources. HHS officials acknowledged the complexity of the issue and the need for further research.
2. **Vaccine Programs**: Items related to vaccine programs, including COVID-19 vaccines, were discussed. Representative Edwards expressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for children under 18. HHS officials clarified that the state only supports federally approved vaccines and emphasized the importance of individual consultations with healthcare providers.
3. **Hamstead Hospital**: Senator Rosenwald and other members voiced concerns about safety and management issues at Hamstead Hospital, including frequent police calls and the need for a new contractor. HHS officials acknowledged the challenges and assured the committee that they are working on improvements and plan to reissue an RFP for the contract.
4. **Medicaid Expansion**: Representative Earth asked several broad questions about the annual report on the Medicaid expansion program, requesting written responses due to the complexity of the issues.

**Medicaid Funding and Mental Health Professional Licensing**
1. **Medicaid Funding and Grant Advantage Program**: The committee discussed the funding of the non-federal share of Medicaid, which includes profits from the Liquor Commission through the Alcohol Prevention and Treatment Fund and the New Hampshire Health Plan assessment. The federal match for the Grant Advantage Program is 90%, with the remaining 10% covered by other funds, including a 2% premium tax on health insurance policies and liquor profits.
2. **Licensing Barriers for Mental Health Professionals**: A performance audit report highlighted barriers to entry for mental health professionals in New Hampshire. While the state’s licensing requirements generally align with national standards, some board procedures unnecessarily prolong the application process. Recommendations included streamlining the application process, improving license portability, and developing rules for licensing processes.
3. **Legislative Actions and Recommendations**: Six recommendations from the audit may require legislative action, including clarifying language in laws, removing negated language, and addressing exam requirements for marriage and family therapists and clinical mental health counselors. The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) is working on interim rules to facilitate portability and has already processed hundreds of applications under new rules.
4. **Compacts and Reciprocity**: The discussion touched on the benefits of participating in multi-state compacts, which can facilitate license portability and data sharing between states. New Hampshire is part of the Mental Health Compact, which requires a national exam for participation. There was caution about accepting other exams due to potential unintended consequences on portability.

**Closing and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with the chairperson asking if there was anything else to address before entertaining a motion to adjourn. After some confusion or discussion about an underlying bill, with one member expressing uncertainty about its details but agreeing to review it later, the committee voted to adjourn. The next meeting was scheduled for November 9th at 10 a.m. The committee plans to work on legislative changes based on the audit recommendations, with some members already filing bills to address these issues. The OPLC will continue to develop rules and processes to streamline licensing and improve portability for mental health professionals.

Overall, the meeting underscored ongoing concerns about state programs, particularly in health and human services, and the need for better communication, proactive management, and legislative action to address these issues effectively.
