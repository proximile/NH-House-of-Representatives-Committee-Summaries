**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Criminal Justice and Public Safety (10/12/23)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on October 12, 2023, focused on critical issues in criminal justice and public safety, with discussions centered on pre-trial services, diversion programs, data integration systems, and their impact on efficiency, cost savings, and public safety. The meeting highlighted successful models from Strafford and Marat Counties, as well as the potential for implementing advanced data analytics systems like North Carolina’s CJ Leads in New Hampshire.

### **Pre-Trial Services and Diversion Programs**
1. **Strafford County’s Success**:
   - Strafford County has achieved a low 9% failure-to-appear rate through its pre-trial assessment programs, which use scientifically studied tools to evaluate defendants’ community ties, employment status, and criminal history.
   - The county’s pre-trial programs monitor individuals in the community using tools like electronic monitoring, drug testing, and curfews, tailored to individual needs. These programs have been nationally recognized for reducing jail overcrowding and providing judges with more sentencing options.
   - The programs are cost-effective, with an 8:1 cost savings compared to incarceration, and also include post-conviction monitoring to prevent reoffending.
   - Infrastructure and support services, such as transitional housing, job assistance, and mental health services, are key to the program’s success.

2. **Marat County’s Approach**:
   - Marat County’s pre-trial services operate independently from the county attorney’s office to ensure neutrality. Pre-trial officers monitor individuals on bail, using electronic and alcohol monitoring, with costs covered by the individuals.
   - The program supervises approximately 160 individuals, with 70% compliance rates. It emphasizes risk mitigation by addressing clients’ needs (e.g., housing, mental health, substance misuse) and connecting them with resources.
   - Challenges include limited access to mental health and substance use treatment and overlapping supervision responsibilities with probation and parole departments.
   - The county is implementing a new database system (North Point) to improve program tracking and exploring billing Medicare for mental health services.

3. **Statewide Considerations**:
   - Smaller counties, like Coos, face challenges in implementing similar programs due to limited resources and infrastructure, while larger counties could benefit significantly.
   - The state often orders counties to monitor individuals on pre-trial release without reimbursing costs, leading to financial strain on county budgets.
   - The committee discussed the potential for expanding pre-trial programs statewide, emphasizing the need for standardized practices, funding, and infrastructure.

### **Data Integration and Analytics: The CJ Leads Model**
1. **SAS Institute Presentation**:
   - The SAS Institute presented its Criminal Justice Law Enforcement Automated Data Services (CJ Leads) system, used in North Carolina, which integrates data from courts, law enforcement, corrections, probation, and DMV to provide a comprehensive view of offenders.
   - The system enhances public safety and operational efficiency by offering real-time data updates, access controls, user training, and auditing. It supports research, trend analysis, and forecasting, and includes a juvenile justice service directory.

2. **System Features and Benefits**:
   - The system is cost-effective, leveraging existing data systems, and has shown to improve data quality and operational efficiency.
   - It supports real-time access for officers, bail commissioners, and courts, and can generate pre-trial reports for evidence-based bail and release decisions.
   - The system is extensible, allowing integration with other systems like child welfare for comprehensive support and risk assessment.

3. **Potential for New Hampshire**:
   - Adopting a similar system in New Hampshire could address siloed data issues, particularly for bail commissioners and courts, by providing real-time access to critical information.
   - Implementation would require addressing technical, legal, and organizational challenges, including data privacy concerns and interagency cooperation.
   - The system ensures data privacy and security through strict access controls and encryption, and can be tailored to New Hampshire’s specific needs and legal requirements.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the effectiveness of pre-trial and diversion programs in reducing costs, improving outcomes, and enhancing public safety. Strafford and Marat Counties serve as models for other jurisdictions, though challenges remain in resource allocation and statewide implementation. The introduction of advanced data integration systems like CJ Leads offers a promising solution to streamline criminal justice processes, improve decision-making, and support research and forecasting. The committee emphasized the importance of collaboration, funding, and infrastructure to successfully adopt these programs and systems statewide.
