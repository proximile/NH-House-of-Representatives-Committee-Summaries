**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting (10/30/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting of the Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting for Unitary Businesses under the Business Profits Tax (BPT) to address the implications of adopting worldwide combined reporting (WWCR). The discussions centered on the competitive disadvantages faced by New Hampshire domestic businesses, constitutional considerations, and the potential impact of WWCR on tax policy.

### Key Discussions and Findings

1. **Competitive Disadvantage for Domestic Businesses**:  
   The commission highlighted the inequity in the current tax system, where New Hampshire domestic businesses pay BPT on 100% of their taxable profits, while foreign multinationals with subsidiaries benefit from the Water's Edge provision. This provision allows foreign companies to obscure their full operations in the state by excluding income from subsidiaries outside the U.S., creating an unlevel playing field. Domestic subsidiaries, in contrast, are subject to taxation on their income, while foreign subsidiaries are not.

2. **Constitutional Considerations**:  
   The commission referenced the 1999 legal case *Caterpillar Inc. v. New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration*, which upheld the constitutionality of the Water's Edge method under the Commerce Clause. However, concerns were raised about the fairness of this method, as it treats foreign and domestic subsidiaries differently. The commission debated whether WWCR, which would require foreign multinationals to report worldwide income, could address these disparities without violating constitutional principles.

3. **Report Draft and Recommendations**:  
   The commission reviewed and finalized a draft report, which included historical context, constitutional analysis, and the impact of transfer pricing on tax revenue. Key findings included:  
   - The lack of credible methodology to estimate potential tax revenue gains from WWCR.  
   - Insufficient evidence to justify such a radical change in tax policy.  
   The majority report recommended that New Hampshire not proceed with WWCR and not adopt HB 1221, which proposed WWCR. However, it acknowledged that future alternative methods might be needed to address transfer pricing abuses.

4. **Minority Report**:  
   Representative Shamberg presented a minority report, arguing that the Water's Edge method disadvantages domestic businesses and allows foreign multinationals to reduce their tax liability. The minority report supported adopting WWCR to level the playing field and cited IRS initiatives to combat transfer pricing abuse as evidence of the need for reform.

5. **Methodology Debate**:  
   The commission debated the credibility of existing methodologies used to estimate the revenue impact of WWCR. It concluded that current estimates were based on broad conjecture and lacked a sound factual foundation, further reinforcing the majority's recommendation against WWCR.

### Final Actions and Next Steps

The commission voted to adopt the majority report, with one dissenting vote, emphasizing that the adoption did not imply approval of the recommendations but merely reflected the committee's actions. The report, which included the majority's findings and recommendations as well as the minority report as an attachment, was to be filed by November 1st. Further discussions on the topic were planned in the House Ways and Means Committee on November 9th.

### Conclusion

The meeting underscored the complexities of tax policy reform, particularly in balancing fairness for domestic businesses with constitutional and practical considerations. While the commission ultimately recommended against adopting WWCR, it acknowledged the need for continued exploration of alternative solutions to address transfer pricing abuses and ensure a more equitable tax system for New Hampshire businesses.
