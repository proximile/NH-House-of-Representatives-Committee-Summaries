### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Subcommittee Meeting on October 10, 2023

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Subcommittee convened on **October 10, 2023**, to deliberate on two significant privacy-related bills: **House Bill 314 (HB 314)** and **Senate Bill 255 (SB 255)**. The discussions centered on the regulation of personal information collection and use, addressing concerns in both the public and private sectors. Key points and outcomes from the meeting are summarized below:

---

#### **House Bill 314 (HB 314)**
HB 314 primarily targets the **public sector's use of personal information**, though it also addresses privacy concerns in the private sector. Key aspects include:
- **Scope**: The bill focuses on preventing third-party service providers (e.g., internet service providers, telephone companies, utilities) from using personal information for purposes beyond the service provided unless explicit consent is given.
- **Amendments Proposed**:
  - **Private Right of Action**: Concerns were raised about allowing private rights of action for unrelated uses of personal information, which could lead to excessive litigation. Amendments were proposed to limit such actions to government entities and require proof of actual damages.
  - **Sovereign Immunity**: New Hampshire’s sovereign immunity statute restricts lawsuits against government entities unless intentional harm or a failure of duty of care is demonstrated.
  - **Clarifications**: Amendments aimed to standardize definitions, include data minimization requirements, and carve out exemptions for state agencies to continue their essential functions.
- **Small Businesses**: The bill addresses privacy concerns for smaller businesses not covered by SB 255, though its application to small businesses sparked debate.

#### **Senate Bill 255 (SB 255)**
SB 255 focuses on **private sector privacy protections**, particularly for large companies. Highlights include:
- **Modeled After Other States**: The bill draws inspiration from privacy laws in states like Virginia and Connecticut, emphasizing consumer consent, data minimization, and data protection impact assessments for businesses handling sensitive data.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - **Global Opt-Out**: Allows consumers to automatically opt out of data sales and targeted advertising. However, implementation is delayed due to technological challenges.
  - **Threshold**: Applies to businesses collecting data from **100,000 or more consumers**. Some members argued for lowering this threshold to align with states like Delaware (35,000) and Montana (50,000) to include smaller or minority-targeted businesses.
  - **Exemptions**: Entities covered by federal laws like the **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)** and **HIPAA** are exempt, which critics argued could allow tech companies to avoid compliance if a small part of their business falls under these laws.
- **Enforcement**: Unlike HB 314, SB 255 does not allow private rights of action. Instead, the **Attorney General** is empowered to bring actions for violations.

#### **General Discussion and Debates**
- **Overlap and Focus**: There was consensus that **HB 314** should focus on government entities, while **SB 255** should address private sector concerns. However, concerns were raised about the overlap between the two bills, with some members suggesting prioritizing SB 255 first and revisiting HB 314 later.
- **Constitutional Considerations**: The committee debated whether New Hampshire’s recent constitutional amendment on privacy applies only to government actions or also to private entities. The consensus leaned toward it being limited to government actions.
- **Data Minimization**: Highlighted as a critical feature of stronger privacy laws, though its implementation in SB 255 was seen as limited to sensitive data.
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Suggestions were made to strengthen enforcement, such as allowing limited private rights of action for specific violations or injunctive relief.

---

#### **Next Steps**
- **Reconvening**: The subcommittee plans to reconvene on **October 24, 2023**, to review proposed amendments for both bills.
- **Final Recommendations**: The goal is to finalize recommendations for the full committee by **November 8, 2023**, ensuring a thorough and deliberate process.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for clear, balanced privacy legislation that protects consumers while addressing concerns from both the public and private sectors. While **SB 255** was seen as a broader framework for large companies, **HB 314** was viewed as essential for addressing smaller businesses and government-related privacy issues. The committee emphasized the importance of aligning with other states’ privacy laws and ensuring practical, enforceable measures to safeguard personal information.
