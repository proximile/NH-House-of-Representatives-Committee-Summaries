The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court met on October 17, 2023, to discuss issues related to guardians ad litem (GALs), parenting coordinators, and mental health evaluations in family court cases. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Guardians Ad Litem (GALs):**  
   - Questions were raised about the specificity of GALs' roles, their ability to make recommendations, and the consistency of their reports.  
   - Concerns were expressed about the affordability of GALs, as many parties cannot afford their services, leading to delays in cases.  
   - The committee discussed the need for funding to make GAL services more accessible, especially for low-income families.  
   - There was a suggestion to expand the qualifications for GALs beyond attorneys to include professionals with backgrounds in psychology, social work, or counseling.  

2. **Mental Health and Substance Use Evaluations:**  
   - The committee discussed the challenges parties face in obtaining mental health or substance use evaluations, particularly when they are unable to afford them.  
   - Judges often leave it up to the parties to arrange evaluations, which can lead to delays and complications in cases.  

3. **Parenting Coordinators:**  
   - The potential role of parenting coordinators in reducing conflict and improving outcomes in high-conflict cases was explored.  
   - The committee considered whether parenting coordinators could help alleviate the burden on judges by facilitating resolutions between parties.  

4. **Funding and Resources:**  
   - The lack of dedicated funding for GALs and mental health evaluations was a recurring theme. The committee discussed the need to allocate resources to support these services.  
   - The labor shortage and the difficulty in attracting qualified professionals at current rates were also noted as challenges.  

5. **Pro Bono and Volunteer Services:**  
   - The committee explored the possibility of pro bono GAL services but acknowledged that the availability of such services is limited.  

6. **Next Steps:**  
   - The committee plans to reconvene in early November to continue discussions and report findings.  
   - Members expressed a commitment to addressing the funding and resource gaps to ensure fair access to GALs and related services for all parties in family court cases.  

Overall, the meeting highlighted the need for systemic improvements in the Family Division, particularly in terms of funding, accessibility, and the expansion of professional roles to better serve families in high-conflict cases.
