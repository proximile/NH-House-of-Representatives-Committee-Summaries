**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on House Rules (10/10/23)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on October 10, 2023, to address a range of procedural and legislative matters, focusing on residency requirements, constitutional violations, late filing requests, and improvements to House rules. The discussions emphasized the need for clarity, timely action, and procedural integrity. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **Residency and Constitutional Concerns**  
A significant portion of the meeting centered on residency issues and constitutional violations. A representative raised concerns about a member who was not living in their district but continued to vote, violating the state constitution. The issue had gone unaddressed for months, prompting calls for clearer and more timely notifications to the House about such violations. The Attorney General’s letter detailing the residency issue was criticized for being overly lengthy and complex, with suggestions to streamline such notifications to essential facts to ensure swift action.  

To prevent similar situations, there was a discussion about improving the process for notifying the House and relevant committees about residency issues. Proposals included limiting the scope of notifications and ensuring they are sent promptly to the Speaker, majority and minority leaders, and the Legislative Administration Committee. Additionally, **Representative Weber** proposed a bill requiring the Attorney General to notify the House if a member is found to be residing outside their district, which the committee approved for late drafting.

### **Procedural Improvements and Bipartisan Cooperation**  
The meeting highlighted the need for procedural improvements and bipartisan collaboration to address constitutional violations and conflicts of interest. A historical rule from the early 1800s, which prohibited members from taking fees or acting as advocates for causes before the legislature, was brought up as a potential model for preventing modern-day lobbying abuses. There was a call to revive and update this rule to ensure fairness and integrity in legislative processes.  

The House also approved a motion to allow late drafting of legislation, with an understanding that it would be completed within a week. This decision was supported by an 8-to-1 vote, reflecting a commitment to flexibility while maintaining procedural discipline.  

### **Approval of Minutes and Deadlines**  
The committee approved the minutes from the April 25, 2023, meeting and discussed deadlines for reporting house bills. Concerns were raised about the short time frame for reviewing complex bills, especially those requiring input from multiple committees. Suggestions were made to extend deadlines to allow more thorough review and deliberation.

### **Late Filing Requests**  
Several late filing requests were considered:  
- **Representative Davis** requested a late filing for a bill addressing timber taxes in Coos County, citing new information that emerged after the filing deadline. The committee approved the request.  
- **Representative McGuire** sought permission to reintroduce House Bill 593, related to asset forfeiture in drug offenses, which had been retained by the Criminal Justice Committee. McGuire proposed splitting the bill into three parts for better manageability, but the committee denied the request, citing concerns about setting a precedent for reintroducing bills still under committee review.  
- **Representative Lunno** requested a late filing to reintroduce House Bill 626, which had been "indefinitely postponed" (ITL) due to a vote by a representative later found to be ineligible to serve. The committee denied the request, emphasizing the importance of maintaining procedural integrity and avoiding the reopening of past decisions.  

### **General Discussion and Integrity Concerns**  
The meeting included extensive debate about the implications of reopening past legislative decisions, the integrity of the House, and the balance between addressing urgent issues and maintaining procedural norms. Concerns were raised about potential precedents, the separation of powers, and the impact on ongoing criminal investigations. The committee emphasized the importance of upholding procedural integrity while addressing unforeseen issues.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting concluded with a reminder of deadlines for sign-offs on late drafting and an acknowledgment of the need for continued discussion and improvement in House procedures. The discussions underscored the House’s commitment to addressing constitutional violations, improving notification processes, and maintaining procedural integrity while fostering bipartisan cooperation to tackle complex legislative challenges.
