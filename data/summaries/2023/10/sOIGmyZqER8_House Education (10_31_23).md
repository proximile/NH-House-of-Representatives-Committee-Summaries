**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (October 31, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on October 31, 2023, to discuss several key bills addressing critical issues in education, including teacher shortages, literacy, mental health education, charter school funding, and special education advisory council membership. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

### **1. Teacher Shortages and Loan Forgiveness (House Bill 623)**  
The committee reviewed **House Bill 623**, modeled after a successful program in Idaho, which aims to establish a **teacher candidate loan forgiveness program** to address teacher shortages in critical areas, particularly in rural and underserved districts. Key points included:  
- **Purpose**: The bill offers up to $122,000 in loan forgiveness over four years to attract and retain teachers in high-need areas such as science, mathematics, and special education.  
- **Target Areas**: The program focuses on rural and Title I-eligible districts, with debate over whether to expand it to other shortage areas like occupational therapy and speech-language pathology.  
- **Funding**: The bill includes an appropriation, but the exact cost is unclear, necessitating further financial analysis.  
- **Concerns**: Committee members emphasized the need to define "rural" districts clearly and ensure the program effectively targets the most underserved areas.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee plans to refine the bill’s funding and eligibility criteria, aligning it with **Senate Bill 217**.

### **2. Literacy and Reading Interventions (House Bill 437)**  
The committee discussed **House Bill 437**, which focuses on improving literacy outcomes through state-supplied universal reading screeners and evidence-based interventions. Key points included:  
- **Universal Screener**: The bill mandates reading assessments three times a year for grades K-3.  
- **Three-Cueing Method**: The bill prohibits the use of the three-cueing method for reading instruction, citing decades of research showing its ineffectiveness.  
- **Teacher Training**: Teachers would be required to demonstrate proficiency in evidence-based literacy methods when renewing certifications.  
- **Funding Concerns**: Smaller districts expressed worries about the financial burden of implementing the bill’s requirements, especially after the depletion of ESSR funds.  
- **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Some members argued that curriculum decisions should remain local, while others stressed the need for state intervention to ensure consistency.  
- **Alignment with Previous Legislation**: The bill builds on **House Bill 377**, which mandates dyslexia screening and interventions.

### **3. Mental Health Education (House Bill 505)**  
The committee debated **House Bill 505**, which addresses mental health education in schools. Key points included:  
- **Amendment Proposal**: Representative Damon proposed removing the term "comprehensive" from the bill to avoid disputes over its meaning.  
- **Current Curriculum**: Some members argued that mental health education is already covered under existing health and wellness curricula, making the bill redundant.  
- **Statutory vs. Rule-Based Approach**: There was debate over whether mental health education should be codified in statute or left to the Department of Education’s rule-making process.  
- **Teacher Burden**: Concerns were raised about overburdening teachers with additional curriculum requirements.  
- **Root Causes**: Members emphasized the importance of addressing broader issues like bullying and school culture to improve mental health outcomes.  
- **Multi-Tiered Support Systems**: The discussion touched on the **Multi-Tiered System of Support for Behavioral Health and Wellness (MTSSB)**, already implemented in some schools.

### **4. Charter Schools and Building Aid (House Bill 354)**  
The committee examined **House Bill 354**, which deals with building aid for charter schools. Key points included:  
- **Repayment of State Funds**: Concerns were raised about how charter schools would repay state building aid if they close, with emphasis on prioritizing state repayment over other creditors.  
- **Asset Disposition**: The need for a clear plan for asset disposition in the event of a charter school’s dissolution was discussed.  
- **Lease Aid vs. Building Aid**: Comparisons were made between lease aid (capped at $50,000 annually) and building aid, with some members questioning the financial risks of providing building aid to charter schools.  
- **Public vs. Charter Schools**: Some representatives expressed concerns about treating charter schools (private 501(c)(3) corporations) the same as public schools, especially given the backlog in building aid requests from public districts.

### **5. Mental Health in Adequacy Standards and Special Education Advisory Council (House Bill 151 and House Bill 147)**  
The committee discussed **House Bill 151**, which proposes including mental health education in the state’s educational adequacy standards. Key points included:  
- **Terminology**: Debate focused on whether to use "behavioral health" or "mental health" and whether to include additional topics like nutrition and child abuse.  
- **Special Education Advisory Council (SAC)**: The committee reviewed amendments to **House Bill 147**, which addresses SAC membership. Discussions centered on:  
  - Reducing the council’s size to improve manageability while ensuring a majority of parents or individuals with disabilities are represented.  
  - Allowing virtual participation to improve accessibility for parents with disabilities or transportation challenges.  
  - Assigning logistical support to a Department of Education official to streamline operations.  
- **Federal Requirements**: Members reviewed federal mandates for SAC membership, debating whether additional state-specific roles were necessary.
