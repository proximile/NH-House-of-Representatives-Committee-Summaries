**Summary of the New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (October 24, 2023): Discussion on House Bill 470**

The New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on October 24, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 470**, which focuses on the legalization and use of rapid test strips and other drug-checking equipment for harm reduction. The bill aims to address the state’s opioid crisis by allowing individuals and public health professionals to test illicit substances for harmful contaminants like fentanyl and xylazine, thereby reducing overdose fatalities. While the bill has strong public health intentions, concerns were raised about potential misuse by drug dealers and the need for precise legislative language to prevent unintended consequences.

### Key Points of Discussion:

1. **Purpose and Public Health Impact**:
   - The bill is designed as a harm reduction tool to save lives by enabling individuals to test substances for dangerous contaminants, particularly fentanyl, which has been a major contributor to overdose deaths.
   - Testimony from Lauren McGinley, Executive Director of the New Hampshire Harm Reduction Coalition, highlighted the success of fentanyl and xylazine test strips in reducing harm, especially among college-aged individuals. She emphasized the need for broader drug-checking capabilities to identify emerging contaminants in the drug supply.

2. **Concerns About Legal Loopholes**:
   - Committee members expressed concerns that the bill, as currently written, could create legal loopholes for drug dealers and traffickers to exploit, potentially using the legislation as a defense in court.
   - Specific worries centered on the definition of drug paraphernalia (RSA 318-B:1) and the possibility of nefarious actors misusing the bill’s provisions. Some members suggested the bill needed significant revisions to prevent such misuse.

3. **Balancing Public Safety and Criminal Justice**:
   - The discussion emphasized the need to balance criminal justice concerns with public health goals. While some members argued the bill should focus more on harm reduction, others stressed the importance of ensuring it does not inadvertently aid illegal activities.
   - Law enforcement representatives raised concerns about the bill potentially aiding drug dealers and called for tighter language to prevent misuse.

4. **Bipartisan Collaboration and Amendments**:
   - The committee demonstrated a strong commitment to bipartisan problem-solving, with members discussing the need for amendments to refine the bill’s language and address concerns.
   - Proposed amendments included defining "nominal amounts" of drugs for testing and clarifying that the bill is focused on drug-checking, not manufacturing or distributing illicit substances.
   - The committee decided to withdraw a motion to recommend "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) and instead focus on crafting a joint amendment.

5. **Harm Reduction and Overdose Prevention**:
   - Personal testimony from a behavioral health worker in long-term recovery underscored the life-saving potential of drug testing and harm reduction measures.
   - The committee acknowledged the urgency of addressing the overdose epidemic and the role of harm reduction tools like test strips in preventing deaths.

6. **Procedural Challenges and Next Steps**:
   - There was some confusion about the legislative process, particularly regarding whether to recommend ITL or propose amendments. Ultimately, the committee decided to prioritize refining the bill through amendments.
   - A follow-up meeting was scheduled for November 1, 2023, to continue working on the bill, with the goal of presenting a unified amendment to the full committee by November 17, 2023.
   - The committee emphasized transparency and public accountability throughout the process.

### Broader Implications:
The bill aims to provide a clearer picture of New Hampshire’s drug supply and enable quicker responses to emerging contaminants. Supporters argued it would help prevent future public health crises by identifying new substances in the drug supply before they cause widespread harm. However, the committee recognized the complexity of addressing the opioid crisis and the need for a multifaceted approach that includes law enforcement efforts, public health initiatives, and harm reduction strategies.

### Conclusion:
The meeting reflected a shared commitment to passing legislation that effectively addresses the overdose crisis while preventing misuse by drug dealers. While the committee recognized the bill’s potential to save lives, members stressed the importance of refining its language to balance public health goals with legal safeguards. The discussion highlighted the need for bipartisan collaboration and careful consideration to ensure the bill achieves its intended purpose without unintended consequences.
