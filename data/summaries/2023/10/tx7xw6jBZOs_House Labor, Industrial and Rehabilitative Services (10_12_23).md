**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services (October 12, 2023)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on October 12, 2023, centered on discussions related to updating labor, industrial, and rehabilitative services safety standards, with a particular focus on adopting OSHA's 1910 standards. The meeting involved detailed deliberations on two primary options for updating New Hampshire's safety regulations, addressing concerns about costs, implementation, and the impact on public and private employers. Key points from the discussion include:

### **Rule Adoption Process and Stakeholder Involvement**
The committee emphasized the importance of a transparent and inclusive rule adoption process. They stressed the need to inform stakeholders, municipalities, and public employers in advance of proposed changes. Public input would be sought to address unforeseen concerns, and changes would be proposed during annual meetings to ensure broad engagement.

### **Option One vs. Option Two**
The committee debated two main approaches to adopting OSHA's 1910 standards:  
1. **Option One**: Proposing the wholesale adoption of OSHA's 1910 standards (excluding subpart U) with a three-year implementation period. This option would require significant staffing increases (12 inspectors and one administrative staff) to manage compliance and transition efforts. It would also bring New Hampshire closer to adopting an OSHA state plan, potentially qualifying for federal funding.  
2. **Option Two**: Suggesting a selective adoption of OSHA's 1910 standards, allowing the Department of Labor to develop state-specific standards over three years that are "at least as effective" as OSHA's. This approach would require fewer additional staff (six inspectors and one administrative staff) and provide flexibility to tailor standards to New Hampshire's needs, including exemptions for inapplicable sections (e.g., mining).  

The committee leaned toward **Option Two**, as it was seen as more manageable, cost-effective, and better suited to New Hampshire's specific needs. It also avoided imposing unnecessary burdens on employers, particularly municipalities and public sector entities.

### **Cost and Implementation Concerns**
Legislators expressed concerns about the financial and logistical challenges of implementing new safety standards. Examples included the potential need to replace non-OSHA-certified equipment or historic fire doors, which could impose significant costs on municipalities like Manchester. The committee acknowledged the uncertainty around costs and stressed the need for clarity before finalizing any changes.

### **Impact on Public Sector Entities**
Questions were raised about how the changes would impact public entities such as the Marine Patrol, fire departments, and the Department of Environmental Services. It was clarified that these entities fall under existing state standards, and the new rules would not significantly alter their current operations. However, the committee emphasized the need for flexibility to accommodate unique public sector needs.

### **Accident Investigations and Reporting Requirements**
The process for investigating workplace accidents, including fatalities, was discussed. The Department of Labor handles investigations similarly to OSHA, utilizing state resources and collaborating with law enforcement when necessary. Employers are required to report injuries and safety incidents to the Department of Labor, with specific timelines for serious injuries or fatalities. The committee highlighted the importance of maintaining and updating safety plans every two years.

### **Timeline and Next Steps**
The committee scheduled an executive session for October 24th to finalize their recommendations and vote on the proposed changes. They aim to present a unified recommendation to the full House, emphasizing the need for clear communication and alignment with stakeholders. The three-year rollout plan was emphasized to minimize disruption and allow for gradual implementation.

### **Positive Impact on Insurance Rates**
The Department of Labor was commended for its work in reducing workplace injuries and lowering insurance rates by 63% over the past 12 years, aligning with the original intent of the legislation. This positive outcome underscored the importance of maintaining effective safety standards.

### **Flexibility and Local Needs**
Option Two was favored for its flexibility, allowing the department to skip irrelevant sections (e.g., mining) and create more accessible, simplified standards for New Hampshire employers. The committee highlighted the importance of avoiding unintended consequences and ensuring that new standards are clear, enforceable, and minimally burdensome.

### **Funding and Staffing**
The department proposed using existing funds (e.g., administrative and restricted funds) to cover staffing and implementation costs. However, there were concerns about space constraints and the need to rent additional office space for new staff. The committee acknowledged these challenges but emphasized the importance of adequate resources to ensure successful implementation.

### **Rulemaking Process**
Both options would require rulemaking through the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR), ensuring legislative oversight and approval. This process would provide an additional layer of scrutiny and alignment with stakeholder needs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee's commitment to balancing safety standards with practical implementation and cost considerations. By favoring **Option Two**, the committee aimed to develop state-specific standards that are at least as effective as OSHA's while minimizing unnecessary burdens on employers. The discussion highlighted the importance of flexibility, stakeholder engagement, and clear communication in achieving the goal of enhancing workplace safety in New Hampshire.
