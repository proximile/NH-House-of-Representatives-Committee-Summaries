### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (October 17, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on October 17, 2023, to address a range of legislative and regulatory issues. The meeting focused on three main areas: **environmental permitting processes**, **farm energy efficiency and landfill siting**, and **various bills and subcommittee updates**. Discussions emphasized the need for balancing technical requirements with community concerns, streamlining processes for efficiency and transparency, and supporting farmers and small-scale businesses.

### **Environmental Permitting Processes**
The committee discussed an amendment aimed at improving the environmental permitting process, particularly in response to concerns about an asphalt plant in Nashua. Key points included:

1. **Public Input and Technical Considerations**: The current permitting process excludes public concerns (e.g., traffic, noise, emissions) and focuses solely on technical data. This has frustrated residents who feel their input is disregarded.
2. **Amendment Proposal**: The amendment seeks to incorporate cumulative impacts and public concerns into the permitting process, providing clearer guidance to the Department of Environmental Services (DES). It also introduces a "without prejudice" clause, allowing applicants to resubmit denied applications.
3. **DES's Role**: DES typically refrains from taking positions on legislation, relying on the House for guidance. The amendment aims to balance legislative direction with DES’s discretion to ensure effective decision-making.
4. **Process and Transparency**: The committee emphasized the importance of public hearings and a fair, transparent process. They planned to meet the following week to address retained bills and clarify schedules for subcommittee meetings and executive sessions.

### **Farm Energy Efficiency and Landfill Siting**
The committee addressed two key topics: **farm energy efficiency grants** and **landfill siting regulations**.

1. **Farm Energy Efficiency Grants**:
   - A $100,000 allocation was proposed to help farmers improve energy efficiency and profitability through grants and technical assistance.
   - Debates centered on whether the funding should be a one-time allocation or part of a multi-year program, with concerns about sustainability beyond the initial year.
   - The program would assist farmers in modernizing equipment, reducing utility costs, and applying for grants, with support from Cooperative Extension specialists.
   - Representatives stressed the need for ongoing funding and explored additional funding sources, including county contributions.

2. **Landfill Siting Regulations**:
   - **HB 602** proposes a preliminary application process for landfill siting to streamline decision-making and avoid wasted resources.
   - The amendment would allow DES to adopt prohibitive locational criteria, preventing unsuitable sites from being considered.
   - The process aligns with practices in other states and provides DES with discretion in rule-making. Concerns were raised about the need for public hearings, but it was noted that the Senate would ensure public input.

### **Bills and Subcommittee Updates**
The committee reviewed several retained bills and provided updates from subcommittees:

1. **HB 37 - Companion Animal Groomers**:
   - The committee shifted focus from forming a study committee to creating a **Consumer’s Guide** for choosing animal groomers. The guide, to be posted on a state website, aims to educate consumers on best practices.
   - Discussions centered on the guide’s content and ensuring it reaches both consumers and groomers.

2. **HB 122 - Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operations**:
   - An amendment was reviewed to allow individuals to sell homemade food to informed consumers without state licensing or inspection, excluding retail and wholesale operations.
   - Concerns were raised about liability, insurance, and local control, but the bill aims to legalize small-scale food sales like bake sales and community events.

3. **HB 326 - Prohibiting Second-Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides**:
   - The committee decided to await federal regulations expected in December or January. If federal action is delayed, the issue may be addressed through the Pesticide Control Board.

4. **HB 369 - Farm Energy Relief Task Force**:
   - A task force was proposed to provide energy and infrastructure advice to farms, modeled after the Forest and Lands Division. The bill includes a $100,000 appropriation for a field specialist to assist farmers with energy systems and technology.

**Subcommittee Updates**:
- **Study on RSA Chapters 426 and 434**: Progress was reported on reviewing and updating these chapters.
- **Wastewater Monitoring Rules**: A subcommittee is working on improving groundwater security around wastewater facilities.
- **Out-of-State Trash Permits**: Recommendations are being finalized to limit out-of-state trash, including potential public ownership of landfills.
- **Slaughter Facilities**: Challenges in slaughtering edible and non-edible animals are being addressed, with potential changes to livestock definitions.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
The meeting underscored the importance of:
- **Balancing technical and community concerns** in environmental permitting.
- **Streamlining processes** for efficiency and transparency in both permitting and landfill siting.
- **Supporting farmers** through energy efficiency programs and task forces.
- **Promoting consumer awareness** and responsibility in food safety and animal grooming.
- **Ensuring clear communication** and resources for farmers, consumers, and small-scale businesses.

The committee concluded with plans to finalize drafts, address remaining questions, and continue discussions in future sessions.
