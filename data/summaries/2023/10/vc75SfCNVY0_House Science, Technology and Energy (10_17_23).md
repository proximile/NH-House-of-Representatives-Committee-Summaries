**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (October 17, 2023):**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on October 17, 2023, to discuss amendments to House Bill 609 (HB 609), which pertains to the operations and structure of the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC). The meeting focused on refining the SEC’s membership, structure, and processes while addressing issues related to energy facility modifications, administrative efficiency, and public member expertise. Key discussions and decisions included:  

### 1. **SEC Membership and Structure**  
- **Membership Reduction**: The committee reviewed a proposal to reduce the SEC’s membership from nine to five members, including three Public Utilities Commissioners, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Services, and one public member.  
- **Public Member Expertise**: The qualifications for the public member were debated, with concerns raised about overly narrow criteria, such as requiring legal expertise in land use planning. The committee agreed to broaden the criteria to include expertise in areas like business management, environmental protection, and community planning.  
- **Designees and Cross-Agency Participation**: The draft legislation allows the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Services to designate individuals from other state agencies for specific SEC proceedings. Clarification was sought on whether designees would replace the commissioner or serve alongside them, and whether the SEC should approve such designations.  

### 2. **SEC Chairperson Role**  
- A significant debate centered on whether the senior attorney member of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) should serve as the SEC chairperson. Representatives and witnesses, including Alex Spidel from the PUC, discussed potential administrative and reporting conflicts if the SEC chair and PUC chair were different individuals. Some argued that the PUC chair should also chair the SEC to maintain clear lines of authority, while others emphasized the value of adjudicative experience in the SEC chair role.  

### 3. **Subcommittees and Administrative Efficiency**  
- The draft legislation proposed eliminating SEC subcommittees, consolidating all SEC business into full committee meetings. Concerns were raised about potential inefficiencies and administrative challenges, particularly regarding the SEC administrator’s role. The committee discussed ensuring that the SEC administrator prioritizes SEC work over PUC duties, with suggestions to include statutory language to clarify this prioritization.  

### 4. **Training and Public Members**  
- The committee discussed the elimination of certain training requirements for public members of the SEC, which were initially added to address turnover and ensure consistency. There was debate over whether this training is still necessary given recent changes. Questions were also raised about the need for training for SEC members, particularly given the technical and adjudicative nature of their responsibilities.  

### 5. **Substantial Changes to Energy Facilities**  
- The committee debated the definition of “substantial change” or “addition” to existing energy facilities, particularly focusing on whether changes exceeding one-third of the original capacity, footprint, or height should trigger a review process.  
- **Capital Investment and Inflation**: The committee considered whether capital investment thresholds for substantial changes should be adjusted for inflation, as older facilities might otherwise trigger reviews based on outdated costs.  

### 6. **Fast-Track Process**  
- The committee considered creating a fast-track process for certain changes to existing energy facilities, reducing the review period from 360 days to 180 days. However, concerns were raised about the complexity of defining what qualifies for this expedited process, and it was suggested that this might require a separate bill.  

### 7. **Repeal of Subcommittees**  
- The committee discussed the repeal of certain subcommittees, as they are no longer in operation, and how this would affect the numbering and structure of the statute.  

### 8. **Future Legislation**  
- The committee acknowledged that some issues, such as the fast-track process and changes to energy sources, might require additional legislation rather than being addressed in the current amendment.  

### 9. **Next Steps**  
- The committee scheduled another meeting for October 24, 2023, to finalize the amendment draft for HB 609, with the goal of having it ready for an executive session on November 6, 2023.  

### Overall Focus and Goals  
The meeting highlighted the complexity of defining and regulating changes to energy facilities and the need for careful consideration of various factors, including inflation, facility size, and potential environmental impact. The committee aimed to balance efficiency with thorough oversight, recognizing that some issues might require further legislative action. Discussions centered on refining the SEC’s structure, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and ensuring efficient and effective operations while addressing potential conflicts and administrative challenges.
