The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee held a meeting on October 18, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 22968**, which focuses on **PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination in well water**. The meeting centered around an **amendment** to the bill, introduced by **Representative Darby**, aimed at improving **public awareness** of PFAS in well water through **notification requirements** in real estate transactions. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Background on PFAS and Previous Legislation**:  
   - Representative Darby explained that the amendment builds on two prior bills (HB 205 and HB 398) related to well water testing and notification in real estate agreements.  
   - HB 205, which included well testing for new wells and notifications in purchase agreements, was tabled and died. HB 398 focused on notifications and disclosures but faced issues with language related to notifying property owners within 500 feet of a contaminated well.

2. **Amendment Details**:  
   - The amendment seeks to **add PFAS to existing notifications** about well water contaminants (e.g., arsenic, lead, radon) in real estate transactions.  
   - It emphasizes **awareness and education** rather than mandating testing or action.  
   - The language was vetted with stakeholders, including the Department of Environmental Services (DES), Realtors, and the bill's prime sponsor.

3. **Discussion and Feedback**:  
   - **Representative Healey** suggested adding a clause to encourage sharing recent well test results (within the last three years) to ensure accuracy.  
   - **Representative Thomas**, the prime sponsor, supported the amendment but expressed a preference for mandatory PFAS testing, though he acknowledged the amendment as a positive step toward awareness.  
   - **Representative Rung** highlighted the **widespread presence of PFAS** in New Hampshire, citing a soil study that found PFAS in every sample tested statewide. She emphasized the importance of notifying buyers, especially in areas without known industrial contamination.  
   - **Representative McHugh** and others praised the amendment as **good public policy**, emphasizing its role in educating homeowners about potential well water contamination.

4. **Stakeholder Input**:  
   - **Brandon Kernan** from DES stressed the importance of the amendment in raising awareness about PFAS, especially in Southern New Hampshire, where contamination is a significant issue. He noted that the EPA is expected to finalize federal PFAS standards in December 2023, which will include additional PFAS compounds.  
   - **Adam Schmidt**, representing the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, confirmed that the Realtors had no concerns with the amendment and supported its implementation starting January 1, 2025.

5. **Vote and Outcome**:  
   - The subcommittee **unanimously approved** the amendment (4-0) and recommended it for further consideration in the full committee.  
   - The amendment was praised for its focus on **education and awareness** without imposing mandates or altering existing contractual dynamics in real estate transactions.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, and the amendment will be presented to the full committee during the executive session.
