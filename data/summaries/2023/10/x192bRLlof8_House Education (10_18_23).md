### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (10/18/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on October 18, 2023, focused on several critical education-related bills and issues, with a particular emphasis on literacy, special education, charter schools, and addressing educational disparities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

#### **1. Literacy and Reading Instruction (House Bill 437)**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 437**, which aims to improve literacy instruction, particularly in early education (K-3), through evidence-based practices aligned with the **science of reading**. Key points included:
- **Teacher Preparation Programs**: Emphasis was placed on rigorous teacher training in literacy, focusing on the **five pillars of reading** (phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension). Keene State College was highlighted as a model for its literacy-focused teacher preparation program.
- **Statewide Implementation**: The bill proposes annual reporting by the Department of Education on teacher preparation programs and their alignment with science-of-reading research. The goal is to standardize literacy instruction across New Hampshire’s 12 teacher preparation programs while allowing local flexibility.
- **Assessments and Interventions**: The bill mandates **three annual reading assessments** for K-3 students to track progress and identify needs. Concerns were raised about the potential workload for teachers and the importance of balancing standardized testing with informal assessments.
- **Parental Involvement**: The role of parents in fostering literacy was discussed, with an emphasis on encouraging reading at home and providing resources to support families.
- **Educator Certification**: The bill includes a requirement for teachers to pass a **subject assessment test** for certification renewal, though details on the test’s content and administration were not fully explored. Debate centered on whether this should be a one-time requirement or recurring every three years.
- **Dyslexia Screening**: The bill mandates dyslexia screening for students three times a year (beginning, middle, and end) to identify risks and implement intervention plans. Testimony emphasized the need for improved teacher training in structured literacy and evidence-based reading instruction.

#### **2. Special Education Advisory Council (SEAC)**
The committee addressed concerns about the functionality and structure of the **Special Education Advisory Council (SEAC)**. Key points included:
- **Dysfunction and Size of the Council**: Concerns were raised about the council's large size (36-38 members), which makes it difficult to conduct efficient meetings, achieve quorum, and respect all members' opinions. The original intent of the bill was to shrink the council to improve functionality and maintain a parent majority.
- **Parent Representation**: Parents and legislators feel the council is not effectively representing parental concerns. The goal is to ensure the council focuses on parents' needs and maintains a parent majority. However, current non-parent positions (22 out of 38) make it challenging to achieve this majority.
- **Resource and Support Issues**: The council lacks adequate resources, including funding for workshops, speakers, and technical support. The Department of Education (DOE) has not provided sufficient assistance, particularly for remote meeting setups, which are often unreliable and hinder participation.
- **Proposed Solutions**: Representatives suggested appointing a DOE staff member to provide technical and administrative support and forming a smaller working group to address the council's issues and refine the legislation.

#### **3. Charter School Building Aid and Dissolution**
The committee debated a bill addressing charter schools' eligibility for state building aid and the handling of assets in case of dissolution. Key points included:
- **State Liability**: Concerns were raised about the state's potential liability for charter school debts and the need for clear language to protect the state from financial risks.
- **Asset Distribution**: There was discussion about the role of the Department of Justice and the charitable trust division in charter school dissolutions, particularly regarding asset distribution and creditor priorities.
- **Amendment to HB 354**: An amendment to HB 354 was discussed, addressing the repayment of school building aid if a charter school dissolves. The amendment clarifies that repayment would follow existing public school guidelines, with the Department of Education having authority to waive repayment under certain circumstances.

#### **4. Persistent Disparity in Education**
The committee discussed a complex bill aimed at redefining and addressing **persistent disparities in education**. Key points included:
- **Definition and Scope**: Concerns were raised about the bill's scope and the need for a clear definition of "persistent disparity." The committee felt the bill was too broad and recommended further refinement before proceeding.
- **Local Education Improvement Plans**: Another bill focused on local education improvement plans and disparities in education. The committee acknowledged the bill's complexity and the need for a more targeted approach.

#### **5. Technical Corrections and Amendments**
Various technical corrections and amendments were proposed and discussed, including adjustments to language and the removal of redundant sections in existing laws.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of evidence-based literacy instruction, teacher preparation, and balancing state mandates with local flexibility to address the diverse needs of New Hampshire students. The committee emphasized the need for clarity, protection of state interests, and alignment with federal requirements in all proposed bills. The committee planned to reconvene in November to finalize the bills, incorporating feedback and addressing remaining questions.
