**Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting (October 24, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on October 24, 2023, to discuss and propose amendments to two significant pieces of legislation related to consumer data privacy and protection: **House Bill 314 (HB 314)** and **Senate Bill 255 (SB 255)**. The meeting focused on refining the scope, addressing overlaps, and ensuring robust consumer protections while balancing practical enforcement and business compliance. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and key points:

---

### **Overview of the Bills**
1. **House Bill 314 (HB 314)**:
   - **Purpose**: Protects personal information held by third-party providers, such as utilities, internet service providers, banks, and insurance companies, by establishing a **reasonable expectation of privacy**.
   - **Key Provisions**: Requires **opt-in consent** for data sharing, restricts disclosure to government entities except under specific conditions (e.g., subpoenas, emergencies), and eliminates **private rights of action**, leaving enforcement to the Attorney General under the Consumer Protection Act.

2. **Senate Bill 255 (SB 255)**:
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on consumer privacy rights for businesses processing personal data of New Hampshire residents, including access, correction, deletion, and **opt-out mechanisms**.
   - **Key Provisions**: Applies to businesses processing data of **35,000 unique consumers** (down from 100,000) or **10,000 consumers** if 25% of revenue comes from selling personal data. Excludes entities covered by HB 314 to avoid overlap and prohibits **private rights of action**.

### **Key Issues and Discussions**
1. **Exemptions and Coverage Concerns**:
   - A significant concern was the exemption of certain businesses (e.g., cellular service providers, utilities, social media companies) from SB 255 under proposed amendments. Critics argued this would leave major data collectors unregulated, undermining the bill’s intent.
   - HB 314 explicitly excludes entities covered by SB 255 to prevent regulatory overlap.

2. **Overlap and Conflicts Between Bills**:
   - The committee debated how to address potential conflicts between the two bills. A proposal was made to ensure companies subject to both bills comply with the stricter privacy protections, particularly the **opt-in requirement** in HB 314.
   - Language was suggested to clarify that companies must follow the law providing greater privacy protection in case of conflicts.

3. **Data Minimization and Consent Fatigue**:
   - Both bills lack **data minimization** requirements, raising concerns about **consent fatigue** (frequent user consent requests). This gap was highlighted as a critical issue in the legislation.
   - The concept of a **universal opt-in/opt-out mechanism** in SB 255 was discussed as a potential solution, though its effectiveness was questioned without explicit data minimization provisions.

4. **Downstream Data Flow Regulation**:
   - The committee emphasized the need for consistent regulation of downstream data transfers to prevent loopholes that could allow data to be reassembled and misused.

5. **Technical and Drafting Issues**:
   - Concerns were raised about unclear definitions (e.g., "disclose" and "recipient") in HB 314 and the potential for confusion in its application.
   - The role of the **Secretary of State** in setting standardized opt-out procedures for SB 255 was critiqued for potentially over-standardizing processes across diverse businesses.

6. **Enforcement and Cure Periods**:
   - SB 255 includes a **cure period** for violations in the first year, with discretion for the Attorney General afterward.
   - Both bills eliminate **private rights of action**, focusing enforcement on the Attorney General.

### **Proposed Amendments**
1. **HB 314**:
   - Clarifies **opt-in consent** requirements, ensuring providers obtain consent through clear, separate communications.
   - Restricts government requests for data to specific circumstances (e.g., subpoenas, emergencies) and mandates notification to individuals unless prohibited by law.

2. **SB 255**:
   - Lowers applicability thresholds to include smaller businesses.
   - Excludes entities covered by HB 314 to avoid regulatory overlap.
   - Introduces standardized opt-out procedures overseen by the Secretary of State.

### **Next Steps**
- The subcommittee unanimously recommended the amended version of HB 314 to the full committee for further review.
- The full committee will review both bills during a work session on **November 8, 2023**, with final votes scheduled for **November 15**.
- Further amendments may be considered based on committee feedback.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing consumer privacy protections with business compliance and practical enforcement. The committee’s efforts focused on addressing gaps, clarifying language, and ensuring consistent regulation to prevent unintended loopholes or burdens. The proposed amendments aim to strengthen consumer rights while providing clear guidance for businesses and government entities. The next steps involve finalizing the language and voting on the amended bills, with a commitment to achieving comprehensive and effective data privacy legislation.
