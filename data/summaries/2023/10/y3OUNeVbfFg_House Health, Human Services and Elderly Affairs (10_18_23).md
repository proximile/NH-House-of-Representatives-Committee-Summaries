The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee met on October 18, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 580 FN**, which aims to establish a **children's vision screening initiative**. The bill, initially framed as a Medicaid-related measure, was clarified to focus on making vision screenings **compulsory for all public school students**, with a **religious exemption option**. The committee engaged in a detailed debate over the bill's scope, implementation, and potential amendments, addressing key concerns and proposing revisions to streamline its language and objectives.

### Key Points of Discussion:

1. **Misleading Title and Scope**:
   - Committee members noted that the bill's title was misleading, as it implied an expansion of Medicaid when, in fact, Medicaid already covers vision care for children. The bill primarily seeks to **mandate vision screenings for public school students**, with provisions for parental opt-outs.
   - Concerns were raised about the bill's applicability to children **aged 0 to 18**, particularly those not yet in the public school system. The committee discussed narrowing the focus to **school entry screenings** for clarity.

2. **Mandate vs. Awareness**:
   - There was debate over whether the bill constitutes a **mandate**, given the opt-out provision. Some members argued that the bill is more about **building awareness** of the importance of vision screening rather than enforcing a strict requirement.

3. **Cost and Coverage**:
   - Vision screenings are covered under the **Affordable Care Act** for most families, but exceptions exist for non-ACA-compliant plans (e.g., self-employed or medical sharing ministries). Medicaid already covers **comprehensive eye exams** for children up to age 18, raising questions about the need for a separate funding mechanism.

4. **Parental Notification and Opt-Out**:
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of a **notification provision** to inform parents of their opt-out rights. The committee emphasized the need for clear communication to ensure parents are aware of the screening process and their ability to decline.
   - The bill allows parents to opt out of screenings or exams, with debate over whether the opt-out should be limited to **religious objections** or expanded to include **any reason**. The committee ultimately favored broader parental discretion.

5. **Training and Provider Qualifications**:
   - The bill includes provisions for **training programs** and a list of approved providers for vision screenings. Some members expressed concern that this could create unnecessary bureaucracy and burdens for healthcare providers, while others argued it ensures quality and consistency.
   - The language was adjusted to specify that screenings or exams must be conducted by **qualified medical providers**, aligning with standards set by the **American Academy of Pediatrics**.

6. **Unfunded Mandate**:
   - Questions were raised about whether the bill imposes an **unfunded mandate** on school districts, particularly if they need to train staff or contract with outside providers for screenings.

7. **Amendments and Simplification**:
   - The committee proposed **amending the bill** to streamline its language and focus on **vision screening or examination** for children upon entry into the public school system. Suggested amendments included replacing specific provider lists with **"qualified providers"** and ensuring alignment with existing healthcare frameworks.
   - Some members suggested the bill might benefit from an **interim study** to address unresolved issues, particularly around **funding** and **mandates for pre-school-age children**. However, the majority favored moving forward with the amendment to avoid delaying the initiative.

8. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee acknowledged that the bill requires **significant revisions** and discussed the possibility of drafting an amendment for further review. The deadline for finalizing the bill was noted as **November 17, 2023**.
   - The committee voted **2-1** to recommend **Ought to Pass with Amendment**, with the amendment focusing on **vision screening or examination** by qualified providers, parental opt-out provisions, and presenting results to both schools and parents.

### Conclusion:
The committee recognized the importance of early vision screening for children but highlighted the need for clearer language, reduced bureaucracy, and alignment with existing healthcare frameworks. The discussion underscored the committeeâ€™s efforts to balance **early vision screening** with **parental rights** and **practical implementation**, while addressing concerns from stakeholders like the **New Hampshire Optometric Association**. The bill is set to move forward with the proposed amendments for further consideration.
