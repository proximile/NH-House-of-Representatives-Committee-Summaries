**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study Proposing Legislation for State-Controlled Sale of Cannabis (October 5, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on October 5, 2023, to discuss the Commission to Study proposing legislation for state-controlled cannabis sales. The meeting focused on the integration of the state’s existing therapeutic cannabis program with a potential recreational cannabis market, addressing enforcement, regulatory frameworks, public health, and stakeholder input. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Draft Legislation and Legislative Process**
- The commission reviewed a draft of proposed legislation, though it was not yet finalized. Members emphasized the need for a structured draft to guide discussions and allow for public and stakeholder input.
- The commission’s recommendations will undergo the full legislative process, including public hearings in both the House and Senate.
- There was urgency to finalize the draft and recommendations by the December 1 deadline, with concerns raised about the tight timeline and the need for efficient use of meeting time.

---

### **2. Enforcement and Regulatory Oversight**
- The commission discussed the enforcement side of the cannabis program, including the authority to revoke cannabis cards based on violations.
- A dual regulatory structure was considered, where the Liquor Commission would oversee adult-use sales, while the Department of Health would regulate the therapeutic market. Collaboration between agencies was suggested to avoid conflicts and ensure consistent standards.
- Robust testing, labeling, and potency limits were highlighted for recreational products, while therapeutic products would remain exempt from potency limits.

---

### **3. Therapeutic Cannabis Program Concerns**
- The therapeutic cannabis program, established in 2013, serves over 14,000 patients with conditions like chronic pain, PTSD, and cancer. It is entirely self-funded through patient registration and licensing fees, with no taxpayer support.
- Concerns were raised about the potential decline in patient registrations if recreational cannabis is legalized, as seen in other states. The program provides specialized products (e.g., low-THC, CBD-rich strains, suppositories) that are not typically profitable in recreational markets.
- The commission emphasized the need to maintain access to therapeutic cannabis for patients under 21, who would be excluded from adult-use markets, and to ensure affordability for patients with serious medical conditions.

---

### **4. Integration of Therapeutic and Recreational Markets**
- The commission explored models for integrating Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) with the recreational market, such as Vermont’s integrated license system, which allows therapeutic entities to apply for a single vertically integrated license.
- The franchise model proposed by the New Hampshire Liquor Commission was discussed, with suggestions to exempt therapeutic sales from the 15% franchise fee, maintain ATC branding, and align regulations to ensure ATCs can operate in both markets.
- The nonprofit status of ATCs was debated, with some arguing that it increases costs and limits their ability to compete in a retail market. Only Arizona still requires nonprofit status for medical cannabis programs.
- Concerns were raised about the potential for ATCs to be outcompeted by recreational cannabis stores, leading to reduced services for therapeutic patients.

---

### **5. Public Health and Safety**
- Public health considerations, such as child-resistant packaging, advertising restrictions, and limits on public consumption, were highlighted as priorities for any cannabis legislation.
- The commission discussed the need for data collection and monitoring to track the impact of cannabis legalization.
- Concerns were raised about the lack of oversight and compliance with advertising restrictions by ATCs, particularly in relation to youth access and cannabis use disorder.

---

### **6. Stakeholder Input and Public Comment**
- The commission emphasized the importance of hearing from various stakeholders, including state agencies, medical professionals, and public health experts, to inform the legislation. Dr. Lyn Silver, a public health expert from California, was suggested as a potential speaker.
- Public comment periods were planned for multiple meetings to allow for input from individuals and organizations, including potential remote participation via Zoom or written testimony.

---

### **7. Upcoming Meetings and Timeline**
- The commission set dates for future meetings:
  - **October 19**: Focus on hearing from the Attorney General (AG) to address legal questions and allow for public comment.
  - **October 24**: Public comment session, with potential work sessions if time permits.
  - **November 3, 9, 16**: Additional meetings were scheduled, with topics to be determined, including potential input from subject matter experts and stakeholders like the Liquor Commission and public health officials.
  - **November 27**: Final meeting to vote on the commission’s report, with a deadline of December 1 for completion.

---

### **8. Financial and Operational Considerations**
- The therapeutic program’s self-funded model was noted, with no taxpayer dollars supporting its operations. The commission discussed the potential financial implications of integrating the therapeutic and recreational markets, including cost savings and regulatory adjustments.
- The commission considered how to incentivize patients to continue using the therapeutic program, such as lower prices and exclusive product offerings.

---

### **Conclusion**
The commission is focused on balancing the needs of therapeutic cannabis patients with the potential economic benefits of a recreational market, while ensuring public health and safety are prioritized. The discussions highlighted the complexities of integrating the two markets, the importance of maintaining patient access and affordability, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. The commission will continue to refine its recommendations through stakeholder input, public comment, and detailed discussions in upcoming meetings.
