**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (10/05/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on October 5, 2023, to discuss several key education-related bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 354**, which addresses **charter school eligibility for state building aid**, and **Bill 147**, which pertains to the **Advisory Council for Special Education**. The meeting also touched on other education bills, accountability measures, and logistical planning for the upcoming legislative session. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **House Bill 354: Charter School Building Aid**
1. **Integration of Charter Schools into Building Aid Program**: The bill aims to include charter schools in the state’s building aid program, similar to public schools. Charter schools must **own their facilities** to qualify, and there are currently **11 charter schools** in New Hampshire that meet this criterion. The bill ensures that charter schools adhere to the same accountability standards as public schools.

2. **Payment Structure and Financial Responsibility**: Charter schools would receive **30% of eligible construction costs**, disbursed over **20 years at 5% annually**. This structure raises concerns about **increased interest costs** for schools but is designed to protect the state’s investment if a school dissolves. If a charter school discontinues use of the facility within 20 years, it must repay **100% of the state grant**, with exceptions for good cause (e.g., natural disasters).

3. **Bond Requirements and Financial Security**: The bill mandates that charter schools post a bond to ensure funds are used for their stated purpose. However, questions were raised about whether charter schools could secure such bonds if they lack sufficient funds for construction.

4. **Competition for Funds**: Adding charter schools to the building aid process could create a **more competitive environment** for limited state funds, as charter schools would compete with public schools for the same pool of money.

5. **Lease Agreements and Double-Dipping**: Concerns were raised about how building aid would apply if a charter school leases a facility from a public school district. The public district would need to apply for aid, but potential **double-dipping** could occur if the charter school also qualifies for lease aid.

6. **Dissolution and Asset Disposition**: The bill outlines the process for voluntary or involuntary dissolution of charter schools, including the handling of assets and liabilities. The state will **not be held liable** for any debts or liabilities if the school’s assets are insufficient to cover them. Student records must be forwarded to the Department of Education or the student’s resident district.

### **Bill 147: Advisory Council for Special Education**
1. **Parent Majority Requirement**: The committee emphasized the federal mandate requiring **51% of the council to be parents of children with disabilities**. However, the council has struggled to meet this quota for nearly a decade, currently at **42%**. Proposals were made to adjust membership by removing non-parent members not federally required.

2. **Healthcare Provider Representation**: There was a proposal to add a healthcare provider (e.g., a pediatrician) to address medical needs related to disabilities. While some supported this, concerns were raised about maintaining the parent majority. Alternatives, such as consulting specialists on an as-needed basis, were suggested.

3. **Remote Participation**: The committee discussed the benefits of remote participation, enabled by **HB 308**, which allows parents and individuals with disabilities to join meetings virtually. This is expected to improve recruitment and retention of parent members.

4. **Council Functionality**: Several members expressed concerns about the council’s current dysfunction, noting that recent meetings have focused on internal logistics rather than addressing the needs of children with disabilities. The council has not produced an annual report since **2018-2019**, and initiatives have stalled.

5. **Proposed Amendments**: Representative Cordelli proposed amendments to streamline the council, including removing non-federally required members (e.g., representatives from the Disability Rights Center and Parent Information Center) to increase the parent majority. The amendments also suggested adding a clerk to handle meeting minutes and improve efficiency.

### **Other Key Discussions**
1. **Accountability and Oversight**: The committee debated accountability measures under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and considered delegating certain oversight responsibilities to the Legislative Oversight Committee.

2. **Career Schools and Bonds**: The committee discussed challenges faced by career schools, particularly the Mountain View Culinary Academy, in securing necessary bonds to operate. They debated reducing the bond amount to help the academy obtain its license.

3. **Mental Health Provisions**: The conversation touched on mental health provisions in education bills, with considerations about whether to retain or remove these provisions. The committee also discussed the importance of having a health provider on advisory councils.

4. **Committee Operations**: The meeting concluded with logistical discussions about future meetings, including scheduling and the process for making recommendations on the discussed bills. The committee agreed to reconvene on **October 18th** to finalize their recommendations.

### **Broader Context and Next Steps**
The committee acknowledged the significant workload ahead, with **109 bills expected in the next session**, and emphasized the need for thorough review and processing. The discussions reflected a balance between **supporting charter schools** and ensuring **fiscal responsibility**, as well as addressing the needs of students with disabilities through the Advisory Council for Special Education. The committee plans to gather more information, finalize amendments, and address unresolved issues before making final recommendations.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to refining education legislation to better serve New Hampshire’s educational institutions and students, while addressing concerns about funding, accountability, and representation.
