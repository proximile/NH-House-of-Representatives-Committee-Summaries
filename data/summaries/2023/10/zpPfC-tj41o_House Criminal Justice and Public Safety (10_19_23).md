The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on October 19, 2023, focused on critical issues within the state's criminal justice and public safety systems, particularly around bail reform, attorney shortages, pre-trial services, and their impacts on public defenders, county jails, and overall system efficiency. The discussions highlighted both the progress and challenges of the 2018 bail reforms, the strain on resources, and the need for comprehensive solutions to address systemic issues. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **Bail Reform and Pre-Trial Services**
The 2018 bail reform in New Hampshire eliminated bail bondsmen and shifted toward a system where individuals are either released on personal recognizance or held based on dangerousness assessments. This reform aimed to reduce reliance on cash bail, which disproportionately affected low-income individuals. However, concerns were raised about proposed changes that would add 12-13 offenses to a list requiring defendants to wait for a judge rather than seeing a bail commissioner. This would increase the number of bail hearings, placing additional strain on public defenders, prosecutors, and the court system. County officials also highlighted challenges with the current bail system, such as a lack of available bail commissioners, which delays processing and results in individuals being held longer than necessary.

### **Attorney Shortages and Caseloads**
The public defenderâ€™s office, which represents about 85% of criminal defendants in the state, is facing significant attrition due to burnout and pay disparities. Caseloads range from 75 to 105 cases per attorney, and the office struggles to recruit and retain staff despite aggressive efforts, including lateral hires and leveraging federal grants. Proposed changes to the bail system would exacerbate these challenges, potentially leading to delays in other cases and creating a backlog. The shift of felony arraignments from Superior Court to Circuit Court in January 2024 will further strain resources, requiring staffing for 31 circuit courts instead of 10 Superior Courts.

### **Impact on County Jails and Medical Costs**
County officials emphasized the rising costs of medical care for inmates, particularly for mental health and substance misuse issues. Inmates often arrive in poor health, requiring significant medical attention, which drives up costs for counties. The lack of pre-trial service programs in some counties, such as Hillsboro County, due to funding constraints, was also discussed. Pre-trial programs in other counties have shown cost savings by reducing the number of individuals held in jail, but establishing these programs requires additional funding and coordination. Electronic monitoring was explored as a cost-effective alternative to incarceration, but it would require significant staffing and resources to manage.

### **Recidivism and Reentry**
Officials discussed the challenges of reentry for individuals leaving custody, particularly in securing stable employment and addressing substance misuse. Better tracking of individuals released on bail is needed to monitor recidivism rates. The public defender highlighted the need for better mental health and substance use treatment options in the community, as incarceration often fails to address these underlying issues. Investing in treatment programs and diversion services could be more effective in reducing recidivism and improving public safety.

### **Financial Burden on Counties**
A recurring theme was the financial burden placed on counties due to state laws and policies. The state creates laws and sentences individuals, but the counties bear the cost of housing and caring for these individuals, especially those with parole violations or pre-trial detainees. This cost-shifting creates significant strain on county resources.

### **Future Considerations and Recommendations**
The committee discussed the potential consequences of proposed legislative changes, including the strain on the public defender system and the need for additional resources to handle increased caseloads. The public defender urged the committee to focus on solutions that address the root causes of criminal behavior, such as investing in pre-trial services, diversion programs, and mental health and substance use treatment, rather than increasing incarceration. County officials also called for comprehensive reforms to improve outcomes for individuals in the criminal justice system and reduce the financial burden on counties.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of bail reform, the challenges of attorney recruitment and retention, and the systemic issues affecting the criminal justice system in New Hampshire. Comprehensive reforms, increased funding, and a focus on addressing root causes of criminal behavior were emphasized as essential to improving public safety and ensuring the fair and efficient administration of justice.
