The New Hampshire House Finance Division I meeting on November 14, 2023, focused on **House Bill 436**, which proposed changes to the retirement plan for Group Two employees, particularly enhancing benefits for certain members. The bill had been removed from the final budget by the Senate but was retained by the committee for further action. The discussion revolved around the following key points:

1. **Retirement Commission Recommendations**: The Retirement Commission had voted 8-6 to support a plan that included increasing the retirement multiplier from 2% to 2.5% for all Group Two employees, not just a specific group. However, the financial impact and detailed language for this plan were still being finalized, delaying its implementation.

2. **Amendment to HB 436**: Representative Dan Maguire proposed an amendment to reintroduce **House Bill 50**, which aimed to pay down the state's unfunded retirement liability by $50 million using surplus funds from the education trust fund. This would reduce future employer contribution rates and lower the state's debt. The amendment passed 4-1 in the division.

3. **Financial Implications**: The committee emphasized the importance of having accurate financial data before moving forward with any changes. The Retirement System, LBA, and other stakeholders were working to finalize the numbers and fiscal notes for the proposed changes.

4. **Next Steps**: The committee decided to expedite a separate bill to address the Retirement Commission's recommendations once all details were finalized. Representative Maguire's amendment to HB 436 would be taken up by the full committee later in the day.

The meeting highlighted the complexity of retirement system reforms, the need for fiscal responsibility, and the committee's commitment to ensuring all stakeholders have accurate information before making decisions.
