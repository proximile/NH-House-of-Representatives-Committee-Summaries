The NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held a hearing on **House Bill 38** on November 16, 2023. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence for Staff Sergeant Tanner Grown, who was killed on November 10th. The focus of the hearing was on the **habitual offender statute (RSA 262:23)**, specifically addressing a confusing provision that allowed sentences to be suspended only in cases of extreme emergency. 

**Key Points Discussed:**
1. **County Attorney Steven Andris** explained that in 2016, the legislature removed the minimum mandatory one-year sentence for habitual offenders and allowed judges discretion to suspend sentences. However, a lingering provision in the statute led some judges to believe they could only suspend sentences in extreme emergencies.
2. The proposed **amendment to House Bill 38** aimed to clarify that judges have full discretion to suspend sentences, aligning with the 2016 legislative intent.
3. **Discussion Highlights:**
   - Representatives questioned why habitual offender violations were elevated to felony status. Andris explained that felony charges apply when individuals drive after being certified as habitual offenders, particularly if the certification was based on serious offenses like multiple DUIs.
   - The amendment was seen as a technical fix to eliminate confusion and ensure judges could use their discretion appropriately.

**Outcome:**
- The committee unanimously adopted the amendment.
- The committee voted **20-0** to recommend the bill as **OTP-A (Ought to Pass with Amendment)**.
- The meeting concluded with reminders about report deadlines and holiday wishes from the chair. 

The bill will now proceed with the amendment for further legislative action.
