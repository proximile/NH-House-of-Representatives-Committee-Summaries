**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (November 2, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on November 2, 2023, to address a range of issues related to bail procedures, public safety, and legislative updates. The meeting was divided into two main segments, covering detailed discussions, citizen testimony, and legislative proposals.

### **Key Discussions and Proposals**

1. **Mileage Reimbursement and Bail Fees**  
   The committee debated increasing the mileage reimbursement rate for bail commissioners from $40 to $50, citing inflation and the need to align with practices in other states. Concerns were raised about the administrative challenges of tracking mileage, but members acknowledged the necessity of fair compensation for bail commissioners.

2. **Bail Commissioner Processes**  
   Members discussed instances where defendants request bail commissioners despite knowing they cannot be bailed, which some viewed as a misuse of resources. The committee emphasized the importance of ensuring defendants see a judge in such cases rather than relying solely on bail commissioners.

3. **Telephonic Bail Hearings**  
   Representative Muse proposed formalizing telephonic bail hearings as a solution to staffing shortages and delays in processing bail cases. It was noted that some bail commissioners already conduct hearings via phone, and there is no statutory prohibition against this practice.

4. **Reoffending While on Bail**  
   The committee planned to explore the issue of reoffending while on bail in greater depth during future sessions, anticipating potential challenges in addressing this complex problem.

5. **Bail Commissioner Training and Oversight**  
   The committee discussed proposals to mandate 16 hours of initial training and 8 hours of annual training for bail commissioners, along with issuing durable identification cards. They emphasized the need for standardized training and oversight to ensure consistency across the state. Additionally, the committee considered requiring bail commissioners to be informed about defendants' bail statuses and ensuring timely reimbursements for their services.

6. **Legislative Vehicle**  
   The committee considered using House Bill 318 as a vehicle to implement these changes. They debated the financial and operational impacts of the proposed measures, particularly on indigent defendants and the court system, and stressed the importance of a balanced approach.

### **Citizen Testimony**

Maryann Jock, a concerned citizen, testified about her experiences with a problematic neighbor who has a history of criminal behavior, including parole violations and threats. She expressed frustration with the justice system's inability to adequately protect her family and community, despite repeated calls to law enforcement. Jock highlighted the financial and emotional toll this situation has taken, underscoring the need for stronger public safety measures.

### **Administrative Updates and Next Steps**

- Representative Murray provided a summary of past meeting minutes and testimonies, which were distributed to committee members.
- The committee held an informal vote to send their discussions to legislative services for drafting, with a formal vote planned for the next day.
- Upcoming topics were previewed, including the management and supervision of bail and a review of the "13 crimes list" from the Senate.

### **Meeting Logistics**

The meeting began with a 20-minute recess due to a family emergency involving the chair's college student son. Upon reconvening, the chair apologized for the delay, and the committee proceeded with the Pledge of Allegiance and opened the floor for testimony.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene the next day for further discussions. The committee focused on improving the bail commissioner system, addressing citizen concerns about public safety, and ensuring that legislative changes are practical, effective, and balanced in their impact.
