### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (11/08/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on November 8, 2023, featured detailed discussions on two key bills—**House Bill 601** and **House Bill 620**—alongside a proposal for an interim study on early childhood education. The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing fiscal responsibility with policy initiatives aimed at improving education and child welfare.

### **Interim Study on Early Childhood Education (Bill 620)**
The committee began by discussing a proposal for an interim study to evaluate the fiscal and logistical feasibility of implementing an early childhood education program in New Hampshire. Key points included:

1. **Proposal by Representative Heath**: Representative Heath suggested a short-term interim study to assess costs, student numbers, and program effectiveness, leveraging existing pilot programs run by the Department of Health and Human Services.
   
2. **Support and Opposition**: While several representatives supported the study, emphasizing the need for data-driven decision-making, others opposed it, arguing that similar studies (e.g., on Head Start) had already shown limited long-term benefits and that the policy direction was already decided.

3. **Vote and Outcome**: The motion for the interim study was defeated with a vote of 5 opposed to 4 in favor. Subsequently, the committee voted to indefinitely postpone (ITL) Bill 620, which proposed establishing an Early Learning Department within the Department of Education.

4. **Next Steps**: The committee planned to reconvene the following week to address other bills, with a focus on expediting unanimous decisions.

### **House Bill 601: Medicaid Direct Certification for School Meals**
The committee also debated **House Bill 601**, which seeks to streamline the process for children on Medicaid to access free or reduced-price school meals. Key discussions included:

1. **Medicaid Direct Certification**: The bill aims to reduce redundant paperwork by using Medicaid data to automatically certify eligible children for school meal programs. Currently, 38 states participate in this program.

2. **Financial Implications**: Implementing the bill could cost the state an estimated $190 million, as it would impact the education funding formula, which uses free and reduced meal data as a proxy for poverty.

3. **Pilot Program Suggestion**: Some representatives proposed a pilot program in select school districts to test the system before statewide implementation. However, the USDA has not yet opened applications for such a pilot, and federal reimbursement would not cover the costs.

4. **School Meal Debt**: The bill could help reduce meal debt in schools, which arises from providing meals to children regardless of their ability to pay.

5. **Concerns and Opposition**: Many representatives expressed concerns about the bill’s financial burden, data accuracy, and potential privacy issues. These concerns led to a motion to recommend ITL, which passed, effectively halting the bill’s progress.

### **House Bill 620: Establishing an Early Learning Department**
Briefly discussed alongside the interim study, **House Bill 620** proposes creating an Early Learning Department within the Department of Education. The bill’s sponsor requested an interim study to gather more information and collaborate with stakeholders, including the Senate, which is considering a similar bill. The committee agreed to recommend an interim study for this bill.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored the complexities of policy-making in education and child welfare, particularly in the context of fiscal constraints. Key themes included:

1. **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The value of interim studies and pilot programs was a recurring topic, with proponents arguing for more data to inform policy decisions and opponents questioning the necessity and cost of such studies.

2. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Concerns about the financial implications of proposed bills, particularly **House Bill 601**, dominated the discussions, leading to recommendations to indefinitely postpone both bills.

3. **Streamlining Processes**: The potential benefits of simplifying administrative processes, such as Medicaid direct certification for school meals, were acknowledged, but the financial and logistical challenges outweighed these benefits in the committee’s view.

4. **Collaboration and Next Steps**: The committee emphasized the importance of collaboration with stakeholders and planned to reconvene to address other bills, with a focus on efficiency.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the tension between advancing progressive policy initiatives and maintaining fiscal prudence in state governance.
