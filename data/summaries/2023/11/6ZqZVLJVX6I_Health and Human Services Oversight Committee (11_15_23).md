The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on November 15, 2023, focused on reestablishing the Subcommittee on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia. The meeting began with introductions and a pledge of allegiance, followed by a roll call of attendees, including representatives, caregivers, and professionals from various organizations.

Key points discussed included:
1. **Reestablishment of the Subcommittee**: The subcommittee, originally established in 2014, had become inactive after 2018. Jessica Esslin from the Alzheimer's Association highlighted the need to reconvene due to New Hampshire's rapidly aging population and a projected 23% increase in Alzheimer's and dementia cases in the next two years.

2. **Scope of Work**: The subcommittee's statutory charge includes reviewing other states' Alzheimer's plans, updating New Hampshire's outdated state plan (last updated in 2015), and addressing gaps in services. The scope also covers training requirements for long-term care staff, public safety capacity, home and community-based resources, and support for caregivers.

3. **Personal Stories and Challenges**: Several attendees shared personal experiences with Alzheimer's and dementia, emphasizing the stigma, lack of awareness, and difficulties in accessing resources. Representative Eric Alon discussed his father-in-law's resistance to diagnosis and the need for better support systems. Kathy Harvard, a caregiver, highlighted the need for public awareness campaigns and reducing stigma.

4. **Crisis in Adult Day Care Centers**: Maria Cango, Director of an Adult Day Center, reported that three centers in Southern New Hampshire are closing, creating a crisis for families and caregivers. She emphasized the high costs of running such programs and the lack of Medicare coverage for adult day care.

5. **Training and Education**: Concerns were raised about insufficient training for nursing staff, particularly in dementia care. The reduction in required training hours was criticized as inadequate.

6. **Non-Pharmacological Interventions**: J Gupta, a pharmacist, advocated for non-pharmacological interventions and the importance of addressing root causes of dementia rather than just treating symptoms. He also emphasized the need for deprescribing unnecessary medications.

7. **Living Conditions and Resources**: Senator Kevin Aard shared a personal story about cleaning the home of a World War II veteran with Alzheimer's, highlighting the dire living conditions and abandonment faced by some individuals. He called for better resources and support for such cases.

8. **Legislative Goals**: The subcommittee discussed potential legislative actions, including updating the state Alzheimer's plan, addressing transportation issues, and creating public awareness campaigns. The group also considered attaching amendments to existing legislation to address immediate crises, such as the closure of adult day care centers.

9. **Next Steps**: Attendees were asked to submit bullet points outlining their priorities and proposed solutions. The subcommittee plans to meet again before the end of the year to review these inputs and develop actionable plans.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, with members expressing a strong commitment to addressing the challenges posed by Alzheimer's and dementia in New Hampshire.
