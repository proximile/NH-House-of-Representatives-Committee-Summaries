**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Legislative Administration Meeting (11/08/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on November 8, 2023, for a Legislative Administration committee meeting focused on reviewing and amending **Senate Bill 84**, a bill aimed at repealing or consolidating various committees and commissions that have outlived their purpose. The session included public hearings, debates, and votes on several amendments, as well as broader discussions about streamlining government operations and ensuring the effectiveness of legislative bodies.

### Key Highlights:

1. **Pledge of Allegiance and Introductions**  
   The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and introductions of substitutes and new committee members.

2. **Amendments to Senate Bill 84**  
   The committee held public hearings on multiple amendments to Senate Bill 84, including:  
   - **Winant Memorial Amendment (2023-2418)**: Repealed the John G. Winant Memorial Commission, transferring its oversight responsibilities to the Joint Legislative Historical Committee for maintenance. This amendment received strong support.  
   - **Annual Indexing of Commissions (2023-2372)**: Removed the requirement for an annual index on commissions, as the information is now accessible via an export function on the legislative website. This change was generally supported.  
   - **Environmental Councils Amendment (2023-2400h)**: Extended the reporting deadline for a study committee on the Department of Environmental Services' appeals process by one year. While supported, it was acknowledged that further work is needed.  
   - **Condo Study Committee Extension**: Debated extending the life of the **Condominium and Homeowners Association Study Committee** by one year. Representative Aly Susan Elme argued for its necessity to address ongoing condominium governance issues, while others questioned whether its functions could be transferred to the Commerce Committee. Ultimately, the committee was granted a one-year extension.  
   - **Repeal of Unnecessary Committees (2023-23998)**: Repealed six committees identified by the Special Committee on Commissions as no longer necessary.  

3. **Omnibus Bill (Senate Bill 84)**  
   The amendments were consolidated into a single omnibus amendment for Senate Bill 84, which included changes to the effective dates of termination for certain committees. The bill, as amended, was moved to pass with broad support.

4. **Sunset Date Requirement**  
   A suggestion was made to include a provision in Senate Bill 84 requiring new committees or task forces to have a sunset date. However, it was noted that existing statutes already address this requirement.

5. **Discussion on Committees and Commissions**  
   The committee engaged in a broader debate about the purpose and effectiveness of study committees, emphasizing the need to streamline government operations and reduce redundancy. The process of identifying and repealing unnecessary committees was highlighted as a key step in achieving this goal.

6. **Executive Session**  
   After public hearings, the committee moved into an executive session to further discuss Senate Bill 84 and its amendments. The initial motion was to recommend that the bill "ought to pass," with open discussion on the proposed changes.

### Conclusion:  
The meeting concluded with the passage of Senate Bill 84 as amended, reflecting the committee's efforts to evaluate the necessity of various legislative bodies, streamline government operations, and ensure that active committees are fulfilling their intended purposes. The session was adjourned with appreciation for the members' work.
