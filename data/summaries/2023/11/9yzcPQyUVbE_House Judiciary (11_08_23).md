The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee meeting on November 8, 2023, covered a wide range of bills and amendments, with discussions focusing on privacy protections, gender identity, tenant rights, and the role of government in regulating sensitive areas. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **Privacy and Data Protection**
- **House Bill 255**: This bill aims to provide privacy protections for customers of larger companies, allowing them to opt out of marketing uses of their personal data and request access, correction, or deletion of their data. An amendment was proposed to expand coverage by lowering the threshold for inclusion from 100,000 to 35,000 customers and standardizing procedures for consumers to exercise their rights. The bill emphasizes avoiding conflicts with federal law and includes provisions for the Attorney General to enforce violations after a cure period.
- **House Bill 314**: The committee discussed proposed changes focusing on privacy protections and the disclosure of personal information by third-party providers. The bill includes provisions for notifying individuals when their information is requested by government entities, with exceptions for emergencies or court orders.

### **Gender Identity and Sports**
- **House Bill 396**: This bill sparked a heated debate over the classification of individuals based on biological sex in sensitive situations like sports, prisons, and restrooms. Representative Perez introduced an amendment emphasizing safety, dignity, and privacy concerns, particularly for women and children. Opponents argued that such classifications are unnecessary and that existing laws are sufficient. The discussion highlighted broader debates on gender identity, with some members advocating for privacy and safety protections based on biological sex, while others emphasized inclusivity and understanding.
- **Controversy in Sports**: The debate centered on fairness in sports, with concerns raised about biological males competing in female sports. Representatives argued that biological males have inherent physical advantages, which could disadvantage female athletes. The discussion also touched on safety concerns of mixed-gender sports, particularly as children reach adolescence. An amendment to the bill failed with a 10-10 tie, and the main bill was discussed with the intent to bring it to the full House floor for further debate.

### **Tenant Rights and Landlord Regulations**
- **House Bill 283**: This bill aims to limit application fees charged to prospective residential tenants. The subcommittee proposed several amendments, with a key disagreement over the penalties for landlords who violate the law. One amendment proposed returning all application fees to the applicant, while another included additional penalties. The committee debated the merits of each amendment, with some members favoring a compromise that includes court costs. There was also debate over whether renewal fees for rental applications should be regulated.

### **Right to Know Laws**
- **House Bill 149**: This bill deals with the right to know laws, requiring municipalities to provide periodic updates if requested information cannot be provided within a specified timeframe. The committee decided to hold off on further action, considering the recent establishment of a new right-to-know ombudsman.
- **House Bill 652**: This bill proposed expanding the "Right to Know" law to require notification before adverse actions are taken in non-public meetings. It was voted **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** due to concerns about the bill's broad language and potential conflicts with existing procedures for handling sensitive information.

### **Human Rights Commission and Other Bills**
- **House Bill 362**: This bill addresses complaint procedures before the Commission for Human Rights. The committee discussed significant delays in case processing and the ongoing performance audit of the commission. The committee voted **ITL**, agreeing to wait for the audit results before taking further action.
- **House Bill 533**: This bill, which initially sought to grant the Department of Education subpoena power, was also voted **ITL**. Concerns were raised about its scope and drafting, and it was suggested that a new, more narrowly focused bill would be introduced in the next legislative session.

### **Overall Themes and Divisions**
The meeting highlighted significant divisions on issues related to privacy, gender identity, and the role of government in regulating sensitive areas like sports and restrooms. The committee moved forward with several amendments and bills, with some members expressing concerns about overreach and others emphasizing the need for protections. Discussions also underscored the importance of careful drafting and consideration of federal and state legal frameworks.

In summary, the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee’s meeting on November 8, 2023, was marked by robust debates and careful consideration of various legislative proposals, reflecting the complexities and sensitivities of the issues at hand.
