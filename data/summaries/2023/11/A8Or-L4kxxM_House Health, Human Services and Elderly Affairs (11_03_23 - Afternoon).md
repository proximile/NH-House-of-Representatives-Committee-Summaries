**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (11/03/23 - Afternoon)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on November 3, 2023, focused on critical issues related to health, human services, and elderly affairs, particularly the implementation challenges of the **New Hampshire Easy system**, the **Bureau of Developmental Services (BDS) redesign**, and proposed legislation like **House Bill 608** and **House Bill 317**. The discussions highlighted systemic issues, financial pressures on providers, and the need for legislative oversight and collaboration to improve services for individuals with disabilities and their families.

### **Key Themes and Issues:**

1. **Challenges with the New Hampshire Easy System**:
   - Since its implementation on July 1, 2023, the New Hampshire Easy system has caused significant chaos for area agencies, providers, and families. Issues include **billing problems**, **software glitches**, and **insufficient staff training**, leading to financial shortfalls, hiring freezes, and delayed projects.
   - Many agencies are struggling financially, requiring stabilization funds or credit lines despite Medicaid rate increases in the state budget.
   - Providers emphasized the need to stabilize cash flow and focus on corrective actions before introducing new initiatives like **Electronic Visit Verification (EVV)**, which could further strain the system.

2. **House Bill 608: Pilot Program for BDS Redesign**:
   - HB 608 proposes a pilot program to support the BDS redesign, but its necessity was debated. Some argued the department could implement changes without legislation, while others advocated for a subcommittee to monitor progress and ensure stakeholder input.
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) acknowledged implementation challenges, particularly with **direct billing** and **EVV compliance**. Providers face financial strain due to billing issues, including overpayments that require repayment.
   - The committee considered amendments to the bill, such as changing the start date to July 1, 2024, and removing an interim report requirement. Concerns were raised about legislative overreach and the balance between oversight and executive autonomy.

3. **Financial and Staffing Challenges**:
   - DHHS reported paying **$106.9 million** to agencies but noted ongoing reconciliation to address overpayments and ensure financial stability. Repayment deadlines were extended for agencies struggling with cash flow.
   - Staffing shortages persist, with vacancy rates improving from 22% in December 2022 to 18% recently. However, key positions like the Bureau Chief and Chief Operating Officer remain unfilled, impacting operations.

4. **Medicaid Billing and EVV Compliance**:
   - Providers, especially small organizations, face significant challenges with the new **Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)**, including delayed payments, complex coding, and the need for extensive oversight.
   - EVV implementation has been particularly challenging in rural areas with poor cell coverage. DHHS emphasized the federal mandate for EVV but acknowledged ongoing fines for non-compliance.

5. **House Bill 317: Two-Tier Waiver System**:
   - HB 317 proposed a two-tier waiver system for disability services, but DHHS clarified they are not pursuing this until at least 2026, focusing instead on strengthening the existing waiver.
   - Stakeholders expressed concerns about potential inequities and the importance of maintaining a person-centered approach. The committee voted to **interim study HB 317**, effectively pausing further action.

6. **Collaboration and Oversight**:
   - A recent meeting between area agency leadership and DHHS was described as productive, with both sides committing to work together to address system issues. Bi-weekly meetings are planned to continue collaboration.
   - The committee discussed the importance of legislative oversight, with suggestions to form subcommittees or use interim studies to maintain momentum and address ongoing issues.

7. **Provider and Family Perspectives**:
   - Testimony highlighted the critical role families play in supporting individuals with developmental disabilities, often providing unpaid care due to workforce shortages and housing crises. Service coordinators are overwhelmed, leading to high turnover rates.
   - Providers shared their experiences with the transition to the new billing system, noting delays in payments and the complexity of the system, which has diverted resources from other critical areas.

8. **Positive Developments and Cautious Optimism**:
   - Despite the challenges, there is cautious optimism that progress is being made, with increased awareness and commitment from DHHS to resolve system issues.
   - The committee recommended an interim study for HB 608 to continue working on broader issues and ensure ongoing communication and collaboration among all stakeholders.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting underscored the complexities of implementing new systems and redesigning services, the financial and operational pressures on providers, and the importance of collaboration between stakeholders, DHHS, and the legislature. The committeeâ€™s focus on oversight, corrective actions, and stakeholder input aims to stabilize the system and improve services for individuals with disabilities and their families in New Hampshire.
