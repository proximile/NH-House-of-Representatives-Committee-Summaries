**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (November 8, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on November 8, 2023, to discuss and vote on a wide range of legislative proposals. The meeting covered significant topics, including environmental regulations, consumer protections, health care, and emerging technologies. Here are the key highlights:

### **Environmental and Consumer Protection**
1. **PFAS-Related Bills**: Multiple bills addressing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in food packaging, consumer products, and insurance coverage were discussed. Most were moved to interim study, as a more comprehensive bill incorporating these aspects is expected in the next session.
2. **Home Appliance Repair (HB 73)**: The bill was moved to interim study, as it was deemed not ready for legislation and required further exploration.
3. **Toilet Facilities in Restaurants (HB 173)**: The bill passed unanimously with an amendment repealing outdated sections of the law.

### **Health Care and Insurance**
4. **Alcohol Over-Serving Penalties (HB 279)**: The bill, which increases penalties for on-premise licensees over-serving alcohol, was amended and passed unanimously.
5. **Health Insurance and Pain Management (HB 303)**: The bill was moved to interim study for further stakeholder collaboration.
6. **All-Payer Insurance System (HB 319)**: The proposal for a study committee on an all-payer insurance system was deemed inexpedient to legislate.
7. **Reproductive Health Care Coverage (SB 198)**: The bill directing a cost study for reproductive health care coverage was deemed inexpedient to legislate due to high costs.
8. **Primary Care Behavioral Health (SB 235)**: The bill was moved to interim study, with a bulletin expected soon.
9. **Prompt Payment for Managed Care (SB 82)**: The bill was moved to interim study, citing concerns over the cost of implementing notifications at every step of the payment process.

### **Emerging Technologies and Economic Development**
10. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) (HB 645)**: The bill, which establishes DAOs as legal entities with legal protections similar to LLCs, was amended and passed unanimously. The aim is to attract economic activity to the state.
11. **Central Bank Digital Currencies (HB 225)**: The bill was moved to interim study, with some members expressing concerns about legislating on an issue that is still evolving and potentially unconstitutional.
12. **Fair Access to Financial Services (HB 227)**: The bill, which involves Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria in banking, was initially deemed inexpedient to legislate. However, after further discussion, a motion for interim study passed, with some members opposing government interference in bank business models.

### **Housing and Real Estate**
13. **Residential Manufactured Housing (SB 75)**: The bill, which creates a study committee on resident-owned manufactured housing parks, was moved to interim study due to its importance to constituents.
14. **Condo Liens for Assessments (HB 178)**: The bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate, citing potential financial burdens on condo associations during economic downturns.
15. **Condo Financial Disclosure (HB 239)**: The bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate, citing the high cost of requiring audited financials for all condos.

### **Miscellaneous**
16. **Cannabis Legalization (HB 544)**: The bill legalizing cannabis for retail sale was moved to interim study, with representatives expressing support for legalization in New Hampshire.
17. **Event Ticket Resale (SB 201)**: The bill regulating the resale of event tickets was moved to interim study as the Senate works with the Attorney Generalâ€™s office on enforcement.
18. **Prohibiting State Contracts with Chinese Entities (HB 86)**: The bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate, as existing federal laws already address the issue.
19. **Repealing the Drug Affordability Board (HB 130)**: The bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate, as the board had already been established and funded.

### **Procedural and Logistical Matters**
Throughout the meeting, there were procedural discussions, votes on amendments, and motions to place bills on the consent calendar. The committee also addressed technical corrections and logistical issues, such as ensuring members spoke into microphones for clarity.

The meeting concluded with reminders to submit reports promptly and well wishes for the holiday season. The committee will reconvene in January for further discussions on pending bills.
