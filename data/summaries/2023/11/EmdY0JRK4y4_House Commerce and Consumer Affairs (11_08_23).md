1. **Insurance Costs and Fiscal Note**  
   The committee discussed the potential financial impact of the state covering costs for individuals and small group insurance. A fiscal note was deemed necessary due to the significant expense. A motion to expedite legislation on this matter passed unanimously (19-0).

2. **Senate Bill 201 (Resale of Event Tickets)**

3. **Senate Bill 235 (Primary Care Behavioral Health Model)**  
   SB 235 was also moved to interim study, with the understanding that a related bulletin was nearly ready. The motion passed unanimously (19-0).

4. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**  
   The committee discussed **HB 645**, which seeks to recognize DAOs as legal entities in New Hampshire, offering them protections similar to LLCs. The bill was amended and passed with a 17-2 vote, with plans for further discussion in the Senate.

5. **Cannabis Legalization**  
   **HB 544**, which would legalize cannabis for retail sale, was moved to interim study to allow further discussion. This decision was influenced by the formation of a new commission studying marijuana legalization.

6. **PFAS Regulations**  
   Several bills addressing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in consumer products, food packaging, and insurance coverage were discussed.

7. **Health Insurance**  
   Bills related to health insurance coverage for pain management services, reproductive health care, and pharmacy benefit managers were discussed. Many were moved to interim study or voted inexpedient to legislate due to existing regulations or ongoing studies.

8. **Prompt Payment for Managed Care**  
   **SB 82**, addressing prompt payment issues for managed care, was voted inexpedient to legislate due to its complexity and the need for further clarity.

9. **Condominium Liens and Financial Disclosure**  
   **HB 178**, related to condominium liens, and **HB 239**, requiring financial disclosure for condominiums, were both voted inexpedient to legislate due to concerns over costs and redundancy.
