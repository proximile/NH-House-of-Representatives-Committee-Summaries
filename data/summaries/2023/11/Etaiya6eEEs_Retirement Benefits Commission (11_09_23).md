**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Retirement Benefits Commission Meeting (November 9, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Retirement Benefits Commission convened on November 9, 2023, to discuss and review proposed changes to retirement benefits, particularly for public safety employees (Group Two members, including police, firefighters, and corrections officers) and state employees. The meeting centered on balancing the need to address recruitment and retention challenges in public service roles with the state’s fiscal responsibilities and the potential impact on taxpayers. Key discussions and proposals included:

### **Proposals for Public Safety Employees**
1. **Proposal 1**: A 2.5% multiplier for retirement benefits after 15 years of service.
2. **Proposal 2**: A 2.5% multiplier after 10 years of service.

**Key Points Discussed**:
- **Cost Estimates**: The 10-year proposal would require an upfront cost of approximately $55 million, with ongoing annual costs of $5.1 million, while the 15-year proposal would cost $36.3 million upfront, with annual costs of $3.3 million.
- **Retention and Recruitment**: Both proposals aim to improve retention and recruitment in public safety roles, which have been struggling due to reduced benefits and increased employee contributions in recent years.
- **Affordability Concerns**: Senator Bradley and others expressed concerns about the affordability of the 10-year proposal, citing the state’s $58 million general fund surplus and potential financial obligations, such as the $175 million Youth Development Center (YDC) settlement. They advocated for the 15-year proposal as a more fiscally prudent option.
- **Compromise and Motion**: Senator Susi and others argued for the 10-year proposal, emphasizing its broader impact on retention and alignment with the commission’s goals. A motion to recommend the 10-year proposal was made but faced opposition from members like Senator Bradley, who preferred the 15-year option.

### **Retirement Benefits for State Employees and Broader Issues**
1. **Nashua and State Employees**: A representative highlighted the challenges faced by communities like Nashua, where state contributions to retirement benefits have decreased from 35% to nothing, creating financial burdens for municipalities and making it difficult to attract and retain public service employees.
2. **Gray Proposal**: Several representatives supported the "Gray Proposal," which includes a $55.9 million allocation to address immediate retirement benefit issues for Group Two employees. This proposal aims to improve benefits for public safety workers who have faced reductions in recent years.
3. **Impact on Property Taxpayers**: Concerns were raised about the potential impact of increased retirement benefit costs on property taxpayers, as additional rate increases could directly affect them.
4. **Deferred Compensation Plans**: Senator Gray proposed legislation to allow state employees to receive up to a 5% employer match on contributions to the public employees’ deferred compensation plan. However, the motion failed on a tie vote, with some arguing it was unnecessary or that the focus should remain on reinstating cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs).
5. **Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)**: There was significant discussion about reinstating COLAs for retirees, which were eliminated in 2011. Some representatives emphasized the need for COLAs to ensure benefits keep pace with inflation, while others noted the commission had not yet reached a consensus on this issue.
6. **Part-Time Employees and Retirement Contributions**: A proposal was made to allow vested employees who return to work part-time to continue contributing to the retirement system, an issue deemed worth further exploration given the rise in part-time workers.
7. **Minority Report**: Senator Bradley indicated that a minority report would be filed in support of the 15-year vesting proposal, which was not adopted by the commission.

### **Next Steps**
The commission will continue to discuss unresolved issues, particularly COLAs and part-time employee contributions, and prepare a final report for submission by December 1st. The discussions highlighted the complexities of addressing retirement benefits, with differing opinions on how to balance improvements in benefits with fiscal responsibility and the potential impact on taxpayers.

Overall, the meeting underscored the ongoing debate between addressing critical retention and recruitment challenges in public safety and state employee roles and managing the state’s financial obligations and taxpayer concerns. The commission’s recommendations will be forwarded for further legislative action.
