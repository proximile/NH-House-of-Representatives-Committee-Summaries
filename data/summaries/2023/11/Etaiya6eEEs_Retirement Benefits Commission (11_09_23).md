**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Retirement Benefits Commission Meeting (November 9, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Retirement Benefits Commission convened on November 9, 2023, to address critical issues related to retirement benefits, with a focus on cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and proposed changes for public safety employees (Group Two members). The meeting emphasized collaboration, fiscal responsibility, and the need to address recruitment and retention challenges in public safety roles.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Minority Report and COLA Study**  
   The commission discussed the submission of a Minority Report, which includes a study on the cost of living adjustment (COLA). The report, to be approved and submitted by December 1st, highlighted unresolved issues regarding COLA increases. The group acknowledged differing opinions on the matter and stressed the importance of continued dialogue to reach a consensus. Senator Bradley commended the chair for their leadership and efforts in organizing the process, recognizing it as a significant step forward. Members expressed gratitude for the chair’s hard work and the collaborative spirit of the commission.

2. **Review of Minutes and Actuarial Cost Estimates**  
   The commission reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting and examined actuarial cost estimates for proposed changes to retirement benefits. Marty Carlin from the New Hampshire Retirement System presented detailed cost analyses for two key proposals involving adjustments to the retirement benefit multiplier for Group Two members (police, firefighters, etc.).

3. **Proposed Benefit Changes for Group Two Members**  
   The main proposals centered on increasing the retirement benefit multiplier from 2% to 2.5% after either 10 or 15 years of service. The cost implications of these changes were thoroughly discussed, with estimates ranging from $36.3 million to $55.9 million, depending on whether the proposal included future hires.

4. **Debate and Vote on Proposals**  
   The commission debated the merits of the 10-year versus 15-year proposals. Proponents of the 10-year plan argued it would better address retention and recruitment challenges in public safety roles, while others favored the 15-year plan for its lower cost and alignment with mid-career benefits. Senator Susie proposed a motion to adopt the 10-year plan, which was seconded by Senator Reel. After extensive discussion, the motion passed, though some members raised concerns about affordability and the potential impact on property taxpayers.

5. **Other Discussions**  
   The commission also explored allowing part-time employees already vested in the retirement system to continue contributing to it. Additionally, potential changes to COLAs for retirees were discussed, but no consensus was reached on these issues.

6. **Legislative Recommendations**  
   The commission recommended incorporating the approved retirement benefit changes into House Bill 436. Members also highlighted the need for further work on unresolved issues, such as COLAs and part-time employee contributions, to ensure a comprehensive and equitable retirement benefits system.

### Conclusion  
The meeting underscored the commission’s commitment to balancing competitive retirement benefits with fiscal responsibility. By addressing the needs of public safety employees and fostering open dialogue on unresolved issues, the commission aimed to strengthen the state’s retirement system while supporting recruitment and retention efforts in critical roles. The collaborative approach and thoughtful discussions reflected the commission’s dedication to achieving sustainable and fair solutions for all stakeholders.
