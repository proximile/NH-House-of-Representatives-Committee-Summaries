**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on State-Controlled Cannabis Sales (11/03/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on November 3, 2023, to discuss the Commission to Study State-Controlled Sales of Cannabis and Cannabis Products. The meeting focused on proposing legislation to establish a state-controlled cannabis system, addressing public health, safety, equity, and regulatory challenges. Key themes and discussion points included:

### **Public Health and Safety**
1. **Health Risks**: Concerns were raised about the health impacts of cannabis use, particularly high-THC products, which are linked to increased risks of psychosis, mental illness, suicidality, impaired driving, and adverse effects on adolescent cognition and pregnancy outcomes. High-potency products like vapes and concentrates were singled out as particularly harmful.
2. **Youth Protection**: Experts emphasized the risks of cannabis use among youth, including dependency and mental health issues. Robust public education campaigns, health warnings on products, and strict marketing restrictions were recommended to minimize youth exposure.
3. **Secondhand Smoke**: Public consumption of cannabis raised concerns about secondhand smoke affecting bystanders, especially children, and the potential for individuals to test positive for THC due to exposure in public spaces.

### **State-Controlled System**
1. **Quebec Model**: The Quebec model of state-controlled cannabis sales was praised for its focus on public health, limiting high-potency products, restricting aggressive marketing, and reducing consumption. This approach was seen as a way to avoid the pitfalls of commercialization and profit-driven models.
2. **Product Regulation**: Recommendations included strict limits on THC potency, banning harmful additives, enforcing plain packaging, and regulating intoxicating hemp products currently sold outside the legal system.
3. **Testing and Quality Control**: Laboratory testing was highlighted as critical for ensuring product safety. The pros and cons of state-run labs versus third-party independent labs were discussed, with an emphasis on ISO 17025 accreditation and rigorous testing for contaminants like heavy metals and pesticides.

### **Equity and Decriminalization**
1. **Automatic Expungement**: The commission emphasized the need to address past inequities by automatically expunging non-violent cannabis possession records and prioritizing equity in licensing.
2. **Decriminalization**: While legalization was discussed, there was a focus on avoiding further criminalization of cannabis use, particularly for public consumption, with suggestions for graduated penalties (e.g., fines for first offenses) rather than misdemeanors.

### **Legal and Regulatory Challenges**
1. **Enforcement and Coordination**: Concerns were raised about enforcement challenges, including the discrepancy between state hemp laws and high-THC cannabis products. The commission discussed the need for clear regulations and coordination between local and federal law enforcement.
2. **Residency and Access**: The definition of "resident" was debated, with concerns about excluding homeless individuals from accessing legal cannabis. The commission also discussed the legality of gifting or transferring cannabis, particularly to individuals under 21.
3. **Federal vs. State Law**: There was significant debate about whether state and local law enforcement should assist federal agencies in enforcing federal cannabis laws, with some members advocating for a sanctuary policy to protect state-legal activities.

### **Revenue and Resource Allocation**
1. **Tax Revenue**: Discussions included how tax revenues from cannabis sales should be allocated, with a focus on funding youth prevention, treatment, and enforcement programs.
2. **Resource Challenges**: The commission acknowledged resource limitations for law enforcement but emphasized the need for legislation that supports effective enforcement without overburdening agencies.

### **Lessons from Other States**
1. **Avoiding Mistakes**: The commission warned against mistakes made in other states, such as overproduction, excessive retail density, and inadequate enforcement against intoxicating hemp products. Starting with conservative regulations and adjusting over time was recommended.
2. **Public Health Focus**: The proposed system should prioritize public health, with oversight from a commission of experts in medicine, substance abuse, law enforcement, and education. The goal is to provide legal access without driving up consumption or creating a new "big tobacco" industry.

### **Next Steps**
The commission agreed to revisit several issues at future meetings, including the definition of "resident," penalties for public consumption, and the enforceability of THC-related language. Members were tasked with reviewing other sections of the bill and consulting with the Attorney Generalâ€™s office for legal clarity.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of legalizing cannabis in New Hampshire, balancing public health, safety, equity, and regulatory enforcement. The proposed state-controlled system aims to mitigate risks, protect vulnerable populations, and create a sustainable model that avoids the pitfalls seen in other states. Further discussions and expert input will be critical in shaping effective and inclusive legislation.
