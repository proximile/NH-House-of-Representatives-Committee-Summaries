The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on November 15, 2023, focused on a series of bills and amendments related to criminal justice and public safety, addressing a wide range of issues from bail reform to drug testing and law enforcement standards. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting:

---

### **Bail System Reforms and Judicial Improvements**
1. **Bail Commissioners’ ID Cards and Training**:  
   - The House authorized the issuance of physical photo ID cards for bail commissioners, similar to those used by House members, with the court collaborating with the DMV to implement this.  
   - Standardized training requirements were established, mandating 16 hours of initial training and 8 hours of annual training for new bail commissioners, ensuring consistency and accountability.  

2. **Bail Fee Increase and Payment Timeliness**:  
   - The bail fee was raised from $40 to $50 to account for increased travel costs, as bail commissioners often travel long distances without compensation. The bill also ensures timely payment to address significant delays in fee disbursement.  

3. **Magistrates and Bail Hearings**:  
   - A bill (SB 249) was discussed to establish magistrates to assist with bail hearings, warrants, and other judicial functions, aiming to reduce the burden on Circuit Court judges and ensure timely hearings, especially on weekends.  

4. **Bail and Dangerousness Standards**:  
   - The bill limits bail restrictions to felony charges and adjusts the standard of evidence for holding someone on dangerousness from "clear and convincing" to "substantial evidence," striking a balance between probable cause and higher standards.  

5. **Cash Bail Reforms**:  
   - The bill emphasizes that cash bail should only be set at an amount the defendant can afford, avoiding excessive bail that effectively detains individuals on financial grounds.  

6. **Electronic Monitoring for Protective Order Violations**:  
   - For individuals charged with violating protective orders, the court can only release them with electronic monitoring to protect domestic violence victims. Law enforcement must obtain a search warrant to access monitoring data, ensuring privacy protections.

### **Pre-Trial Services and Court Modernization**
1. **Pre-Trial Services Study**:  
   - The Interbranch Criminal Justice and Juvenile Law Commission was tasked with studying pre-trial services to reduce incarceration costs by providing interventions for individuals with substance abuse or mental health issues. The goal is to establish a gold standard for pre-trial services and create a fund to incentivize counties to develop these systems.  

2. **Court System Modernization**:  
   - The commission will also study modernizing the court’s computer systems to improve case tracking and data accessibility across the state.  

3. **Victim Witness Services**:  
   - The commission will evaluate and set standards for victim witness services to ensure consistent support for crime victims statewide.

### **Drug Testing and Harm Reduction**
1. **Drug Testing Equipment**:  
   - Representatives debated a bill (HB 470) to allow drug testing equipment and nominal amounts of drugs for harm reduction purposes, such as fentanyl test strips. Supporters argued it would save lives by enabling individuals to test drugs for dangerous substances, while opponents expressed concerns about enabling drug use. The committee ultimately voted the bill Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL).  

2. **Overdose Data and Autopsies**:  
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of autopsies performed on overdose deaths in New Hampshire, limiting the understanding of what substances are causing fatalities. Representatives emphasized the need for better data to address the overdose crisis.

### **Law Enforcement and Public Safety Standards**
1. **Physical Fitness Standards for Police Officers (HB 1113)**:  
   - The House debated repealing the state-mandated physical fitness test for police officers, tied to certification and required every three years. Supporters argued the Cooper standards are outdated and hinder recruitment, while opponents maintained they ensure officers are physically capable. The motion to pass the bill failed, and it will proceed to the House floor with no recommendation.  

2. **Firearms for Felons (HB 144)**:  
   - The committee unanimously voted ITL on a bill that would have allowed felons to regain firearm rights, citing existing state processes and public safety concerns.  

3. **Cannabis Cultivation in Federally Subsidized Housing (HB 344)**:  
   - The committee voted ITL on a bill that would have allowed cannabis cultivation in federally subsidized housing, citing conflicts with federal law and potential loss of housing for residents.  

---

### **Asset Forfeiture and Victim Notification**
1. **Asset Forfeiture (HB 593)**:  
   - A bill related to the forfeiture of assets was discussed, with an amendment proposed to study the issue further due to its complexity.  

2. **Victim Notification (HB 318)**:  
   - The bill focused on notifying victims when offenders arrested for violent crimes are released, addressing the appointment and removal of bail commissioners, and the issuance of identification cards for them.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with unanimous approval of several amendments, highlighting bipartisan collaboration and months of subcommittee work. Representatives expressed appreciation for the team effort and emphasized the importance of continued progress in criminal justice reform. The next session will address a non-germane amendment in a public hearing.  

Throughout the discussions, representatives emphasized the need for public safety, harm reduction, and judicial efficiency while balancing concerns about enabling drug use, maintaining high policing standards, and ensuring local control. The meeting reflected a comprehensive approach to addressing complex issues in New Hampshire’s criminal justice and public safety systems.
