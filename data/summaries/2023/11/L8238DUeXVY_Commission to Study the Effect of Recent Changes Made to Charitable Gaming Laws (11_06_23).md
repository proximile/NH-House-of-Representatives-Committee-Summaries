**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws (11/06/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting of the **Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws**, with a particular focus on the introduction of **Historical Horse Racing (HHR)** machines. The meeting was divided into three segments, addressing scheduling, substantive discussions, and detailed analysis of gaming operations and revenue distribution. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **Scheduling and Logistics (Segment 1/3)**
The commission began by addressing logistical and planning matters for future meetings:  
1. **Scheduling**: Members debated availability, ultimately tentatively agreeing to meet on **December 4th at 10:00 AM** and planning a second meeting on **December 18th**.  
2. **Meeting Location**: Options included the current room, the state house, or the Lottery building, with the latter being favored for its ample parking.  
3. **Remote Participation**: While in-person attendance was preferred for engagement, the commission acknowledged the need for remote participation options to accommodate absent members.  
4. **Agenda Items**: Members were encouraged to propose topics for future discussions, though no specific items were suggested during this segment.  

The meeting concluded with the chair adjourning the session and thanking participants for their input.

### **Substantive Discussions on Charitable Gaming (Segment 2/3)**
The commission delved into the effects of recent changes to charitable gaming laws, focusing on fairness, transparency, and community impact:  
1. **Rent and Charity Allocation**: Significant variability in rent charged to charities (5%-50%) was noted, with smaller facilities often charging higher rates. Concerns were raised about fairness, especially with the introduction of HHR, which has led to split rents and inconsistencies.  
2. **Historical Horse Racing (HHR)**: The introduction of HHR has created a two-tier system for charities. **Tier 1** charities receive all revenue from traditional games and half from HHR, while **Tier 2** charities only receive HHR revenue. This system is set to expire in January 2024, potentially leading to a 50/50 split between charities.  
3. **Community Funding**: The need for host communities to receive financial support (e.g., a percentage of revenues) was emphasized, with comparisons made to states like Maine where such practices exist.  
4. **Consultant and Data Analysis**: A subcommittee was formed to define the scope of work for a consultant who will analyze gaming regulations, allocations, and economic impacts.  
5. **Transparency and Advertising**: Concerns were raised about the lack of visibility for charities within gaming facilities, with suggestions to improve signage and public awareness.  
6. **Future Meetings**: The commission planned to hold two more meetings before Christmas, exploring hybrid options for remote participation.

### **Detailed Analysis of Gaming Operations (Segment 3/3)**
The commission examined the operational and financial aspects of charitable gaming, particularly HHR:  
1. **Absent Member**: Lou Alisandra was unable to attend due to hospitalization, but the meeting was live-streamed for his viewing.  
2. **Approval of Minutes**: The minutes from the previous meeting were approved without changes.  
3. **Glossary of Gambling Terms**: A glossary was presented to clarify key terms like "handle" and "hold," essential for understanding gaming revenue.  
4. **Revenue Distribution**: Charts showed that for September, operators received 75% of commissions, charities received $945,000, and the state Lottery received $1.7 million (used for oversight and education funding).  
5. **HHR vs. Slots**: HHR machines are **pari-mutuel** (betting into a pool) and incur ongoing technology fees, unlike traditional slot machines.  
6. **Rent and Fair Market Value**: Concerns were raised about inconsistent or high rental fees charged to charities, with the Lottery Commission confirming that written agreements are mandatory and reviewed for compliance.  
7. **Labor and Operating Costs**: Operators spend approximately 2.1% of revenue on labor and 1.4% on rent, taxes, and utilities, leaving a small profit margin.  
8. **Charity Allocations**: Charts illustrated charity allocations from games of chance and HHR, with the commission emphasizing the need for fair distribution.  
9. **Takeout Rates**: The **takeout rate** (commission from wagers) for HHR averages around 9%, below the statutory maximum of 12%.  
10. **Future Discussions**: The commission plans to explore the fairness of current revenue distribution and rent structures, particularly as HHR gains popularity. They also discussed the potential for shared pools across facilities and the impact on game of chance revenues.
