### Comprehensive Summary: Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws (November 6, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting of the **Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws**, focusing on the impact of newly authorized **Historical Horse Racing (HHR)** machines and broader issues related to charitable gaming. The meeting addressed key topics, including revenue distribution, operational costs, fairness to stakeholders, and the need for updated regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

#### **Key Discussions and Findings**

1. **Revenue Distribution and Charitable Impact**  
   - **Historical Horse Racing (HHR) Revenue**: HHR revenue is accelerating, with operators retaining 75%, charities receiving 9.45%, and the state allocating 1.7 million (as of September 2023) for oversight and education funding.  
   - **Tiered System for Charities**:  
     - **Tier 1 (Legacy Charities)**: Active before 2020, these charities receive all revenue from games of chance and half from HHR.  
     - **Tier 2 (New Charities)**: Only receive revenue from HHR.  
   - **Revenue Splits**: Operators are pairing charities of similar tiers for a 50/50 revenue split, though concerns were raised about smaller charities needing additional protection to remain viable.  

2. **Operational Costs and Fees**  
   - **Labor and Operating Costs**: Operators allocate 2.1% of revenue to labor, 2% to marketing, and 1.4% to rent, utilities, and other expenses.  
   - **Third-Party Vendor Fees**: Operators pay 12% to 20% of revenue to third-party vendors for HHR technology and historical race data, depending on leasing or purchasing arrangements.  
   - **Class III Machines vs. HHR**: Unlike HHR, Class III slot machines incur no ongoing fees for historical data or technology, making them less costly for operators.  

3. **Rent and Fair Market Value**  
   - **Rent Requirements**: Charities renting facilities must receive at least 35% of gross revenues from games of chance, minus prizes and rent. Rent must be a fixed payment (not a percentage of revenue) and reflect fair market value, comparable to event space rentals (e.g., weddings, parties).  
   - **Inconsistent Practices**: Data showed wide variability in rent percentages (5% to 50%), with smaller facilities often charging higher percentages. Some charities reported significant rent increases without negotiation.  
   - **Impact of HHR**: Facilities with HHR machines often host two charities, splitting rent and revenue. This has raised questions about fairness and the potential need to eliminate rent, given HHR’s profitability.  

4. **Table Games vs. HHR**  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential decline of table games, which are more labor-intensive but benefit charities more (35 cents per dollar vs. 8 cents for HHR). Rules require a ratio of table games to machines to prevent this shift.  

5. **Shared Pools and Takeout Percentages**  
   - **Shared Pools**: The possibility of operators sharing wagering pools across facilities was discussed, though no operators have pursued this option. The state’s 10% takeout is calculated before any pool distribution, ensuring no impact on state or charity revenue.  
   - **Takeout Percentage**: HHR machines have a takeout percentage (commission) capped at 12%, though most operators set it around 9%. The Lottery Commission monitors daily reports to ensure compliance.  

6. **Community Funding and Advertising**  
   - **Community Funding**: The commission explored whether communities hosting gaming facilities should receive a share of revenue to offset additional costs, such as increased police presence. Comparisons were made to past casino bills that allocated percentages of revenue to host and surrounding communities.  
   - **Charity Advertising**: Concerns were raised about the lack of visibility for charities sponsoring gaming events. Members suggested requiring more prominent advertising to highlight charitable causes benefiting from gaming revenues.  

7. **Consultant Hiring and Membership**  
   - **Consultant Hiring**: A subcommittee was formed to define the scope of work for hiring a consultant to provide insights into gaming regulations, economic impacts, and best practices from other states.  
   - **NCLGS Membership**: The commission approved a $5,000 membership fee to join the National Council on Legislators with Gaming States (NCLGS), a resource for gaming-related information and data.

#### **Future Plans and Considerations**  
- The commission planned two more meetings before Christmas, tentatively on December 4th and 18th, with hybrid meeting options to accommodate members unable to attend in person.  
- Discussions highlighted the need to **update the statute** to address the impact of HHR, as the current law predates its introduction.  
- The commission emphasized the importance of ensuring fairness to all stakeholders—charities, operators, players, and the state—while balancing revenue distribution, operational costs, and community impacts.

#### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the complexities of charitable gaming laws in light of the introduction of HHR machines. Key issues included revenue splits, rent practices, operational costs, and the need for updated regulations to ensure fairness and transparency. The commission plans to continue its work, leveraging data analysis, expert insights, and stakeholder input to inform recommendations for improving charitable gaming laws in New Hampshire.
