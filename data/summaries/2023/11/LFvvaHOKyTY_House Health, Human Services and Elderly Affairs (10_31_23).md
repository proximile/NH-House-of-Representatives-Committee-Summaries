**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on House Bill 619 (HB 619) and Amendment 2359 (10/31/23):**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on October 31, 2023, to discuss **House Bill 619 (HB 619)** and its proposed **Amendment 2359**, which focus on **gender-affirming care**, particularly for minors. The public hearing featured extensive testimony from a diverse range of stakeholders, including medical professionals, advocacy groups, parents of transgender youth, legislators, and representatives from organizations such as the ACLU of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Medical Society, and Dartmouth Health. The discussion centered on the implications of the bill and amendment, with strong opposition to the proposed legislation dominating the testimonies. Here are the key points from the meeting:

### **1. Opposition to HB 619 and Amendment 2359**
- **Overwhelming Opposition**: The majority of speakers opposed the bill and amendment, arguing that they would **harm transgender youth** and their families by restricting access to **medically necessary** and **life-saving** gender-affirming care.  
- **Government Overreach**: Critics contended that the legislation constitutes **government overreach**, infringing on **parental rights** and the **physician-patient relationship**. They emphasized that medical decisions should remain between **patients, parents, and healthcare providers**, not legislators.  
- **Mental Health Concerns**: Testimonies highlighted the severe mental health consequences of restricting gender-affirming care, including increased **suicide rates** among transgender youth.

### **2. Medical and Parental Perspectives**
- **Medical Necessity**: Medical professionals emphasized that gender-affirming care is **well-researched**, **safe**, and **effective**, with low regret rates among transgender individuals. They stressed that such care is tailored to individual needs and involves extensive psychological and medical evaluations.  
- **Parental Testimonies**: Parents of transgender children shared personal stories about how gender-affirming care has been **crucial** for their children’s well-being and survival. They expressed frustration at the prospect of the state interfering in deeply personal medical decisions.  
- **Rarity of Surgeries for Minors**: Testimonies clarified that gender-affirming surgeries for minors are **exceedingly rare**, typically occurring only in cases of medical necessity and involving extensive consultations.

### **3. Criticisms of Misinformation and Misconceptions**
- **Debunking Myths**: Speakers debunked **misconceptions** about gender-affirming care, such as the false claim that minors routinely undergo irreversible surgeries at a young age. They emphasized that care for minors is primarily **non-surgical** and involves reversible interventions like puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  
- **Detransitioning Concerns**: While some speakers raised concerns about individuals who regretted their transitions, others countered that regret rates for gender-affirming care are **extremely low** compared to other medical procedures.

### **4. Conversion Therapy and Ethical Concerns**
- **Conversion Therapy Ban**: The discussion touched on New Hampshire’s 2018 ban on conversion therapy, a widely discredited and harmful practice. Opponents of the amendment argued that conflating conversion therapy with gender-affirming care is **misleading** and **dangerous**.

- **Discrimination and Autonomy**: The bill and amendment were criticized for **discriminating against transgender individuals** and undermining their rights to **medical autonomy**.

- **Insurance Coverage**: Concerns were raised about the amendment’s provision to prohibit insurers from covering gender-affirming care, which was seen as **discriminatory** and **unlawful**.

- **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**: Multiple speakers urged the committee to vote **inexpedient to legislate** on HB 619 and the amendment, arguing that such decisions should be based on **medical evidence** and **individual circumstances**, not political or ideological biases.  
- **Medical Community’s Opposition**: The New Hampshire Medical Society, Dartmouth Health, and other medical organizations opposed the bill and amendment, stating that they **infringe on the provider-patient relationship**, **promote discrimination**, and **contradict principles of health equity**.

### **7. Prime Sponsor’s Perspective**
- **Representative Erica Leon**: The prime sponsor of the amendment argued for a cautious approach to medical interventions for minors, citing concerns about the **lack of long-term data** on outcomes. However, her perspective was met with significant pushback from medical professionals and advocates who emphasized the **well-established benefits** of gender-affirming care.
