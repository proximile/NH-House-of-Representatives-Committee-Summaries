**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (November 9, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on November 9, 2023, to address a range of legislative issues, with a primary focus on **tax policy, corporate taxation, education funding, and charitable gaming regulations**. The discussions highlighted the complexities of these topics, emphasizing fairness, economic impact, and the need for careful legislative consideration.

### **Tax Policy and Corporate Taxation**
1. **"Waters Edge" Method Debate**:
   - **Representative Shamburg** argued against the "Waters Edge" tax method, asserting it creates a competitive disadvantage for domestic businesses by allowing foreign multinationals to avoid state taxes. He referenced historical tax practices, the 1999 Caterpillar Supreme Court decision, and the need for fairness in taxation.
   - **Representative Spilsbury** countered, stating the method is not unconstitutional and that broadening the tax base through worldwide combined reporting does not necessarily increase tax revenue. He emphasized the complexity of tax systems and the need for careful consideration.

2. **Worldwide Combined Reporting**:
   - The **Commission on Worldwide Combined Reporting**, established in 2022, recommended against implementing this method for New Hampshire. The commission found no significant benefits and highlighted potential complexities and disadvantages.
   - The commission noted that New Hampshire aligns its tax system with the federal Internal Revenue Code, simplifying tax compliance and leveraging federal audits. Historical context was provided, showing that New Hampshire and other states experimented with worldwide combined reporting in the 1980s but repealed it due to discriminatory impacts on U.S. multinationals.
   - The commission voted 6-1 against implementing worldwide combined reporting, citing lack of benefits and potential unpredictability in tax revenue.

3. **Interim Study Motion**:
   - **Representative Ames** moved for an interim study on **HB 569**, which addresses the Statewide Education Property Tax. The motion passed unanimously, with the decision to wait for a pending constitutional case before proceeding further.

4. **ITL Motions**:
   - The committee voted on "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) motions for several bills, including **HB 1221** and **HB 192**, with mixed results. **HB 192**, which aimed to modify the interest and dividends tax, was unanimously ITL’d due to the repeal of RSA 77 in HB2.

### **Education Funding**
- The committee reviewed **HB 569**, which proposes changes to the Statewide Education Property Tax. The bill aims to centralize the collection and distribution of education funds, moving them from local retention to state administration.
- The context of ongoing litigation challenging the current system was noted, with the recommendation to support an interim study to monitor developments and potentially propose legislation in the future.

### **Charitable Gaming Regulations**
1. **SB12-FN Amendment 2358H**:
   - **Amendment Overview**: The amendment proposes a **moratorium on expanded Historic Horse Racing (HHR)** machines and eliminates the requirement for charities to pay rent to participate in charitable gaming.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Rent Elimination**: Charities will no longer be charged rent, a practice deemed outdated and burdensome.
     - **HHR Moratorium**: A permanent moratorium on new HHR machines is proposed to prevent unchecked expansion, particularly in towns like Salem, where concerns about turning into "Atlantic City" were raised.
     - **Licensing Process**: The amendment allows current applicants to proceed but restricts new HHR licenses, potentially capping the number of gaming establishments at 19.
     - **Public Input**: There is no public input process for gaming licenses, though local zoning and permitting processes provide some community oversight.

2. **Confidentiality of Gaming Applicants**:
   - The Lottery Commission maintains confidentiality of gaming license applicants until licenses are issued, citing concerns about suitability reviews and privacy.

3. **Local Control**:
   - Towns have limited control over gaming establishments, primarily through zoning and permitting, but cannot outright ban gaming.

### **Amendments and Voting**
- **Amendments to SB 112** were discussed and voted on, with a focus on clarifying language related to charitable organizations and rent agreements. The amendment passed with a vote of 18-1.
- The committee also voted on **SB 112** as amended, which passed with the same vote count.
- A motion was made to deem **HB 1221** inexpedient to legislate, with a second from another representative.

### **Closing Remarks**
- The meeting concluded with thanks to **Acting Chair Representative Janigian** for her leadership. The committee’s work for the year ended, with plans to reconvene in January 2024.

### **Overall Themes**
The discussions underscored the **complexity of tax policy**, the **balance between fairness and revenue generation**, and the **importance of legal and constitutional considerations** in legislative decisions. The committee emphasized the need for ongoing study and monitoring of these issues to make informed decisions in the future. The charitable gaming amendment aims to curb HHR expansion while supporting charities, while the tax reporting recommendation seeks to maintain simplicity and alignment with federal tax practices.
