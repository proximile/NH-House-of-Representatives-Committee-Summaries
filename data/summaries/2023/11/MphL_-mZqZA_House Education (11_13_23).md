### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (November 13, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on November 13, 2023, to discuss and vote on a wide range of education-related bills. The meeting highlighted key debates on student safety, funding, accountability, and the balance between state mandates and local control. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Background Checks and Student Safety**:
   - **HB 628**: This bill requires non-public schools and education service providers receiving public funds to perform background checks on employees and volunteers. The committee debated its practicality and impact on homeschooling families, ultimately resulting in a "no recommendation" outcome, sending it to the House floor without a clear endorsement.
   - **HB 267**: Addressed criminal background checks for school employees. An amendment was proposed to allow superintendents to negotiate recurring background checks with unions, though some questioned its necessity.

2. **Charter School Funding and Accountability**:
   - **HB 354**: Focused on providing state building aid to charter schools. Concerns were raised about accountability, especially if a charter school dissolves while receiving aid over 20 years. The bill was sent to the floor with split recommendations: **Ought to Pass (OTP)** and **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**.
   - **SB 25**: Repealed a requirement for charter school payment reports, deemed duplicative of existing legislation, and was voted ITL.

3. **Homeschooling and Average Daily Membership**:
   - **HB 625**: Addressed average daily membership calculations for home-educated students and was passed with minimal discussion.
   - **HB 637**: Clarified reimbursement for middle schools offering courses to homeschooled students, extending the existing reimbursement structure for high schools.

4. **Mental Health and Special Education**:
   - **HB 352**: Dealt with mental health-related excused absences but was deemed unnecessary as existing law already allows for such absences. It was voted ITL.
   - **HB 505**: Focused on comprehensive mental health education in schools. An amendment was proposed to remove the word "comprehensive" to provide flexibility, with debates on whether mental health education should be mandated or left to local districts.
   - **HB 577**: Addressed state aid for special education pupils, particularly the financial burden on small towns due to high costs of residential placements. A motion for an interim study was proposed to further examine the issue.

5. **Transportation and Safety**:
   - **HB 651**: Allowed schools to use transportation networks for student transportation. An amendment was proposed to clarify background check requirements for drivers, but concerns about its germaneness led to a pause in discussion. The bill ultimately failed with a 9-11 vote.

6. **Reading and Literacy**:
   - **HB 437**: Aimed to implement evidence-based reading instruction (the "science of reading") to improve literacy rates. Supporters highlighted research showing 95% of students can learn to read with proper instruction, while opponents raised concerns about government overreach and local control. The bill was rejected (10-11), and a motion for an interim study passed (12-8).

7. **Higher Education and Professional Development**:
   - **HB 155**: An amendment proposed changes to the Higher Education Commission’s membership, including adding the chancellor of the university system and the commissioner of education or their designees.
   - **HB 218**: Proposed grants for professional development but faced criticism due to lack of funding and unclear justification, leading to its rejection.

8. **School Tuition and Religious Schools**:
   - **HB 439**: Sought to repeal a statute limiting school boards from contracting with non-sectarian private schools. Supporters argued the statute is outdated and unconstitutional, while opponents emphasized local control.

9. **Salary Transparency**:
   - **HB 553**: An amendment required school boards to publish a complete list of positions and salaries to increase transparency. The amendment passed with a 10-8 vote, though some questioned its necessity given existing public availability of salary information.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Student Safety**: Discussions on background checks (HB 628, HB 267) and transportation (HB 651) emphasized the importance of student safety but highlighted concerns about redundancy, practicality, and the balance between safety and parental rights.
- **Funding and Accountability**: Debates on charter school funding (HB 354, SB 25), special education aid (HB 577), and building aid reflected concerns about accountability, taxpayer funds, and fairness in resource allocation.
- **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Many discussions, particularly on mental health education (HB 505), reading instruction (HB 437), and school tuition (HB 439), centered on the tension between local control and state mandates.
- **Interim Studies**: Several bills, including HB 577 (special education funding) and HB 437 (reading instruction), were recommended for interim study to allow for further review and data collection.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Amendments to bills like HB 553 (salary transparency) and HB 354 (charter school building aid) aimed to increase transparency and ensure accountability in the use of public funds.

#### **Final Remarks**

The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the challenging nature of the discussions and the work of committee members in addressing complex educational issues. The committee emphasized the need for careful consideration, collaboration, and further study to address the diverse needs of students and schools effectively. The bills and amendments discussed will proceed to the House floor with varying levels of support, reflecting the committee’s ongoing efforts to balance safety, funding, and local control in education policy.
