**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (November 8, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on November 8, 2023, to discuss and vote on several bills, with a primary focus on retirement plan reforms, licensing requirements, and other administrative matters. The meeting highlighted the committee's efforts to balance public safety, economic freedom, and the welfare of state employees. Here’s a detailed overview of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Retirement Plan Reforms: House Bill 559**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill 559**, which proposed transitioning state employees from a defined benefit retirement plan to a defined contribution plan. Key points included:

1. **Amendment to Increase Employer Contribution**: An amendment was introduced to raise the employer contribution from 2.5% to 5% of employees' earnable compensation. While many supported this as a more reasonable starting point, some argued it was still insufficient compared to private sector standards.

2. **Arguments for the Bill**: Supporters emphasized that many state employees do not meet the 10-year vesting period required under the current defined benefit plan, leaving them with no retirement benefits. A defined contribution plan would allow employees to accrue benefits immediately, even if they leave state employment earlier.

3. **Concerns About the Bill**: Opponents raised issues about shifting investment risk to employees, potential erosion of trust in state employment, and the impact on the current pension system. Some argued that the proposed 5% employer contribution was too low.

4. **Voting Outcomes**:
   - The amendment to increase the employer contribution to 5% passed with a vote of 14-6.
   - The overall bill, however, failed to pass with a vote of 10-8 and will proceed without recommendation. A minority report recommending the bill be deemed "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) was also filed.

5. **Additional Discussions**: The committee briefly touched on other topics, such as threading (a hair removal technique), booth rentals, and the state's unfunded pension liabilities.

### **Other Bills Discussed and Voted On**
The committee also addressed several other bills, with a focus on streamlining legislation and addressing redundancy:

1. **House Bill 105**: Representative Groda moved to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill due to a lack of consensus over the summer. The motion passed with 18 in favor and no opposition.

2. **House Bill 183**: Representative Simon moved to ITL the bill, which aimed to allow retired firefighters to work at the fire academy. The motion passed unanimously, as the issue was deemed to affect very few people.

3. **House Bill 274**: Representative Simon moved to pass the bill with an amendment that removed certain sections already addressed in House Bill 357. The amendment and the bill passed unanimously.

4. **House Bill 428**: Representative Blackis moved to ITL the bill, as its contents were already included in Senate Bill 207, which had become law. The motion passed unanimously.

5. **House Bill 449**: Representative Simon moved to ITL the bill, as it was no longer necessary due to ongoing work on House Bill 436 by the retirement commission. The motion passed unanimously.

6. **House Bill 518**: Representative Groda moved to pass the bill with an amendment addressing licensing and disciplinary responsibilities. The amendment and the bill passed unanimously.

7. **Senate Bill 106**: Representative Broer moved to pass the bill, which established professional certification for child care programs. The motion passed unanimously, despite concerns about HHS’s inaction on the issue.

8. **House Bill 644**: Representative Lais moved to pass the bill with an amendment removing redundant sections already addressed in House Bill 409. The amendment and the bill passed with 19 in favor and no opposition. The bill aimed to remove licensing requirements for certain cosmetology services like blow drying and makeup application, sparking debate about public safety versus economic freedom.
