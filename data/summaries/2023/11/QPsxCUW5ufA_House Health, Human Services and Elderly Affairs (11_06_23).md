**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (November 6, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on November 6, 2023, to address scheduling, procedural matters, and several bills. Key discussions and outcomes included:

### Scheduling and Procedural Matters
1. **Subcommittee Meetings**: The subcommittees for **House Bills 580** and **378** were scheduled to meet at **10:00 a.m.** on the following Monday, with the executive session beginning at **10:30 a.m.**  
2. **Senate Bill 236**: Representative Murray raised concerns about the submission date for **SB 236**, listed as November 1, 2023. The committee discussed a potential floor amendment to adjust the date, possibly by a year. Representative Murray moved to reconsider the vote on SB 236, which was seconded and passed unanimously (**20-0**). Representative Shapiro volunteered to handle the amendment, with Representative McDonald offering to co-sponsor.  
3. **Additional Business**: Representative Leon requested a separate meeting with the **619 subcommittee** to finalize their schedule.  
4. **Closing**: The chair thanked attendees and adjourned the meeting, with the next session scheduled for the following Monday.

### Bill Discussions and Outcomes
1. **House Bill 587**: The bill proposed a "New Hampshire first" designation on the donor registry for anatomical gifts. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with federal and state laws, including RSA 291a (Uniform Anatomical Gift Act). Legal counsel noted that the bill could be preempted by federal law and disrupt organ allocation efficiency. The committee voted unanimously to recommend **ITL** (Inexpedient to Legislate).  

2. **House Bill 322**: This bill aimed to establish a committee to study the New Hampshire Board of Medicine. The subcommittee recommended passing the bill with an amendment, which adjusted the committee's composition and included the New Hampshire Nurse Practitioner Association as an invited stakeholder. The committee voted **20-0** to pass the amended bill.  

3. **House Bill 329**: The bill sought to establish an ALS registry in New Hampshire. However, logistical and financial challenges, particularly with the Department of Health and Human Services, made it unfeasible at this time. The committee voted unanimously to **ITL** the bill.  

4. **House Bill 554**: This bill focused on improving access to alternative therapies for chronic pain management. The committee recommended an **interim study** to further explore the issue, as related legislation (HB 66) was already in progress.  

5. **House Bill 566**: The bill aimed to address funding for certain services, but it was determined that existing funds in the state budget and external resources were sufficient. The committee voted unanimously to **ITL** the bill.  

6. **House Bill 580**: The committee decided to continue discussions on this bill, which aimed to establish a children's vision screening initiative within the Medicaid program, at the next executive session on November 13.  

7. **Senate Bill 236**: This bill proposed a study committee to examine nonprofit organizations contracting with the Department of Health and Human Services for children's services. The committee voted unanimously to **pass** the bill, citing the importance of addressing insurance cost issues affecting vulnerable children.  

### Next Steps
The next executive session was scheduled for **November 13 at 10:30 a.m.**, with subcommittees meeting beforehand. Committee members were reminded to submit their reports promptly.  

The meeting concluded with a focus on advancing key legislative priorities while addressing procedural and logistical challenges.
