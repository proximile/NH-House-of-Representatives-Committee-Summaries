The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on November 6, 2023, to discuss and deliberate on several bills. Key discussions, decisions, and outcomes from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed and Actions Taken**

1. **House Bill 587 (Relative to New Hampshire First Designation on the Donor Registry for Anatomical Gifts)**:
   - The bill proposed a "New Hampshire First" designation on the donor registry for anatomical gifts. However, legal counsel raised concerns about potential conflicts with federal and state laws, including possible federal preemption. The subcommittee recommended **indefinitely postponing (ITL)** the bill due to these legal issues. The committee unanimously voted to ITL the bill.

2. **House Bill 322 (Establishing a Committee to Study the New Hampshire Board of Medicine)**:
   - This bill aimed to address transparency and reporting issues within the Board of Medicine, particularly regarding malpractice complaints. An amendment (2365H) was proposed to adjust the committee’s composition and extend the reporting deadline to November 1, 2024. The committee unanimously approved the amendment and passed the bill. Further discussion on the bill was scheduled for the next meeting on November 13, 2023.

3. **House Bill 329 (Establishing an ALS Registry in New Hampshire)**:
   - The bill sought to create an ALS registry in New Hampshire. However, logistical and financial challenges were identified, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) confirmed it could not support the registry. The committee unanimously voted to **ITL the bill**, with plans to explore alternative solutions outside of legislation.

4. **House Bill 406 (Access to Children’s Medical Records)**:
   - This bill addressed parents' access to their children’s medical records, particularly through online portals. It was revealed that technical limitations in current software restrict access for children over 12. While the issue is significant, the committee agreed that **legislation is not the appropriate solution** at this time and unanimously voted to ITL the bill.

5. **House Bill 554 (Interim Study on Opioid Crisis and Alternative Therapies)**:
   - The bill aimed to improve access to alternative therapies for pain management to address the opioid crisis. After extensive stakeholder discussions and revisions, the committee voted unanimously to recommend an **interim study** to further refine the bill and address unresolved issues. A committee has already been formed to address these matters, and continued stakeholder involvement, including insurers and healthcare providers, was emphasized.

6. **House Bill 580 (Children’s Vision Screening Initiative within the State Medicaid Program)**:
   - The committee postponed consideration of this bill until the next executive session on November 13, 2023. Subcommittee meetings were scheduled to further discuss the bill before the next session.

7. **Senate Bill 236 (Committee to Study Nonprofit Organizations Contracting for Children’s Services)**:
   - The committee unanimously passed this bill, which establishes a committee to study nonprofit organizations contracting for children’s services under the Department of Health and Human Services. The study committee will address issues such as rising insurance costs affecting service providers. A floor amendment was proposed to adjust the reporting deadline to November 1, 2024, to ensure compliance with procedural timelines.

8. **House Bill 566 (Funding Mechanisms for Specific Issues)**:
   - The committee unanimously voted to ITL this bill, as the issue it addresses is already being handled through other funding mechanisms.
