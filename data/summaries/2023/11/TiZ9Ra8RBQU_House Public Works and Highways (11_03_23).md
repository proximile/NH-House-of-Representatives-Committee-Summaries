The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee held an executive session on November 3, 2023, to discuss and vote on five bills. Here’s a summary of the proceedings:

1. **House Bill 199 (Rail Appropriation)**: The committee voted unanimously (18-0) to **ITL** (Inexpedient to Legislate) this bill, which was a placeholder for funding freight rail improvement projects. It was deemed unnecessary as the funding is expected to be included in the capital budget.

2. **House Bill 361 (Peace Development Authority Board and Food)**: The committee also voted unanimously (18-0) to **ITL** this bill due to concerns with its wording. A similar bill will be considered next year.

3. **House Bill 456 (Road Tolls on Electric Vehicle Chargers)**: The committee unanimously (18-0) voted to **ITL** this bill, which aimed to collect road tolls on separately metered electric vehicle chargers.

4. **House Bill 606 (EV Charging Infrastructure in State Buildings)**: The committee voted unanimously (18-0) to send this bill to **interim study**. Members acknowledged the bill’s good intentions but felt it needed further refinement and coordination with other studies.

5. **House Bill 110 (Prohibiting State Funds for New Passenger Rail Projects)**: The committee voted unanimously (18-0) to send this bill to **interim study**, recognizing it as a contentious issue. Further debate is expected next year, possibly as part of the 10-year transportation plan.

All bills were placed on the consent calendar for the full House to consider. The session concluded with a motion to adjourn, which passed unanimously.
