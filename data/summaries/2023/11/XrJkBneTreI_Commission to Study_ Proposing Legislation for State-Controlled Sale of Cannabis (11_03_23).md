**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study State-Controlled Sale of Cannabis (11/03/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss and propose legislation for the state-controlled sale of cannabis and cannabis products. The meeting highlighted the complexity of crafting a regulatory framework, balancing public health, safety, enforcement, and economic considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions across all segments:

---

### **1. Public Use and Penalties**
The commission debated penalties for public cannabis consumption, with two main approaches emerging:
- **Graduated Fine System**: Some members advocated for escalating fines (e.g., $100 for the first offense, up to $500 for subsequent offenses).
- **Criminal Penalties**: Others pushed for criminalization, such as a Class B misdemeanor for repeat offenses. Concerns were raised about the collateral harms of criminal records, leading to a lack of consensus.

---

### **2. Distribution and Sales Model**
- **Licensed Distributors**: The New Hampshire Coalition for Responsible Cannabis Legislation proposed a distribution model akin to the alcohol industry, with licensed distributors ensuring safety, product tracking, and security.
- **Franchise Operations**: Rules for cannabis retail franchises, including handling, transportation, and distribution, were discussed, with emphasis on effective regulation.

---

### **3. Driving Under the Influence (DUI)**
- **THC Limits**: The commission considered establishing a prima facie THC limit for impaired driving, similar to alcohol’s 0.08 threshold. However, the lack of scientific consensus on THC impairment levels complicated the discussion.
- **Roadside Sobriety Tests**: Some members suggested relying on sobriety tests rather than specific THC thresholds.
- **Hands-Free Use**: Concerns were raised about drivers using vaporizers while operating vehicles, prompting proposals to include hands-free use language in the legislation.
- **Enforcement Challenges**: Law enforcement representatives highlighted difficulties in prosecuting cannabis-impaired driving due to unclear legal standards and scientific evidence.

---

### **4. Regulatory Structure**
- **Cannabis Control Commission**: The commission debated whether to establish an independent Cannabis Control Commission to oversee rules and regulations. While some members argued it was necessary for public health and independent oversight, others expressed concerns about adding an extra layer of government.
- **Liquor Commission vs. DHHS**: The Liquor Commission was proposed as the primary regulator for recreational sales, while the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was seen as essential for overseeing therapeutic cannabis.

---

### **5. Potency Limits**
- **Public Health Concerns**: The commission debated THC potency limits, with some members advocating for a 5-milligram limit per serving to align with public health recommendations and reduce risks like accidental ingestion by children.
- **Economic Competitiveness**: Others pushed for a 10-milligram limit to remain competitive with neighboring states like Maine. The commission ultimately favored the 5-milligram limit, with potential adjustments based on future research.

---

### **6. Therapeutic vs. Recreational Cannabis**
- **Integration of Programs**: Significant discussion centered on how to integrate New Hampshire’s existing therapeutic cannabis program with the proposed recreational market. Some members suggested allowing therapeutic products to be sold in recreational stores, while others preferred keeping the programs separate.
- **Patient Education**: The need for clear educational materials for patients was emphasized, particularly regarding potency differences between therapeutic and recreational products.

---

### **7. Timeline for Implementation**
- **Extended Timeline**: The commission debated extending the implementation period from 24 to 30 months to ensure adequate product availability and infrastructure development.

---

### **8. Investigator Roles**
- **Combined vs. Separate Roles**: The commission discussed whether cannabis and liquor investigators should be separate or combined, ultimately leaning toward consistency with existing liquor investigator roles.

---

### **9. Home Cultivation**
- **Personal Liberty vs. Legislative Hurdles**: The issue of home grow was raised, with some members arguing it is a personal liberty and a way to reduce the illicit market. However, others noted that including home grow in the bill could jeopardize its passage.

---

### **10. Advertising and Signage**
- **Restrictions on Advertising**: The commission discussed limiting advertising, particularly billboard signage, to avoid over-commercialization. Concerns were raised about out-of-state businesses advertising in New Hampshire if in-state advertising is banned.

---

### **11. Seed Production and Regulation**
- **Seed Labeling and Certification**: The need for regulations around cannabis seed production was highlighted, with Minnesota’s model cited as an example.

---

### **12. Unresolved Issues**
Several key issues remained unresolved and were earmarked for further discussion:
- **Possession Limits**: Balancing consumer needs with public safety concerns.
- **Public Use**: No consensus was reached, leaving it as a violation for now.
- **Nanogram Measurements**: Awaiting further data to determine appropriate thresholds for impairment.
- **Dual Licensing**: Whether to allow separate or dual licenses for cannabis retailers and the potential issues this creates.
- **Zoning Regulations**: Issues such as the 200-foot rule were briefly mentioned but not fully discussed.

---

### **13. Next Steps**
The commission acknowledged the need for further debate, public hearings, and detailed proposals to finalize the legislation. The next meeting was scheduled for November 16th, with an emphasis on addressing unresolved issues and preparing a working draft.

---

### **Key Themes**
- **Public Health Prioritization**: The commission consistently emphasized prioritizing public health over profitability, particularly in limiting potency and reducing risks like accidental ingestion.
- **Enforcement Challenges**: Law enforcement representatives highlighted difficulties in prosecuting cannabis-related offenses due to unclear legal standards and scientific evidence.
- **Economic Competitiveness**: Concerns were raised about New Hampshire’s ability to compete with neighboring states if potency limits or other regulations are too restrictive.
- **Integration of Programs**: Significant discussion focused on how to integrate the existing therapeutic cannabis program with the proposed recreational market.

The meeting concluded with the recognition that crafting effective cannabis legislation requires balancing diverse interests and addressing complex regulatory, enforcement, and public health challenges.
