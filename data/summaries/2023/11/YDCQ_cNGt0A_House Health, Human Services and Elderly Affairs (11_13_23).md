### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs (11/13/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on November 13, 2023, focused on several key bills addressing health, human services, and elderly affairs. The discussions highlighted significant debates on issues such as sexual assault survivors' rights, gender marker changes on birth certificates, gender transition procedures for minors, and services for individuals with developmental disabilities. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes:

---

#### **House Bill 378: Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to provide sexual assault survivors with clear information about their rights, particularly regarding evidence collection kits and legal protections.
- **Amendment 2357 H**: This amendment requires the Department of Justice to create a summarized document outlining survivors' rights, making it more accessible for survivors, healthcare providers, and the public.
- **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about ensuring the amendment aligns with existing statutes and doesn’t exclude anyone. The Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence requested more time to review the amendment but supported its intent.
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed 6-0, and the bill, as amended, passed unanimously (20-0) in the full committee.

#### **House Bill 264: Birth Certificate Gender Marker Changes**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes simplifying the process for individuals to change the gender marker on their birth certificate, eliminating the need for a court order.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill aligns with current practices for adopted children and reduces unnecessary legal hurdles.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including Representative Lon, contended that birth certificates should remain a historical record of birth conditions and not be altered for current identity purposes.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 10-10 on a motion to "ought to pass," resulting in no recommendation. A second motion to "ought to pass" was made but not further discussed.

#### **House Bill 619: Gender Transition Procedures for Minors**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to prohibit genital gender reassignment surgeries for minors under 18, with exceptions for medical conditions like malformations, injuries, or diseases. It also addresses sex and gender policies in public schools and the definition of conversion therapy.
- **Amendment**: An amendment was proposed to narrow the bill’s scope to focus solely on surgeries, but it failed in a 10-10 tie vote.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that minors cannot provide fully informed consent for irreversible surgeries and emphasized the need to protect children from potential harm. They also cited a lack of long-term data on the safety and efficacy of these procedures.
- **Opposition**: Critics contended that the bill interferes with the physician-patient relationship, discriminates against transgender youth, and addresses a problem that does not exist in New Hampshire. They also emphasized the importance of informed consent and parental rights.
- **Outcome**: The motion to pass the bill narrowly failed along party lines, and it will proceed to the floor with no recommendation.

#### **House Bill 317: Bureau of Developmental Services Redesign**
- **Purpose**: The bill addressed the Bureau of Developmental Services' redesign program.
