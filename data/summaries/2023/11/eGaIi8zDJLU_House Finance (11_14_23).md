**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting on November 14, 2023**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on November 14, 2023, to deliberate on a wide range of bills, primarily focusing on education funding, Medicaid expansion, harm reduction programs, and various other legislative proposals. The committee efficiently reviewed and voted on numerous bills, with most decisions resulting in recommendations that the bills be deemed "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), meaning they should not move forward. Key discussions, decisions, and votes from the meeting are summarized below:

### Key Bills and Committee Actions:

1. **House Bill 601**: The committee narrowly voted 13-12 to recommend ITL for this bill, which aimed to change the distribution of state education funds. Concerns were raised about fairness and the need to address the issue within the normal budget process.

2. **House Bill 620**: The committee voted 13-12 to recommend ITL for this bill, which proposed establishing a Division of Early Learning in the Department of Education for a pre-kindergarten pilot program. Critics argued it duplicated existing programs like Head Start and lacked measurable benefits.

3. **House Bill 638**: The committee unanimously (25-0) recommended ITL for this bill, which concerned extraordinary needs grants to schools. The motion was uncontroversial, with no further discussion.

4. **House Bill 91**: The committee unanimously (25-0) recommended ITL for this bill, which aimed to create a data privacy and IT security governance board within the Department of Health and Human Services. The bill was already incorporated into the state budget.

5. **House Bill 282**: The committee unanimously (25-0) recommended ITL for this bill, which sought to waive a 5-year waiting period for Medicaid and CHIP coverage for certain children and pregnant women. The provision was already included in the state budget.

6. **House Bill 527**: The committee unanimously (25-0) recommended ITL for this bill, which aimed to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for certain assisted living facilities. The bill was also incorporated into the state budget.

7. **House Bill 565**: The committee unanimously (25-0) recommended ITL for this bill, which proposed expanding Medicaid to include postpartum healthcare services for a full year. This provision was already included in the state budget.

8. **House Bill 614**: The committee unanimously (25-0) recommended ITL for this bill, which sought funding for a phase three feasibility study on kidney cancer incidence in Merrimack, NH. The study was already funded in the state budget.

9. **Senate Bill 239**: The committee voted 13-12 to recommend an interim study for this bill, which aimed to codify harm reduction programs in New Hampshire. Concerns were raised about the definition of "harm reduction" and potential unintended consequences, such as safe injection sites.

10. **Senate Bill 263**: The committee voted 13-12 to recommend ITL for this bill, which proposed making Medicaid expansion permanent. Opponents argued that the program's costs were unclear and that the current 7-year extension in the state budget provided sufficient stability.

### Additional Bills and Discussions:

- **House Bills (HB)**: Several other House Bills, including HB 230, HB 276, HB 300, HB 311, HB 347, HB 436, HB 462, HB 571, and others, were discussed. Most were voted ITL, as their provisions were already included in the budget or were no longer needed.
  
- **Senate Bills (SB)**: SB 128 and SB 267 were also discussed and voted ITL, as they were not funded in the final budget.

- **Amendments**: Some bills, like HB 436, had amendments proposed. For example, an amendment to HB 436 aimed to repurpose the bill to address unfunded liabilities, but it passed with a divided vote (17-8).

- **Consent Calendar**: Many bills voted ITL were recommended for the consent calendar, streamlining their disposal without further debate.

### Debates and Discussions:

- **SB 267**: There was significant debate about the need for cumulative impact analysis in environmental decision-making. While the bill had strong policy support, it was voted ITL due to financial concerns about hiring additional staff post-budget.

- **HB 436**: Representative Maguire proposed an amendment to redirect funds to pay down unfunded liabilities, arguing it was financially prudent.

### Votes and Minority Reports:

- **Votes**: Votes were consistently 25-0 or near-unanimous for most bills, indicating broad agreement that the bills were unnecessary or already addressed in the budget.

- **Minority Reports**: On some bills, like HB 546, minority reports were noted, indicating dissenting opinions.

### Final Recommendations:

Bills were either marked ITL and placed on the consent calendar or, in cases with amendments or significant debate, moved to the regular calendar.

### Conclusion:

The meeting was highly procedural, focusing on disposing of bills that were redundant or already addressed in the budget. The Finance Committee efficiently moved through a large number of bills, with most decisions being unanimous. The meeting concluded with reminders about submitting reports and gratitude for the committee's efficiency.
