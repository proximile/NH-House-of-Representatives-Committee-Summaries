**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on State-Controlled Cannabis Sales (November 16, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting on November 16, 2023, to discuss the **Commission to Study State-Controlled Sales of Cannabis and Cannabis Products**. The goal of the commission is to propose legislation that establishes a state-controlled model for the sale of cannabis, balancing public safety, regulatory oversight, and social justice. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Discussion Areas**

1. **Municipal Control and Opt-In**  
   - Municipalities would have the authority to decide whether to allow cannabis sales within their jurisdictions, requiring an affirmative opt-in process.  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential impact on towns that choose not to participate, as well as the need for clear zoning restrictions and local control.  

2. **Regulatory Framework**  
   - The commission emphasized aligning cannabis regulations with existing laws, particularly those governing alcohol sales.  
   - A **seed-to-sale tracking system** was proposed to monitor cannabis products from cultivation to sale, ensuring accountability and preventing diversion to the black market.  
   - **Location restrictions** were discussed, including a proposed 2,000-foot buffer zone around schools, colleges, and universities, though some argued this could be overly restrictive in certain areas.  

3. **Public Health and Safety**  
   - **Warning labels and educational materials** would be required on cannabis products to inform consumers about risks, including impaired driving, effects on youth, and risks for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals.  
   - **Product recalls** and consumer notification processes were added to the draft legislation to address contaminated or unsafe products.  
   - The commission debated prohibiting **alcohol-infused cannabis products** to mitigate public health risks, while allowing non-alcoholic THC-infused beverages under strict regulation.  

4. **Impairment and Enforcement**  
   - Law enforcement officials highlighted challenges in detecting and prosecuting cannabis-impaired driving, emphasizing the need for additional training, resources, and updated testing methods (e.g., blood tests, drug recognition experts).  
   - The commission debated establishing a **legal standard for cannabis impairment**, with some referencing Colorado’s 5 nanograms of Delta-9 THC per milliliter of blood as a permissible inference. However, scientific consensus on THC levels and impairment remains unclear.  

5. **Revenue Allocation and Taxation**  
   - A **15% franchise fee** on gross monthly sales was proposed, with some advocating for a higher rate (e.g., 30%) to generate more revenue for public health, safety, and social justice initiatives.  
   - Funds would be allocated to **law enforcement training**, **public safety initiatives**, and **substance abuse prevention and recovery programs**.  
   - A **Justice Reinvestment Fund** was proposed to support communities disproportionately affected by past drug policies, addressing social justice issues and providing resources for those impacted by the war on drugs.  

6. **Black Market Concerns**  
   - The commission discussed tightening language to ensure only licensed, state-regulated cannabis products are legal, distinguishing them from black market products.  
   - Some representatives argued that maintaining competitive pricing in the legal market would naturally reduce black market activity, while others advocated for increased penalties for illegal sales.  

7. **Legal and Practical Challenges**  
   - The commission acknowledged the complexities of enforcing cannabis-related laws, particularly regarding impaired driving and the need for updated statutory language to support effective prosecution.  
   - **Non-discrimination provisions** for state-legal cannabis activities were discussed, with concerns raised about potential conflicts with federal law, especially for roles requiring federal certifications (e.g., CDL drivers, police officers).  

8. **Banking and Financial Issues**  
   - State Treasurer Monica Mapelli testified about the challenges of banking and revenue collection due to federal restrictions on cannabis.  
   - The state plans to collect franchise fees based on monthly sales, but federal guidance and banking agreements will need to be reviewed to navigate these challenges.  

9. **Therapeutic Cannabis Program Integration**  
   - The commission discussed integrating the existing therapeutic cannabis program with the proposed recreational model, including the potential for **dual licenses** for Alternate Treatment Centers (ATCs) to operate as retail stores.  
   - There was debate about moving the regulation of ATCs from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to the Liquor Commission to streamline oversight, though concerns were raised about the loss of funding for the therapeutic program.  

10. **Property Rights and Public Consumption**  
    - The legislation would allow private property owners, including landlords and businesses, to prohibit cannabis consumption or sales on their premises.  
    - The commission debated penalties for public cannabis consumption, with a majority favoring enhanced penalties for repeat offenses.

### **Next Steps**  
The commission aims to finalize its recommendations by the next meeting on November 27, 2023. The final report, due by December 1, will include both majority and minority opinions on contentious issues. The draft legislation will then be submitted to the policy committee for further review and debate.
