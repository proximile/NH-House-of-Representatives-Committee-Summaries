The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on November 9, 2023, began with the approval of minutes from October 19. The committee then addressed several items on the agenda, including budget transfers and funding requests for various state departments. Key discussions included:

1. **Health and Human Services (HHS)**: A $15 million transfer between class lines was approved without discussion.
2. **Office of the Governor**: A budget item was approved, though some details were unclear due to the absence of the budget manager.
3. **Fish and Game Department**: Multiple items were discussed, including funding for water tests at fish hatcheries and a $25,000 request for software updates. Executive Director Scott Mason explained delays due to company acquisitions and staffing changes, with a target completion date of September 2025. Committee members expressed concerns about the timeline and urged expedited progress.
4. **Youth Development Center (YDC)**: The committee discussed a request for additional funding (approximately $6.5 million) for the construction of a new YDC facility in Hampstead. Commissioner Lori Weaver explained that initial estimates were based on preliminary designs, and the final design required more space to meet safety and therapeutic standards. Concerns were raised about security, staffing, and the potential for juveniles with gang affiliations to abscond. The committee approved the request, though some members voted against it due to concerns about the late submission of the item.
5. **Treasury Department**: A request to release an audit report was approved without discussion.

The meeting also included updates on staffing challenges at Hampstead Hospital and discussions about integrating security systems between the hospital and the YDC. The committee set the next meeting for December 15, 2023, and adjourned for a recess until noon to discuss ongoing litigation related to abuse claims at the YDC.
