**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (11/08/23)**

On November 8, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened to discuss two significant bills: **House Bill 619** and **House Bill 368**, both addressing transgender healthcare, particularly for minors. The discussions highlighted a range of legal, medical, ethical, and practical considerations, reflecting the complexity of the issues at hand.

### **House Bill 619: Prohibiting Gender Reassignment Surgeries for Minors**
The committee focused on **House Bill 619**, which seeks to ban gender reassignment surgeries for individuals under the age of 18. Key points from the discussion included:

1. **Protection of Minors**: Representatives emphasized the need to safeguard vulnerable youth while balancing access to appropriate care for those with gender dysphoria. Concerns were raised about limiting treatment options for families and children.

2. **Medical vs. Legislative Authority**: Some members argued that medical decisions should remain within the purview of the medical community, cautioning that legislation might lag behind evolving medical practices and research.

3. **Evidence and Data**: The lack of long-term clinical data on the safety and efficacy of gender reassignment surgeries for minors was a significant concern. Representatives noted the limited scope of current studies and their insufficiency to support such procedures for adolescents.

4. **Discrimination Concerns**: The bill’s focus on the transgender community was criticized as potentially discriminatory, as other medical needs and communities were not addressed similarly.

5. **Therapy and Support**: The importance of therapy and support for minors with gender dysphoria was acknowledged, with clarification that the bill does not aim to outlaw therapy or hormone blockers.

6. **Process and Amendments**: The subcommittee refined the bill’s language based on feedback, removing certain elements to narrow its focus. A motion to recommend the amended version to the full committee passed with a 3-2 vote, with one absence.

The committee concluded by moving the amended bill forward for further consideration by the full committee.

### **House Bill 368: Transgender Healthcare Access and Protections**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 368**, which aims to allow families from other states to seek transgender healthcare for their children in New Hampshire, particularly when such care is restricted or unavailable in their home states. The bill also seeks to protect healthcare providers from being compelled to share medical information across state lines, potentially shielding families from prosecution.

Key points of discussion included:

1. **Legal and Constitutional Concerns**: Representatives debated the constitutionality of the bill, particularly regarding interstate legal jurisdiction and the enforcement of laws across state lines. Article 4, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution was cited, raising questions about whether New Hampshire could legally prevent other states from prosecuting families or healthcare providers for actions taken within its borders.

2. **Healthcare Access and Capacity**: Concerns were raised about New Hampshire’s capacity to provide transgender healthcare, given existing backlogs and shortages in the healthcare system. Challenges with Medicaid reimbursement for therapists were noted.

3. **Interstate Implications**: Practical challenges for families traveling to New Hampshire for regular care were discussed, given the frequency of therapy and medical appointments required. Questions were also raised about New Hampshire’s ability to compete with states that have larger, more established centers for transgender care.

4. **Dartmouth Hitchcock’s Role**: Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center was identified as a key provider of transgender healthcare in the state. However, representatives expressed frustration over the lack of detailed information from the institution regarding their policies and procedures for transgender care, particularly for minors.

5. **Conversion Therapy and Non-Binary Protections**: The discussion briefly touched on New Hampshire’s conversion therapy ban, with some representatives arguing that the current statute does not adequately protect non-binary individuals. However, there was consensus that this issue should be addressed separately.

6. **Amendment Proposals**: An amendment was proposed to narrow the bill’s focus to **genital gender reassignment surgeries for minors**, prohibiting such procedures in New Hampshire. The amendment emphasized informed consent, parental involvement, and the need for high-quality clinical evidence before such procedures could be approved.

7. **Legislative vs. Medical Authority**: Some representatives argued that the legislature should not overstep into medical decision-making, while others countered that the legislature has a duty to protect minors, especially in cases where long-term outcomes are uncertain or potentially harmful.

8. **Future Steps**: The committee considered creating an interim study to gather more information from Dartmouth Hitchcock and other stakeholders before making a final decision. A motion to recommend further study passed with three in favor and one opposed.

### **Conclusion**
Both discussions underscored the complexity of addressing transgender healthcare for minors, balancing ethical, legal, and medical considerations. The committee emphasized the need to protect vulnerable youth while ensuring that any legislation is constitutionally sound, evidence-based, and in the best interest of public health. The amended **House Bill 619** was moved forward for further consideration, while **House Bill 368** was recommended for additional study to gather more information before final decisions are made.
