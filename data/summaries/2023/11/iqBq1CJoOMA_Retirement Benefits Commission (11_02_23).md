The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on retirement benefits, specifically discussing amendments to the state's retirement system. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Approval of Minutes**: The commission began by approving the minutes from the previous meeting without any comments or corrections.

2. **Actuarial Analysis**: The commission reviewed an actuarial cost-benefit analysis related to retirement system amendments. The analysis highlighted changes to **Amendment 2259**, which would apply only to **Group Two Tier B members** who work to their full retirement age, reducing the pool of affected individuals and lowering the unfunded liability impact from $47 million to $43.9 million. Another proposal, from **Senator Gray**, suggested increasing the **multiplier for years worked past 20** to **2.5%** for all Group Two members, including Tier B and Tier C, which would increase employer contributions but was seen as more affordable and beneficial for retention.

3. **Cost Implications**: Discussions centered on the financial impact of these changes, with concerns about the state's surplus and the need to balance affordability with employee benefits. Senator Bradley emphasized the importance of fixing the system comprehensively to avoid recurring issues.

4. **COLA (Cost of Living Adjustments)**: There was debate over introducing a COLA benefit within the retirement system. Some members, including **Senator Gray**, advocated for a COLA to address inflation, while others, like **Representative Packard**, expressed caution about the financial burden on employers. A motion was proposed to allow employers and employees to negotiate COLA benefits, with enabling legislation for state employees, but it was deferred for further clarification and written proposal.

5. **Future Meetings**: The commission planned to meet again on **November 9th** to finalize recommendations before the December 1st deadline for their report. They also discussed the possibility of forming a subcommittee to negotiate COLA benefits further.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing retirement benefits with financial sustainability, with a focus on addressing inequities and improving retention through thoughtful amendments.
