The New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee meeting on November 6, 2023, focused on two key amendments: one to **House Bill 274** and another to **House Bill 518**. Here’s a summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 274 Amendment (Amendment 2293):**
- **Sponsor:** Representative Carol Maguire presented the amendment, which aims to strengthen legislative oversight in the administrative rulemaking process.
- **Key Changes:**
  1. Agencies must notify known stakeholders of rulemaking, especially when implementing new legislation, to ensure alignment with legislative intent.
  2. Agencies must solicit feedback from legislative policy committees during major rule rewrites or new legislation implementation.
  3. If a rule is challenged in court and found invalid, the agency must pay the plaintiff’s legal fees, discouraging controversial rule adoption.
- **Background:** The amendment addresses opposition from agencies during the spring hearing, particularly those in a "limbo" between state and federal compliance. It removes certain agencies from the bill to avoid jeopardizing federal funding.
- **Discussion:** Committee members discussed the workability of legislative involvement, given the part-time nature of the legislature, and the rarity of final objections to rules.

### **House Bill 518 Amendment (Amendment 2349):**
- **Sponsor:** Representative Groa presented the amendment, which clarifies licensing and reinstatement processes for pharmacists and pharmacies.
- **Key Provisions:**
  1. Licenses expire on their expiration date, and reinstatement is allowed within one year without backdating to avoid misrepresentation of unlicensed practice.
  2. Defines "good standing" for licensees and requires presiding officers to assist boards in non-disciplinary adjudicative proceedings.
  3. Allows the agency to act in rare cases where a board cannot meet quorum.
  4. Adds general charging language for professional misconduct across all professions.
- **Discussion:** Committee members debated grace periods for late renewals, fees for reinstatement, and the implications of practicing without a license. Concerns were raised about insurance coverage and penalties for operating without a license during the lapse period.

### **General Observations:**
- **Legislative Involvement:** Both amendments emphasize increasing legislative oversight in rulemaking and licensing processes.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Efforts were made to ensure stakeholders, including professional organizations and legislators, are informed and involved in rulemaking.
- **Workability Concerns:** Committee members questioned the practicality of legislative involvement during off-sessions and the potential for unintended consequences, such as penalties for late renewals.

The committee planned to vote on the amendments on Wednesday, with further language tweaks expected.
