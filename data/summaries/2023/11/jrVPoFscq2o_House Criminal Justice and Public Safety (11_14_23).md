The transcript is from a New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee meeting focused on finalizing changes to retained bail bills. Key points discussed include:

1. **Pledge of Allegiance and Opening Remarks**: The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by a brief recess to allow members time to review newly introduced bills.

2. **Bail Bill Modifications**:
   - **Domestic Violence and Stalking**: The committee agreed to specify that only felony versions of domestic violence and stalking charges would be included in the bail provisions. This decision was based on concerns about additional hearings and costs associated with misdemeanor charges.
   - **Probable Cause vs. Clear and Convincing Evidence**: There was debate over the evidentiary standard required to hold someone on bail for violent crimes. The committee decided to maintain the probable cause standard for initial appearances, as raising it to clear and convincing evidence within 24 hours of arrest was deemed impractical.

3. **Electronic Monitoring**: The committee added a provision requiring a warrant for law enforcement to access any electronic monitoring data beyond what is necessary to enforce bail conditions, addressing privacy concerns.

4. **Interbranch Criminal Justice Council**: A change was proposed to have a legislative member from the criminal justice committee chair the council, ensuring continuity and legislative oversight.

5. **Finalizing Changes**: The committee reviewed and agreed on all proposed changes, which will be presented to the full committee for a final vote the following day. Republican members planned to caucus at 9:00 a.m. before the full committee meeting.

The meeting concluded with members confirming their agreement on the changes, and the chair planned to finalize the amendments with the Office of Legislative Services.
