**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (11/08/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on November 8, 2023, to discuss a range of initiatives and updates aimed at improving the state’s criminal justice system. The meeting focused on several key areas, including pre-trial services, bail reform, victim advocacy, court technology upgrades, and harm reduction measures. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Statewide Pre-Trial Services**
The committee explored the creation of a **statewide pre-trial services program**, which would standardize and enhance pre-trial support across New Hampshire. This includes establishing a fund that counties can apply to for reimbursement if they meet specific criteria. The goal is to improve consistency and effectiveness in pre-trial interventions, reducing disparities across counties.

---

### **2. Top-Down Review of the Criminal Justice System**
A **comprehensive review** of the criminal justice system was proposed to address disconnects between branches and agencies. The review aims to improve coordination and efficiency, ensuring smoother operations across law enforcement, courts, and other related entities.

---

### **3. Victim’s Advocate Division**
The committee discussed the need for a **dedicated victim’s advocate division** in all courts. Currently, victim services are inconsistent, with advocates often serving as communication liaisons rather than providing direct support. The committee is considering creating a specific office within the Judiciary or county attorney’s offices to better serve victims and witnesses.

---

### **4. Bail Appeals Process**
The committee addressed the **bail appeals process**, proposing that county attorneys can appeal a circuit court judge’s bail decision in cases involving dangerousness. If an appeal is filed, the individual would be held for up to 48 hours pending a Superior Court hearing to review the decision.

---

### **5. Court Technology Upgrades**
Efforts are underway to **upgrade court technology**, including exploring the use of text notifications for court hearings. While the courts are eager to implement these improvements, the committee is cautious about mandating specific technological solutions.

---

### **6. House Bill 470: Fentanyl Test Strips and Drug-Checking Equipment**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 470**, which focuses on harm reduction by expanding the use of drug-checking equipment, including fentanyl and xylazine test strips. Key points include:
- **Amendment Details**: The bill clarifies the distinction between drug-checking equipment (used for harm reduction) and equipment used for manufacturing illegal drugs. It exempts drug-checking equipment from being classified as drug paraphernalia and ensures harm reduction organizations and individuals distributing test strips are not prosecuted.
- **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of harm reduction measures, but supporters emphasized the bill’s focus on saving lives and its specificity compared to broader decriminalization efforts in other states. The bill passed with the amendment by a vote of 4-1.

---

### **7. Bail Reform**
The committee discussed several proposed changes to **bail reform**, aimed at enhancing public safety and ensuring fair treatment of accused individuals. Key provisions include:
- **Felony Arrests While on Bail**: Individuals arrested for a felony while on bail will be held for a judge or magistrate within 24 hours.
- **Class A Misdemeanors**: Individuals with a history of two or more misdemeanor convictions will be held if arrested for a Class A misdemeanor while on bail.
- **Electronic Monitoring**: Mandatory for individuals with domestic violence restraining orders.
- **Victim Notification**: Victims must be notified at least one hour before a defendant’s release on bail.
- **Bail Commissioner Education**: Enhanced training requirements for bail commissioners and magistrates.
- **Bail Fees**: Increased by $50, with courts responsible for paying bail commissioners monthly and recouping costs from defendants if possible.
- **Resource Information**: Accused individuals will receive information on local services (e.g., homelessness, mental health, substance abuse) upon release.
- **Technology Upgrades**: $1.7 million allocated to improve communication between law enforcement and courts for real-time bail status updates.
- **No Cash Bail**: Reiterated that individuals cannot be held solely due to inability to pay bail.
- **Inter-Branch Commission**: Retasked to improve pre-trial interventions and address inconsistencies across counties.

### **8. Upcoming Meetings and Bills**
The committee outlined its schedule for the week, including subcommittee meetings to finalize recommendations on bail, a full committee vote on retained bills, and a public hearing for a non-germane amendment to a bail bill requested by a county attorney. Members were instructed to watch for updates via email over the weekend, with the committee set to reconvene on Tuesday to continue its work.
