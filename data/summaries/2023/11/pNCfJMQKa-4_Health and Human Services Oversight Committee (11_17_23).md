**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (November 17, 2023)**

The **New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee** convened on **November 17, 2023**, to discuss a wide range of topics related to health, human services, and veterans’ support. The meeting was structured around three main segments, each addressing key issues and updates.

### **Committee Role and Authority**
The meeting began with a discussion on the committee’s role and authority in overseeing the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Members debated whether the committee should adopt a broader or narrower scope of oversight, particularly in enforcing regulations. Concerns were raised about overstepping legal boundaries, prompting Representative McDonald to propose gathering input from committee members via a memorandum. The committee also discussed childcare licensing rules, with DHHS Chief Legal Officer Melissa Saier clarifying that while DHHS oversees the quality of childcare services, it does not regulate admissions practices. Discrimination claims are referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The committee agreed to consult House Counsel to clarify its legal authority and responsibilities, with plans to continue the discussion in December.

### **Veterans’ Health and Support Initiatives**
The committee reviewed several initiatives aimed at supporting veterans and their families. These included the **New Hampshire Veteran Family Business Network**, which connects veterans with employment opportunities, and the **"Ask the Question" campaign**, encouraging healthcare providers to inquire about military service to better address veterans’ healthcare needs. Efforts to address dental healthcare gaps for veterans, modeled after Maine’s approach, were also discussed. Additionally, the committee highlighted suicide prevention programs such as **ASIST** and **Connect Online**, noting a decrease in veteran suicide rates but emphasizing that rates remain higher than the national average.

### **Mental Health Admissions and Childcare Vaccination Exemptions**
The committee received a report on the use of restraints and transportation methods for **involuntary emergency admissions (IEA)** to psychiatric facilities. Data showed that 61% of adult transports were conducted by law enforcement, with 86% involving restraints, while ambulance transports rarely used restraints. The committee discussed trends and consistency in these practices over the past four years.

Representative Leah Kushman raised concerns about childcare agencies denying enrollment to children based on **religious exemptions for vaccinations**, arguing that such denials violate constitutional rights and state laws. The committee debated whether this issue fell within its oversight mandate, with some members suggesting it should be addressed through legislation or the courts rather than by the committee.

### **DHHS Updates and Construction Projects**
DHHS Commissioner **Lori Shibinette** provided updates on several topics:
- **Vacancy Rates**: The DHHS vacancy rate improved from 19.6% to 17.2%, with ongoing recruitment efforts.
- **Deputy Commissioner**: **Marissa Hen** was confirmed as Deputy Commissioner, filling a year-long vacancy.
- **Construction Projects**: A forensic hospital and renovations at New Hampshire Hospital are progressing on schedule, with expected completion in **summer 2025** and **January 2024**, respectively.
- **Nurse Recruitment**: Efforts to hire full-time nurses continue, though agency nurses still make up the majority at New Hampshire Hospital.

### **Board of Medicine Complaint Process**
Attorney **Douglas Hooper** presented a flowchart outlining the complaint process following **HB 655 and HB 409**. The process involves reviews by enforcement attorneys, with recommendations for dismissal or investigation made to the Board of Medicine. Investigations are confidential, and outcomes are communicated to complainants after board decisions. The process aims to resolve complaints within a year, with exceptions for complex or criminal cases.

### **Developmental Services Redesign**
**Chris Antonello**, representing **Melissa Hardy**, provided an update on **HB 608**, now in interim study. Key points included:
- Stakeholder engagement sessions to gather feedback on the developmental services system.
- Rate work has been paused, except for **HB2** rates, to focus on addressing cash flow issues for providers.

### **Veterans’ Access to Health Care and Mental Health Services**
**Wendy Alman** (DHHS) and **Heather Smith** (Department of Military Affairs and Veteran Services) presented highlights from **Senate Bill 174**, emphasizing collaboration between DHHS and veteran services to support veterans’ access to healthcare and mental health services. Initiatives include training on military culture, partnerships with VA hospitals, and support through **ServiceLink** and community mental health centers. A 2023 snapshot report on New Hampshire veterans was also provided, detailing demographics and programmatic support.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with opportunities for committee members to ask questions and discuss the updates provided. The next meeting was scheduled for **December 15, 2023**, at 1:00 PM, with a holiday-themed gathering planned. The committee also noted a going-away party for **Paula Lan** on December 15th. Overall, the meeting sought to define the committee’s role more clearly while ensuring it operates within legal and statutory limits, addressing a broad spectrum of health and human services issues.
