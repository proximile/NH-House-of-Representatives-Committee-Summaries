The New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Committee meeting on November 1, 2023, focused on the discussion and voting of two bills: **House Bill 301** and **House Bill 157**. Here's a summary of the key points:

### **House Bill 301: Recusal for Conflicts of Interest**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses recusal requirements for members of the General Court in cases of conflicts of interest.
- **Amendment**: Representative Sheen proposed an amendment (2023-2326h) to the bill, which was discussed extensively. The amendment aimed to refine the language and address concerns raised by the Ethics Committee.
- **Ethics Committee Concerns**: The Ethics Committee found the amendment too broad, difficult to enforce, and potentially excluding too many legislators from voting. They recommended narrowing the scope.
- **Discussion**: Committee members debated the amendment's language, particularly around terms like "special interest" and "fiduciary responsibility." There was also discussion about whether certain provisions were redundant given existing constitutional rules.
- **Vote**: The committee unanimously passed the Sheen amendment (13-0) and subsequently voted to pass HB 301 as amended (13-0). The bill will now move to the Senate for further consideration.

### **House Bill 157: Joint Committee on Legislative Facilities and Sexual Harassment Policies**
- **Purpose**: This bill deals with policies related to legislative facilities and sexual harassment.
- **Motion**: Representative Sheen moved for an interim study, citing the need for further work on the bill to align it with broader policies affecting House and Senate staff.
- **Vote**: The committee unanimously approved the motion for interim study (13-0).

### **Upcoming Business**
- **Senate Bill 84**: The committee discussed plans for next weekâ€™s meeting, where they will address SB 84, a retained bill. Multiple non-germane amendments are expected, and the committee aims to finalize the bill by the next meeting.

### **Closing Remarks**
- The chair thanked substitutes for their input and emphasized the committee's collaborative and respectful approach to discussions.
- The next meeting is scheduled for November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM, with the expectation of concluding quickly.

Overall, the meeting focused on refining legislation related to ethical standards and legislative policies, with a strong emphasis on consensus and thorough consideration of amendments.
