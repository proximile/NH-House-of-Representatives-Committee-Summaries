**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (11/09/23)**

On November 9, 2023, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened to address a range of issues impacting family law and the operations of the Family Division. The meeting included discussions on legislative priorities, updates from subcommittees, and planning for interim and final reports. Key topics and outcomes are summarized below:

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **Legislative Priorities and Family Law Issues**
1. **Child Support Bill**:  
   The committee reviewed a 2024 bill focused on child support, particularly addressing shared parenting time and income disparities between parents. Recognizing past challenges with similar legislation, members emphasized the need for consensus to ensure its successful passage.

2. **Domestic Violence (DV)**:  
   There was debate over whether to form a new subcommittee or working group to address domestic violence issues. While some members advocated for a dedicated group, others argued that existing committees (Criminal Justice, Children and Family Law, and Judiciary) could handle the matter. The committee leaned toward recommending a limited-time group to review domestic violence statutes and propose legislative changes.

3. **Parenting Coordination and Visitation**:  
   The role of parenting coordinators and the challenges of supervised visitation, especially in cases involving substance abuse or domestic violence, were discussed. The committee considered addressing these issues through ongoing work by the guardian ad litem (GAL) and parenting coordination subcommittees.

4. **Future Work Areas**:  
   The committee identified several areas for further exploration, including the "one judge, one family" principle, visitation challenges, and addiction-related issues. These topics will likely be addressed in the final report due in 2024.

#### **Interim Report and Meeting Logistics**
- The committee planned to submit an interim report summarizing their progress to the Speaker of the House. After debating whether to approve the report via email or in person, they decided to meet on November 16 to finalize and vote on the report.  
- Scheduling conflicts initially made it difficult to secure a quorum for a November 14 meeting, prompting the rescheduling to November 16.

#### **Subcommittee Updates**
1. **Forms Subcommittee**:  
   Efforts to streamline and simplify court forms across different court areas were reported. Challenges with online form accessibility were highlighted, and steps are being taken to improve the system, including seeking proposals for technological enhancements. Communication with judicial staff remains open, with further updates expected in the next six months.

2. **Judicial Training, Education, Supervision, and Accountability Subcommittee**:  
   This group emphasized the complexity of family court cases and the need for specialized judicial training in areas like child development, family dynamics, and dispute resolution. Concerns were raised about insufficient staffing and the need for more clerks to support judges. The subcommittee suggested increased monitoring and review of judges’ performance, particularly in cases where concerns about bias or improper rulings have been raised.

3. **Parenting Coordinator and GAL Subcommittee**:  
   The role of parenting coordinators and GALs in family court cases was discussed. Financial barriers for indigent parties were noted, with recommendations to address funding in future budgets. Further work on the GAL component is needed, and the subcommittee plans to reconvene to finalize recommendations.

4. **Rules of Evidence Subcommittee**:  
   This subcommittee reviewed concerns about judges’ discretion in admitting or excluding evidence in family court cases. An amendment was proposed requiring judges to document their reasoning for evidentiary rulings, aiming to increase transparency and accountability. The amendment passed the Children and Family Law Committee unanimously and is seen as a way to address perceived biases while maintaining judicial discretion.

### **Overall Committee Discussion and Next Steps**
- The committee discussed the need for an interim report summarizing the work of the subcommittees.  
- There was consensus to continue work on some issues, such as GALs and judicial training, while other subcommittees, like the Rules of Evidence group, felt their work was largely complete.  
- The committee plans to reconvene in the new year to finalize recommendations and prepare a detailed report for the next legislative session.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to improving the Family Division’s efficiency, transparency, and fairness. Key focus areas included addressing child support, domestic violence, parenting coordination, and judicial accountability. The committee emphasized ongoing collaboration with the judiciary and other stakeholders to ensure meaningful progress and legislative success.
