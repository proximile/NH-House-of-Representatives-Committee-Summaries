**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Children and Family Law Committee Meeting (October 31, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Children and Family Law Committee convened on October 31, 2023, to discuss and vote on several bills and amendments related to children and family law. The meeting focused on issues such as parental access to medical records, child custody arrangements, reunification therapy, child support payment options, and family court procedures. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Parental Access to Medical Records**
- **Senate Bill 253**: The committee addressed challenges related to parents accessing their minor child’s medical records, particularly for children aged 12 and older. The issue was identified as a technological limitation rather than a legislative one. The bill passed unanimously with a vote of 16-0, with no amendments.

### **2. Child Custody and Parenting Time**
- **House Bill 185**: The committee debated two amendments related to custody arrangements:
  - **Amendment 2351**: This amendment proposed defining a "fit parent" and ensuring "approximately equal parenting time" in custody cases. Concerns were raised about potential inconsistencies and complications in cases involving abuse or distance. The committee decided not to move forward with this amendment.
  - **Amendment 2378h**: This amendment replaced the vague term "frequent and continued contact" with "approximately equal parenting time" to provide clearer guidance for judges. Despite concerns about potential disputes, the amendment passed, and the bill, as amended, moved forward with a vote of 9-7.

### **3. Appointment of Counsel for Children**
- **House Bill 535**: The committee discussed an amendment requiring the appointment of an attorney to represent the expressed interests of children in family court cases, particularly those at risk of placement. The amendment also included provisions for notifying the court within two business days of placement decisions and updating the Foster Care Bill of Rights. The amendment passed with a vote of 15-1, and the bill, as amended, also passed with a vote of 15-1.

### **4. Reunification Therapy**
- **House Bill 306**: The bill aimed to regulate reunification therapy in custody cases, ensuring that judges consider parents' insurance coverage and avoid harmful practices. The committee unanimously passed the bill with an amendment (236h) that outlined specific criteria for acceptable reunification therapies.

---

### **5. Child Support Payment Options**
- **House Bill 618**: The committee considered an amendment requiring courts to develop a form for parents to specify their preferred child support payment methods (e.g., direct deposit, check) before the temporary hearing. The amendment and the bill, as amended, both passed with a vote of 14-0. The committee recessed to gather more information on whether the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or the courts should develop the required form.

### **6. Family Court Procedures**
- **House Bill 475**: The committee debated a bill requiring all evidence to be admitted in family court proceedings. An amendment was proposed to require judges to document their reasoning for admitting or excluding evidence. The amendment passed unanimously (16-0), and the bill, as amended, also passed unanimously.
- **House Bill 471**: The committee discussed a bill related to final disposition hearings in divorce proceedings. Concerns were raised about the practicality of scheduling final hearings early in the process. The committee voted unanimously (16-0) to recommend the bill be "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).
- **House Bill 499**: The committee discussed a bill related to the admission of evidence in family court proceedings. The committee voted unanimously (16-0) to recommend ITL, citing concerns about the bill's practicality and potential for abuse.

### **7. Youth Detention Center**

### **8. Special Immigrant Juvenile Status**
- **House Bill 455**: The committee discussed a bill creating a new state cause of action for abused, neglected, and abandoned children seeking special immigrant juvenile status. The committee voted unanimously (16-0) to recommend ITL, citing issues with federal law and unintended complications.

- **Protection from Harm**: There was a strong emphasis on protecting children and families from harmful practices, whether in custody disputes, reunification therapy, or family court proceedings.
