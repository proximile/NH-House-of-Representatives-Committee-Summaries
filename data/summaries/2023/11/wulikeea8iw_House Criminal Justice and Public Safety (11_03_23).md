**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (November 3, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on November 3, 2023, to discuss key issues related to bail reform, electronic monitoring, and broader criminal justice reforms.

Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and proposals:

### **Key Discussion Points and Proposals**

1. **Bail Reform and Recidivism**

   - The committee emphasized the need to reduce repeat offenses by ensuring accountability and addressing underlying issues contributing to criminal behavior.

2. **Homelessness and Trespassing**

   - Some representatives argued that punitive measures like electronic monitoring or jail time do not address the root causes of homelessness and may exacerbate the problem.

3. **Victims' Rights and Justice**  
   - The committee discussed the importance of balancing the **rights of victims** with the need to avoid overly punitive measures for defendants.  
   - Trespassing and other minor offenses can have victims, and the committee explored ways to ensure justice for both parties while protecting public safety.

4. **Social Services and Referrals**  
   - The committee highlighted the critical role of **social services** in addressing issues like homelessness, addiction, and mental health.

5. **Bail Commissioners and Judicial Oversight**  
   - There was discussion about the role of **bail commissioners** and the need for clearer guidelines and training.  
   - The committee proposed that individuals rearrested while on bail should be brought before a judge rather than released by bail commissioners.  
   - A **magistrate program** was suggested to oversee bail commissioners and electronic monitoring, ensuring that individuals arrested on weekends see a magistrate promptly to assess flight risk or danger.

6. **Crime Data and Police Staffing**  
   - The committee reviewed **crime data**, noting that crime rates in New Hampshire have decreased since bail reform.

7. **Cost and Resource Management**  
   - The financial and logistical implications of **electronic monitoring** were discussed, including who would bear the costs and how to manage resources.  
   - The committee considered requiring individuals to reimburse monitoring costs if convicted but recognized the challenges of recovering fees from indigent defendants.

8. **Privacy and Data Use**

   - The committee referenced a New Hampshire **constitutional amendment** protecting personal privacy.

11. **Legislative Drafting and Next Steps**

    - They aimed to finalize language for the proposed legislation and continue discussions on related issues, including the role of magistrates and specific offenses to be included in the policy.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting concluded with a commitment to creating a more **accountable bail system**, reducing recidivism, and addressing the root causes of criminal behavior while respecting individual rights and privacy. The committee planned to continue deliberations and prepare for a formal vote in the next session.
