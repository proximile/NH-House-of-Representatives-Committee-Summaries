### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on State-Controlled Cannabis Sales (11/27/23)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a series of meetings under the **Commission to Study Proposing Legislation for State-Controlled Sales of Cannabis and Cannabis Products**. The discussions focused on crafting a comprehensive regulatory framework for the legalization and sale of cannabis, emphasizing public health, safety, and equity. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions across all segments:

---

### **1. Regulatory Framework and Licensing**
- **Licensing and Regulation**: The commission emphasized the need for all cannabis-related facilities and products to be licensed and regulated, with clear language to avoid ambiguity. A statewide cap of **15 retail stores** was agreed upon, with potential for future legislative adjustments.
- **Online Ordering and Pickup**: Online ordering with in-store pickup was approved, requiring ID verification to prevent out-of-state residents from transporting cannabis illegally.
- **Inventory Tracking**: An **electronic inventory tracking system** from seedling to sale was mandated to ensure accountability and law enforcement access.
- **Franchise Fees and Taxes**: Cannabis accessories were excluded from franchise fees to maintain parity with non-licensed retailers. The term "tax" was replaced with "fee" in relevant sections.

### **2. Public Health and Safety**
- **Training Requirements**: Mandatory annual training for cannabis retail employees was established, covering topics such as potency, ID checks, and responsible sales practices.
- **Potency Limits**: The serving size limit for cannabis edibles was reduced from **20 milligrams to 5 milligrams of THC per serving**. The commission debated whether potency limits should be set in statute or through rulemaking.
- **Packaging and Marketing**: Regulations were proposed to prevent cannabis products from appealing to children, including restrictions on bright colors, characters, and toy-like shapes.
- **Public Consumption Penalties**: A graduated penalty system for public consumption was considered, with first offenses as violations and subsequent offenses escalating to misdemeanors. No consensus was reached, leaving this to the policy committee for further discussion.
- **Recall Procedures**: Provisions for product recalls and consumer notifications were included to ensure consumer protection.

### **3. Social Equity and Justice**
- **Justice Reinvestment Fund**: The commission debated but ultimately decided to strike the Justice Reinvestment Fund from the bill, suggesting it be addressed in separate legislation.
- **Annulment of Convictions**: A process for annulling past cannabis-related convictions was discussed but removed from the bill, with plans to address it in future standalone legislation.
- **Non-Discrimination in Employment**: The commission explored protections for state and municipal employees who use cannabis, particularly for roles like law enforcement and school bus drivers. A study committee was formed to further examine this issue.

---

### **4. Funding Allocation**
- **Revenue Distribution**: Funds generated from cannabis sales were allocated as follows: **50% to the state**, **20% to substance abuse prevention and recovery**, **5% to mental health for children**, and the remainder to retirement systems and education.
- **Mental Health and Substance Abuse**: The commission emphasized the importance of funding substance abuse prevention and mental health treatment programs, including voluntary and involuntary treatment options.

### **5. Advisory and Oversight Bodies**
- **Public Health Advisory Committee**: This committee was established to provide guidance on cannabis-related public health issues, including potency limits and educational materials.
- **Cannabis Advisory Commission**: An 11-member advisory commission was proposed, including representatives from public health, law enforcement, the medical community, and the public. The commission will oversee regulatory, public health, and business operations related to cannabis.

### **6. Operational and Logistical Considerations**
- **Distance Restrictions**: The commission debated distance requirements for cannabis retail outlets near schools, churches, and other sensitive areas. A **1,000-foot limit** was proposed, similar to existing therapeutic cannabis rules.
- **Therapeutic Cannabis Integration**: Therapeutic cannabis products were integrated into the retail market, with retail franchise stores allowed to sell these products to registered patients.
- **Landlord-Tenant Issues**: Landlords were granted the right to prohibit smoking cannabis in rental properties, but not other forms of consumption like edibles.

### **7. Ethical and Legal Considerations**
- **Conflict of Interest**: The commission discussed adding language to prevent conflicts of interest among advisory board members, ensuring transparency and trust in the oversight process.
- **Lobbying Restrictions**: A proposed restriction on lobbying and political contributions by cannabis license holders was included as an addendum for further discussion, aiming to prevent undue industry influence on policy.

---

### **8. Final Report and Next Steps**
- **Report and Recommendations**: The commission voted **7-2** to present a neutral report summarizing their work without endorsing or opposing the proposed legislation. Minority members were allowed to submit addendums.
- **Future Legislation**: The commission acknowledged that their report does not prevent individual legislators from proposing cannabis-related legislation in the future.
- **Final Vote**: The meeting concluded with a vote to recommend no further action on the proposed legislation, leaving the decision to future legislators.
