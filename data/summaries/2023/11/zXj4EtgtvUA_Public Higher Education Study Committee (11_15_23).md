**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Higher Education Study Committee Meeting (November 15, 2023)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Public Higher Education Study Committee convened on November 15, 2023, to discuss critical issues and initiatives aimed at improving public higher education in the state. The meeting centered on three main themes: the progress of HB 1530 and transfer pathways, challenges in credit transferability—particularly in nursing and allied health fields—and the future of public higher education, including online learning, affordability, and strategic alignment between institutions.

### **1. Progress of HB 1530 and Transfer Pathways**
The committee focused on **HB 1530**, a bill designed to create clear, affordable, and efficient transfer pathways between New Hampshire’s community colleges and the University System of New Hampshire (USNH). Key highlights included:  
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to align educational pathways with workforce needs, provide better guidance for undecided students, and ensure seamless credit transfers.  
- **Progress**: Three subcommittees were formed to explore transfer programs, existing pathways, and block grant opportunities. Universal transfer pathways have been established for 10 programs, with seven more expected by December 2023.  
- **Collaboration**: Faculty collaboration between community colleges and USNH institutions is critical to aligning learning outcomes and reducing barriers for students.  
- **Student Advising**: Early advising, starting in high school through dual enrollment and early college programs, is essential to inform students about transfer opportunities.  
- **Quality Assurance**: The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining academic standards, addressing grade inflation, and using standardized assessments to ensure competency.  
- **Future Goals**: Efforts will focus on aligning course numbering, defining grade levels for automatic transfers, and learning from successful systems in states like California.

### **2. Credit Transferability in Nursing and Allied Health Fields**
The committee addressed challenges and opportunities in credit transferability, particularly in high-demand fields like nursing and allied health:  
- **Credit Transfer Issues**: Ensuring smooth credit transfers is a priority to prevent students from losing credits or retaking courses.  
- **Nursing Programs**: Declining applications to nursing programs were discussed, with a focus on making nursing careers more attractive. Clear pathways from associate to bachelor’s degrees in nursing were emphasized, as well as opportunities for students to pivot into other allied health fields.  
- **Advising and Pathways**: Early and effective advising is crucial to help students navigate transfer pathways and avoid surprises.  
- **Demographic Challenges**: The decline in high school graduates has prompted a focus on adult learners, affordability, and accessibility, particularly for part-time and non-traditional students.  
- **Competition and Affordability**: Institutions are competing for students by emphasizing affordability and value, while promoting the quality of education.  
- **Online Education**: The pandemic accelerated the adoption of online learning, with 30% of credit activity now conducted online. Online options are especially important for adult learners needing flexibility.  
- **Collaboration**: Strengthening partnerships between community colleges and four-year institutions is key to creating seamless transfer pathways and supporting student success.

### **3. The Future of Public Higher Education**
The committee explored the evolving landscape of public higher education, including the balance between online and in-person learning, affordability, and strategic alignment:  
- **Online vs. In-Person Learning**: Approximately 30% of credit activity occurs online, with concerns raised about high school students missing out on social interaction. However, online learning offers flexibility, particularly for adult learners.  
- **Strategic Alignment**: Governor Chris Sununu established a task force to explore coordination between the state’s community college and university systems. The task force will report by March 31, 2024, focusing on enhancing postsecondary education, improving accessibility, and addressing affordability.  
- **Affordability and Accessibility**: Streamlining programs, avoiding duplication, and managing expenses are critical to reducing costs for students and families. Accessibility for adult learners and those in remote areas remains a priority.  
- **Sustainability**: Questions were raised about the sustainability of maintaining 10 postsecondary institutions in New Hampshire, with discussions on consolidating programs and optimizing physical facilities.  
- **Future of Education**: The shift toward shorter-term certifications and badges, alongside traditional degrees, reflects the evolving needs of students and the workforce. Balancing practical, job-focused education with liberal arts education was emphasized.  
- **Governance and Coordination**: Better coordination between the community college and university systems is essential to create core programs accessible across multiple colleges.  
- **Public Input**: A legislative listening session was scheduled to gather public feedback on the search for the next University of New Hampshire president.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to improving public higher education in New Hampshire by streamlining transfer pathways, addressing credit transferability challenges, and exploring strategic alignment between institutions. Key priorities include affordability, accessibility, collaboration, and adapting to the evolving needs of students and the workforce. The committee’s ongoing efforts, including the work of the task force and public input sessions, will shape the future of higher education in the state, ensuring it remains responsive to the needs of students, families, and the broader economy.
