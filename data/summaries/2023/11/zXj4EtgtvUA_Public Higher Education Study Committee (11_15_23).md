4. **Student Recruitment, Retention, and Advising**  
   - Strategies to re-engage students admitted to USNH but who did not enroll include offering the same financial aid package and creating a welcoming environment.  
   - **Early advising** for high school and community college students is critical to inform them about transfer opportunities and ensure smooth transitions.  
   - Better communication between institutions and students, as well as improved tracking systems, are needed to prevent surprises in credit transfers.  

5. **Demographic Challenges and Enrollment Trends**  
   - New England is experiencing a decline in high school graduates and college enrollment, with projections indicating further declines.  
   - Strategies to adapt include focusing on **adult learners**, expanding **online education**, and offering flexible, shorter programs to meet the needs of non-traditional students.  

6. **Online Education and Future Trends**  
   - The growth of online education, accelerated by the pandemic, was noted. The balance between online and in-person learning, as well as the need for flexible programs, was discussed.  
   - The future of education may involve more **certifications**, **badges**, and **short-term programs** alongside traditional degrees to adapt to changing industry demands and technological advancements.
