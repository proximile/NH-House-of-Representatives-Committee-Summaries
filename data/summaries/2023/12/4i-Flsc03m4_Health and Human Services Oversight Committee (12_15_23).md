### **Direct Care Workforce Shortage**
The committee addressed the significant decline in licensed nursing assistants (LNAs) and registered nurses from 2022 to 2023, with a projected need for 24,000 more direct care workers by 2028. Major barriers to workforce retention include low wages, lack of affordable housing, child care, and transportation. Pilot programs like home-sharing and tuition assistance were discussed as potential solutions.

### **Ageism and Age-Friendly Policies**
The committee emphasized the importance of reducing ageism in policies and practices, promoting the value of older adults, and creating age-friendly workplaces and housing. The goal is to encourage older adults to remain in the workforce and live independently longer.

### **Multi-Sector Plan**
A new priority for the year, the multi-sector plan aims to integrate existing state plans (e.g., aging, mental health, transportation) into a cohesive 10-year strategy to address the needs of an aging population and improve overall state readiness.

### **Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Report**
Katrina Hansen from the Division of Public Health Services provided updates on HAIs in hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, dialysis centers, and long-term care facilities. While New Hampshire hospitals reported fewer infections than the national average, challenges persist in dialysis centers, which have higher-than-expected infection rates and low influenza vaccination rates among healthcare personnel. Efforts are underway to improve reporting, training, and infection prevention.

### **Health Officers Association Report**
Wayne Whitford, president of the New Hampshire Health Officers Association, presented the annual State Readiness Report. Key challenges include housing issues, septic system compliance, and inadequate staffing and funding for health officers, with a 12% vacancy rate statewide. Solutions proposed include regional collaboration and increased training.
