**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (12/15/23)**

The December 15, 2023, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health and Human Services Oversight Committee addressed a wide range of topics related to health, human services, and aging in the state. The meeting began with a roll call confirming a quorum, except for Senator Avard, who was absent, and the approval of the draft minutes from the November 17, 2023, regular meeting.

### Key Updates and Discussions:

1. **DHHS Commissioners Update**:
   - Deputy Commissioner Marissa Hen and Director Patricia Tilly provided updates on the school-based health program in Manchester, funded by a CDC grant. The program has delivered nearly 7,000 behavioral health visits and 208 physical health services to students. While the CDC funding ends this fiscal year, the program is designed to be sustainable through Medicaid and commercial insurance billing.

2. **Tuition Waiver Program**:
   - Beth Me, a youth engagement specialist, and Michaela Willie, a beneficiary of the program, discussed the tuition waiver program. Recent changes have increased the number of waivers and the age limit for applicants, resulting in 52 students using the waivers this year, a significant increase from previous years.

3. **Medicaid Dental Program**:
   - Medicaid Director Henry Lipman updated the committee on the Medicaid dental program. Delta Dental has donated funds to support dental services at federally qualified health centers. Efforts are ongoing to recruit more dentists and use mobile dental vans to reach underserved areas.

4. **Redetermination Efforts**:
   - Lipman also discussed the Medicaid redetermination process, which is nearing completion. The retention rate for regular renewals was 89.5% last month, with additional outreach efforts for vulnerable populations.

5. **Medicaid and Medicare Challenges**:
   - The committee discussed ongoing issues with Medicaid, including difficulties in verifying assets and bank account information for eligibility. Additionally, individuals aging out of Medicaid face challenges transitioning to Medicare.

6. **New Hampshire State Commission on Aging**:
   - The Commission on Aging presented its annual report, emphasizing its role in advising the governor and legislature on aging-related issues. Key priorities include strengthening systems of care for healthy aging, growing the Direct Care Workforce, advancing age-friendly policies, and developing a multi-sector plan for aging in New Hampshire.
   - The state’s aging population is significant, with over 27% of residents aged 60 and older, making New Hampshire the second oldest state by median age.

7. **Direct Care Workforce**:
   - The commission highlighted the need to address the shortage in the Direct Care Workforce, particularly in home and community-based care. Challenges include low wages, lack of affordable housing, and transportation barriers. Suggested solutions include pilot programs, tuition assistance, and removing licensing barriers while maintaining safety standards.

8. **Age-Friendly Policies**:
   - Reducing ageism and creating age-friendly workplaces and housing were discussed as critical. The commission emphasized the importance of valuing older adults and leveraging their contributions to society. Technology investments, such as broadband in rural areas and tools for remote health monitoring, were also highlighted.

9. **Multi-Sector Plan for Aging**:
   - A new priority for the commission is developing a multi-sector plan for aging, which would integrate existing plans (e.g., mental health, transportation) to create a cohesive, long-term strategy for the state’s aging population.

10. **Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Program Update**:
    - Katrina Hansen from the Division of Public Health Services provided an update on the HAI program, which tracks infections in healthcare settings. New Hampshire hospitals reported significantly fewer infections than predicted by national data in 2021, particularly in urinary tract and surgical site infections.

11. **Infection Control and Reporting**:
    - Healthcare vaccination coverage in hospitals was reported at 90.4%, exceeding the Healthy People 2020 goal of 90%. However, some facilities failed to report required data, and technical issues hindered data analysis. Efforts are underway to engage these facilities and resolve challenges.

12. **Health Officer Readiness**:
    - The New Hampshire Health Officers Association reported on the readiness of health officers to respond to health threats. Challenges include staffing, funding, and addressing issues like hoarding, septic system compliance, and homelessness. The state has 217 health officers, with a 12% vacancy rate.

13. **Personnel Updates**:
    - Paula Minahan, a long-time representative of the New Hampshire Hospital Association, announced her departure and introduced her successor, Ben Bradley, who will take over as vice president of state government relations. Bradley expressed his commitment to representing hospitals and working with the committee.

The meeting concluded with expressions of gratitude for Minahan’s service and well-wishes for her upcoming trip to New Zealand and Australia. The committee also discussed future agenda items, including compliance audits and strategic planning for the department.
