The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Capital Project Overview Committee meeting on December 15, 2023, began with Chairman Mark McCornick apologizing for being six minutes late. The meeting focused on several key agenda items:

1. **Nominations**: Representative Karen Eel nominated Representative Mills for Vice Chair, which was seconded and unanimously approved. Representative Mel then nominated Representative Danny as clerk, also unanimously approved.

2. **Harbor Dredging and Pier Maintenance Fund**: The committee discussed a request from the Pease Development Authority (PDA) Division of Ports and Harbors to expend up to $100,000 from the Harbor Dredging and Pier Maintenance Fund for repairs to the Portsmouth Commercial Fish Pier. Gan Omar, the PDA Director, explained that the funds were needed to complete the project without compromising its scope. The motion to approve the request was passed unanimously.

3. **Minutes Approval**: The committee accepted the minutes from the September 15 meeting.

4. **Informational Item**: The committee reviewed a quarterly report from the Department of Transportation (DOT), which included a name change from "Capital Budget" to "Capital Projects Overview" and set a reporting threshold for projects of $1 million or more. Due to time constraints and membership changes, further discussion on this item was postponed to the next meeting.

5. **Next Meeting**: The committee scheduled its next meeting for January 26, 2024, at 9:00 AM.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which was unanimously approved. Chairman McCornick thanked the members for their participation and wished them a happy holiday season.
