**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on the Commission to Investigate Implementation of Next Generation Nuclear Reactor Technology (12/01/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on December 1, 2023, to finalize the work of the Commission to Investigate Implementation of Next Generation Nuclear Reactor Technology. The meeting centered on refining and approving a comprehensive report on advanced nuclear reactor technologies, addressing technical, policy, and economic considerations, and ensuring the state’s preparedness for the potential adoption of these technologies. Here are the key points from the discussion:

### **1. Report Refinement and Accessibility**
- **Glossary and Technical Clarity**: Representative Alvin C. from Merrimack County proposed adding a glossary to the report to explain acronyms and technical terms related to nuclear energy and the electric power industry. He also suggested including a simple line graph comparing energy levels (e.g., megawatt, gigawatt, terawatt) to enhance reader understanding.
- **Data and Resources**: The commission recommended linking the report to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) for state-level energy data specific to New Hampshire, improving the document’s utility and accuracy.
- **Document Preservation**: Plans were made to keep the commission’s website active for a couple of years and migrate all meeting minutes and documents to the official state site for permanent record-keeping.

### **2. Key Findings on Advanced Nuclear Technologies**
The report, compiled from a year-long study, highlighted the complexities and potential benefits of advanced nuclear reactor technologies:
- **Technological Features**: Advanced reactors utilize various fuel types, heat transfer mediums, and innovative designs, offering high energy density, continuous energy supply, and compatibility with renewable energy sources.
- **Safety and Modernization**: Modern reactor designs prioritize safety, and the report emphasized the importance of public engagement, regulatory updates, and lessons learned from past projects.
- **Zero-Carbon Goals**: Nuclear energy was identified as essential for achieving zero-carbon emissions, with advancements in nuclear fuel recycling and innovative business models further enhancing its viability.
- **Supply Chain and Workforce**: The report underscored the need for a robust supply chain and the challenges of restarting the experience cycle for skilled labor, given the decades-long gap in nuclear reactor construction.

### **3. Policy and Economic Considerations**
- **Policy Options**: The commission discussed potential state policies to support advanced nuclear technologies, including designating nuclear as a clean technology, streamlining licensing and permitting processes, and updating atomic energy statutes. Financial incentives and public-private investments in the nuclear supply chain were also considered.
- **Market and Regulatory Signals**: In deregulated markets, the challenges of developing nuclear projects were acknowledged, along with the potential for New Hampshire to become a net exporter of electricity. Sending positive market signals, such as legislative resolutions supporting nuclear energy and urging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite license approvals, was deemed critical.
- **Cost and Efficiency**: While first-of-a-kind nuclear projects are not expected to save money initially, efficiencies and economies of scale can be achieved over time. Advanced reactors are designed to maximize electricity generation efficiency, potentially outperforming older plants.

### **4. Strategic Importance for New Hampshire**
The meeting concluded with a focus on New Hampshire’s energy future:
- **Energy Reliability and Stability**: Nuclear energy offers a stable and consistent power supply, aligning with the state’s energy policy goals of cost-effectiveness and reliability.
- **Regional Leadership**: By adopting advanced nuclear technologies, New Hampshire could position itself as a leader in the regional energy market, benefiting economically and ensuring a reliable energy supply.
- **Workforce Development and Public Awareness**: The need for workforce development, public awareness campaigns, and reevaluating New Hampshire’s participation in the NRC agreement state program were emphasized to support the successful implementation of nuclear energy.

### **5. Approval and Next Steps**
The commission finalized the report with suggested amendments and agreed to review changes over the weekend via email to ensure timely submission. The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which was unanimously approved.

In summary, the commission’s work underscores the potential of advanced nuclear reactor technologies to play a pivotal role in New Hampshire’s energy strategy. By addressing technical, policy, and economic challenges, the state aims to leverage nuclear energy to achieve its zero-carbon goals, ensure energy reliability, and position itself as a regional leader in the energy transition.
