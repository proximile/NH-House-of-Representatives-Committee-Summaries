**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws (12/04/23)**

On December 4, 2023, the New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss the **Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws**, with a particular focus on the newly authorized **Historical Horse Racing (HHR) machines**. The meeting addressed the financial, regulatory, and social implications of these changes, aiming to ensure the continued effectiveness and fairness of charitable gaming in supporting the state’s nonprofit sector.

---

### **2. Revenue and Tax Implications**

---

### **3. Charity Selection and Scheduling**
- Concerns were raised about the fairness of **date allocation** for charitable gaming events, with some charities receiving more lucrative dates (e.g., weekends) than others.

---

### **4. Impact on Charities**
- Charitable gaming has provided significant financial benefits to nonprofits, with some charities earning **over $100,000 annually**. However, there were concerns about **saturation** and the need to accommodate more charities.
- Proposals included reducing the **maximum number of days** a charity can sponsor to allow more organizations to participate.

---

### **5. Geographic Distribution**

---

### **6. Public Input and Surveys**
- To better understand the experiences and challenges faced by charities, the commission proposed conducting a **statewide survey** to gather feedback from nonprofits involved in charitable gaming.

---

### **7. RFP for Gaming Consultant**
- The commission discussed drafting a **Request for Proposal (RFP)** to hire a consultant to study the impact of HHR machines and charitable gaming laws. The consultant’s analysis would focus on **saturation**, **revenue**, and **regulatory frameworks**, with comparisons to states like **Kentucky**, **Virginia**, **Rhode Island**, and **Massachusetts**.

---

### **8. Moratorium on HHR Expansion**
- Representative **Fred Set** introduced an amendment to **Senate Bill 112**, proposing a **permanent moratorium** on new HHR licenses after October 18, 2023, to prevent **oversaturation**.
- The amendment also addressed **rent payments** from operators to charities, suggesting eliminating rent to ensure more funds go directly to charitable causes.

---

### **9. Discussion on Saturation and Machine Limits**

---

### **11. Revenue Distribution**

---

### **12. Licensing and Fees**
- New Hampshire’s **licensing fees** for gaming operators are significantly lower than those in states like **Maine** and **Massachusetts**, which charge hundreds of thousands of dollars. The commission discussed whether increasing fees could generate more state revenue.
