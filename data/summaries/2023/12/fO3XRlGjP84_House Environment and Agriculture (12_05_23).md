**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Environment and Agriculture (12/05/23)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on December 5, 2023, focused on critical issues related to waste management, landfill regulations, and the treatment and disposal of landfill leachate, particularly addressing the persistent challenge of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination. The discussions highlighted the complexities of managing landfill leachate, regulatory updates, and the need for long-term solutions to mitigate environmental risks.

### **Key Discussions and Updates:**

1. **Treatment and Disposal of Landfill Leachate:**
   - **Treatment Methods:** Reverse osmosis is an effective method for treating leachate but concentrates PFAS in the reject stream, which then requires specialized disposal. Landfills like TurnKey are implementing on-site pre-treatment, often driven by requests from wastewater treatment plants, though this is not mandated in New Hampshire.
   - **Challenges:** On-site pre-treatment reduces handling but raises concerns about potential infrastructure failures. Off-site treatment minimizes handling but risks contaminating biosolids at wastewater plants, perpetuating PFAS contamination cycles.
   - **Disposal of Concentrated PFAS:** The reject stream from reverse osmosis is currently sent to facilities in New York for further treatment, though previous disposal at a Massachusetts wastewater plant raised concerns.

2. **Regulatory Considerations and Rulemaking:**
   - **PFAS Standards:** The committee is exploring standards for PFAS concentrations in biosolids intended for land application. Efforts to reduce PFAS in consumer products, such as textiles and treated carpets, may gradually decrease PFAS levels in landfills, though this will take time due to the age of existing waste.
   - **Rulemaking Process:** Mike Whims, Director of the Waste Management Division, and Leah McKenna, Administrator of the Solid Waste Management Bureau, provided updates on the rulemaking process for landfill regulations (Env-Sw 800). Public input was collected from October to November 8, 2023, with 14 entities submitting approximately 100 pages of comments. The formal rulemaking process will begin with a presentation to the Waste Management Council on January 18, 2024, followed by public hearings in March or April, aiming for adoption by July 1, 2024.
   - **500-Foot Setback Rule:** A proposed rule increases the required distance of landfills from perennial surface water from 200 feet to 500 feet, based on groundwater travel time calculations. This conservative measure provides a three-year buffer to detect, investigate, and remediate potential contamination. The 500-foot standard is more protective than neighboring states, which typically require setbacks of 100 to 400 feet.
   - **Hydrogeological Standards:** The rules include requirements for soil permeability (hydraulic conductivity) beneath landfills to ensure slower groundwater movement, facilitating effective monitoring and remediation.

3. **Case Study: NCES Landfill in Bethlehem:**
   - The NCES landfill, which historically had issues with an unlined landfill impacting groundwater, was discussed. After being lined, ongoing monitoring shows declining contaminant levels, though PFAS and 1,4-dioxane remain persistent. Groundwater seeps near the landfill were examined, with no evidence of adverse impacts on the Ammonoosuc River.

4. **Funding and Long-Term Solutions:**
   - The committee acknowledged the challenges of managing a large volume of expiring rules simultaneously. Additional funding could help, particularly for staffing, but is unlikely to address immediate rulemaking needs. Long-term solutions include staggering rule updates and addressing chronic underfunding in the solid waste program.

### **Future Steps:**
- The committee plans to reconvene in January 2024 to review progress on rulemaking and public hearings. The waste management team will finalize draft rules and submit them for legal review before the January 18, 2024, presentation to the Waste Management Council. Further public hearings and comment periods will follow as part of the formal rulemaking process.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting underscored the complexities of managing PFAS in landfill leachate, the need for updated regulations, and the importance of balancing on-site treatment with off-site disposal. The discussions highlighted the ongoing challenges of mitigating environmental risks while ensuring effective waste management practices. The committee remains committed to advancing regulatory updates and exploring long-term solutions to address these critical issues.
