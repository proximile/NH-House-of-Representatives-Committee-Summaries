**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (December 21, 2023)**

   The representatives discussed the filing of emergency rules, particularly focusing on correcting a fee calculation error for architects and engineers issued by the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).

The committee acknowledged the importance of addressing this issue correctly.

2. **Deliberative Council (Delcar) Meeting Schedule**:  
   The committee reviewed the schedule for Delcar meetings in 2024. Regular meetings were set for the third Friday of the month during the first six months of the year, with Thursdays scheduled for the second half of the year to avoid conflicts with the legislative session and summer schedules. The schedule was approved, ensuring no conflicts with Easter. The continued meeting was canceled, and the next meeting was scheduled for January 19.

The segment concluded with holiday wishes and adjournment.
