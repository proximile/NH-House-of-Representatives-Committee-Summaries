### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

1. **Establishment and Operation of Area Agencies (2023-152)**  
   A conditional approval request was filed, addressing most comments on the final proposal. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) agreed to an oral amendment to correct a terminology error on page six, replacing "developmental disability service system" with "service delivery system" to align with statutory language.

2. **Impaired Driver Programs (Item K)**  
   Representative Leon raised concerns about the program's operation via video conferencing. DHHS agreed to add a new definition of "face-to-face" to include virtual interactions, ensuring clarity in the rules. Public testimony from Marian Kelly of the Amethyst Foundation highlighted financial challenges faced by Impaired Driver Care Management Programs (IDCMPs) due to reduced revenues. Kelly urged the committee to accept proposed fee increases to ensure program viability.

3. **Emergency Rule for Architects and Professional Engineers**  
   An emergency rule was filed to correct an oversight in fee increases for certificates of authority, which mistakenly quadrupled fees instead of doubling them. The agency is working on refunds for those who overpaid and plans to address the issue through regular rulemaking.

4. **Board of Mental Health Practice Certification**  
   The committee discussed concerns about the time frame for completing supervisory experience and the scope of duties allowable under the certification. The board clarified that the certification is for reimbursement purposes and does not limit the scope of practice. Final approval was postponed to the next meeting to allow further clarification.

5. **Schedule of Delcar Meetings for 2024**  
   The committee approved the schedule for Delcar meetings in 2024, with regular meetings set for the third Friday of the month during the first six months and Thursdays during the second six months to avoid conflicts with legislative sessions.

6. **Attendance and Substitutions**  
   Several members were absent, requiring substitutions. Representative Grass filled in for Senator Chandley, and Representative Hacken Phillips was on deck.

7. **Consent Agenda and Postponements**  
   Item K was removed from the consent agenda at Representative Lon's request, while the rest of the consent agenda was approved. Item I, related to the Water Council, was postponed to the January agenda.

8. **Watercraft Safety Rules (Proposal 20237)**  
   The Department of Safety requested more time to address substantive comments. A preliminary objection was recommended, allowing the agency to resolve issues in a preliminary objection response.

9. **Nursing Licensing Requirements (Proposal Nursing 300s)**  
   A revised conditional approval addressed legislative intent and unclear comments. The committee approved a motion to change "alternate education" to "alternate experience" in the rules.

10. **Definitions of Financial and Medical Assistance (Proposal 2023-141)**  
    A late-filed conditional approval was granted a waiver. Discussions focused on dependent child definitions and specified relative criteria, with plans to report back on guardianship issues.

11. **Hospice Services (Proposal 2023-193)**  
    Rules had expired since 2018 and 2022, with the Department following Medicare regulations during the lapse. A motion to approve the conditional request passed.

12. **Assistance Payment Determination (Proposal 196)**  
    A rule expired due to a missed paragraph. The bulk of the rule addressed payment timelines and reductions for specific populations. The conditional approval was passed.

13. **Ambulance Services (Interim Rule)**  
    An interim rule was filed after the effective rule expired on December 1, 2023. The agency plans to move forward with regular rulemaking in January. The conditional approval was passed.

14. **Expired Rules Discussion**  
    DHHS acknowledged challenges in managing 3,000 rules with limited staff. Efforts are underway to improve rule expiration tracking.
