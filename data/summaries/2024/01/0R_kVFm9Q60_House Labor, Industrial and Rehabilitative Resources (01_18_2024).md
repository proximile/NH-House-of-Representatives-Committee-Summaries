The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 18, 2024, addressed a range of labor-related issues, focusing on several key bills and discussions surrounding employee rights, wage payment methods, and protections for freelance workers. The meeting highlighted debates on the adequacy of existing laws, the need for education, and the potential impact on employers and employees.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 1051: Prohibiting Employee Responsibility for Unpaid Customer Bills**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prevent restaurants from requiring employees to cover the cost of customers who leave without paying.
- **Sponsor**: Representative Mark PR argued that employees should not be held financially responsible for situations beyond their control.
- **Testimony**: Tracy McGraw from the Department of Labor clarified that existing law (RSA 275:48) already prohibits employers from deducting wages without written employee consent, making such practices illegal.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association deemed the bill unnecessary, as the issue is already covered by law and rarely occurs.
- **Conclusion**: The committee emphasized the need for better education on employee rights rather than new legislation.

#### **HB 1072: Prohibiting Polygraph Tests in Hiring**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to ban employers from using polygraph tests in the hiring process, citing their unreliability and the anxiety they cause job seekers.
- **Sponsor**: Representative Eric Gallagher introduced the bill, which includes exemptions for certain positions like law enforcement and security.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police expressed concerns about the bill's impact on non-sworn personnel, particularly in sensitive roles.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the balance between preventing coercive practices and allowing employers to verify employee honesty.

#### **HB 1110: Mandating E-Verify for Employers**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires employers with more than 25 employees to use the federal E-Verify system to confirm work eligibility.
- **Sponsor**: Representative Tim McU argued that this would level the playing field, prevent exploitation of undocumented workers, and protect employers from liability.
- **Opposition**: The ACLU and other opponents highlighted E-Verify's inaccuracies, low adoption rate (12% of employers), and potential for discrimination, citing over 58,000 eligible workers wrongly denied employment in 2022.
- **Support**: Employer Steve Dupry shared positive experiences with E-Verify, emphasizing its ease of use and reliability in protecting employers from liability.

#### **HB 121: Disposition of Wages After Employee Death**
- **Purpose**: The bill updates a 1963 law allowing employers to pay owed wages (up to $300) directly to the heirs of deceased employees without probate, proposing an increase to $3,000 to account for inflation.
- **Sponsor**: Representative Brian Seaworth introduced the bill.
- **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about whether $3,000 is sufficient, especially for employees owed vacation or sick pay, with suggestions to tie the cap to pay periods or individual earnings.

#### **HB 1226: Protections for Freelance Workers**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to provide employment protections for freelance workers, including contract safeguards and timely payment guarantees.
- **Sponsor**: Representative Chuck Grassie highlighted the growing population of freelancers in New Hampshire and the need for legislative protections.
- **Testimony**: Freelance media worker Sarah Catz discussed challenges such as lack of benefits, high self-employment taxes, and inconsistent income, advocating for mandatory negotiable contracts.
- **Conclusion**: The Department of Labor expressed willingness to work on an interim study to refine the proposed legislation.

#### **HB 1246: Allowing Wage Payment in Gold and Silver**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes allowing employers to pay employees in gold and silver as legal tender, seen as a safeguard against economic instability.
- **Sponsor**: Representative Granger argued that gold and silver have historically held value and could protect against inflation or hyperinflation.
- **Concerns**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Association of Counties and the New Hampshire Municipal Association raised issues about logistical and financial burdens, fluctuating values, and potential IRS audits.
- **Support**: Supporters emphasized the historical stability of gold and silver and the need for alternative payment methods in case of U.S. dollar devaluation.
- **Proposed Amendments**: The sponsor indicated willingness to amend the bill to clarify that payment in gold and silver must be voluntary for employees.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**

2. **Freelancer Challenges**: The growing freelance workforce faces significant challenges, including lack of benefits and inconsistent income, prompting calls for legislative protections.
3. **Wage Payment Methods**: Discussions on wage payment methods, including the potential use of gold and silver, highlighted the complexities and practical challenges of implementing alternative payment systems.
4. **Legislative Updates**: Several bills aimed to update outdated laws, such as increasing the cap on wages payable to heirs of deceased employees and modernizing protections for freelance workers.
5. **Education and Awareness**: There was a recurring emphasis on the need for better education and awareness of existing laws and employee rights, rather than introducing redundant legislation.

Overall, the meeting reflected a comprehensive effort to address contemporary labor issues, balancing the need for new protections with the practicalities of implementation and the adequacy of existing laws.
