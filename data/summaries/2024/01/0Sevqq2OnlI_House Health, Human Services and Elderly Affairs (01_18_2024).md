Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Therapeutic Cannabis Expansion and Access**
Several bills aimed at expanding access to New Hampshire’s therapeutic cannabis program were discussed, reflecting a patient-centered approach to medical cannabis use.

- **House Bill 1278-FN**: This bill, introduced by Representative Wendy Thomas, seeks to allow medical providers greater discretion in certifying patients for therapeutic cannabis, even for conditions not explicitly listed in the program. It includes a "two-tiered system" where providers can use the existing list or certify patients based on clinical judgment. The bill received broad support from the Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board (TCMO) and advocates, who emphasized its potential to improve access for patients with conditions like chronic pain, PTSD, and anxiety. Concerns about overuse were addressed through safeguards, including age restrictions (21+) and provider attestations. The bill also includes a repeal provision allowing out-of-state patients to access New Hampshire dispensaries.

- **House Bill 1240**: This bill proposes adding eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa, as a qualifying condition for medical cannabis. Proponents argued that cannabis can stimulate appetite and reduce anxiety, while opponents, including Dr. Jerry Kerk of the TCMO, cautioned about insufficient evidence and potential risks like cannabis use disorder.

- **House Bill 1349**: This bill aims to add generalized anxiety disorder as a qualifying condition. Supporters highlighted cannabis as a safer alternative to benzodiazepines, while concerns were raised about its use in adolescents due to potential neurological risks.

- **House Bill 1350**: This bill proposes increasing the medical cannabis possession limit from 2 to 4 ounces to align with proposed recreational limits and better serve patients, particularly those with severe illnesses like cancer. The Therapeutic Cannabis Board unanimously supported the bill, citing the need for larger quantities for patients who make their own edibles.

- **House Bill 1581**: This bill seeks to allow alternative treatment centers (ATCs) to operate additional cultivation locations, including greenhouses, to reduce costs and improve sustainability. Discussions emphasized the environmental and economic benefits of greenhouse cultivation, as well as the importance of maintaining product quality through rigorous testing.

- **House Bill 1231**: This bill proposes allowing medical cannabis patients and caregivers to cultivate cannabis at home, with limits of 3 mature plants, 3 immature plants, and 12 seedlings. Supporters highlighted the benefits of affordability, strain diversity, and accessibility for rural patients, while opponents raised concerns about enforcement and potential abuse.

#### **2. Health and Human Services**
- **House Bill 1520 FNA**: This bill aimed to provide vehicles to individuals in need but sparked debate over potential fraud, maintenance costs, and state funding. It resulted in a tie vote (10-10), moving to the regular calendar without a recommendation.

- **House Bill 1593 FN**: This bill proposed funding for developmental services and community integration. Concerns about the shifting landscape of services for individuals with developmental disabilities led to its continuation to February 14th for further discussion.

- **House Bill 1662**: This bill addresses conflicts of interest in foster care placements by prohibiting HHS employees involved in child removal from serving as foster parents for those children. An amendment clarified that employees could still serve as foster parents for children they had no involvement in removing. The bill resulted in a tie (10-10), leading to no recommendation.

#### **3. Environmental Health**
- **House Bill 1171**: This bill seeks to reestablish and extend the Commission on Environmentally Triggered Chronic Illness, which studies the links between environmental contaminants (e.g., PFAS, lead, arsenic) and chronic illnesses. The commission’s work has led to legislative recommendations, including funding for a kidney cancer study in Merrimack, NH. The bill received strong support for its focus on education, data sharing, and public health improvements.

- **House Bill 1612**: This bill relates to monitoring radioactivity and leverages existing networks like the C10 Network. The motion to expedite the bill passed unanimously (20-0), and it was placed on the consent calendar.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Patient Access and Affordability**: Many bills focused on improving access to therapeutic cannabis and health services, particularly for vulnerable populations. Home cultivation and increased possession limits were seen as ways to reduce costs and improve accessibility for patients.

2. **Environmental Sustainability**: Greenhouse and outdoor cannabis cultivation were highlighted as eco-friendly and cost-effective alternatives to indoor facilities. The commission on environmentally triggered illnesses emphasized the importance of addressing environmental health risks.

3. **Evidence-Based Practices**: While many bills were supported by patient testimonials and anecdotal evidence, there was a call for more rigorous research, particularly for psychiatric conditions and cannabis use in adolescents.

4. **Legislative Overlap and Efficiency**: Discussions highlighted the need to avoid redundancy in legislation, with some bills potentially rendered unnecessary by broader measures like HB 1278.

5. **Enforcement and Regulation**: Concerns about enforcement, particularly for home cultivation and foster care placements, underscored the need for clear regulations and safeguards.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a strong commitment to improving health care access, environmental health, and the therapeutic cannabis program in New Hampshire. While significant progress was made on several bills, ongoing discussions and further research will be essential to ensure these measures are effective, sustainable, and aligned with the needs of New Hampshire residents.
