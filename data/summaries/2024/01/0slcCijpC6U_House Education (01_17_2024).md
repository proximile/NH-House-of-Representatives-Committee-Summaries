**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Meeting (January 17, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 17, 2024, centered on critical discussions around education funding, policy reforms, and initiatives aimed at improving both public and alternative education systems. Key topics included the expansion of the Education Freedom Account (EFA) program, special education funding, local food procurement for schools, and broader debates on school choice, equity, and accountability. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and legislative proposals from the meeting:

### **1. Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) Expansion**
The EFA program, which allows families to use state funds for private or alternative education, was a focal point of the meeting, with several bills proposing its expansion:

- **House Bill 1561**: This bill seeks to broaden EFA eligibility to include students facing challenges such as bullying, mental health issues, unsafe school environments, or low-performing schools. Supporters argued that EFAs provide tailored educational solutions and empower parental choice, while opponents raised concerns about diverting funds from public schools, particularly in underfunded districts. Critics also highlighted the lack of anti-discrimination protections in private schools and the potential exclusion of marginalized students.
  
- **House Bill 1665**: This bill proposes increasing the income eligibility cap for EFAs from 350% to 500% of the federal poverty level. Proponents argued that this would make the program accessible to more families, while opponents questioned the fiscal impact and sustainability of the expansion.

- **House Bill 1677**: This bill ties EFA eligibility to school district performance, allowing families in districts with low proficiency rates (below 50%) to access EFAs regardless of income. The bill aims to hold underperforming schools accountable while providing families with alternatives.

**Debate Highlights**:
- Supporters emphasized the importance of parental choice, innovation, and meeting diverse student needs.
- Opponents argued that EFAs undermine public education, exacerbate funding disparities, and lack accountability measures.
- Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact of expanding EFAs, with critics noting the lack of fiscal notes and the potential strain on state budgets.

### **2. Special Education Funding (House Bill 1670)**
House Bill 1670 proposes a significant overhaul of special education funding by shifting the financial burden from local property taxpayers to the state. Key points included:

- **Funding Mechanism**: The bill would raise approximately $869 million through the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) to cover 95% of special education costs, replacing the current system of differentiated and categorical aid programs.
  
- **Current Challenges**: Currently, 82% of special education costs are funded locally, with only 11% from the state and 7% from federal sources. This has led to unmet needs for students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs).

- **Concerns**: Issues such as cash flow management for districts, federal funding overlaps, and potential constitutional implications were raised. Testimony highlighted the long-term benefits of adequately funding special education, including higher high school completion and college enrollment rates.

### **3. Local Food Procurement for Schools (House Bill 1678)**
House Bill 1678 proposes the establishment of a **New Hampshire Farm to School Local Food Incentive Pilot Program**, aiming to connect local farms with school districts to provide fresh, locally sourced food. Key points included:

- **Purpose**: The pilot program would assess the feasibility of a statewide farm-to-school initiative, benefiting students, farmers, and communities.
  
- **Benefits**: Students gain access to nutritious meals and agricultural education, while farmers receive a stable market for their products. The program also strengthens local food systems and reduces transportation costs.

- **Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the higher cost of local foods, implementation logistics, and ensuring equitable access for all schools, including those in urban areas.

### **4. Math Learning Communities Program (House Bill 1167)**
This bill introduces a program to help students struggling with Algebra 1 by offering alternative pathways to meet college math requirements. The program emphasizes collaboration between high school and community college math instructors and uses multiple measures to assess student readiness rather than relying on a single test.

### **5. Broader Education Funding and Equity Issues**
Several discussions highlighted the inequities in public school funding and the need to prioritize public education:

- **Constitutional Obligations**: Representatives referenced the Claremont decisions, emphasizing the state’s duty to adequately fund public education. Critics of EFA expansion argued that the state must fulfill this obligation before diverting funds to private schools.
  
- **Funding Disparities**: Examples of underfunded schools lacking basic resources like running water were cited, with calls to address these deficiencies rather than expanding voucher programs.

- **Health and Nutrition**: Concerns were raised about the quality of school meals, including the presence of harmful chemicals like glyphosate. Advocates called for healthier, locally sourced options to improve student health.

### **6. Accountability and Performance Metrics**
Representatives stressed the importance of setting higher standards and measuring school performance to ensure student proficiency in core subjects like math, English, and science. There was a call to incentivize schools to improve outcomes rather than rewarding underperformance with additional funding.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the ongoing tension between expanding school choice through programs like EFAs and the state’s obligation to adequately fund and improve public education. While supporters of EFAs emphasized parental choice and tailored educational solutions, opponents highlighted the risks of diverting funds from public schools and exacerbating inequities. Discussions on special education funding, local food procurement, and math education initiatives reflected a broader commitment to addressing systemic challenges and improving outcomes for all students. The debates highlighted the need for careful consideration of fiscal impacts, accountability measures, and equitable access to quality education in New Hampshire.
