**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration (01/24/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 24, 2024, covered a wide range of topics, including electric vehicles (EVs), disaster relief, green burials, vital records, daylight saving time, and privacy concerns. The discussions reflected a balance between advancing progressive policies and addressing practical, ethical, and financial considerations.

### **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**  
The committee examined **House Bill 1510** and **House Bill 1333**, both related to EV adoption. Concerns were raised about the safety, cost, and readiness of EV technology, particularly battery fires, cold weather performance, and the environmental impact of sourcing raw materials. Opposing views highlighted the environmental and economic benefits of EVs, including reduced carbon emissions and lower operating costs. The committee also discussed hybrid vehicles as a viable interim solution and emphasized the need for improved EV infrastructure and first responder training. The Department of Transportation recommended further study, suggesting a balanced approach to EV adoption.

### **Disaster Relief Funding**  
**House Bill 1466**, introduced by Representative Aaron, proposed a state-level mechanism to provide immediate disaster relief funding to municipalities, bypassing the often slow federal FEMA process. The bill addressed the challenges faced by small towns with limited resources in recovering from natural disasters, emphasizing the need for expedient state-level solutions.

### **Green Burials and Natural Organic Reduction (NOR)**  
**House Bill 1324** sought to legalize natural organic reduction (NOR), also known as human composting, as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional burial and cremation. Proponents highlighted NOR’s environmental benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions and conservation of natural resources, as well as the growing demand for green burial options. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Funeral Directors and Embalmers Association and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester, raised concerns about ethical implications, environmental risks, and the complexity of implementation. The committee discussed regulatory and practical considerations, including cost, unclaimed soil, and the need for clear definitions and regulations.

### **Vital Records and Public Health**  
The committee discussed the critical role of vital records in maternal and child health programs, newborn screening, and child support services. Access to personally identifiable information (PII) was emphasized as essential for tracking maternal mortality, ensuring infant health, and enforcing child support orders. Privacy and data security concerns were also addressed, with a focus on balancing the need for sensitive information with robust protections. An interim study was recommended to further examine the implications of proposed legislation on data sharing and public health services.

### **Daylight Saving Time (DST)**  
The committee debated two bills: **HB 1075**, proposing permanent Standard Time, and **HB 1679**, proposing permanent Atlantic Time (DST). Advocates for permanent Standard Time argued that it aligns better with natural circadian rhythms and improves health outcomes, while supporters of permanent DST emphasized the economic and recreational benefits of later sunsets. Broadcasters raised concerns about logistical challenges of operating across different time zones. The discussion highlighted the need for regional coordination, as neighboring states are considering similar changes.

### **Privacy and Data Security**  
The meeting addressed privacy concerns related to vital records and the potential impact of proposed legislation on data sharing. The New Hampshire Vital Records Information Network (NVRIN) was highlighted as a secure system with strict access controls. The proposed bill could restrict the sharing of PII, affecting DHHS’s ability to provide essential health services and comply with federal funding requirements. The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining robust data governance and security practices while ensuring efficient data sharing for public health purposes.

### **Key Themes and Recommendations**  
The meeting underscored the importance of balancing innovation and tradition, privacy and accessibility, and state and federal responsibilities. Key recommendations included further study on EV adoption, disaster relief mechanisms, and natural organic reduction; interim studies on vital records and data sharing; and careful consideration of the health, economic, and logistical impacts of daylight saving time changes. The committee emphasized the need for clear regulations, robust data security, and regional coordination in addressing these complex issues.

Overall, the meeting reflected a thoughtful and collaborative approach to addressing pressing environmental, public health, and policy challenges in New Hampshire.
