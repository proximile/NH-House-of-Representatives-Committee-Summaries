The New Hampshire House Finance Division II held a work session on **House Bill 1560** on **January 29, 2024**, focusing on the state's **Education Trust Fund (ETF)**. The discussion centered on the fund's surplus, statutory uses, and revenue sources. Key points included:

1. **ETF Surplus and Projections**: The ETF is projected to have a **$43.4 million surplus** for the current fiscal year (FY 2024), with a potential **$253 million surplus** by FY 2025. The fund’s balance has grown significantly since 2018, transitioning from requiring general fund transfers to generating surpluses.

2. **Education Freedom Accounts**: A **$10 million annual reduction** in funding for Education Freedom Accounts, part of the budget, was highlighted as a factor in the ETF’s financials.

3. **Proposed Bill (HB 1560)**: The bill would transfer any **unallocated ETF surplus** at the end of the fiscal year to the **general fund**, increasing budgetary flexibility. Proponents argued this would allow the state to address other needs while still funding education if required. Critics raised concerns about the timing and potential impact on education funding, especially given ongoing discussions about **school funding adequacy** and **special education costs**.

4. **Debate and Motion**: A motion to recommend **OTP (Ought to Pass)** for HB 1560 was made, passing **5-2**. However, some members expressed concerns about the vote’s legitimacy due to absentees and the lack of a more robust discussion. Suggestions were made to refer the bill to the **Education Funding Commission** for further review.

5. **Contextual Concerns**: Members discussed the **local property tax burden** for education funding, the need for **special education funding reform**, and the state’s historical reliance on the general fund for education during financial crises. The **Connelly case**, which addressed school funding adequacy, was also referenced as a critical factor in ongoing education funding discussions.

The session concluded with plans for further discussion on Thursday, acknowledging the need for a more comprehensive review of the bill’s implications.
