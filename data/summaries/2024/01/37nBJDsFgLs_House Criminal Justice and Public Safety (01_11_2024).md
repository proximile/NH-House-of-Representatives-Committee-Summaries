**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (January 11, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 11, 2024, to discuss several key pieces of legislation related to criminal justice, public safety, and individual rights. The meeting centered on debates surrounding the restoration of rights for convicted felons, constitutional protections, transparency in public spaces, and the prevention of mandatory digital identification systems. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Restoration of Rights for Convicted Felons (House Bill 1619)**

The meeting opened with a focus on **House Bill 1619**, which seeks to clarify the restoration of rights for convicted felons, including the right to **bear arms**. Key points included:

- **Restoration of Rights**: The bill aims to address inconsistencies in **RSA 607-A**, which governs the restoration of rights upon discharge, such as voting, holding public office, serving on a jury, and bearing arms. Testimony highlighted confusion over the issuance of certificates of discharge and the specific rights restored.
- **Federal vs. State Law**: The interplay between state and federal law was a significant concern, particularly under **18 USC 922**, which prohibits felons from possessing firearms unless their rights are restored under state law. The bill seeks to align state law with federal requirements to prevent legal challenges.
- **Safety and Fiscal Concerns**: The **Department of Corrections** opposed the bill, citing increased safety risks for probation and parole officers if individuals under supervision are allowed to carry firearms. The department also raised fiscal concerns, estimating the need for additional staff to comply with the bill’s requirements.
- **Constitutional Debate**: Representatives discussed the distinction between the **right to bear arms** (protected by the Second Amendment) and the **privilege to carry firearms** (requiring a license). Critics argued the bill could lead to dangerous situations, while supporters contended it would prevent unnecessary litigation.
- **Recidivism and Rehabilitation**: Questions were raised about the **rate of recidivism** among felons, particularly those convicted of violent crimes, and whether allowing them to carry firearms would hinder rehabilitation efforts.
- **Subcommittee Formation**: A subcommittee was appointed to further review the bill, with a report expected in two weeks.

### **2. Constitutional Rights and Transparency**

The meeting also addressed several bills aimed at protecting constitutional rights and ensuring transparency:

- **License to Carry vs. Constitutional Rights**: A representative emphasized the distinction between a **license to carry firearms** for security professionals and the **constitutional right to bear arms** for personal use. They criticized states like Massachusetts for imposing fees on constitutional rights, citing the 1943 Supreme Court case *Murdoch v. Pennsylvania*.
- **Jury Trials for Minor Offenses**: Representative Jason Gard introduced a bill to ensure individuals charged with minor offenses (over $20) have the right to a jury trial. The bill includes a $500 fee for defendants found guilty to prevent frivolous trials. Gard shared personal experiences of being arrested during COVID-19 for anti-mask and vaccine protests, highlighting the importance of public trials and jury nullification.
- **Whistleblower Protection**: Gard proposed a bill to protect whistleblowers from harassment by state or federal officials, citing examples like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. The bill aims to prevent extradition attempts and ensure whistleblowers can safely expose corruption.
- **Recording in Public Buildings**: Gard introduced a bill affirming the right to videotape and audio record in publicly accessible areas of public buildings, including federal courthouses. He argued that New Hampshire retains concurrent jurisdiction over federal lands and buildings, emphasizing the importance of transparency in public proceedings. Concerns were raised about balancing transparency with privacy, particularly in family court proceedings.

### **3. Recording in Public Buildings (House Bill 1455)**

**House Bill 1455**, which pertains to recording in publicly accessible areas of public buildings, sparked significant debate:

- **Broad Language Concerns**: The **Municipal Association** opposed the bill, arguing its language is overly broad and could allow recording in sensitive areas like bathrooms or locker rooms. They suggested refining the bill to target specific areas, such as federal courts.
- **First Amendment Considerations**: Representatives debated the balance between public transparency and privacy rights, with some arguing that recording in public spaces is already protected under the First Amendment.
- **Sensitive Areas**: Concerns were raised about recording in places like **county nursing homes** and **correctional facilities**, where residents and staff have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
- **Federal vs. State Jurisdiction**: The discussion highlighted the complexities of federal and state jurisdiction, particularly in buildings where both entities operate concurrently.

### **4. Prohibiting Mandatory Digital Identification (House Bill 1535)**

**House Bill 1535**, which addresses the prohibition of mandatory participation in digital identification systems, was also discussed:

- **Social Credit System Concerns**: The bill’s sponsor expressed concerns about the potential development of a **social credit system** and sought to prevent mandatory participation in digital identification systems, especially for vulnerable populations reliant on public benefits.
- **Biometrics and Privacy**: The bill aims to restrict the collection of biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition) and prevent the creation of a **national ID system**. It also seeks to stop practices like scanning IDs at stores, which could lead to tracking and profiling.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The Department of Corrections estimated significant costs to implement voting facilitation for inmates, but the sponsor argued that the process could be simplified and made more cost-effective.

### **5. Voting Rights for Inmates**

A separate discussion focused on restoring voting rights to incarcerated individuals:

- **Voting Rights Restoration**: The bill proposes allowing incarcerated individuals to vote, aligning with practices in states like Maine and Vermont. However, it specifies that inmates should vote in their last established residence to avoid skewing local elections.
- **Federal vs. State Authority**: Questions arose about whether the governor has the authority to restore rights for federal convictions, with the sponsor asserting that federal law defers to state decisions in such cases.

---

### **Key Themes**

- **Transparency vs. Privacy**: The debate centered on balancing public transparency (e.g., recording public officials) with the protection of privacy in sensitive areas.
- **Civil Liberties**: Both bills emphasized protecting individual rights, whether through limiting digital surveillance or restoring rights to convicted individuals.
- **Jurisdictional Issues**: Discussions highlighted the complexities of federal and state jurisdiction, particularly in cases involving public buildings and the restoration of rights for federal convictions.

The meeting concluded with the committee considering amendments to refine the language of both bills to address concerns raised during testimony.
