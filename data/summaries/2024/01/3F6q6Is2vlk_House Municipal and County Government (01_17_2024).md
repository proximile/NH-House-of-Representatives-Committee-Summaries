The New Hampshire House Municipal and County Government Committee convened on January 17, 2024, to discuss a range of bills addressing local governance, transparency, homelessness, renewable energy, and municipal operations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills covered during the meeting:

---

### **1. House Bill 1105: Clarifying Local Tax Caps**
Sponsored by Representative Diane Power, **HB 1105** seeks to address ambiguities in the application of local tax caps. The bill clarifies that the "budget" for tax cap purposes includes not only operating budgets but also all warrant articles with appropriations. This aims to prevent misinterpretations that exclude certain expenditures, such as warrant articles, from the cap.  
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill was prompted by a case in the Brookline School District, where warrant articles were initially included in the tax cap calculation but later excluded, leading to a proposed tax effort exceeding the cap.
  - Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA), raised concerns about the use of the term "appropriation," suggesting it could cause confusion. They recommended focusing on "amounts raised by taxation" instead.
  - The bill does not introduce new enforcement mechanisms but relies on governing bodies to comply with the clarified law.
  - Amendments were suggested to align the bill with existing statutory definitions and avoid unintended consequences.

### **2. House Bill 1461: Live Streaming Municipal Meetings**
Sponsored by Representative Pope Damon, **HB 1461** mandates the live streaming and recording of all properly noticed municipal meetings to improve transparency, accessibility, and accountability.  
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to benefit seniors, parents, and individuals with physical limitations by allowing them to observe public meetings without attending in person.
  - Funding mechanisms include warrant articles and state reimbursement, with exemptions for municipalities facing technological challenges.
  - Concerns were raised about unfunded mandates, broadband access in rural areas, and the feasibility of live streaming in resource-limited communities.
  - Amendments proposed extending the time for posting recordings from 72 hours to 5 days and ensuring compliance with the Right-to-Know law (RSA 91-A).

### **3. House Bill 1544: Addressing Homelessness**
**HB 1544** allows municipalities to designate public property for temporary shelter use while reducing liability for negligence.  
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to provide safer, more manageable locations for homeless individuals, addressing concerns about unsanitary conditions in current encampments.
  - Liability and litigation were major discussion points, with the bill seeking to reduce municipalities' legal risks.
  - Questions were raised about public health standards, definitions of "temporary" and "homeless," and the bill's applicability to undocumented immigrants.
  - The New Hampshire Association for Justice opposed the bill, arguing it creates a two-tier system for duty of care and could lead to prolonged litigation.
  - Amendments were considered to address concerns, but opponents remained skeptical about resolving fundamental issues.

### **4. House Bill 1223: Budget Committee Roles**
**HB 1223** clarifies the role of governing body members on municipal budget committees.  
- **Key Points**:
  - Opposition was expressed due to the absence of the billâ€™s sponsor to address concerns.
  - Discussion centered on crafting an amendment to include a local option, allowing municipalities to maintain or modify their budget committee structures as desired.
  - The NHMA indicated it would remain neutral if the bill provided clear, enactable local options.

### **5. House Bill 1478: Dual Service Restrictions**
Sponsored by Representative Roy, **HB 1478** prohibits individuals from serving on both a local select board (or other municipal governing body) and a school board within the same jurisdiction.  
- **Key Points**:
  - There was no significant discussion on the bill, though it was noted that it might overlap with another bill being worked on by Representative Bilsbury.

### **6. House Bill 1124: Conflicts of Interest**
Introduced by Representative Spillsbury, **HB 1124** aims to limit conflicts of interest and the concentration of power among municipal board and committee members.  
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill proposes restrictions on the number of boards or committees an individual can serve on, particularly for full-time municipal employees and elected officials.
  - The discussion highlighted the need for diverse voices in local governance and the challenges of recruiting volunteers for municipal boards.

### **7. House Bill 1396: Municipal Inspections**
Sponsored by Representative Alexander, **HB 1396** prohibits municipal inspections of owner-occupied units in multi-unit housing with four units or less.  
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill is framed as a property rights and privacy issue, emphasizing that government should not intrude into private homes.
  - Concerns were raised about potential risks to other residents in the building if inspections are not conducted.

### **8. House Bill 1641: Solar Canopies in Parking Lots**
Sponsored by Representative Rebecca McWilliams, **HB 1641** mandates the installation of solar canopies in large parking lots (80+ spaces), with stricter deadlines for lots with 400+ spaces.  
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to promote renewable energy, reduce carbon footprints, and utilize existing infrastructure efficiently.
  - Benefits include energy savings, support for EV charging infrastructure, and preservation of undeveloped land.
  - Concerns were raised about upfront costs, snow accumulation in northern climates, glare near airports, and water runoff issues.
  - Opponents, including the NHMA, argued the bill imposes unfunded mandates and suggested incentivizing solar installations on rooftops or fields instead.
