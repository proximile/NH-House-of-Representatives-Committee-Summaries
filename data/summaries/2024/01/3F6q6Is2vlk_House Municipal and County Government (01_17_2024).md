The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 17, 2024, focused on several key legislative bills and amendments related to municipal and county government, addressing issues such as transparency, tax caps, renewable energy, and governance. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Transparency and Record-Keeping**
- **HB 1461**: This bill mandates live streaming and recording of all publicly posted municipal meetings to enhance transparency and accessibility. Proponents, including Representative Damon, argued that live streaming benefits the elderly, parents, and individuals with disabilities. Concerns were raised about costs, technological challenges, and the definition of accessibility, particularly in rural areas with limited infrastructure. The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) expressed worries about compliance costs, though the bill includes provisions for state reimbursement.
- **HB 1708**: This bill encourages municipalities to digitize and upload public records to a state-hosted website, reducing the burden of Right-to-Know requests. It funds the Local Government Records Manager position within the State Archives to oversee the process. Benefits include increased transparency and cost savings for municipalities. Concerns were raised about logistics, cybersecurity, and potential unfunded mandates. The bill does not mandate participation but incentivizes municipalities to upload records, with amendments suggested to clarify definitions and address implementation challenges.

### **Tax Caps and Budgeting**
- **HB 1105**: This bill clarifies the application of local tax caps by ensuring all warrant articles with appropriations are included in the tax cap calculation. Representative Diane Power introduced the bill to address inconsistencies in towns and school districts that misinterpret the statute (RSA 32:5-b). The NHMA supported the intent but suggested refining the language to focus on "amounts raised by taxation" rather than all appropriations. The discussion emphasized the importance of clarity in statutory language to ensure consistent application across municipalities.

### **Renewable Energy and Urban Planning**
- **HB 1641**: This bill requires large parking lots (over 80 spaces) to install solar canopies to promote renewable energy and efficient land use. Representative Rebecca McWilliams highlighted benefits such as energy savings, reduced urban heat, and integration with EV chargers. Concerns were raised about costs, enforcement, and local control, with opponents arguing it imposes unfunded mandates. Proponents countered that the long-term benefits outweigh initial costs, citing examples from France and New York City.
- **HB 1640**: Similar to HB 1641, this bill mandates solar canopies on parking lots but includes stricter deadlines for larger lots. Critics raised concerns about cost, practicality, and enforcement, while proponents emphasized the potential for EV charging revenue to offset installation costs. The bill was opposed by organizations like the NHMA and the New Hampshire Association of Counties due to high costs and impracticality.

### **Governance and Conflict of Interest**
- **HB 1124**: This bill aims to limit conflicts of interest and concentration of power by restricting individuals from serving on multiple municipal boards or committees. It prohibits full-time municipal employees from serving on certain boards and limits elected officials to one additional volunteer board. The bill seeks to ensure diverse voices in municipal decision-making but faced concerns about enforcement, particularly in smaller towns where finding volunteers is challenging.
- **HB 1223**: This bill clarifies the role of governing body members on municipal budget committees. The NHMA opposed the bill as written but suggested a local option amendment to allow flexibility for municipalities.
- **HB 1478**: This bill prohibits individuals from serving on both a local select board and a school board in the same jurisdiction. The discussion was brief, with potential overlap noted with other proposed legislation.

### **Homelessness and Liability**
- **HB 1544**: This bill aims to reduce liability for municipalities providing temporary shelter or aid to homeless individuals on public property. Supporters argued it would encourage municipalities to offer more emergency housing options, while opponents raised concerns about public health and safety standards. The bill maintains local control, allowing municipalities to designate areas for temporary shelter without mandating it.

### **Public Safety and Property Rights**
- **HB 1396**: This bill prohibits municipal inspections of owner-occupied units in multi-unit housing (up to four units). Proponents argued it protects property and privacy rights, while opponents expressed concerns about public safety and health risks, such as infestations or structural hazards affecting neighboring units.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the tension between increasing transparency, promoting renewable energy, and ensuring good governance, while addressing practical challenges such as costs, enforcement, and local control. Representatives expressed support for the bills' goals but sought further clarity on implementation and potential unintended consequences. Amendments were suggested to refine the language and address concerns raised by stakeholders, including the NHMA and other advocacy groups. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing state mandates with local autonomy to achieve effective and equitable solutions.
