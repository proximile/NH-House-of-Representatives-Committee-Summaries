**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 26, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 26, 2024, focused on legislative proposals related to healthcare licensing, regulatory efficiency, and public safety, particularly concerning nursing and medical professionals. The discussions revolved around several key bills and amendments, with a strong emphasis on balancing administrative streamlining with the need to uphold professional standards and protect vulnerable populations.

### **Key Discussions and Decisions:**

#### **1. House Bill 1410: Nurse Practice Act and Licensing Reforms**
The meeting began with a detailed discussion of **House Bill 1410**, which aims to amend the Nurse Practice Act and streamline administrative functions within the Office of Professional Licensing and Certification (OPLC) and the Board of Nursing. Key points included:
- **Transfer of Responsibilities**: The bill proposes transferring certain administrative tasks, such as licensing and renewals, from the Board of Nursing to the OPLC to improve efficiency and reduce processing times.
- **Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs)**: A major focus was on the licensing and certification of LNAs. The bill initially proposed eliminating state-specific LNA licensing in favor of reliance on a federal registry, which would remove state fees but raised concerns about maintaining training standards, scope of practice, and background checks.
- **Background Checks**: The committee debated the removal of state-mandated background checks for LNAs, as the federal registry does not require them. Concerns were raised about potential risks to vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, if employers were solely responsible for conducting background checks. Ultimately, the committee decided to retain the background check requirement for LNAs.
- **Board of Nursing Membership**: The bill proposed reducing the Board of Nursing from 13 to 7 members. Stakeholders expressed concerns about losing expertise and maintaining quorum, leading the committee to retain the current membership structure.
- **Collaboration Between OPLC and the Board**: The discussion highlighted the collaborative efforts between the OPLC and the Board of Nursing to set criteria and ensure efficient licensing processes, with the Board retaining authority over eligibility criteria.

#### **2. Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy**
The committee addressed licensing requirements for medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals. After considering testimony and the potential impact on public safety, the committee decided to retain these licensing requirements, removing language from the bill that would have repealed them. It was confirmed that the advisory board overseeing these fields is fully functional and provides necessary guidance.

#### **3. Medical Technicians**
The committee discussed the registration and licensing of medical technicians, who are often unlicensed workers in healthcare facilities. The current system was described as dysfunctional due to the lack of a functioning board to oversee disciplinary actions. The committee voted to repeal the registration requirement for medical technicians, effectively eliminating the need for registration.

#### **4. Cleanup and Technical Adjustments**
The committee identified several "cleanup" items in the bill, such as redundant language and technical inconsistencies, which were set aside for further review. Plans were made to schedule a subcommittee meeting to finalize these amendments and prepare a comprehensive update for the full committee.

### **Themes and Outcomes**
- **Public Safety and Professional Standards**: Throughout the meeting, the committee prioritized maintaining high standards for healthcare professionals, particularly in light of the potential risks to vulnerable populations. Decisions to retain background checks and licensing requirements for LNAs and medical imaging professionals reflected this commitment.
- **Regulatory Efficiency**: The committee sought to streamline administrative processes where possible, such as transferring responsibilities to the OPLC and repealing dysfunctional registration requirements for medical technicians.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The discussions highlighted the importance of collaboration between the OPLC, the Board of Nursing, and other stakeholders to ensure that regulatory changes are both efficient and effective.
- **Future Steps**: The committee outlined a process for finalizing the bill, including scheduling a subcommittee meeting to address cleanup items and prepare amendments for the full committee's consideration.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing workforce needs, regulatory efficiency, and public safety in healthcare licensing. The committee moved to accept certain sections of the bill while continuing to deliberate on more contentious issues, with a focus on ensuring that all changes are properly vetted and aligned with the committee's priorities.
