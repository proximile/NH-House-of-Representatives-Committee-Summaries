### Comprehensive Summary of NH House Executive Departments and Administration Meeting (01/26/2024)

The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on January 26, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on several key issues related to healthcare professional licensing, registration, and regulatory oversight. The meeting focused primarily on **Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs)**, **medical technicians**, and **radiologic technologists**, with a strong emphasis on balancing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and public safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

#### **1. Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs): Licensing vs. Registration**
A central theme of the meeting was the debate over whether to retain the **licensing system** for LNAs or transition to a **registry-based system**. Key points included:
   - **Licensing and Professional Identity**: LNAs expressed that licensing is integral to their professional identity and historical record. Removing licensing could diminish their sense of professionalism and recognition within the healthcare system.
   - **Background Checks**: Under the current licensing system, LNAs undergo criminal background checks, which are crucial for ensuring the safety of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly. The registry system, however, would shift the responsibility for background checks to employers, raising concerns about consistency and oversight. The Board of Nursing noted that **81% of LNA applications involve criminal background concerns**, highlighting the importance of this safeguard.
   - **Cost and Workforce Concerns**: LNAs are among the lowest-paid healthcare workers, and the financial burden of licensing fees was a significant issue. Proponents of the registry system argued that it would streamline processes and reduce costs, potentially encouraging workforce growth. However, the committee emphasized that safety should not be compromised for the sake of cost savings.
   - **Federal Compliance**: The **Licensed Nursing Assistant (LNA) registry** is federally mandated, and the committee discussed how changes to state licensing requirements would align with federal regulations (42 CFR). The registry would still require LNAs to complete Board of Nursing-approved training and competency evaluations, but without a state-level background check.
   - **Medication Nursing Assistants (MNAs)**: MNAs, who must first be LNAs, would face complications if the LNA licensing requirement were removed. The registry system would still allow for MNA qualifications, but the change could create administrative challenges.

   **Outcome**: The committee voted to **eliminate Section 1** of the bill, which proposed removing the LNA licensing requirement, and related parts of **Section 10**. This decision ensures that the current licensing system remains in place while further reforms are explored, possibly through a separate bill led by Representative Grotta.

#### **2. Board of Nursing and Administrative Efficiency**
The committee discussed the **Board of Nursing**'s role and the transfer of certain administrative functions to the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**:
   - **Powers and Duties**: The bill proposed transferring operational tasks, such as licensing exams, renewals, and disciplinary actions, to the OPLC, while the board retains authority over eligibility criteria like education requirements. This change aims to streamline processes and reduce delays.
   - **Membership and Structure**: The committee considered reducing the number of board members but ultimately decided to retain the current structure, noting that the board benefits from diverse expertise and has no issues with quorum.
   - **Efficiency Gains**: OPLC representatives reported that transferring administrative tasks has already improved processing times, with some applications being approved in as little as three business days.

#### **3. Medical Technicians and Radiologic Technologists**
The committee also addressed regulatory issues for **medical technicians** and **radiologic technologists**:
   - **Medical Technicians**: The current system for medical technicians, who may handle controlled substances, was described as dysfunctional due to the lack of a functioning board to handle complaints and disciplinary actions. Proposals included eliminating the board and allowing the OPLC to adjudicate issues.
   - **Radiologic Technologists**: Concerns were raised about repealing sections of the bill related to the licensing of radiologic technologists and medical imaging professionals. The committee ultimately voted to **remove these sections**, maintaining the current licensing requirements to ensure public safety.

#### **4. Funding and Process Streamlining**
   - **Dual Process Challenges**: The OPLC highlighted funding allocation challenges caused by the dual process of licensing and registration. Combining these processes could streamline costs and operations.
   - **Federal Funding Restrictions**: The committee noted federal funding restrictions for background checks, which further complicates the financial aspects of regulatory oversight.

---

#### **5. Voting and Next Steps**
   - **Motions and Amendments**: The committee voted on several amendments, including reverting certain sections to current statute, removing redundant language, and eliminating controversial sections like Section 1. Most decisions received unanimous approval.
   - **Future Work**: The committee identified the need for further review and cleanup of **Section 10** and planned to meet again to finalize amendments. They also discussed the possibility of addressing broader nursing reforms in a separate bill.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the complexity of healthcare regulation and the need to balance efficiency, cost, and public safety. While the committee opted to **retain the LNA licensing system** for now, they acknowledged the need for further reforms to streamline processes and support the LNA workforce. Decisions regarding **medical technicians** and **radiologic technologists** reflected a cautious approach, prioritizing public safety and maintaining existing licensing requirements. The committee emphasized the importance of aligning state regulations with federal mandates while ensuring that healthcare professionals are properly vetted and regulated.
