**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 12, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 12, 2024, covered a wide range of topics, reflecting the state’s concerns about historical injustices, sovereignty, federal-state relations, veterans affairs, environmental issues, and constitutional amendments. The discussions were passionate and multifaceted, with a strong emphasis on transparency, accountability, and state autonomy. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions:

---

### **1. Historical Injustice: The USS Liberty Incident**
- **USS Liberty Incident (HB 1041)**: Survivors and advocates of the 1967 attack on the USS Liberty, a U.S. Navy ship attacked by Israeli forces during the Six-Day War, testified about the lack of a thorough federal investigation. They argued that the attack was deliberate, not a case of mistaken identity, and accused the U.S. government of colluding with Israel to cover it up. The survivors called for a state-level commission to uncover the truth, which they believe has been suppressed for over 56 years. While some representatives supported the idea, others noted the limitations of state power in subpoenaing federal records.

### **2. State Sovereignty and Independence**
- **New Hampshire Sovereignty (HB 1130)**: A bill proposing a study commission to explore the economic, legal, and sociological implications of New Hampshire asserting its sovereign rights, including potential independence, was discussed. Advocates argued that the state should prepare for scenarios like a national divorce or the breakup of the United States, citing movements in other states like Texas and California. The bill was framed as a proactive measure to strengthen New Hampshire’s position within the federal system.
- **Constitutional Amendment for Independence (CACR 20)**: Another proposal, CACR 20, sought to amend the state constitution to allow New Hampshire to peacefully declare independence if the U.S. national debt reaches $40 trillion. Supporters cited fiscal irresponsibility, federal overreach, and the erosion of liberties as reasons for secession. Opponents argued that secession is unconstitutional, impractical, and would dishonor the sacrifices of those who fought to preserve the Union. The measure would require a two-thirds majority to pass and be put to voters in November 2024.

### **3. Veterans Affairs and Military Support**
- **State Park Fees for Retired Military (HB 1179)**: This bill aimed to grant complimentary access to New Hampshire state parks for retired members of the Armed Forces, addressing an unintentional gap in current law. The fiscal impact was revised down to approximately $15,200, and the bill received strong support from veterans’ groups.
- **National Guard Recruitment and Retention Bonuses (HB 1355)**: To address recruitment challenges, the bill proposed increasing reenlistment bonuses from $3,000 to $6,000 for non-commissioned officers ineligible for federal bonuses. The program was seen as a way to retain experienced personnel and encourage referrals.
- **Selective Service Enforcement (HB 1338)**: This bill sought to withhold state support for enforcing Selective Service call-ups, repeal related compliance laws, and allow conscientious objectors to notify the Selective Service System when registering for a driver’s license. It was introduced as an anti-war measure, emphasizing state autonomy and opposition to federal conscription.

### **4. Constitutional Amendment to Abolish Slavery (CACR 13)**
- **Purpose and Support**: CACR 13 proposed abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude in New Hampshire, addressing historical and modern-day implications, particularly in the context of prison labor. Advocates, including the ACLU and Black Lives Matter New Hampshire, emphasized the moral imperative to rectify historical injustices and ensure human rights. The amendment received bipartisan support and was seen as a reaffirmation of the principles of freedom and equality.
- **Historical Context**: The discussion referenced the 13th Amendment’s exception clause, which allows for involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime, and highlighted New Hampshire’s history with slavery, including a 1779 petition from enslaved individuals that was ignored by the legislature.

### **5. Environmental Concerns: PFAS Contamination**
- **PFAS Contamination (HR 28)**: Testimonies highlighted the widespread health impacts of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination in communities like Merrimack, where residents have experienced high rates of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other illnesses. Saint-Gobain, a major corporation, was identified as a key contributor to the contamination. The resolution called for federal intervention, cleanup funding, and stricter regulations to address the crisis.
- **Corporate Accountability**: Advocates emphasized the need for corporate accountability and urged the state to ensure that residents are not burdened with the costs of cleanup.

### **6. Federal-State Relations and Other Resolutions**
- **Special Education Funding (HCR 10)**: The resolution urged New Hampshire’s federal delegation to increase funding for special education services, as mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Local school districts have been forced to cover significant costs, often cutting general education programs to fund special education.
- **Taiwan Resolution (HR 20)**: The resolution affirmed the friendship and mutually beneficial relationship between the U.S., including New Hampshire, and Taiwan. It supported Taiwan’s democracy and called for enhanced trade and cultural exchanges, especially in the face of threats from the People’s Republic of China.
- **State Militia (HR 21)**: A resolution affirmed the role of the New Hampshire militia as a state-controlled defense force distinct from the National Guard. The discussion emphasized the need for a state militia to address potential asymmetric threats and protect state sovereignty.
