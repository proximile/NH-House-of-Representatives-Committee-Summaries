**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting on January 16, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on January 16, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on a range of transportation-related bills. The meeting addressed key issues such as vehicle regulations, driver’s license processes, vehicle titling, and commercial activities on public waterways. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Vehicle Regulations and Licensing**
- **House Bill 1062: Special License Plates**  
  This bill proposes allowing state representatives to use legislative license plates on the front of their vehicles while retaining regular plates on the back. The bill aims to facilitate access to the garage during sessions and reduce unnecessary attention. Concerns were raised about administrative clarity and toll system recognition, but the DMV clarified that legislative plates are not integrated into their system, and police officers wouldn’t recognize them during stops.

- **House Bill 1122: Vehicle Lighting Regulations**  
  This bill regulates the use of aftermarket and auxiliary lighting on vehicles, addressing concerns about brightness, color, and safety. It focuses on operational use rather than equipment restrictions, exempting emergency and work vehicles. Discussions clarified that emergency lighting colors (blue for police, red for fire, amber for other vehicles) and aftermarket LED halo lights, which can change colors, are not permitted while driving but may be allowed at car shows.

- **House Bill 1127: Driver’s License Suspensions**  
  This bill addresses the handling of suspended licenses by the DMV and clarifies that operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license applies only to public roads, not private property. The DMV explained that it no longer requires the surrender of suspended licenses except for specific cases like DUI offenses, aligning with the State-to-State program to prevent individuals from holding multiple valid licenses across states.

- **House Bill 1118: Driver’s Licenses for Aliens Temporarily Residing in New Hampshire**  
  This bill seeks to reorganize and clarify the process for issuing driver’s licenses to temporary residents, particularly those without Social Security numbers. The DMV opposed the bill, citing concerns about clarity and unintended consequences, noting that it already issues licenses to individuals without Social Security numbers under specific conditions.

#### **2. Vehicle Titling and Registration**
- **House Bill 1083: Vehicle Titling for Survivors**  
  This bill addresses issues with vehicle titling and registration for surviving spouses, particularly concerning veterans’ plates. The DMV emphasized the importance of removing deceased individuals from titles to prevent fraud, while acknowledging sentimental concerns. Surviving spouses can retain plates for up to 13 months without cost, but veterans’ plates are tied to the individual’s service status.

- **House Bill 1123: Registration of Title-Exempt Vehicles**  
  This bill eliminates the disclosure of personal information beyond name and address for the registration of title-exempt vehicles. No further testimony or questions were raised by the committee.

- **House Bill 1031 and HB 1032: Vehicle Titling Requirements**  
  The committee voted 17-0 to **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)** HB 1031, which proposed a 10-year limit for requiring vehicle titles, arguing that 10 years was too short. They voted 17-0 to recommend **ought to pass (OTP)** for HB 1032, which proposed a 20-year floating period for vehicle titling, deeming it more administratively sensible.

#### **3. Commercial Activities on Public Waterways**
- **House Bill 1158: Exception to Vessel Registration**  
  This bill aims to exempt small, low-powered boats used for minor commercial activities, like selling ice cream, from requiring a commercial license, especially for minors. The bill was introduced to address a “catch-22” situation faced by a 16-year-old constituent who operates a small electric boat to sell ice cream on a lake. The Marine Patrol suggested addressing the issue through existing regulations rather than modifying vessel registration laws, while the DMV noted that tracking such exemptions would require significant software changes.

#### **4. Vehicle Inspections and Safety**
- **House Bill 1391: Vehicle Inspections for New Vehicles**  
  The committee voted 12-5 to recommend **OTP** for this bill, which would allow new vehicles purchased in the current model year or earlier to skip inspections until the second year after purchase. Supporters argued it was a common-sense change that would save time and money, while opponents raised concerns about potential environmental impacts and the lack of data supporting the change.

- **House Bill 1447: Prohibition of Smoke-Emitting Devices on Vehicles**  
  The committee voted 17-0 to **ITL** this bill, citing difficulties in enforcement and associated costs as reasons for opposition.

### **Overall Themes**
- **Administrative Clarity**: Several bills sought to streamline or clarify existing regulations, particularly around license plates, driver’s licenses, and vehicle titling.
- **Safety Concerns**: Discussions emphasized public safety, particularly regarding vehicle lighting and inspections.
- **Fraud Prevention**: The DMV highlighted the importance of removing deceased individuals from vehicle titles and aligning with programs like State-to-State to prevent fraud.
- **Support for Entrepreneurship**: Bills like HB 1158 aimed to support young entrepreneurs by reducing regulatory burdens for minor commercial activities.
- **Fairness and Efficiency**: The committee balanced administrative efficiency, safety, and fairness in their decisions, particularly in discussions about driver’s licenses for temporary residents and vehicle titling requirements.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with votes on several bills and decisions to reschedule others for the next meeting on January 30, 2024. The committee emphasized practicality, data-driven decision-making, and the need to balance regulation with support for residents and public safety.
