### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 1623: State Energy Policy**
1. **Overview**:
   - The bill aims to safeguard New Hampshire’s electrical grid and assert state sovereignty in energy policy, protecting against external regulatory interference and promoting market-driven energy governance.
   - It emphasizes energy reliability and affordability, addressing concerns about the premature shutdown of power generation facilities due to federal regulations.

2. **Concerns and Testimony**:
   - **Criticism**: The bill was criticized for inconsistencies, lack of definitions, and potential conflicts with ISO New England. Stakeholders raised concerns about its focus on dispatchable resources, which could undermine renewable energy investments.
   - **Testimony**:
     - **Molly Connors** (New England Power Generators Association) highlighted the importance of competitive wholesale electricity markets and regional collaboration to address financial challenges faced by power generators.
     - **Nick Croff** (Conservation Law Foundation) argued the bill favors fossil fuels, ignoring their environmental and public health impacts, and misplaces its focus on reliability, which ISO New England already ensures.
     - **Sam Evans Brown** (Clean Energy New Hampshire) warned the bill could deter renewable energy investment and undermine existing efficiency programs like New Hampshire Saves.

3. **Neutral Stance**:
   - The New Hampshire Department of Energy remained neutral but noted potential conflicts with current energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

#### **House Bill 1487: Health Effects of 5G Technology**
1. **Overview**:
   - The bill seeks to implement recommendations from the 2020 5G Commission Report, including:
     - Posting warning signs about RF radiation in public buildings.
     - Labeling 5G antennas with radiation information.
     - Training home inspectors to measure RF radiation and report it to the Department of Environmental Services.
     - Transitioning schools from wireless to hardwired internet connections within five years.

2. **Public Concerns and Testimony**:
   - Residents shared personal experiences of health issues near cell towers, advocating for greater transparency and regulation of RF radiation.
   - A **certified health physicist** opposed the bill, stating that 5G radiation levels are negligible and within safety standards, posing no significant health risks.

3. **Debate**:
   - Supporters emphasized the need for public awareness, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women and children.
   - Critics questioned the practicality, cost, and necessity of the proposed measures, given existing safety standards.

#### **House Bill 1700: Prohibiting Intentional Polluting Emissions**
1. **Overview**:
   - The bill proposes prohibiting intentional polluting emissions, including cloud seeding and weather modification, and requires public notification for such programs.

2. **Debate and Amendments**:
   - Participants debated the need for public disclosure and whether weather modification programs had ever been conducted in New Hampshire.
   - Amendments included a **two-year moratorium** on certain provisions to allow more research and data collection.
   - Concerns were raised about the bill’s potential to disrupt relationships with federal agencies and other states.

3. **Outcome**:
   - Representative Thomas motioned to ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) the bill, citing unresolved uncertainties, and the motion passed 16-3.
