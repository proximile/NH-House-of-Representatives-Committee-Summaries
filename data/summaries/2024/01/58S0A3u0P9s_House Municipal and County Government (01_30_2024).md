### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Municipal and County Government (01/30/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on January 30, 2024, to discuss several key bills aimed at improving local governance, enhancing transparency, and addressing pressing issues such as housing affordability and financial oversight. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

#### **Streamlining Administrative Processes**
1. **HB 1052 - Excavating and Dredging Permit Applications**  
   - Proposed by Representative Jim Majori, this bill seeks to reduce the number of paper copies required for permit applications from four to one, with the addition of a digital copy.  
   - The goal is to streamline the process and reduce administrative burdens.  
   - Committee members debated the impact on communities with limited digital capabilities and discussed an amendment allowing local bodies to choose between digital or paper copies.

2. **HB 1218 - Voting for Municipal Bonds**  
   - Introduced by Representative Kahill, this bill aims to lower the threshold for approving municipal bonds from 60% to a simple majority.  
   - Proponents argued that the current requirement delays critical infrastructure projects, particularly in schools, and increases costs.  
   - Concerns were raised about the financial implications, the importance of voter input, and the potential impact on tax rates.

3. **HB 1125 - Public Notice and Comment at County Meetings**  
   - A bipartisan bill introduced by Representative Anita Burroughs, this legislation mandates public notice and comment at all county commissioner and delegation meetings.  
   - Inspired by an incident in Carroll County where a citizen was silenced, the bill outlines procedures for public participation, including sign-in processes and time limits.  
   - Committee members discussed the logistics of public notice, the scope of public comment, and potential amendments.

#### **Enhancing Local Governance and Accountability**
4. **HB 1242 - Countywide Communications Districts**  
   - This bill simplifies the process for counties to establish Communications Districts, which facilitate broadband networks and partnerships with corporate bodies.  
   - Representative Howard explained that it allows counties to create referendums instead of requiring each town to pass a warrant article, with towns retaining the option to opt out.  
   - The New Hampshire Association of Counties supported the bill, citing its potential to improve broadband access, especially in rural areas.

5. **HB 1302 - Elected Conservation Commissions**  
   - This bill allows towns to elect members of their Conservation Commissions instead of having them appointed by select boards.  
   - Proponents argued that elected commissions increase accountability to voters and prevent select boards from excluding qualified individuals due to personal biases.  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential for elected members to be removed by select boards for "cause," which some argued could undermine the purpose of elections.  
   - The New Hampshire Association of Conservation Commissions opposed the bill, citing potential complications and reduced volunteer participation.

#### **Financial Oversight and Transparency**
6. **Gunstock Mountain Resort (HB 1302 and HB 1414)**  
   - These bills propose changes to the financial oversight of Gunstock Mountain Resort, a county-owned asset in Belknap County.  
   - Key provisions include increasing the percentage of gross revenue Gunstock contributes to the county (from 1.75% to 3%), mandating video recordings of commission meetings, and requiring forensic audits every five years.  
   - Supporters emphasized the need for transparency and accountability, citing past issues such as political contributions made with taxpayer funds.  
   - Opponents, including the Gunstock Area Commission, argued that the bills address non-existent problems and could harm the resort's financial health.  
   - The debate highlighted the need to balance financial oversight with the resort's operational flexibility and self-sufficiency.

#### **Addressing Housing Affordability**
7. **HB 1362 - Rent Stabilization**  
   - This bill allows municipalities to implement rent stabilization ordinances in emergency housing situations, limiting rent increases to no more than 5% annually.  
   - Supporters argued it is a necessary tool to address housing affordability and workforce shortages, emphasizing local control and emergency measures.  
   - Opponents, including developers and real estate representatives, warned that rent stabilization could reduce housing quality and supply, advocating instead for zoning reforms and streamlined permitting processes.  
   - The bill exempts new construction for 15 years and includes provisions ensuring landlords receive a fair return on investment.  
   - The debate highlighted the tension between addressing the housing crisis and protecting landlords' rights.
