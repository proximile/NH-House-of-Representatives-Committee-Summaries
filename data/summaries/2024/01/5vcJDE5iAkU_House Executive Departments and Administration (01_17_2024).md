**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (01/17/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 17, 2024, focused on several key healthcare-related bills, addressing issues ranging from licensing and workforce shortages to specialized therapy and human trafficking education. The discussions highlighted tensions between streamlining processes and maintaining robust oversight to ensure public safety and professional standards. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

---

### **House Bill 1413: Mental Health Licensing**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to repeal outdated and duplicative language in the statute related to licensing for mental health practitioners, specifically concerning unlicensed practice under supervision agreements.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill proposes eliminating the pathway for unlicensed individuals to practice under supervision agreements, which lacks oversight from the Board of Mental Health Practice.
  - It suggests replacing this with a conditional license pathway under the board’s jurisdiction, ensuring clearer oversight and accountability.
  - Concerns were raised about the impact on individuals currently practicing under supervision agreements, particularly in for-profit mental health practices, as nonprofits are exempt.
  - Testimony highlighted the unfairness of the current system, which disadvantages private providers compared to nonprofits.
- **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review to address complexities and align with existing regulations.

### **House Bill 1112: Human Trafficking Education for Healthcare Professionals**
- **Purpose**: The bill mandates that healthcare professionals complete one hour of human trafficking education annually as part of their continuing education requirements.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill reallocates a portion of existing continuing education hours to focus on human trafficking awareness, without adding new costs or hours.
  - Testimony emphasized the importance of educating healthcare providers to recognize and respond to human trafficking, citing examples from states like Florida.
  - Concerns were raised about the necessity of legislative mandates versus allowing professional boards to determine training priorities.
  - The New Hampshire Hospital Association opposed the bill, arguing that training decisions should remain with professional boards.
- **Outcome**: The bill will undergo further review in subcommittees to refine its details and address stakeholder concerns.

### **House Bill 1410: Nursing Oversight and Licensing**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes changes to professional licensing and oversight, particularly for Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) and medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill seeks to eliminate state licensing requirements for LNAs, retaining only federal registration, which would shift criminal background checks and oversight to employers.
  - Critics argued that this could reduce oversight and professional standards, potentially impacting patient safety and workforce morale.
  - Concerns were raised about the financial implications, as current licensing fees do not cover regulatory costs.
  - The bill also proposes repealing licensing requirements for medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals, with stakeholders expressing uncertainty about its impact.
- **Outcome**: The bill is expected to go to a subcommittee for further review, with discussions focusing on public safety, workforce development, and healthcare system impacts.

### **House Bill 1427: Deputy Physicians and Residency Programs**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes creating a pathway for medical school graduates without residency training to become "Deputy Physicians," addressing workforce shortages.
- **Key Points**:
  - Opponents, including the New Hampshire Medical Society and Primary Care Association, argued that the bill would lower standards and risk patient safety.
  - Concerns were raised about the lack of accredited residency programs and the potential for unqualified individuals to practice medicine.
  - Advocates highlighted the growing number of medical graduates unable to secure residencies, suggesting the bill could help fill gaps in underserved areas.
  - Testimony emphasized the importance of residency programs in training competent physicians and the dangers of circumventing this process.
- **Outcome**: Opponents urged the committee to recommend "inexpedient to legislate" to avoid compromising standards and risking public health.

### **House Bill 1394: Music Therapy Certification**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to establish music therapy as a certified allied health profession in New Hampshire.
- **Key Points**:
  - Advocates argued that the lack of certification limits music therapists’ ability to work in healthcare and educational settings and receive insurance reimbursement.
  - Testimonies highlighted the effectiveness of music therapy in treating conditions such as PTSD, autism, speech disorders, and physical rehabilitation.
  - Veterans were cited as a population that could benefit significantly from music therapy.
  - The bill has been introduced multiple times in previous legislative sessions but has not passed. The current version incorporates feedback from stakeholders and aligns with updated Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) statutes.
- **Outcome**: The bill garnered support for its potential to improve access to music therapy services, particularly for vulnerable populations like veterans, and is likely to undergo further discussion in subcommittees.

### **Additional Discussions**
1. **Accessibility of Therapy for Veterans**: Concerns were raised about the difficulty veterans face in accessing therapy, particularly at a location in Jamaica Plain. Remote therapy options were considered, but certain therapies requiring in-person sessions, such as those involving music and motor skills, were noted.
2. **Legislative Language Cleanup**: General Counsel Douglas Sout identified discrepancies in the proposed language of a bill and offered to assist in cleaning up the language. The committee agreed to correct the issues before proceeding.

### **Overall Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of updating licensing regulations, addressing workforce shortages, and expanding access to specialized therapies. While some bills, such as **HB 1413** and **HB 1394**, received cautious support, others, like **HB 1410** and **HB 1427**, faced significant opposition due to concerns about patient safety and professional standards. All bills will undergo further review in subcommittees to refine their details and address stakeholder concerns.
