The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 17, 2024, focused on several key bills addressing professional licensing, healthcare training, and public safety. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

---

### **House Bill 1413: Licensing and Supervision Agreements for Mental Health Professionals**
- **Purpose:** The bill aims to repeal outdated language and streamline the licensing process for mental health professionals by replacing unlicensed supervision agreements with conditional licenses overseen by the Board of Mental Health Practice.
- **Key Points:**
  - Eliminates the pathway for unlicensed practitioners under supervision, ensuring all professionals are subject to board oversight.
  - Addresses administrative challenges and enhances public safety by giving the board jurisdiction over all supervised practitioners.
  - Concerns were raised about the impact on nonprofits, which are currently exempt from supervision agreements.
  - The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review to clarify statutory language and address stakeholder concerns.

### **House Bill 1112: Human Trafficking Awareness Training for Healthcare Providers**
- **Purpose:** The bill mandates one hour of continuing education on human trafficking awareness every two years for healthcare providers as part of their recredentialing process.
- **Key Points:**
  - Does not add additional education hours or costs but reallocates existing requirements to include human trafficking awareness.
  - Aims to improve identification and reporting of trafficking cases, particularly in light of 366 cases reported in New Hampshire through the National Human Trafficking Hotline.
  - Modeled after similar programs in states like Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.
  - Opposition was voiced by the New Hampshire Hospital Association and others, who argued that professional boards should determine training requirements rather than the legislature.

### **House Bill 1410: Changes to Licensing and Nursing Board Structure**
- **Purpose:** The bill proposes significant changes to professional licensing, particularly for Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) and medical imaging professionals, and seeks to streamline regulatory processes.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs):**
    - Proposes replacing LNA licensing with registration, raising concerns about oversight, safety, and professional stature.
    - Opponents argued that licensing ensures accountability and protects public safety, especially in vulnerable settings like long-term care.
    - Workforce impact: Removing licensing could devalue the profession and worsen workforce shortages.
  - **Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy:**
    - Eliminating licensing for medical imaging professionals could lead to unsafe practices, as unqualified operators may expose patients to harmful radiation levels.
    - Licensing ensures that professionals are qualified to operate complex equipment safely.
  - **Board of Nursing:**
    - The bill proposes reducing the board’s size and adjusting membership requirements, which could hinder effective decision-making.
  - **Subcommittee Review:** The bill was referred to a subcommittee to address concerns and explore alternatives.

### **House Bill 1427: Establishment of Deputy Physicians**
- **Purpose:** The bill aims to address the shortage of primary care providers by allowing medical school graduates who have not completed residency programs to practice under the supervision of licensed physicians.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Opposition:** Strongly opposed by the New Hampshire Medical Society, New Hampshire Nurses Association, and others, who argue it would lower medical training standards and jeopardize patient safety.
  - **Patient Safety Concerns:** Residency training is essential for developing clinical skills and handling complex cases, particularly for vulnerable populations like older adults.
  - **Residency Shortage:** The bill does not address the nationwide shortage of residency slots, which is the root cause of the physician shortage.
  - **Alternative Solutions:** Expanding the role of nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) or increasing funding for residency programs were suggested as better solutions.
  - **Experience from Missouri:** Missouri’s similar program faced challenges, including difficulties in securing malpractice insurance and reimbursement for Deputy Physicians.
  - **Conclusion:** The bill was met with strong opposition, with stakeholders urging the committee to prioritize patient safety and invest in expanding residency programs.

### **House Bill 1394: Certification of Music Therapists**
- **Purpose:** The bill aims to certify music therapists in New Hampshire, allowing them to be recognized as allied health professionals and reimbursed by insurance.
- **Key Points:**
  - Music therapy has been used since 1945 in settings like the U.S. military and VA hospitals to aid individuals with disabilities, veterans, and those recovering from brain injuries or PTSD.
  - The bill has been revised to address previous concerns, including language conflicts with RSA 310, and aligns with current state regulations.
  - Testimonies highlighted the positive impact of music therapy, including personal stories of individuals who benefited from the practice.
  - The bill has faced multiple iterations and near-passages in previous sessions but has yet to become law.
