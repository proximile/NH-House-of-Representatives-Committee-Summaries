**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting - House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (01/25/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 25, 2024, addressed a range of topics centered on consumer protection, industry regulations, and transparency across various sectors, including propane and heating fuel, lumber, short-term rentals, and flood risk disclosures. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and legislative proposals from the meeting:

---

### **1. Propane and Heating Fuel Regulations (Segments 1, 2, 3)**
The meeting extensively discussed issues related to propane and heating fuel contracts, focusing on consumer protection and fair business practices. Key points included:
- **Consumer Protection Concerns**: Complaints about propane companies charging rent on tanks consumers own, difficulty canceling contracts, and failing to reimburse pre-buy fees upon cancellation were highlighted. Pre-buy programs, where consumers lock in prices for fuel, were criticized for being a "gamble" due to market fluctuations.
- **Proposed Legislation**:  
  - **HB 1395 (Rep. Rosemary Rung)**: This bill proposes six key changes to protect consumers, including requiring upfront disclosure of all fees, pro-rated reimbursement for pre-buy fees, and a 60-day window for companies to remove tanks after contract cancellation. It also prohibits charging rent on tanks not owned by the dealer.  
  - **Bill by Rep. Terry Spillbury**: Aims to prevent companies from repricing fuel after a customer has prepaid, ensuring the quoted price at the time of payment is honored upon delivery.
- **Industry Perspectives**: Representatives from the propane industry argued that the bill unfairly targets the entire industry due to the actions of a single problematic company (likely AmeriGas). They expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of tank removal and the financial risks of pre-buy programs.
- **Consumer Awareness**: The importance of clear communication in contracts and transparency in pricing was emphasized, along with the need for consumers to know who owns their propane tank and how to switch providers.

### **2. Lumber Advertising Standards (Segment 2)**
- **HB 1033 (Rep. Jason Gard)**: This bill seeks to prohibit the advertising of nominal dimensions of lumber (e.g., a "2x4" that is actually 1.5x3.5 inches), aiming for transparency and truth in advertising.  
  - **Support**: Rep. Gard, a carpenter, argued that consumers should know the actual dimensions of the lumber they purchase.  
  - **Opposition**: Industry representatives, including the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, opposed the bill, stating that nominal dimensions are an industry standard dating back to the 1930s and that changing this would cause significant disruption.

### **3. Oil Pricing and Consumer Protection (Segment 4)**
- The discussion focused on hypothetical scenarios where oil companies offer low prices for future delivery, raising concerns about consumer protection and the feasibility of such offers.  
- The conversation emphasized the importance of protecting consumers from unfair practices while acknowledging the financial and logistical risks for oil companies in holding prices for extended periods.

### **4. Short-Term Rental Regulations (Segment 5)**
- **HB 1498 (Rep. Mea McWilliams)**: Proposes a statewide short-term rental registry to improve transparency, assist law enforcement, ensure safety standards, and enhance tax collection. Concerns were raised about enforcement and the balance between state and local control.  
- **HB 1635 (Rep. Mick Willans)**: Aims to establish a unified definition of "short-term rental" as properties offered for a fee for less than 30 consecutive days, addressing legal ambiguities.  
- **Key Discussions**: Representatives debated the role of inspections, the administrative burden on property owners, and potential conflicts with existing tax laws. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, opposed the bills in their current forms.

### **5. Flood Risk Disclosure in Real Estate (Segments 4, 6)**
- **HB 1320 (Rep. Chris Muns)**: This bill requires sellers and landlords to disclose flood risks, including whether a property is in a flood zone, has flood insurance, or has experienced flood damage.  
  - **Support**: Constituents and experts, including members of the Hampton Coastal Hazard Adaptation Team, emphasized the importance of transparency to protect buyers and renters from unexpected flood risks.  
  - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Association of Realtors and landlords expressed concerns about liability, additional paperwork, and the burden on sellers and landlords.  
  - **Amendments**: The bill was amended to separate rental property disclosures from property sale disclosures, addressing some concerns about clarity and enforcement.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Consumer Protection**: Across all discussions, the focus was on ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in consumer transactions, whether in propane contracts, lumber sales, oil pricing, or real estate disclosures.
2. **Industry Concerns**: Industry representatives consistently highlighted the potential burdens and unintended consequences of proposed regulations, advocating for balanced approaches that address specific issues without over-regulating compliant businesses.
3. **Legislative Refinement**: Many bills were acknowledged as needing further refinement to address conflicts with existing statutes, ensure enforceability, and balance state and local control.
4. **Transparency and Awareness**: A recurring theme was the importance of clear communication and consumer awareness, whether in understanding contract terms, property risks, or product dimensions.
