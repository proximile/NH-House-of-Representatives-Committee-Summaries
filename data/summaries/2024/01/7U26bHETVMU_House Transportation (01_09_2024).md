**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (01/09/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss a range of transportation-related bills, focusing on vehicle safety, emissions testing, personal electric vehicles (PEVs), and motor vehicle titling and registration. The meeting highlighted the need to balance safety, regulatory compliance, and convenience for citizens while addressing evolving transportation technologies and practices.

### **Key Topics and Discussions**

#### **1. Personal Electric Vehicles (PEVs)**
   - **Regulation and Safety**: The growing use of PEVs, such as electric bicycles, scooters, and unicycles, on rail trails and public ways prompted discussions on safety concerns, including speed and pedestrian awareness. Proposals included implementing warning systems, enforcing speed limits, and classifying high-powered PEVs as motorcycles, subjecting them to licensing and safety training.
   - **Enforcement and Accessibility**: The role of local police versus specialized trail enforcement was debated, alongside considerations for accessibility and equity for those relying on PEVs for transportation.
   - **Legislation**: HB 1543 aimed to establish guidelines for the safe operation of PEVs in shared spaces, preventing rail trails from becoming "racetracks" while ensuring PEVs are regulated similarly to bicycles.

#### **2. Vehicle Inspection and Emissions Testing**
   - **Inspection Period for New Vehicles**: A bill proposed extending the first safety inspection period for new vehicles from one to two years. Proponents argued that modern vehicles are safer and more reliable, with a low failure rate (0.1%) during initial inspections. They cited other states, like Rhode Island and Connecticut, that have similar exemptions.
   - **Safety Concerns**: Opponents raised concerns about delaying inspections, as vehicles can accumulate significant mileage in two years, potentially leading to safety issues like worn tires or brake failures. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) emphasized that New Hampshire’s emissions inspection program is federally mandated, and any changes would require EPA approval.
   - **Industry Perspectives**: Representatives from the automotive and rental car industries highlighted the importance of regular maintenance, even without state-mandated inspections.

#### **3. Motor Vehicle Titling and Registration**
   - **Title Exemptions**: Bills HB 1031 and HB 1032 proposed changing the title exemption period for older vehicles. HB 1031 suggested a rolling 10-year exemption, while HB 1032 proposed a 20-year exemption. Proponents argued this would make older vehicles more marketable, reduce abandoned vehicles, and benefit low-income individuals. Opponents raised concerns about fraud, theft, and revenue loss.
   - **Facilitating Interstate Sales**: HB 1044 proposed allowing non-mandatory titling for vehicles older than 2000 and trailers under 3,000 pounds to facilitate interstate sales and disposal of unwanted vehicles.

#### **4. OHRV and Snowmobile Operation with Suspended Licenses**
   - **Penalty Alignment**: HB 1138 sought to align penalties for operating Off-Highway Recreational Vehicles (OHRVs) and snowmobiles with a suspended driver’s license with those for motor vehicles, imposing stricter penalties to deter repeat offenders.

#### **5. Boat Registration and Federal Compliance**
   - **Two-Sticker System**: HB 1304 proposed a two-sticker system for boat registration to separate fees and ensure compliance with federal Coast Guard regulations, preserving $4.1 million in federal funding.

#### **6. Prohibiting Smoke-Emitting Devices on Vehicles**
   - **Enforcement of EPA Regulations**: HB 1447 aimed to enforce federal EPA regulations by prohibiting modifications that release excessive smoke or pollutants from vehicle exhaust systems, addressing "rolling coal" incidents.

### **Key Takeaways**
   - **Safety vs. Convenience**: The meeting underscored the ongoing tension between ensuring safety and reducing regulatory burdens. Discussions on vehicle inspections, PEV regulations, and title exemptions reflected efforts to modernize laws while addressing safety and compliance concerns.
   - **Federal Compliance**: Several bills, including those related to emissions testing and boat registration, highlighted the importance of aligning state regulations with federal mandates to avoid sanctions and preserve funding.
   - **Economic and Accessibility Considerations**: Proposals like extending title exemptions and inspection periods were framed as measures to reduce costs and improve accessibility, particularly for low-income individuals and the motorcycle community.

### **Next Steps**
The committee closed the public hearing on House Bill 1391 and scheduled upcoming meetings for January 16 and 30, with a break on January 23 for Election Day. Further discussions will focus on gathering additional data, addressing stakeholder concerns, and refining proposed legislation to balance safety, compliance, and convenience.
