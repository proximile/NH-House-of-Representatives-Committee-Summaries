The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 22, 2024, focused on several key education-related bills, sparking debates on school choice, communication methods for students with disabilities, emergency medical preparedness, curriculum standards, and governance in Cooperative School Districts. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

#### **1. House Bill 1553 – Spelling to Communicate (S2C) Pilot Project**
- **Purpose**: To establish a pilot program enabling non-speaking or minimally speaking students with autism and apraxia to communicate by pointing to letters on a letter board.
- **Support**: Parents testified that S2C has transformed their children’s lives, allowing them to express complex thoughts and feelings. Advocates emphasized the importance of presuming competence and providing access to education tailored to cognitive abilities.
- **Opposition**: Speech-language pathologists and disability rights advocates raised concerns about the lack of evidence supporting S2C, likening it to discredited facilitated communication methods. They argued it could divert resources from evidence-based assistive technologies and undermine the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
- **Key Concerns**: Independent communication, funding allocation, and the potential exclusion of other evidence-based methods.
- **Outcome**: The committee discussed amendments, including making the program optional for school districts, and moved the bill forward for further consideration.

#### **2. House Bill 1652 – Local Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**
- **Purpose**: To allow local school districts, via a supermajority vote, to use local tax money to fund educational choices, including private schools.
- **Support**: Proponents argued it would expand school choice and could bring students back into public schools.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about fiscal impact, accountability, increased local property taxes, and constitutional issues related to funding religious schools.
- **Key Themes**: School choice, local control vs. state oversight, and constitutional concerns.
- **Outcome**: The bill sparked significant debate, with strong opinions on both sides regarding the balance between innovation, choice, and accountability in education.

#### **3. House Bill 1088 – Stocking Epinephrine Auto-Injectors in Schools**
- **Purpose**: To ensure schools maintain a supply of epinephrine auto-injectors for emergency use, with clear language and uniform procedures.
- **Support**: Advocates highlighted the life-saving potential of having epinephrine readily available, especially for students with severe allergies.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about administration protocols, including who can administer the epinephrine and the logistics of managing the supply.
- **Outcome**: The bill received backing from the New Hampshire School Nurse Association and Convenient MD and will proceed to the next legislative steps.

#### **4. House Bill 1691 – Redefining Adequate Education**
- **Purpose**: To emphasize core subjects like English, math, science, and social studies in defining an "adequate education," while still including other subjects like arts and physical education.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that focusing on core subjects is essential for improving low proficiency scores in math and English language arts.
- **Opposition**: Critics contended that a well-rounded education requires more than just core subjects and highlighted the state’s $550 million shortfall in education funding.
- **Key Concerns**: Underfunding public schools, potential cuts to non-core subjects, and the state’s constitutional obligation to provide a robust education.
- **Outcome**: The debate underscored the tension between focusing on core academic subjects and maintaining a well-rounded curriculum.

#### **5. Cooperative School District Governance (HB 1481, HB 1383, HB 1493, HB 1642)**
- **Key Issues**: Discussions centered on voting mechanisms, representation, and the roles of budget committees and school boards in Cooperative School Districts.
- **HB 1481**: Aims to ensure midterm vacancies in at-large Cooperative School Board seats are filled by someone from the same municipality as the outgoing member.
- **HB 1383**: Addresses the election process for Cooperative School Board members, distinguishing between at-large and non-at-large members.
- **HB 1493**: Proposes clarifying the authority of budget committees over warrant articles and supplemental appropriations.
- **HB 1642**: Seeks to change the role of the school board member on the budget committee from a voting member to a non-voting, ex-officio member.
- **Key Concerns**: Fair representation, transparency, accountability, and the balance of power between budget committees and school boards.
- **Outcome**: The New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA) opposed both HB 1493 and HB 1642, suggesting alternative solutions to address governance issues.

#### **6. School Administrative Unit (SAU) Mergers**
- **Purpose**: To incentivize SAUs to merge by offering a $200 per pupil grant for two years, aiming to reduce administrative costs.
- **Discussion**: Representatives debated the feasibility of mergers, especially in smaller communities, and the potential fiscal impact.
- **Key Themes**: Local control, flexibility in funding formulas, and the need for technical and legal amendments.

### **Key Themes Across Discussions:**
1. **School Choice and Funding**: Debates over expanding educational options versus potential financial burdens on public schools and taxpayers.
2. **Evidence-Based Practices**: Discussions on the efficacy and evidence behind educational methods like S2C.
3. **Local Control vs. State Oversight**: Tensions between local decision-making and state-level accountability, particularly regarding funding and educational standards.
