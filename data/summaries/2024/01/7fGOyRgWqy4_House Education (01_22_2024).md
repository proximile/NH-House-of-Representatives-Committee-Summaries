The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 22, 2024, featured extensive discussions on a range of education-related bills, reflecting ongoing debates about school choice, governance, funding, and student support. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

### **School Choice and Funding**
1. **HB 1652 - Local Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**:
   - This bill proposes allowing school districts to establish local EFAs, enabling public education funds to follow students to private or alternative schools. The program would be optional, requiring a supermajority vote for adoption, and funds unused by age 21 would return to the district.
   - **Supporters** argued that the bill empowers families to choose the best educational setting for their children, citing increased satisfaction in districts with school choice programs.
   - **Opponents** raised concerns about the fiscal impact on public schools, the potential diversion of funds to private institutions, and constitutional issues related to funding religious schools.
   - The state EFA program’s higher-than-expected participation was cited as evidence of demand for school choice.

2. **HB 1691 - Definition of an Adequate Education**:
   - This bill seeks to prioritize core subjects (English, math, science, and social studies) in the definition of an adequate education while still including other subjects like arts and physical education.
   - **Supporters** highlighted low proficiency rates in many districts and argued that a stronger focus on foundational skills is necessary to improve student outcomes and workforce readiness.
   - **Concerns** were raised about ensuring a well-rounded education and the ability of graduates to meet the needs of local businesses.

### **Student Support and Special Education**
3. **HB 1553 - Spelling to Communicate (S2C) Pilot Program**:
   - This bill proposes a three-year pilot program to offer S2C services to non-speaking students with autism and apraxia, enabling them to communicate using letter boards.
   - **Supporters** shared personal stories of S2C’s transformative impact, emphasizing its ability to give non-speaking individuals a voice and improve their quality of life.
   - **Opponents**, including speech-language pathologists, questioned the scientific validity of S2C and raised concerns about facilitator bias and the diversion of funds from evidence-based therapies.
   - The bill includes a $125,000 appropriation and allows school districts to opt in.

4. **HB 1088 - Emergency Epinephrine in Schools**:
   - This bill aims to ensure schools maintain a supply of epinephrine auto-injectors for emergency use, particularly for students with severe allergies.
   - **Supporters** highlighted the life-saving potential of epinephrine in schools, with Representative Jodi Nelson sharing a personal story of her son’s near-fatal allergic reaction.
   - The bill provides clear procedures for stocking epinephrine, protects trained staff from liability, and allows for donations if manufacturer programs end.

### **School District Governance and Budgeting**
5. **HB 1493 - Cooperative School District Budget Committees**:
   - This bill seeks to clarify and expand the role of budget committees in reviewing warrant articles and supplemental appropriations, ensuring transparency and proper oversight of expenditures.
   - **Supporters** argued that the bill addresses ambiguities in current law and ensures that budget committees are involved in the authorization process.
   - **Opponents**, including the School Boards Association, contended that budget committees’ responsibilities should remain limited to the operating budget.
   - Discussions highlighted the need for clear statutory language to balance the roles of school boards and budget committees.

6. **HB 1642 - Role of School Board Members on Budget Committees**:
   - This bill proposes changing school board members’ participation on budget committees from voting to non-voting ex officio members.
   - **Supporters** argued this maintains the balance of power and prevents conflicts of interest.
   - **Opponents** countered that voting rights are essential for proper representation and avoiding tied decisions.

7. **HB 1481 and HB 1383 - Cooperative School Board Representation**:
   - These bills address vacancies and elections in Cooperative School Boards, ensuring fair representation and clarifying voting mechanisms.
   - **HB 1481** requires that at-large vacancies be filled by candidates from the same municipality as the outgoing member.
   - **HB 1383** distinguishes between at-large and non-at-large seats, ensuring non-at-large seats are voted on only by residents of the specific municipality they represent.

### **School District Mergers and Funding**
8. **SAU Merger Incentives**:
   - A bill incentivizing the merger of smaller School Administrative Units (SAUs) was discussed, offering a $200 per-student grant for two years to merged districts.
   - **Supporters** argued that merging SAUs would reduce administrative costs and improve efficiency.
   - **Concerns** were raised about the challenges of merging, particularly in rural areas, and the potential need to lower the minimum student population threshold from 1,500 to 1,200.

9. **Alternative Funding Formulas**:
   - Another bill proposed allowing school districts to adopt alternative funding methods for SAU costs, moving away from the state-mandated 50% enrollment, 50% property valuation model.
   - The goal was to provide flexibility for districts with unique tax bases and enrollment situations, emphasizing local control and autonomy.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **School Choice**: Debates around HB 1652 highlighted the tension between expanding educational options for families and protecting public school funding.
- **Student Support**: Bills like HB 1553 and HB 1088 underscored the importance of addressing critical gaps in school-based support systems, from communication methods for non-speaking students to emergency medical interventions.
- **Governance and Transparency**: Discussions on Cooperative School District governance emphasized the need for clear statutory language, fair representation, and effective oversight of financial decisions.
- **Local Control and Efficiency**: The push for SAU mergers and alternative funding formulas reflected broader efforts to balance local autonomy with the need for cost savings and administrative efficiency.

Overall, the meeting showcased the complexities of education policy in New Hampshire, with representatives grappling with issues of equity, accountability, and the evolving needs of students and communities.
