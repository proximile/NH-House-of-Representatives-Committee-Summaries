### **Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services (January 10, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss several labor-related bills, focusing on worker protections, wage increases, remote work policies, and union rights. The meeting featured extensive debates and testimonies from legislators, business representatives, union leaders, and workers. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed:

---

#### **1. House Bill 1178: Earned Time and Vacation Pay**
- **Purpose**: Ensures employees are paid for unused vacation or earned time upon layoff, business closure, or sale, particularly for employers with 15 or more employees.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Proponents argued the bill protects workers from losing earned benefits in unexpected layoffs or business transitions, citing instances where employees lost accrued vacation pay.
  - **Opposition**: Critics, including the Associated General Contractors and the NH Municipal Association, argued the bill duplicates existing laws, imposes unnecessary mandates, and complicates policies for seasonal businesses. They suggested amendments to limit its scope to specific situations like business closures or sales.
  - **Amendment**: An amendment was proposed to clarify that vacation pay is based on employer policies, except in cases of layoffs or sales.

#### **2. House Bill 1322: Minimum Wage Increase**
- **Purpose**: Proposes raising the minimum wage incrementally to $17 by 2029, starting at $9.50 in 2024, and increasing the tipped wage to 50% of the minimum wage.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Rationale**: Sponsors highlighted that New Hampshire’s minimum wage has remained at the federal rate of $7.25 since 2009, while living costs have risen significantly. A living wage in NH is estimated at $17.23/hour.
  - **Support**: Small business owners, community organizers, and religious leaders testified that raising the wage would reduce reliance on government assistance, boost local economies, and improve workers’ quality of life.
  - **Opposition**: Hospitality industry representatives opposed the tipped wage increase, arguing that tipped employees already earn more than the minimum wage with tips and that the change would burden small businesses.
  - **Economic Context**: New Hampshire is the only New England state without a state minimum wage, putting it at a competitive disadvantage in attracting workers.

#### **3. House Bill 10007: Remote Work Policies**
- **Purpose**: Requires employers to clearly outline remote work arrangements in writing and inform employees of applicable labor laws, such as workers’ compensation and breaks.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Proponents argued the bill ensures transparency and protects workers’ rights in the growing trend of remote work.
  - **Opposition**: Critics, including the Business and Industry Association, questioned the need for the bill, noting that many employers already document remote work terms in employee manuals.
  - **Concerns**: Questions arose about enforcing labor laws for out-of-state employers with remote workers in NH. The NH Department of Labor clarified that NH workers’ compensation laws apply regardless of the employer’s location.

#### **4. House Bill 1377: Right to Work**
- **Purpose**: Prohibits mandatory union dues or fees as a condition of employment, allowing workers to opt out of paying union dues even if they benefit from union-negotiated contracts.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Advocates, such as Americans for Prosperity, argued the bill promotes individual freedom and economic growth by making unions more responsive to members and attracting businesses to NH.
  - **Opposition**: Union leaders and workers strongly opposed the bill, arguing it would weaken unions, reduce wages, and harm worker protections. They highlighted unions’ role in providing fair wages, benefits, training, and job security.
  - **Economic Impact**: Opponents cited studies showing that right-to-work states have lower wage growth, higher poverty rates, and worse economic outcomes.
  - **Historical Context**: NH has repeatedly rejected similar legislation over the past 40 years, with opponents framing it as driven by out-of-state interests rather than local needs.

---

#### **5. House Bill 1668: 32-Hour Work Week**
- **Purpose**: Proposes a 32-hour work week with overtime pay for hours beyond that, without a reduction in pay.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Sponsors cited benefits such as increased productivity, reduced burnout, improved work-life balance, and environmental and mental health improvements.
  - **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the feasibility of the bill and its impact on employers, particularly small businesses.

---

#### **General Observations**:
- **Worker Protections vs. Business Flexibility**: The debates highlighted the tension between protecting workers’ rights and maintaining flexibility for employers, particularly small businesses.
- **Economic Context**: Many discussions referenced New Hampshire’s economic challenges, including rising living costs, labor shortages, and the need to attract and retain workers.
- **Union Role**: Union representatives emphasized the value of unions in providing fair wages, benefits, and training, while opponents of union-related bills argued for individual choice and reduced government intervention.
- **Out-of-State Influence**: Several speakers criticized certain bills, particularly HB 1377, as being driven by out-of-state interests rather than the needs of NH residents.

#### **Conclusion**:
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing worker protections with economic growth and business flexibility. Key themes included the need for transparency in remote work arrangements, the importance of fair wages and benefits, and the ongoing debate over the role of unions in the workforce. The discussions will continue in future sessions, with potential amendments to address concerns raised during the meeting.
