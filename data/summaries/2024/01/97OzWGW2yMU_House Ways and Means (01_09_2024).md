**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Ways and Means Committee, January 9, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss several key bills and a constitutional amendment, focusing on taxation, public safety, and community services. The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing fiscal responsibility, municipal needs, and the impact of tourism on local communities. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Local Option for Public Safety Assessment on Hotel Occupancies (HB 1254)**
The committee extensively debated **HB 1254**, which proposes allowing municipalities to impose a nightly occupancy fee on hotel rooms to fund public safety services strained by tourism. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to offset costs for police, fire, EMS, and wastewater services in tourist-heavy towns, reducing the burden on local property taxpayers.
- **Fee Structure**: Discussions suggested a fee of $1 to $2 per room night, with municipalities having the autonomy to decide whether to implement it and how much to charge.
- **Support**: Representatives from tourist towns like Portsmouth and Conway emphasized the disproportionate burden of tourism-related costs and the need for additional funding. They argued the fee would not deter tourism, as similar fees are common in other states.
- **Concerns**: Hospitality industry representatives opposed the bill, citing potential burdens on lodging businesses and visitors. Some committee members worried about the bill’s vague language, which could allow funds to be diverted to non-public safety uses.
- **Next Steps**: The committee acknowledged the need for tighter wording and planned a work session to refine the bill.

### **2. Reduction in State Meals Tax (HB 1)**
The committee also discussed **HB 1**, which proposes a 1% reduction in the state meals tax while ensuring municipalities retain their 30% share. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The reduction aims to provide financial relief to residents and stimulate the economy by encouraging dining out.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the reduction would benefit working families and leave the rooms and car rental taxes unchanged, as these primarily affect out-of-state visitors.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives suggested exploring a local option for towns to impose their own meals and rooms tax. Others debated whether the bill should cover both meals and rooms or remain focused solely on meals.

---

### **3. Meals and Rooms Tax Exemption for Meals on Wheels (HB 1191)**
The committee reviewed **HB 1191**, which seeks to exempt the Meals on Wheels restaurant voucher program from the meals and rooms tax. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The program allows seniors to dine at local restaurants using preloaded cards, promoting socialization and reducing isolation.
- **Support**: Meals on Wheels representatives highlighted the program’s effectiveness and argued that the tax exemption would allow more funds to be reinvested into the program.
- **Concerns**: The Department of Revenue Administration noted potential administrative challenges, and committee members raised questions about scalability and funding sources.

### **4. Constitutional Amendment to Tax Religious Organizations (CACR 18)**
The committee held a public hearing on **CACR 18**, a proposed constitutional amendment to remove tax exemptions for religious organizations. Key points included:
- **Arguments in Favor**: Supporters argued that tax exemptions for religious organizations divert resources from public services and blur the lines between church and state.
- **Arguments Against**: Opponents, including religious leaders, emphasized the charitable work done by churches and raised constitutional concerns about violating the First Amendment.
- **Next Steps**: The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issue and scheduled a work session for further deliberation.

### **5. Changes to Meals and Rooms Tax (HB 1515)**
The committee discussed **HB 1515**, which proposes changes to the state’s meals and rooms tax. Key points included:
- **Surplus Concerns**: Representatives noted the decline in the state’s surplus and the impact of a 10% drop in business taxes.
- **Constituent Struggles**: Constituents’ struggles with rising costs of living, including food, gas, and property taxes, were highlighted, with calls for tax relief.
- **Municipal Impact**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association emphasized the importance of meals and rooms tax revenue in reducing local property taxes.
- **Tourism Taxation**: Some representatives suggested shifting the tax burden more toward the tourism industry rather than residents.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
1. **Tourism’s Impact on Public Safety**: Tourist towns face unique challenges, including high public safety costs and a lack of affordable housing for workers. HB 1254 seeks to address these issues through a local occupancy fee.
2. **Tax Relief for Residents**: Bills like HB 1 and HB 1515 aim to provide financial relief to residents by reducing the meals tax and ensuring municipalities receive their share of revenue.
3. **Community Services**: HB 1191 and CACR 18 highlight the importance of supporting community services, whether through tax exemptions for programs like Meals on Wheels or debates over taxing religious organizations.
4. **Fiscal Responsibility**: The committee emphasized the need for sustainable funding mechanisms, addressing concerns about the state’s surplus and the long-term fiscal impact of proposed tax changes.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to refine the bills through work sessions and further discussions, ensuring they effectively address the needs of municipalities, residents, and the state as a whole.
