#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1177: Expanding Electronic Filing for Domestic Violence Survivors**  
   - The bill aims to expand electronic filing options for domestic violence survivors in state courts. While the judicial branch supports the gradual transition to e-filing, concerns were raised about the high costs and the need to maintain paper filing options for individuals without internet access.  
   - The bill passed unanimously after a motion to deem it "inexpedient to legislate" was rejected.

2. **House Bill 1214: Restorative Justice for Juvenile Misdemeanors and Hate Crimes**  
   - This bill proposes a study committee to explore restorative justice models for juvenile misdemeanors and hate crimes. The sponsor highlighted successful peer-led programs like Howard County’s Teen Court.  
   - Concerns were raised about ensuring qualified facilitators and addressing potential biases in restorative justice practices.

3. **House Bill 1344: Criminalizing Enticement and Manipulation of Minors**  
   - The bill seeks to criminalize the enticement and manipulation of minors into sexual activity, both online and in person. Law enforcement emphasized the rise in sextortion cases and the need for broader legal tools to prosecute offenders.  
   - Questions were raised about enforcement and potential constitutional issues.

4. **House Bill 1500: Addressing Misuse of Synthetic Media and AI**  
   - This bill requires disclosure when AI is used in media and consent from individuals depicted, prompted by incidents like AI-generated robocalls mimicking President Biden.  
   - Concerns were raised about free speech implications, enforcement challenges, and the need to avoid unintended consequences for legitimate uses of AI. Amendments were proposed to narrow the scope and clarify definitions.

5. **House Bill 279 (Elizabeth Croak Law): Penalties for Over-Serving Alcohol**  
   - Named after Elizabeth Croak, who died due to an intoxicated driver over-served at multiple establishments, the bill increases penalties for over-serving alcohol.  
   - Provisions include higher fines (up to $7,500), extended license suspensions (up to 30 days), and public notification of suspensions.  
   - While the bill incentivizes training for alcohol servers, some argued for mandatory training to ensure accountability. The hospitality industry expressed concerns about the financial impact on small businesses.

6. **House Bill 1137: Electronic Filing of Domestic Violence and Stalking Petitions**  
   - This bill proposed mandatory electronic filing for domestic violence and stalking petitions to improve efficiency and data tracking.  
   - Advocacy groups raised concerns about accessibility and safety for victims, particularly those with limited technology access or safety risks.  
   - The committee voted to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), with plans to revisit the issue with revised language.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Domestic Violence and Survivor Safety**: Multiple bills addressed domestic violence, emphasizing the need for accessible filing options (both electronic and paper) and ensuring survivor safety. The committee prioritized balancing efficiency with accessibility and protection for vulnerable populations.

- **Restorative Justice**: The potential for restorative justice models for juveniles was explored, with a focus on peer-led programs and addressing biases in implementation.

- **Alcohol Service and Public Safety**: The Elizabeth Croak Law highlighted the need for accountability in alcohol service, with discussions on training, penalties, and their impact on businesses. While the bill was seen as a positive step, some called for stricter measures, including mandatory training.

- **AI and Synthetic Media**: The misuse of AI, particularly in creating deep fake videos and misinformation, was a major concern. Legislators debated the balance between regulating harmful uses of AI and protecting free speech and legitimate applications. Amendments were proposed to clarify definitions and scope.

- **Enforcement and Practicality**: Across all bills, questions were raised about enforcement, constitutional implications, and the practical challenges of implementation. Testimony from law enforcement, advocacy groups, and industry representatives provided valuable insights into these issues.

#### **Outcomes and Next Steps**

- **Passed Bills**: House Bill 1177 (electronic filing for domestic violence survivors) and House Bill 279 (Elizabeth Croak Law) were passed, with potential amendments to be considered in the Senate.
- **Tabled Bills**: House Bill 1137 (mandatory electronic filing for domestic violence petitions) was tabled (ITL) due to accessibility concerns, with plans to revisit the issue.
- **Ongoing Discussions**: Bills addressing AI misuse (HB 1500) and restorative justice (HB 1214) will likely undergo further refinement to address concerns about scope, enforceability, and unintended consequences.

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing complex issues in criminal justice and public safety, balancing innovation and accountability with the need to protect vulnerable populations and uphold constitutional rights.
