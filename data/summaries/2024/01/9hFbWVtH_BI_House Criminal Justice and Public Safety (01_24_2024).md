The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held a meeting on January 24, 2024, to discuss several key bills addressing public safety, criminal justice, and the regulation of emerging technologies. The discussions centered on issues ranging from alcohol service and domestic violence protections to juvenile restorative justice and the regulation of synthetic media and artificial intelligence (AI). Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points and debates from the meeting:

### Alcohol Service and Training
1. **Training Programs**: Representatives examined the effectiveness of alcohol service training programs like TIPS (Training for Intervention Procedures), emphasizing the importance of understanding liability and state laws to prevent over-serving and recognize signs of intoxication.
2. **Compliance and Enforcement**: The committee highlighted the responsibility of establishments to verify the legal drinking age of patrons, even in group settings. Regular compliance checks and investigations were noted, with penalties for violations, including fines and license suspensions.
3. **Penalties for Over-Serving (HB 279)**: The "Elizabeth Croke Law" proposed increasing penalties for establishments that over-serve alcohol, particularly in cases resulting in serious injury or death. Fines would rise from $2,500 to $7,500, and license suspensions could extend to 30 days. Public notification of suspensions was also proposed. The bill sparked debate over mandatory training, with some arguing it would improve safety and others concerned about the burden on small businesses.

### Domestic Violence and Stalking Petitions
1. **Electronic Filing (HB 1177)**: The bill proposed allowing electronic filing for domestic violence and stalking petitions to streamline the process and improve access to protective orders. However, concerns were raised about making e-filing mandatory, as it could create barriers for survivors with limited access to technology or safety concerns. Advocates emphasized the need to retain in-person and remote filing options to accommodate diverse needs.
2. **Survivor Safety**: The committee discussed the importance of connecting survivors to crisis centers and legal services during the filing process, ensuring they receive comprehensive support.

### Juvenile Restorative Justice (HB 1214)
1. **Restorative Justice Models**: The bill proposed creating a study committee to explore best practices for restorative justice models for juveniles involved in misdemeanors and hate crimes. Inspired by successful programs like Howard County, Maryland’s Teen Court, the bill aims to address rising juvenile offenses and hate crimes through peer-led restorative justice.

### Enticement of Minors (HB 1344)
1. **Closing Legal Gaps**: The bill sought to criminalize the enticement and manipulation of minors into sexual activity, both online and in-person. It aimed to address gaps in existing laws that primarily focus on electronic enticement, with law enforcement highlighting the growing issue of sextortion.

### Synthetic Media and AI Regulation (HB 1500)
1. **Misuse of AI**: The bill aimed to regulate the creation and distribution of synthetic media (e.g., deepfakes) generated using AI, particularly in contexts like elections or defamation. It proposed requiring conspicuous disclosure of AI use and prohibiting unauthorized use of someone’s likeness.
2. **Challenges and Concerns**: Lawmakers debated the bill’s broad language, potential impact on free speech, and the difficulty of proving AI use in court. Concerns were also raised about the liability of broadcasters and the need for federal action given the global nature of AI.
3. **Election Integrity**: Specific provisions targeted the use of synthetic media in elections, with discussions focused on preventing voter misinformation and ensuring clear regulations.

### Key Themes and Debates
- **Training vs. Penalties**: Across multiple bills, the committee debated the balance between mandatory training programs and increased penalties, particularly in the context of alcohol service and public safety.
- **Accessibility and Survivor Support**: Ensuring accessibility for survivors of domestic violence and stalking was a recurring theme, with a focus on maintaining flexible filing options and connecting survivors to resources.
- **Technological Regulation**: The meeting highlighted the challenges of regulating emerging technologies like AI, balancing the need to prevent misuse with protecting free speech and ensuring practical enforcement.
- **Public Safety and Enforcement**: Lawmakers emphasized the importance of effective enforcement mechanisms, clear definitions, and practical penalties to address issues ranging from alcohol over-serving to juvenile justice and AI misuse.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing complex public safety and criminal justice issues while balancing efficiency, accessibility, and the evolving challenges posed by technology. The bills discussed are expected to undergo further refinement to address concerns and ensure they effectively protect the public and uphold justice.
