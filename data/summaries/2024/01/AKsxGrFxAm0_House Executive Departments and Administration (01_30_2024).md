**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting (House Executive Departments and Administration, January 30, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 30, 2024, to discuss several bills addressing a wide range of issues, including retiree health insurance, pension benefits, firefighter safety, state investments, carbon pricing, and critical incident stress management. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Retiree Health Insurance and Pension Benefits**

**House Bill 1292**: This bill proposes a minor adjustment to the state retiree health insurance plan, allowing dependent children aged 19-25 to remain on their parents' plan without requiring them to be full-time students. Representative David Lumo presented the bill, emphasizing its alignment with federal Affordable Care Act provisions. The committee unanimously supported the bill, noting its benefits to retirees and minimal financial impact on the state. The motion to recommend the bill passed **12-0**.

**House Bill 1435**: This bill aimed to address a situation where a retiree’s former spouse loses access to retirement benefits if the retiree returns to work. While Representative Barbara Com highlighted a constituent’s financial hardship, the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) raised concerns about the bill’s legality, citing potential violations of IRS rules and state statutes. The committee voted **11-0** to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, suggesting that such issues are better resolved in family courts.

**House Bill 1451**: This bill proposes including **mandatory overtime** in the base pay calculation for pensions, particularly for public safety employees like police, firefighters, and corrections officers. Supporters argued that this would ensure fairness for employees forced to work overtime due to staffing shortages, while opponents expressed concerns about the financial impact on the pension system and the lack of a statewide definition for mandatory overtime. The committee voted **12-0** to recommend the bill for passage, emphasizing local control in defining mandatory overtime.

### **2. Firefighter Safety and Protective Equipment**

**House Bill 1352**: This bill addresses firefighter protective equipment (PPE) and station wear, aiming to reduce exposure to harmful **PFAS chemicals**. Brian Will, president of the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire, presented the bill, which includes defining station wear, requiring manufacturers to disclose PFAS content, and prioritizing safer alternatives. The bill also mandates policies to limit unnecessary exposure to PPE and bans station wear with intentionally added PFAS by 2025. The committee expressed strong interest in the bill’s comprehensive approach to firefighter safety.

### **3. State Investments and ESG Standards**

**House Bill 1267**: This bill sought to prohibit the consideration of **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** criteria in state investments, arguing that it could lead to politicized or underperforming investments. Supporters claimed ESG criteria prioritize activism over financial returns, while opponents, including representatives from the NHRS, argued that ESG factors are essential for assessing long-term risks (e.g., climate change, lawsuits). The committee voted **13-0** to recommend the bill as **inexpedient to legislate**, effectively opposing its passage.

### **4. Carbon Pricing and State Procurement**

**House Bill 1486**: This bill proposes incorporating a **proxy carbon price** into state purchasing decisions, particularly for energy-related equipment like HVAC systems and vehicles. Representative Nick Gera suggested making the bill **non-binding**, turning it into a data-gathering experiment rather than a mandate. Concerns were raised about potential incrementalism toward electrification, cost implications, and energy reliability during emergencies. The committee discussed a **5-year sunset clause** for the experiment, allowing time to gather meaningful data without committing to long-term policy changes.

### **5. Critical Incident Stress Management and Civil Liberties**

**House Bill 1079**: This bill focuses on **critical incident stress management (CISM)** for first responders, including police, fire, EMS, and hospital emergency room staff. An amendment expanded the definition of **first responders** to include retirees, telecommunicators, and hospital staff, while clarifying **confidentiality protections** for peer support services. Testimony highlighted the importance of peer-driven support over traditional Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). The bill was sent to a **subcommittee** for further refinement.

**House Bill 1070**: This bill addresses concerns about **civil liberties** during a **state of emergency**, particularly restrictions on places of worship during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to clarify that no branch of government should suspend civil liberties guaranteed by the U.S. or New Hampshire Constitutions.
