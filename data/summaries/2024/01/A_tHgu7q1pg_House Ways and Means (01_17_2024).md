**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting on January 17, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on January 17, 2024, to discuss several key bills addressing taxation, education funding, and land management. The meeting focused on four main areas: the statewide education property tax (SWEPT), carbon credit programs, hunting and fishing license fees, and the taxation of S Corporations (S Corps). Here’s a detailed summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) and Education Funding**

**HB 1514: Remitting Excess SWEPT Funds to the State**
- **Purpose**: This bill requires municipalities to return excess SWEPT funds to the state for deposit into the general fund.
- **Key Points**:
  - SWEPT, a tax mechanism created 25 years ago, reallocates local property taxes to fund education. However, municipalities currently retain excess SWEPT funds.
  - The bill aims to address a Supreme Court ruling that found the administration of SWEPT unconstitutional by ensuring funds are redistributed equitably among all towns.
  - The fiscal impact is estimated at $26–$29 million in additional state revenue, though actual amounts may vary due to delayed tax collections.
  - Proponents argue the bill is necessary to uphold constitutional obligations and ensure fairness in education funding.

**HB 1563: Repealing SWEPT**
- **Purpose**: This bill seeks to repeal SWEPT, calling it a "virtual tax" that reallocates local property taxes rather than generating new revenue.
- **Key Points**:
  - SWEPT was established after a Supreme Court ruling requiring increased state funding for schools. It splits local property taxes into two components: local property tax and state education property tax.
  - The repeal aims to increase transparency by merging these tax lines on property tax bills, simplifying the process.
  - The bill is revenue-neutral and does not impact state aid to schools. It is set to take effect in November 2025.
  - Concerns were raised about potential future increases in SWEPT and the need for the state to increase its contribution to school funding.

### **2. Carbon Credit Programs and Land Management**

**HB 1484: Excluding Carbon Credit Land from Current Use Tax Assessment**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes to exclude land enrolled in carbon credit programs from the current use tax assessment program.
- **Key Points**:
  - The current use program, established in the 1960s, assesses property taxes based on the land’s current use (e.g., forestry, agriculture) rather than its highest potential development value.
  - Carbon credit programs involve landowners selling the carbon sequestration potential of their forests, often through long-term contracts (40–100 years).
  - Critics argue that these programs reduce timber harvesting, potentially impacting local economies and tax revenues.
  - Opponents of the bill noted that carbon credit programs are minimal in New Hampshire, with fewer than 10 landowners and less than 200,000 acres enrolled. They emphasized that carbon credits do not change the land’s open space status.
  - Landowners testified that carbon credits provide an additional revenue stream without conflicting with the goals of the current use program.
  - Alternative solutions, such as the state’s timber tax law (RSA 79), were suggested to address concerns about lost timber revenue.

**Concerns About Carbon Credits vs. Timber Harvests**
- The state’s largest private landowner submitted a 10-year forest management plan proposing to reduce timber harvests by 50% in favor of carbon credits.
- This shift could reduce timber tax revenues and impact local economies, including logging jobs and wood supply to mills.
- The state is reviewing whether the proposed reduction aligns with the terms of the conservation easement on the land.

### **3. Hunting and Fishing License Fees**

**HB 1558: Increasing Agent Fees for Hunting and Fishing Licenses**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes increasing the agent fee from $1 to $3 for issuing hunting and fishing licenses, citing increased costs for agents (e.g., internet, printers, paper).
- **Key Points**:
  - The fee increase would apply to both in-person and online license purchases. Online sales account for 60% of licenses, and the increase would significantly benefit the online vendor, raising their earnings from $200,000 to over $600,000 annually.
  - The bill also sets maximum fees for game weighing stations to prevent overcharging hunters.
  - The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department opposes the bill, arguing it would lead to higher costs for consumers and require significant programming changes, estimated at $50,000–$100,000.

### **4. Taxation of S Corporations (S Corps)**

**HB 1551: Aligning S Corps Taxation with Federal Standards**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to differentiate between S Corps and C Corps for tax purposes in New Hampshire, eliminating double taxation for S Corps.
- **Key Points**:
  - Currently, New Hampshire and Louisiana are the only states that do not recognize the federal tax treatment of S Corps, resulting in double taxation at the state level.
  - S Corps are pass-through entities for federal tax purposes, meaning income is taxed at the individual level, not the entity level. However, in New Hampshire, S Corps are taxed at both the entity level (Business Profits Tax) and the individual level (Interest and Dividends Tax).
  - The bill seeks to align New Hampshire’s tax treatment of S Corps with federal standards, exempting them from the Business Profits Tax.
  - The Department of Revenue estimates a significant revenue loss if S Corps are exempt from the Business Profits Tax.
  - The discussion also touched on the phase-out of the Interest and Dividends Tax and whether the bill would still be relevant if this tax is fully eliminated.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**

- **Transparency and Fairness**: The discussions emphasized the need for transparency in taxation and equitable distribution of education funding.
- **Economic Impact**: Concerns were raised about the economic ripple effects of carbon credit programs on local economies and the potential fiscal impact of tax reforms.
- **Coordination and Comprehensive Solutions**: Representatives highlighted the complexity of the issues and the need for coordinated, comprehensive approaches to address school funding, land management, and taxation.
- **Work Sessions**: The committee plans to hold work sessions in early February to further discuss and amend these bills, with public hearings concluding by January 31.

In summary, the meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing constitutional concerns, promoting transparency, and ensuring fairness in taxation and education funding, while balancing the economic and environmental impacts of proposed legislative changes.
