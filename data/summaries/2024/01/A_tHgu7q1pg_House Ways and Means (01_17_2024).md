**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 17, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on January 17, 2024, to address a range of issues, including the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT), forest carbon credits, hunting regulations, and the taxation of S corporations (S Corps). The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing fiscal responsibility, environmental conservation, and the sustainability of local industries. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

### **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)**
The SWEPT, a tax collected locally but considered a state tax, was a central focus of the meeting. Key points included:
1. **Excess SWEPT Funds**: Discussions revolved around the unconstitutional administration of SWEPT, as ruled by the Supreme Court in the *Steven Rand vs. State of New Hampshire* case. Proposals aimed to ensure excess funds are allocated to education rather than retained by towns. One bill (HB 1514) proposed remitting excess SWEPT funds to the state, while another suggested simplifying the process with a 3% processing fee for municipalities.
2. **Repeal of SWEPT (HB 1563)**: A bill to repeal SWEPT was introduced, arguing that it is a "phantom tax" that reallocates local property taxes without generating new revenue. The repeal would increase transparency by merging SWEPT with local property taxes and prevent future rate increases. Concerns were raised about the impact on school funding formulas and donor towns.

### **Forest Carbon Credits and Current Use Program**
The meeting addressed the growing issue of forest carbon credits and their impact on the current use program, which provides tax reductions for land actively used for forestry or agriculture.
1. **Carbon Credits and Tax Reductions (HB 1484)**: A bill proposed excluding landowners who sell carbon credits from the current use program. Critics argued that this would discourage forest preservation and incentivize development, while supporters raised concerns about tax fairness and the loss of timber tax revenue.
2. **Economic Impact of Reduced Timber Harvesting**: A landowner’s proposal to reduce timber harvesting by 50% sparked concerns about municipal timber tax revenues, local jobs, and the supply of wood to mills. The Department of Justice is reviewing the conservation easement governing the land.

### **Hunting Regulations (HB 1558)**
The committee discussed a bill proposing an increase in agent fees for issuing hunting and fishing licenses from $1 to $3 to cover increased costs. The bill also set maximum fees for weighing game animals at registration stations. Concerns were raised about the financial impact on hunters and the disproportionate benefit to online vendors.

### **Taxation of S Corporations (HB 1551)**
The committee debated a bill to align New Hampshire’s tax treatment of S Corps with federal standards, as the state currently taxes S Corps similarly to C Corps, leading to double taxation. The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) indicated a potential significant revenue loss ($424 million) if the bill passes. Concerns were raised about the constitutional implications of treating S Corps and C Corps differently for tax purposes.

### **General Discussion and Next Steps**
The meeting underscored the need for a comprehensive approach to address the fiscal, environmental, and economic challenges posed by these issues. The committee plans to hold work sessions to further analyze the bills and address technical issues, such as the timing of SWEPT repeal and the implementation of new hunting license fees.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities of managing state education funding, the emerging challenges posed by the carbon credit market, and the need for balanced solutions that consider fiscal responsibility, environmental conservation, and the sustainability of local industries. Representatives emphasized the importance of further study and a comprehensive approach to address these multifaceted issues effectively.
