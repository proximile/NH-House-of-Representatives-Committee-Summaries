### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (01/08/2024)

The New Hampshire House Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 8, 2024, to discuss several key pieces of legislation addressing environmental and agricultural issues. The meeting featured extensive testimony, debates, and discussions on topics ranging from water quality and waste management to constitutional amendments and extended producer responsibility (EPR). Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Water Quality and Nutrient Runoff (HB 1293 and HB 1294)**
   - **HB 1293**: Focused on reducing phosphorus runoff into New Hampshire’s lakes and rivers, this bill seeks to restrict fertilizer application during heavy rain, on saturated or frozen ground, and from October 15 to April 1. It includes exemptions for agriculture, golf courses, and gardening, and emphasizes public education on proper fertilizer use. Testimony from organizations like the New Hampshire Association of Realtors and the Kezar Lake Protective Association highlighted the growing issue of cyanobacteria blooms and the bill’s alignment with the state’s cyanobacteria action plan. Concerns were raised about enforcement, exemptions, and potential impacts on greenhouse operations. The committee discussed amendments to clarify language and ensure feasibility.
   - **HB 1294**: This bill aims to prohibit the state from enforcing EPA regulations, citing concerns about federal overreach, particularly in cases like nitrogen pollution in the Great Bay area. Representative Granger introduced the bill as a placeholder for future amendments. Discussions included debates on the EPA’s statutory authority, recent Supreme Court rulings (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*), and the potential fiscal impact of losing federal funding. Some representatives questioned the bill’s constitutionality, while others supported the pushback against federal overreach.

#### **2. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for Packaging Waste (HB 1630)**
   - **Purpose**: HB 1630 proposes shifting the financial and management responsibility for post-consumer packaging waste from municipalities to producers. The bill aligns with New Hampshire’s 2022 Solid Waste Management Plan and aims to reduce waste, particularly single-use plastics, by incentivizing sustainable packaging design.
   - **Concerns**: Some representatives expressed skepticism about the bill’s feasibility, citing potential cost increases for consumers and small businesses, insufficient study time, and the lack of evidence from other states with similar EPR programs. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) opposed the bill, estimating it would require eight new staff positions and suggesting a regional or national approach would be more effective.
   - **Support**: Advocates, including the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), argued that EPR would reduce waste, lower municipal costs, and encourage innovation in packaging. Testimonies highlighted the toxic effects of plastic packaging and the success of EPR programs in other states and countries. Supporters emphasized the need to hold producers accountable for the environmental and health impacts of their products.

#### **3. Constitutional Amendment on Environmental Rights (CACR 14)**
   - **Proposal**: CACR 14 seeks to amend the New Hampshire Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right to a clean and healthful environment, inspired by a similar provision in Montana’s constitution.
   - **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned how the amendment aligns with existing constitutional principles, particularly Article 1, which emphasizes that government originates from the people. There were also concerns about potential conflicts with other constitutional articles and the obligations it might impose on the legislature.
   - **Next Steps**: The bill will likely move to a work session for further refinement, with input from drafting attorneys and committee members.

#### **4. Waste Management and Recycling Challenges**
   - **Municipal Struggles**: Representatives from towns like Hopkinton highlighted the financial and logistical challenges of waste management, including recycling issues, staffing shortages, and infrastructure inefficiencies. The town faces significant costs for waste disposal, including a $4 million bond to clean up contaminated septage lagoons.
   - **Need for Systemic Change**: The discussion emphasized the urgent need for legislative action to reduce packaging waste and promote EPR programs. HB 1630 was seen as a critical step toward alleviating the financial burden on municipalities and taxpayers.

---

#### **5. Other Bills**
   - **HB 1626 (Dog License Fees)**: This bill proposed adjusting the allocation of dog license fees between the spay and neuter program and the veterinary diagnostic laboratory. The committee voted to pass the bill, which will now move to the full House.
   - **CA S4 (Environmental Protection Amendment)**: Representative Timothy Horgan introduced a constitutional amendment to protect the environment, inspired by Montana’s constitution. The committee discussed potential revisions to clarify the amendment’s intent, particularly regarding terms like “remedies” and “prevention.”

---

### **Key Themes**
   - **Environmental Protection**: Many bills focused on reducing environmental harm, from water quality improvements to waste reduction and constitutional guarantees of environmental rights.
   - **Federal vs. State Authority**: Discussions on HB 1294 highlighted tensions between state sovereignty and federal oversight, particularly in environmental regulation.
   - **Economic and Practical Considerations**: Concerns about the financial impact on consumers, small businesses, and municipalities were central to debates on EPR and other bills.
   - **Education and Innovation**: Several bills emphasized the importance of public education and incentivizing innovation in areas like sustainable packaging and waste management.

---

### **Next Steps**
   - **HB 1293 and HB 1294**: The committee will seek further input from state agencies and stakeholders before making decisions on these bills.
   - **HB 1630 (EPR)**: The bill will continue to be debated, with potential amendments to address concerns about costs, implementation, and small business impacts.
   - **CACR 14**: The constitutional amendment will likely proceed to a work session for further refinement.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges and opportunities in advancing environmental legislation while balancing economic and practical considerations. The committee’s discussions highlighted the need for systemic changes to protect New Hampshire’s natural resources, reduce waste, and ensure a clean and healthful environment for future generations.
