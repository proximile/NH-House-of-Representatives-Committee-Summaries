The NH House of Representatives' Long Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee met on January 26, 2023. Due to scheduling conflicts, some members were substituted, including Representative Sue Newman and Representative Eaton. The meeting began with the approval of the December 15, 2022, minutes, which were accepted unanimously without corrections.

The committee then addressed two main agenda items:

1. **Disposal of Highway and Turnpike Funded Real Estate (Item LRC 24001):**  
   The New Hampshire Department of Transportation requested authorization to sell a small, triangular piece of state-owned land (0.006 acres) in Epping, NH, for $10,500. The land, originally part of a larger parcel acquired in 1936, was deemed surplus. The buyers, who own an adjacent property, sought to clear a title issue related to their driveway crossing the land. The motion to approve the sale passed unanimously.

2. **Amendment to Easement Agreement (Item LRC 24002):**  
   The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources sought authorization to amend an existing easement agreement to include public water supply lines for the towns of Antrim and Bennington. The amendment would be at no cost to the state, with a $1,100 administrative fee. Although no representative from the department was present, the committee discussed the issue and unanimously approved the motion.

The meeting concluded with the scheduling of the next committee meeting for April 5, 2023, at 10:10 a.m., and a motion to adjourn, which was also unanimously approved.
