**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (01/08/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 8, 2024, to discuss several bills and initiatives related to energy, technology, and environmental policy. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including equitable access to technology, energy efficiency, clean energy transitions, and net metering policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting.

---

### **1. Equitable Access and Outreach (House Bill 1047)**
The committee began with a focus on **House Bill 1047**, which proposes establishing a committee to study the effectiveness of state outreach to residents without computer access. Co-sponsored by Representative Wendy Thomas, the bill aims to address inclusivity and equitable access to vital information, such as economic and healthcare initiatives. Thomas emphasized nine reasons for the bill, including improving policy, resource allocation, and fostering public trust.

**Key Concerns and Discussions:**
- **Need for the Study:** Some members questioned whether there was sufficient evidence of communication gaps and whether existing state agencies could address the issue without forming a new committee.
- **Scope and Implementation:** Questions were raised about how the committee would measure impact, avoid selection bias, and ensure actionable recommendations.
- **Funding:** Concerns were expressed about potential costs and the possibility of taxpayer-funded internet access.
- **Existing Programs:** Representatives inquired about the effectiveness of current federal and state programs, such as the Affordable Connectivity Program, in reaching underserved populations.

**Stakeholder Testimonies:**
- **Griffin Roberge** (NH Department of Energy) acknowledged challenges in reaching certain populations but noted the department had not intended to testify on the bill.
- **Mara Weston** (New England Connectivity and Telecommunications Association) supported the bill, emphasizing the need for greater awareness of existing programs and partnerships to improve access.

**Conclusion:** The bill’s prime sponsor, Representative Muse, stressed the importance of understanding communication gaps in programs like low-income heating assistance, SNAP benefits, and Medicaid before proposing solutions. The committee plans to continue public hearings and work sessions on the bill.

### **2. Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Programs**
The committee discussed energy efficiency initiatives, including the **Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)** and the **New Hampshire Saves Program**, funded through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).

**Key Points:**
- **WAP Funding:** $18 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was allocated for WAP, which assists low-income households with energy efficiency improvements. Concerns were raised about the sufficiency of funds given potential increased demand.
- **New Hampshire Saves Program:** This program has a larger budget and works closely with community action agencies and contractors to identify the best use of funds for weatherization projects.
- **Housing Affordability:** Testimonies highlighted the impact of high utility costs on low-income and elderly residents, calling for studies to understand unmet demand and barriers to accessing weatherization programs.

**House Bill 1230:** This bill proposes a study committee to examine challenges with New Hampshire’s weatherization programs, particularly for seniors and low-income residents. Issues include complex application processes, lack of awareness, and insufficient outreach.

**Conclusion:** Representatives emphasized the need for data-driven solutions, improved inter-agency collaboration, and addressing federal funding constraints to enhance program accessibility and efficiency.

### **3. Clean Energy Transition and Environmental Concerns**
The committee discussed the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, focusing on the **Bow Power Plant** and the potential establishment of a **Clean Energy Community Resilience and Conservation Corps**.

**Key Points:**
- **Bow Power Plant:** **House Bill 1289** proposes establishing a commission to study replacing the coal-fired Bow power plant with a clean energy base load generator and storage. The bill addresses environmental and health impacts, including higher mercury levels, cancer, asthma, and premature deaths.
- **Public Involvement:** Emphasis was placed on involving local communities, particularly Bow residents, in the transition process to address their concerns and needs.
- **Clean Energy Commission:** The commission would explore renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro, leveraging federal funding for decommissioning coal plants and transitioning to clean energy.
- **Clean Energy Community Resilience and Conservation Corps:** Representative Matt Wilhelm introduced a bill to study the creation of a corps that would mobilize young people for national service in clean energy, conservation, and community resilience projects.

**Conclusion:** The discussions highlighted the urgency of transitioning to clean energy, addressing environmental and health impacts, and involving local communities in the process.

### **4. Net Metering and Energy Policy (House Bill 1398)**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 1398**, introduced by Representative Michael Vose, which aims to provide transparency and tracking for net metering costs. The bill proposes recovering these costs through a **stranded cost recovery charge (SCRC)** rather than standard rates, making the costs visible on customer bills.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** The bill seeks to make net metering costs transparent and ensure equitable cost recovery across all customers.
- **Current Practices:** Eversource uses the SCRC for net metering costs, while Unitil uses an external distribution charge. The bill would standardize this approach.
- **Transparency:** The bill aims to provide customers with a clearer understanding of net metering costs, though concerns were raised about whether customers would investigate these charges in detail.
- **Concerns:** Some representatives questioned the appropriateness of classifying net metering costs as stranded costs and the potential administrative burdens on utilities.

**Public Testimonies:**
- **Eversource** stated it is neutral on the bill but suggested clarifying language to avoid conflating net metering costs with traditional stranded costs.
- **Department of Energy** expressed neutrality but highlighted potential challenges, such as the bill’s specificity and its impact on ongoing utility rate cases.

**Conclusion:** The meeting centered on balancing transparency and consistency in utility billing practices while addressing concerns about administrative complexity and the appropriateness of classifying net metering costs as stranded costs.

### **5. Broader Energy Policy and Market Competition**
The committee also discussed broader energy policy issues, including the impact of net metering on competition and the need for transparency in reporting the costs and benefits of renewable energy systems.

**Key Points:**
- **Competition:** Concerns were raised that **House Bill 1398** could undermine competition by providing utilities with advantages not afforded to other competitors.
- **Net Metering Growth:** There has been significant growth in net metering customers and capacity, with communities interested in using local renewable energy resources to offset their energy consumption.
- **Transparency and Data:** There was a call for greater transparency in reporting the costs and benefits of net metering, including reduced energy purchases and transmission costs.

**Conclusion:** The discussions underscored the complexities of net metering policies, the need for accurate data, and the importance of balancing costs and benefits to ensure a fair and competitive energy market in New Hampshire.

### **Overall Outcome:**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on improving access to technology, enhancing energy efficiency, transitioning to clean energy, and ensuring transparency in energy policies. The committee plans to continue public hearings and work sessions on the discussed bills, with the aim of finalizing its work by early February.
