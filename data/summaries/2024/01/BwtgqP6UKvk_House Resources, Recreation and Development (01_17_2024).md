The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 17, 2024, convened by the House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee, addressed several critical environmental and regulatory issues. The discussions centered on Shoreland and septic system regulations, boat safety, overnight stays on public waters, geological resource management, and flood-related property management. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key topics and debates:

### **Environmental Protection and Shoreland Regulations**
The meeting began with a focus on environmental protection, particularly the enforcement of the **Shoreland Protection Act** and **septic system regulations**. Key points included:
- **Strict Liability for Shoreland Violations**: Representatives debated applying strict liability to enforce the Shoreland Protection Act, meaning property owners could be fined for violations regardless of intent. This approach is seen as a last resort to ensure environmental restoration rather than a mandatory enforcement tool.
- **Realtors’ Concerns**: Sarah Holland of the New Hampshire Association of Realtors highlighted the need for educating property owners about the Act, as many violations are unintentional. She opposed removing notification requirements for violations.
- **Support for Stronger Enforcement**: Pat Tarpy of the Lake Winnipesaukee Association advocated for stricter enforcement to prevent long-term environmental damage, emphasizing the 10-year lag between violations and visible water quality impacts.
- **Septic System Regulations (HB 1113)**: The bill proposes requiring septic system evaluations for waterfront properties within 250 feet of a water body, especially if the system is over 20 years old or unapproved. If a system is failing, its replacement would be a condition of sale. Amendments were suggested to allow reasonable timeframes for repairs.
- **Environmental Impact of Failed Septic Systems**: Experts, including Philip Trowbridge from the Department of Environmental Services (DES), discussed how failing septic systems contribute to water pollution, such as nutrient loading and cyanobacteria blooms.
- **Collaboration with Realtors**: Bob Quinn, CEO of the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, expressed confidence in working with DES to propose solutions, either through amendments or future legislation.

### **Boat Safety and Overnight Stays**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 1045** and **House Bill 1049**, addressing boat safety and overnight stays on public waters:
- **Engine Cut-Off Switch Requirement (HB 1045)**: This bill mandates powerboat operators to wear an engine cut-off switch (ECOS) while operating certain powerboats above headway speed. The ECOS prevents runaway boats if the operator is ejected, reducing accidents and fatalities. Marine Patrol supported the bill, though concerns were raised about the definition of "headway speed."
- **Overnight Use of Houseboats (HB 1049)**: This bill seeks to repeal the prohibition on overnight stays in houseboats on New Hampshire’s great ponds. Supporters argued that current laws, which require landowner permission, are overly restrictive and limit fair access to public waters. The bill aims to allow overnight stays without landowner permission, with potential regulations on stay durations and sanitary facilities.

### **Geological Resources Management**
**House Bill 1060** proposed establishing a **Geological Resources Advisory Committee** as a permanent committee in statute. This would streamline the process for receiving federal funding from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for geological mapping in New Hampshire, eliminating the need for periodic reauthorization.

### **Flood-Related Property Management**
**House Bill 1121** addressed exemptions for property owners to clear debris from streams after natural disasters or flooding events without requiring a Wetlands permit. Key discussions included:
- **Stream Debris Removal**: The bill allows property owners to clear debris threatening property, crops, or structures, provided they document the work, notify abutters, and consult with local conservation officers or contractors.
- **Emergency Authorization Process**: DES highlighted its existing emergency authorization process, which expedites responses to flood-related threats without formal permits while ensuring compliance with environmental laws.
- **FEMA Funding Concerns**: There were concerns that the bill could jeopardize FEMA funding, as federal aid requires compliance with state and federal environmental laws.
- **Opposition from Conservation Groups**: The New Hampshire Association of Conservation Commissions and The Nature Conservancy opposed the bill, arguing that the existing emergency process is sufficient and that the bill could lead to improper stream management.
- **Call for Broader Solutions**: Representatives emphasized the need for state-level coordination and planning to address extreme weather events, including the establishment of a State Adaptation and Resilience Council.

### **General Themes**
Throughout the meeting, several recurring themes emerged:
- **Environmental Protection**: All bills emphasized the importance of safeguarding water quality and natural resources from pollution, improper septic systems, and flood-related debris.
- **Financial and Regulatory Burden**: Stakeholders highlighted the financial strain on property owners, particularly regarding septic system repairs and Wetlands permitting.
- **Collaborative Solutions**: Representatives and stakeholders expressed a willingness to work together to refine the bills, ensuring they balance environmental protection with practical solutions for property owners.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to further discussions and potential amendments to address the concerns raised, reflecting a shared goal of protecting New Hampshire’s natural resources while minimizing regulatory and financial burdens on residents.
