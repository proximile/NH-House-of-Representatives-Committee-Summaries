The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 25, 2024, focused on several bills aimed at reforming occupational licensing processes and administrative oversight. The discussions centered on reducing barriers to entry for licensed professionals, improving workforce mobility, and ensuring public safety while balancing regulatory efficiency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1057 - Provisional Licensing for EMTs**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Mark PR  
   - **Purpose**: Address delays in background checks for EMTs by allowing temporary licenses to be issued if background checks are not completed within three weeks. The temporary license can be revoked if issues are later discovered.  
   - **Outcome**: Passed unanimously (13-0) and placed on the consent calendar.

2. **House Bill 1233 - Chiropractors and Veterinary Licensing**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Diane Kelly  
   - **Purpose**: Exempt certified animal chiropractors from veterinary licensing requirements if certified by a program approved by the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).  
   - **Outcome**: Passed unanimously (14-0) and placed on the consent calendar.

3. **House Bill 1272 - Reciprocity Licensing**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Diane Power  
   - **Purpose**: Streamline the reciprocity licensing process by removing the requirement that another state’s licensing standards be “substantially similar” to New Hampshire’s. This aims to reduce administrative burdens and expand the labor force.  
   - **Discussion**:  
     - **Support**: Proponents argued that removing the “substantially similar” requirement would address workforce shortages and improve mobility for professionals, citing examples from states like Arizona.  
     - **Concerns**: Opponents raised concerns about public safety, citing differences in education, training, and scope of practice across states (e.g., plumbers, electricians, real estate agents).  
     - **Outcome**: Referred to a subcommittee for further discussion and potential amendments.

4. **House Bill 1676 - Sunset Commission for Occupational Licensing**  
   - **Sponsor**: Representative Tony Luus  
   - **Purpose**: Establish a sunset commission to evaluate the necessity, performance, and potential improvements to occupational licensing boards and regulations. The bill includes default repeal provisions for boards that fail to justify their existence.  
   - **Discussion**:  
     - **Support**: Advocates argued that the commission would reduce regulatory burdens, increase employment opportunities, and ensure accountability, citing examples from Texas and Ohio.  
     - **Opposition**: Critics expressed concerns about the potential loss of public safety and professional standards, particularly for critical professions like medicine, nursing, and engineering.  
     - **Outcome**: Referred to a subcommittee for further review and potential amendments.

### **Key Themes**

1. **Workforce Mobility and Labor Shortages**  
   - Multiple bills (e.g., HB 1272) aimed to make it easier for out-of-state professionals to obtain licenses in New Hampshire, addressing workforce shortages and improving economic mobility.

2. **Public Safety and Professional Standards**  
   - Throughout the discussions, representatives emphasized the importance of maintaining public safety and consumer protection, particularly in professions with significant health and safety implications (e.g., EMTs, plumbers, electricians).

3. **Regulatory Efficiency and Oversight**  
   - The proposed sunset commission (HB 1676) reflected a broader effort to review and streamline occupational licensing boards, ensuring they are effective and efficient while minimizing unnecessary burdens.

4. **Balancing Reform with Accountability**  
   - While there was support for reducing barriers to entry and improving reciprocity, concerns were raised about the potential risks of deregulation and the need for objective standards to replace subjective criteria like “substantially similar.”

### **Stakeholder Perspectives**

- **Supporters**: Organizations like the Institute for Justice and representatives advocating for workforce mobility argued that licensing reforms would reduce barriers to employment and improve economic growth.  
- **Opponents**: Licensing boards, professional organizations, and some representatives emphasized the risks to public safety and the potential loss of professional standards if licensing requirements were weakened or boards were repealed.

### **Next Steps**

- **Subcommittee Review**: HB 1272 and HB 1676 were referred to subcommittees for further discussion and potential amendments to address concerns about public safety, scope of practice differences, and the structure of the sunset commission.  
- **Consent Calendar**: HB 1057 and HB 1233, which passed unanimously, were placed on the consent calendar for expedited approval.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the ongoing effort to balance workforce mobility and economic growth with public safety and regulatory oversight. While there was broad support for reducing administrative burdens and improving reciprocity, significant concerns were raised about maintaining professional standards and protecting consumers. The subcommittees will play a critical role in refining these bills to address these competing priorities.
