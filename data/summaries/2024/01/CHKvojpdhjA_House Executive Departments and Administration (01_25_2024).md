**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 25, 2024: Focus on Occupational Licensing and Related Bills**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 25, 2024, centered on discussions around occupational licensing, with a focus on several key bills aimed at reforming licensing practices, addressing workforce shortages, and ensuring public safety. The meeting highlighted the tension between maintaining rigorous licensing standards to protect public health and safety and streamlining processes to facilitate workforce mobility and economic growth.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Occupational Licensing Reciprocity and Standards**  
   - **House Bill 1272**: This bill proposed removing the requirement that out-of-state licensing standards must be "substantially similar" to New Hampshire's for reciprocal licensing. Supporters argued that the current process creates unnecessary barriers for professionals moving to New Hampshire, exacerbating labor shortages. Critics, however, expressed concerns that this could lower standards and compromise public safety, particularly in professions like real estate, plumbing, and accounting.  
   - **Testimony and Concerns**: Stakeholders, including the Board of Accountancy and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), emphasized the need for comparability in licensing standards to protect consumers and maintain professional integrity. The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review and potential amendments.

2. **Sunset Commission and Licensing Board Review**  
   - **House Bill 1676**: This bill proposed establishing a sunset commission to review and evaluate the necessity and performance of various occupational licensing boards. The commission would recommend whether boards should be renewed, reformed, or repealed, with a default repeal mechanism if no legislative action is taken.  
   - **Opposition and Concerns**: Many representatives and stakeholders strongly opposed the default repeal provision, arguing it could lead to the unintended elimination of critical boards, undermining public safety and professional standards. Professions like medicine, nursing, engineering, and acupuncture were highlighted as particularly vulnerable.  
   - **Support for Review**: While there was broad agreement on the need for periodic reviews to ensure efficiency and effectiveness, critics called for a more balanced approach that avoids default repeals and includes greater input from industry experts.  

3. **Provisional Licensing for EMTs**  
   - **House Bill 1057**: This bill addressed delays in background checks for emergency medical technicians (EMTs) by allowing the state to issue provisional licenses if background checks take longer than three weeks. The bill included safeguards, such as pairing provisional license holders with experienced EMTs and the ability to revoke licenses if issues arise.  
   - **Support and Passage**: The bill received unanimous support from the committee, recommending its passage to help recruit and retain EMTs, especially during workforce shortages exacerbated by COVID-19.  

4. **Chiropractic Licensing for Animals**  
   - **House Bill 1233**: This bill sought to exempt certified animal chiropractors from veterinary licensing requirements, provided they are certified by a program approved by the OPLC. Supporters argued that this would reduce unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles while maintaining high standards through national certification.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously recommended the bill for passage.  

5. **Economic and Labor Considerations**  
   - Throughout the meeting, representatives debated the economic and labor implications of licensing reforms. Some argued that overly strict licensing requirements hinder economic growth and exacerbate labor shortages, citing examples from states with universal licensing reciprocity laws. Others emphasized the importance of maintaining rigorous standards to protect public safety and consumer trust.  

6. **Subcommittee and Further Review**  
   - Several bills, including HB 1272 and HB 1676, were referred to subcommittees for further refinement. Representatives and stakeholders expressed a willingness to collaborate on amendments to address concerns while advancing the goals of workforce mobility, public safety, and regulatory efficiency.  

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the complex balance between ensuring public safety through rigorous occupational licensing standards and addressing workforce shortages by reducing barriers to licensure. While there was broad support for streamlining processes and periodic reviews of licensing boards, concerns about maintaining professional standards and avoiding unintended consequences dominated the discussions. The bills discussed are expected to undergo further refinement in subcommittees, with a focus on finding solutions that protect public health and safety while fostering economic growth and workforce mobility.
