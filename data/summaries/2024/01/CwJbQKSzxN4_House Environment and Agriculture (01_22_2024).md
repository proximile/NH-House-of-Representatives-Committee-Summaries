### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (01/22/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 22, 2024, to discuss a range of legislative proposals and issues related to food safety, agriculture, environmental protection, and public health. The meeting covered seven key segments, each focusing on specific bills and topics. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

---

### **1. House Bill 1572: mRNA Technology in Food, Lab-Grown Meat, and Insect-Based Foods**
The committee reviewed **HB 1572**, which seeks to regulate the use of mRNA technology in food, lab-grown meat, and insect-based products. Key points included:
- **Prohibiting mRNA Technology in Food**: The bill aims to ban mRNA technology in food due to concerns about unintended health consequences, such as potential vaccination without consent. Representative Jeff Gannon highlighted risks like blood clots and myocarditis linked to mRNA vaccines.
- **Labeling Requirements**: The bill mandates clear labeling for lab-grown meat and insect-based foods to ensure consumer transparency.
- **Scientific and Regulatory Concerns**: Committee members questioned the feasibility of mRNA transfer through food and the potential impact on New Hampshire’s food supply chain.
- **Opposition from State Agencies**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of Agriculture expressed concerns about the bill’s enforceability and its potential to limit food options in the state.

### **2. House Bill 1565: Right to Homestead Act**
**HB 1565**, the **Right to Homestead Act**, was discussed as a means to expand the ability of individuals to produce and sell homemade foods without requiring a license. Key points included:
- **Support for Local Food Production**: Proponents argued the bill would empower small producers, increase food security, and encourage entrepreneurship.
- **Food Safety Concerns**: DHHS opposed the bill, citing risks of foodborne illnesses from unregulated production of hazardous foods like meats and dairy.
- **Comparison to Other States**: Vermont’s approach, which allows higher-risk foods with licensing and inspection, was discussed as a potential model.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The bill would eliminate a $150 licensing fee, resulting in revenue loss for the state.

### **3. Homemade and Artisan Food Production**
The committee discussed proposals to exempt homemade food producers from certain licensing and inspection requirements. Key points included:
- **Food Freedom and Economic Opportunity**: Advocates emphasized the need to support small-scale food entrepreneurs, particularly stay-at-home parents and caregivers.
- **Safety and Labeling**: The bills included provisions for food safety protocols, labeling, and transparency, with a focus on allergen information.
- **State Comparisons**: Wyoming’s Food Freedom Act was cited as a successful model for similar legislation.
- **Concerns About Foodborne Illnesses**: Opponents raised concerns about the potential risks of unregulated food production, though no confirmed cases of illness were reported in states with similar laws.

### **4. Nutrient Management, Water Quality, and EPA Regulations**
The committee addressed issues related to nutrient management, water quality, and the impact of EPA regulations. Key points included:
- **Nutrient Management Plans**: Exemptions for farms with nutrient management plans were debated, with emphasis on applying fertilizers only during the growing season.
- **Great Bay Water Quality**: Ted Deers from the NH Department of Environmental Services highlighted the challenges of reducing nitrogen levels in Great Bay and the collaborative efforts with UNH and the EPA.
- **EPA Regulations**: Concerns were raised about the financial burden on municipalities to comply with EPA mandates, particularly in rural areas. Some representatives proposed prohibiting the state from enforcing EPA regulations.
- **Constitutional Amendment**: A proposed amendment to enshrine environmental protection in the state constitution was discussed, with mixed opinions on its necessity.

### **5. Organic Farming Programs**
The committee reviewed a bill to codify an organic farming program into law. Key points included:
- **Costs and Benefits**: The bill would require $220,000 in funding, with supporters arguing it benefits soil, water, and air health. Opponents questioned the necessity of mandating the program, given the small number of certified organic farms in the state.
- **Trends in Organic Farming**: Younger farmers are reportedly shifting away from USDA-certified organic programs in favor of alternatives like certified naturally grown or certified regeneratively grown.
- **Amendment Proposal**: An amendment was proposed to limit the program’s scope to certifying crops, addressing concerns raised by the Commissioner of Agriculture.

### **6. House Bill 1685: Food Safety and Home-Based Food Production**
**HB 1685**, which pertains to food safety and the regulation of home-based and artisan food production, was discussed. Key points included:
- **Comparison with HB 1565**: The committee compared the two bills, with concerns raised about the clarity of HB 1685, particularly regarding where homemade foods can be sold.
- **Food Safety Education**: Representatives emphasized the need for education and clear guidelines for food producers to ensure safety.
- **State Comparisons**: Other states with similar laws were referenced, with mixed outcomes in terms of foodborne illnesses.
- **Amendments and Clarifications**: Proposed amendments aimed to define terms more precisely and avoid overburdening retailers with additional requirements.

### **7. Environmental Protection and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)**
The committee discussed a proposed constitutional amendment on environmental protection and **HB 1630**, which introduces Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for waste management. Key points included:
- **Constitutional Amendment**: Representatives debated the feasibility and necessity of enshrining environmental protection in the state constitution, with some suggesting a study committee to explore the issue further.
- **EPR Legislation**: The committee acknowledged the complexity of the EPR bill, with concerns about its financial impact and the need for more data and stakeholder input. A proposal for a needs assessment was discussed as a preliminary step.
- **Organic Certification Program**: The committee reviewed an appropriation to support the state’s organic certification program, with debate over its fiscal responsibility given the small number of certified organic farms.

### **Overall Tone and Next Steps**
The meeting highlighted a mix of support for environmental and agricultural initiatives, tempered by concerns about feasibility, cost, and the need for further study.
