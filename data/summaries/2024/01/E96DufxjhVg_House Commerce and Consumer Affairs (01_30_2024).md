**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (01/30/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 30, 2024, covered a range of topics, primarily focusing on service animals, farmers' market regulations, and the legalization and regulation of cannabis. The discussions highlighted the complexities of addressing these issues within legal, practical, and public health frameworks.

### **Service Animals (HB 1117)**
The committee addressed the growing issue of individuals misrepresenting pets as service animals, which has caused disruptions in businesses such as restaurants and hotels. Business owners shared concerns about the challenges of enforcing rules and the potential legal and social media backlash when denying entry to misrepresented animals. Proposed solutions included optional registration and identification for service animals to differentiate them from pets. However, there was concern that such measures might conflict with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits requiring proof of a service animal's status. Representatives also discussed the enforceability of existing laws, including a $1,200 fine for misrepresentation, which is rarely imposed. The committee considered forming a study committee to explore potential solutions without violating federal law.

### **Farmers' Market Registration (HB 1090)**
The bill aimed to repeal the requirement for farmers' markets to register as trade names. The sponsor, Representative Cole, recommended that the bill be killed (voted "Inexpedient to Legislate") because recent amendments to related laws rendered the repeal unnecessary. The committee agreed to close the public hearing on the bill and indicated it would likely vote to kill it during the next executive session.

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The meeting extensively discussed the legalization and regulation of cannabis in New Hampshire, focusing on several key areas:

1. **Non-Refundable Application Fees**: The issue of non-refundable application fees for cannabis-related licenses was highlighted as a significant topic.

2. **Therapeutic Cannabis**: Provisions related to home-growing for therapeutic cannabis were removed to avoid confusion. The Liquor Commission, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the Therapeutic Cannabis Program (TCP) will collaborate on drafting legislation to potentially transfer the TCP to the Liquor Commission and regulate the sale of therapeutic cannabis in retail stores.

3. **Licensing and Market Control**: The bill proposes a cap of 15 retail cannabis licenses initially, with provisions for reassessment based on market needs. Geographic restrictions and zoning laws were also discussed.

4. **Advertising and Marketing**: Strict restrictions on cannabis advertising were proposed, including bans on social media marketing and promotions encouraging overconsumption. Consistent branding and store appearance were emphasized to maintain uniformity and prevent exposure to minors.

5. **Operational Control**: The committee debated the franchise model, which includes operational control over stores (e.g., design, pricing, and employee compensation), versus the "cannabis retail outlet" model, which reduces operational control while maintaining regulatory oversight. Concerns were raised about the franchise model potentially triggering federal franchise laws.

6. **Data Collection and Public Health**: The importance of establishing baseline data before cannabis legalization was emphasized. Michael Hol, the administrator of the therapeutic cannabis program with DHHS, advocated for data on childhood poisonings and accidental ingestions post-legalization. The bill includes provisions for inter-agency collaboration and data sharing.

7. **Public Safety and Youth Protection**: Measures to keep cannabis away from minors and out of schools were discussed, including packaging, labeling, and potency limits for cannabis products.

8. **Legal and Financial Considerations**: The bill addresses agency fees (initially set at 10%), the conversion of non-profit cannabis entities to for-profit status, and the intentional omission of provisions for annulment of past cannabis possession convictions.

9. **Governor’s Influence**: Legislators acknowledged the governor's influence, as past cannabis bills were vetoed. The current bill aims to align with the governor’s guidelines to avoid another veto.

10. **Subcommittee Scheduling**: Subcommittees were planned to address early bills, including the cannabis bill, which might require additional meetings.

### **Data Collection on Motor Vehicles and Cannabis**
The committee discussed the lack of data on motor vehicles and the need for baseline data before cannabis legalization. Representatives debated the roles of the Department of Safety and DHHS in data collection, with Hol emphasizing the importance of inter-agency collaboration and data-sharing agreements. The committee agreed to revisit and amend specific paragraphs related to data collection.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the complexities of addressing service animal misrepresentation within federal legal constraints, streamlining outdated state regulations, and implementing a state-controlled cannabis system. The discussions reflected a cautious approach to cannabis legalization, balancing operational control, federal risks, public health, and market development. The committee emphasized the need for inter-agency collaboration, baseline data collection, and a slow rollout to ensure public safety and avoid overwhelming the market.
