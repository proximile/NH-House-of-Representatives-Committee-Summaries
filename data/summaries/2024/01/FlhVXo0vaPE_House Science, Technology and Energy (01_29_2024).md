**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (01/29/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 29, 2024, to discuss several key pieces of legislation focused on energy, technology, and public utilities. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including advanced nuclear reactors, fiber optic service restoration, utility planning, property owner rights, net energy metering, and grid reliability. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Advanced Nuclear Reactors (House Bill 1465)**
- **Purpose**: The bill updates existing statutes to assign the Department of Energy (DOE) and other state agencies the responsibility to study advanced nuclear reactor technology and its potential implementation in New Hampshire.
- **Discussion**:
  - The bill modernizes outdated terminology and aligns with federal definitions of advanced nuclear reactors, emphasizing their safety, scalability, and potential for job creation.
  - Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact, particularly the cost of hiring experts or creating new positions, though the sponsor argued that most departments could handle the responsibilities with existing resources.
  - The DOE expressed neutrality but noted that absorbing the new responsibilities might require repurposing federal funds and reducing other programmatic activities.
  - The bill aims to position New Hampshire as a leader in nuclear technology and educate policymakers and the public about its benefits.

---

### **2. Fiber Optic Service Restoration (House Bill 1508)**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires fiber optic service providers to prioritize restoring service for public safety and health organizations during disruptions.
- **Discussion**:
  - Introduced after a service disruption in Littleton, NH, the bill seeks to address delays that affected public safety operations.
  - Concerns were raised about the state’s ability to regulate fiber optic services, which are largely overseen by federal authorities.
  - The DOE and industry stakeholders opposed the bill, citing ambiguous definitions of “public safety” and “public health organizations” and arguing that existing protocols already prioritize these entities.

---

### **3. Integrated Electric Distribution and Transmission Plans (House Bill 1431)**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires electric utilities to submit 10-year integrated distribution and transmission plans every five years, emphasizing public input and oversight.
- **Discussion**:
  - The bill aims to ensure safe, reliable, and cost-effective energy systems while addressing future demands like electrification and grid modernization.
  - Concerns were raised about jurisdictional issues, potential litigation, and the impact on ratepayers.
  - Supporters, including Eversource, argued that the bill provides a necessary framework for long-term planning, while opponents, including the DOE, viewed it as redundant and costly.

---

### **4. Property Owner Opt-Out of Public Utilities (House Bill 1576)**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows property owners with functioning wells and septic systems to opt out of connecting to new public utilities.
- **Discussion**:
  - Proponents argued that property owners should not be forced into costly connections if their private systems are functional and environmentally sound.
  - The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES) opposed the bill, citing conflicts with existing statutes and concerns about water quality and local control.
  - Technical issues, such as the bill’s placement under RSA 362, were also discussed, with suggestions to move it to RSA 149 (sewer and water).

---

### **5. Net Energy Metering and Municipal Aggregations (House Bill 1600 FN)**
- **Purpose**: The bill clarifies that municipal hosts (e.g., solar or landfill gas projects) can offset the load of municipal or county aggregations rather than default utility service.
- **Discussion**:
  - The bill promotes local renewable energy projects and avoids cost shifts to default service ratepayers.
  - Challenges include load settlement issues and inconsistent data reporting by utilities.
  - Stakeholders, including the Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire, supported the bill, while utilities and the New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed it due to implementation concerns.

---

### **6. Grid Reliability and Non-Carbon-Emitting Energy (House Bill 1644-FN)**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires the DOE to investigate the benefits of supporting clean or non-carbon-emitting power generation, particularly nuclear energy.
- **Discussion**:
  - The bill addresses grid reliability concerns highlighted by ISO New England and NERC, emphasizing nuclear energy’s dispatchability and non-carbon-emitting qualities.
  - Concerns were raised about the bill’s broad scope and the DOE’s capacity to conduct the investigation without additional funding.
  - The sponsor is open to narrowing the bill’s focus to nuclear energy and refining its language.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Energy Planning and Innovation**: Discussions emphasized the need for comprehensive, forward-looking energy planning to address future demands, sustainability, and reliability. Bills like HB 1431 and HB 1465 highlighted the importance of integrating new technologies like advanced nuclear reactors and renewable energy into the state’s energy strategy.
2. **Regulatory and Fiscal Challenges**: Concerns about jurisdictional authority, implementation costs, and regulatory clarity were recurring themes. Stakeholders questioned the feasibility of proposed changes and their impact on ratepayers.
3. **Public Safety and Property Rights**: Bills like HB 1508 and HB 1576 focused on balancing public safety and property owner rights with regulatory oversight and environmental protections.
4. **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Testimony from utilities, environmental groups, and businesses underscored the importance of transparency, accountability, and collaboration in energy planning and policy development.
5. **Grid Reliability and Clean Energy**: The meeting highlighted the growing importance of grid reliability and the role of non-carbon-emitting energy sources, particularly nuclear energy, in New Hampshire’s energy transition.

### **Next Steps**
The committee will continue to refine and amend the discussed bills, addressing concerns raised during the hearing. Key areas of focus include narrowing the scope of investigations, ensuring fiscal responsibility, and balancing stakeholder interests. The committee also plans to hold work sessions to consolidate related bills and streamline efforts.

Overall, the meeting reflected New Hampshire’s commitment to modernizing its energy infrastructure, addressing future challenges, and promoting innovation while balancing regulatory, fiscal, and environmental considerations.
