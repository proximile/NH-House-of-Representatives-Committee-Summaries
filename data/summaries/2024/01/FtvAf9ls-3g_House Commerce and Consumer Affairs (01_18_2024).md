### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/18/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 18, 2024, to discuss several bills addressing healthcare, consumer protection, and insurance practices. The meeting featured detailed debates on legislative proposals, with a focus on improving access to essential medical services, reducing financial burdens on patients, and addressing systemic issues in healthcare billing and coverage. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

#### **1. House Bill 1236: Repealing a Defunct Commission**
- **Presenter**: Representative John Hunt
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to repeal a commission established in 2019. However, Hunt discovered that the commission’s statute does not exist, leading to confusion about its legal standing. Legal counsel suggested that, since the commission operated as if it were legally established, passing the repeal might be necessary to formally expunge it from records.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated whether to pass the bill or let it die, given the uncertainty surrounding the commission’s legal status.

#### **2. House Bill 1225: Conflicts of Interest in the Prescription Drug Affordability Board**
- **Presenter**: Representative Gary Merchant
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses conflicts of interest within the Prescription Drug Affordability Board. An amendment proposes involving the board’s attorney as an arbitrator in conflict resolution.
- **Discussion**: Committee members raised concerns about the attorney’s neutrality and suggested refining the amendment to ensure fairness.

#### **3. House Bill 1365: Promoting Competition in the Biologics Market**
- **Presenter**: Representative Gary Merchant
- **Purpose**: The bill allows pharmacists to substitute biosimilar drugs deemed interchangeable by the FDA, aiming to reduce drug costs.
- **Discussion**: The committee questioned the therapeutic equivalence of biosimilars and their potential impact on patient health. Merchant emphasized FDA approval as a safeguard, and the bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review.

#### **4. House Bill 1296: Eliminating Cost-Sharing for Diagnostic Breast Cancer Screenings**
- **Purpose**: The bill removes out-of-pocket costs for follow-up diagnostic imaging after an abnormal mammogram, aiming to improve early detection of breast cancer.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Advocates, including breast cancer survivors and medical professionals, highlighted the financial and emotional toll of diagnostic costs, emphasizing the importance of early detection.
  - **Opposition**: Insurance representatives (e.g., AHIP) raised concerns about increased premiums and the bill’s limited scope (applying only to fully insured plans).
  - **Comparative Analysis**: The bill aligns with similar legislation in 20 other states, supported by the American Cancer Society.
- **Outcome**: The committee acknowledged the bill’s potential to save lives but will further evaluate its financial implications.

#### **5. House Bill 1571: Diabetes Device Affordability Act**
- **Purpose**: The bill mandates coverage of glucose monitoring devices (e.g., continuous glucose monitors) for all individuals with diabetes, regardless of insulin use, and caps out-of-pocket costs at $30 for a 30-day supply.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Advocates, including diabetes educators and patients, stressed the life-saving benefits of glucose monitoring and the high costs of diabetes care.
  - **Opposition**: Insurance representatives warned of increased premiums and the bill’s limited applicability to fully insured plans.
  - **State Precedents**: The bill is modeled after similar legislation in six states, including Rhode Island.
- **Outcome**: The committee will continue to refine the bill, balancing access to essential devices with cost concerns.

#### **6. House Bill 1081: Ambulance Service Billing Practices**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires insurance companies to reimburse ambulance service providers directly, rather than sending checks to patients, to reduce confusion and ensure timely payments.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Ambulance associations and fire chiefs argued that the bill simplifies billing and protects patients from being caught in payment disputes.
  - **Opposition**: Insurance representatives claimed that sending checks to patients incentivizes ambulance providers to join networks.
  - **Legislative Context**: Ground ambulance services were excluded from the **No Surprises Act**, but federal changes may address this gap in the future.
- **Outcome**: The bill is seen as a step toward fairness, but broader legislative action may be needed to fully resolve billing issues.
