**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Meeting (01/18/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 18, 2024, to discuss several bills addressing law enforcement practices, public safety, and individual rights. The meeting featured robust debates on topics ranging from sheriffs’ authority and resisting arrest to parental rights, torture prohibition, and gender-affirming care for minors. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Law Enforcement Authority and Resisting Arrest**
1. **House Bill 1017 (Sheriffs’ Authority and Federal Oversight)**  
   - **Sponsor (Rep. Mike Belcher)**: The bill sought to grant sheriffs expanded powers, including the ability to deputize individuals during emergencies and oversee federal law enforcement actions in New Hampshire. It proposed categorizing deputy sheriffs into two groups: those for process service and special deputies for emergencies.  
   - **Opposition**: The NH Sheriffs’ Association, led by Sheriff Bill Wright, opposed the bill, citing liability concerns, lack of training for deputized individuals, and the absence of arrest powers for special deputies. Critics also questioned the practicality of overseeing federal law enforcement and warned of potential conflicts with the Posse Comitatus Act.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 20-0 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," effectively killing it.

2. **House Bill 1026 (Resisting Arrest)**  
   - **Sponsor (Rep. Unknown)**: The bill aimed to provide an affirmative defense for resisting arrest if the arrest was later deemed unlawful, arguing that individuals have a natural right to self-defense against wrongful police actions.  
   - **Opposition**: Law enforcement officials, including Chief Charles Ratas, expressed concerns that the bill could encourage violence against officers, particularly in situations involving intoxication or mental health crises. Prosecutors noted that existing law (RSA 594:5) requires individuals to submit to arrest regardless of its legality.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 20-0 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

### **Prohibition of Torture**
3. **House Bill 1372 (Prohibition of Torture)**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill sought to define and prohibit torture, including withholding medical care, aligning with federal laws that apply outside the U.S.  
   - **Debate**:  
     - **Support**: Representative Wheeler strongly opposed torture, referencing past U.S. actions at Guantanamo Bay and emphasized the need to address such issues.  
     - **Concerns**: Critics argued that New Hampshire’s existing assault statutes already cover acts that could be considered torture, making the bill redundant. The bill’s language, particularly around "severe mental pain and suffering," was criticized for being vague and undefined.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 17-3 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

### **Parental Rights and Child Welfare**
4. **House Bill 1012 (Endangering the Welfare of a Child)**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aimed to clarify RSA 639:3, which addresses child endangerment, by protecting parents’ rights to make parenting decisions while ensuring children’s safety. It proposed specific criteria for determining when a parenting decision should be considered criminal.  
   - **Support**: Advocates, including Representative Leah Kushman, argued that the current statute is overly vague and has been used to criminalize parents for decisions like allowing children to walk to school or use farm equipment. Supporters emphasized the need for clear guidelines to prevent arbitrary prosecutions.  
   - **Concerns**: Opponents, including prosecutors, noted that the statute is typically applied in clear cases of danger, such as drunk driving with children. They cautioned against weakening protections for children.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee discussed refining the bill’s language to balance parental rights with child safety.

### **Gender-Affirming Care for Minors**
5. **House Bill 1011 (Prohibition of Male Genital Mutilation)**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill sought to ban gender-affirming surgeries and treatments for transgender minors, with exceptions for circumcision at birth with parental consent.  
   - **Opposition**:  
     - **Medical Professionals**: Testified that gender-affirming care is life-saving for transgender youth, reducing suicide rates and supported by major medical associations. They warned that the bill’s broad language could unintentionally ban treatments like chemotherapy.  
     - **Parents and Advocates**: Shared personal stories of transgender children who benefited from gender-affirming care, arguing that the bill would criminalize loving parents and providers.  
     - **Legal Experts**: Highlighted that the bill is unconstitutional, violating equal protection, parental rights, and religious freedom.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee chair noted that the bill’s sponsor requested it be "killed," and the committee was likely to vote against it.

### **EMS Licensing and Discipline**
6. **House Bill 1330 (EMS Licensing and Discipline)**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposed changes to the EMS disciplinary system, including creating an advisory panel to review license suspensions and renewals.  
   - **Discussion**: Testimony highlighted concerns about delays in investigations and the need for more oversight in disciplinary decisions. The Department of Safety opposed the original bill but supported amendments to streamline the process.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee considered amendments to improve the bill.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Law Enforcement Authority**: Bills expanding sheriffs’ powers and addressing resisting arrest were opposed due to concerns about liability, officer safety, and redundancy with existing laws.  
- **Parental Rights vs. Child Safety**: Discussions on child endangerment highlighted the need for clearer legal standards to balance parental autonomy with child welfare.  
- **Torture Prohibition**: While there was strong opposition to torture, the bill was deemed redundant and poorly defined.  
- **Gender-Affirming Care**: Testimonies overwhelmingly opposed the bill banning gender-affirming care, emphasizing its potential harm to transgender youth, families, and medical providers, as well as its legal and ethical flaws.  
- **EMS Oversight**: The committee considered amendments to improve the EMS disciplinary process.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of clarity in legislation, the need to avoid redundant or vague laws, and the challenges of balancing individual rights with public safety.
