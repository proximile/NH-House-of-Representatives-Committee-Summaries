**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (January 10, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 10, 2024, to discuss several bills and issues related to criminal justice and public safety. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including body-worn cameras (BWCs), vehicle inspections, boating safety, DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) cases, and evidence storage. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions:

### **1. Body-Worn Cameras (HB 1021)**  
**Prime Sponsor (Rep. Hines):**  
- Rep. Hines, a criminal defense attorney, introduced **HB 1021** to enhance transparency and accountability by ensuring defendants have access to BWC footage.  
- The bill aims to prevent the destruction of evidence, allow officers to use BWCs even when not in uniform, and prohibit muting BWCs during conversations with other officers to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence.  

**Opposition from Law Enforcement (Captain Davy):**  
- The State Police opposed the bill, citing concerns about muting BWCs during tactical discussions to protect sensitive information and officer safety.  
- They highlighted privacy risks for victims, witnesses, and third parties if BWC footage is publicly disseminated.  
- Logistical challenges, such as the volume of footage and the need for redaction, were also raised.  

**County Attorney’s Perspective (Stephen Andress):**  
- The County Attorney’s Office emphasized the need for privacy protections and suggested that access to BWC footage should be accompanied by protective orders to prevent misuse.  

**Key Issues:**  
- **Access to Footage:** The bill ensures defendants can obtain and share BWC footage, but opponents argue this could violate privacy.  
- **Muting BWCs:** The bill prohibits muting, which opponents say is necessary for tactical and safety reasons.  
- **Uniform Requirement:** The bill repeals the requirement that officers must be in uniform to use BWCs.  
- **Privacy and Redaction:** Opponents stressed the need for redaction and privacy safeguards.  

**Fiscal and Logistical Concerns:**  
- Managing and redacting BWC footage would require significant resources, including additional staff and time.  

### **2. Vehicle Inspections (HB 1061)**  
**Inspection Failures and Enforcement:**  
- The discussion focused on the financial burden faced by low-income individuals whose vehicles fail inspections, particularly for non-safety-related issues.  
- Current law allows officers to stop vehicles solely for inspection violations, disproportionately affecting those who cannot afford repairs.  

**Proposed Changes:**  
- **HB 1061** proposes making inspection violations a **secondary offense**, meaning officers could only issue tickets if the driver is stopped for another violation (e.g., speeding).  
- This change aims to reduce the financial burden on low-income drivers and prevent a cycle of fines and license suspensions.  

**Impact on Low-Income Individuals:**  
- Testimonies highlighted how fines for uninspected vehicles can lead to license suspensions, exacerbating financial struggles and making it harder for individuals to work.  

**Rejection Stickers and Safety Concerns:**  
- There was debate about whether vehicles should have rejection stickers to differentiate between safety and non-safety issues, with some arguing that safety-related failures should remain a primary enforcement concern.  

### **3. Boating Safety**  
**Negligent vs. Reckless Operation:**  
- The discussion addressed the disparity between how negligent and reckless boat operation is handled.  
- Currently, **negligent operation of a boat** is a misdemeanor, while similar motor vehicle offenses are violations.  
- A bill was proposed to align boating offenses with motor vehicle laws, making **negligent operation a violation** and introducing **reckless operation as a misdemeanor**.  

**License Suspensions:**  
- The bill includes provisions for suspending both driver’s licenses and boating privileges for reckless boat operators.  
- Concerns were raised about the timing of suspensions, as offenders might delay convictions to avoid boating season suspensions.  

**Support for the Bill:**  
- Law enforcement officials supported the bill, stating it would provide more appropriate charging options and reduce unnecessary court cases for minor offenses.  

### **4. DWI Blood Sample Storage**  
**Current Policy:**  
- Blood samples in DWI cases are destroyed after 30 days, which destroys potentially exculpatory evidence while cases are still ongoing.  

**Proposed Changes:**  
- A bill was introduced to retain blood samples until the case is resolved, allowing defense attorneys to request independent testing if needed.  

**Fiscal Impact:**  
- Extending the storage period to six or nine months was deemed feasible without significant financial impact, as most cases are resolved within that timeframe.  

**Proposed Amendments:**  
- The committee discussed extending the storage period and addressing logistical challenges, such as notifying the lab when cases are resolved.  

### **5. Disorderly Conduct Statute (HB 125)**  
**Proposed Changes:**  
- **HB 125** seeks to repeal the "fighting words" doctrine from the disorderly conduct statute, arguing that it infringes on First Amendment rights.  

**Opposition:**  
- Law enforcement expressed concerns that removing this provision could lead to increased public altercations and reduced officer safety.  

### **6. Prostitution Statute Amendments (HB 1022)**  
**Proposed Changes:**  
- Rep. Hines proposed reducing some prostitution offenses from misdemeanors to violations to help individuals with criminal records seek employment.  

**Opposition:**  
- The New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence argued that the bill could reduce protections for vulnerable individuals and increase exploitation.  

### **Key Takeaways:**  
- **Body-Worn Cameras:** The bill aims to enhance transparency but faces opposition over privacy and logistical concerns.  
- **Vehicle Inspections:** The proposed change to make inspection violations a secondary offense seeks to reduce the burden on low-income drivers.  
- **Boating Safety:** The bill aligns boating offenses with motor vehicle laws and addresses license suspension issues.  
- **DWI Blood Samples:** Extending the storage period for blood samples ensures defendants have access to potentially exculpatory evidence.  
- **Disorderly Conduct:** The repeal of the "fighting words" doctrine raises concerns about public safety and officer protection.  
- **Prostitution Statute:** Amendments to reduce penalties for prostitution offenses aim to help individuals with criminal records but face opposition over exploitation risks.  

The meeting concluded with subcommittees formed to further examine several bills, with a request to report back within two weeks. The discussions highlighted the need to balance public safety, civil liberties, and the rights of vulnerable populations.
