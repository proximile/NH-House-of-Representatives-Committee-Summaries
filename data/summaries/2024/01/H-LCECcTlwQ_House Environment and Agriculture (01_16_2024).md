**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (01/16/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Environment and Agriculture Committee meeting on January 16, 2024, addressed several critical issues related to organic farming certification, equine welfare, and the sale of puppies in pet stores. The discussions centered on three main legislative proposals: **HB 1184**, **HB 1618**, and **HB 1680**, along with a bill addressing inhumane equine practices.

### **Organic Farming Certification: HB 1184 and HB 1618**
The committee focused on two bills aimed at addressing the state’s Organic Certification Program, which has faced significant challenges in recent years.

1. **HB 1184: Funding and Staffing for Organic Certification**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to appropriate $220,000 to fund 1.5 full-time positions within the Department of Agriculture to manage the Organic Certification Program, ensuring compliance with USDA National Organic Program (NOP) standards.
   - **Challenges**: The program has struggled with funding and staffing since its inception in the 1980s. In 2021, compliance issues led to the loss of certification for animal agriculture and processing scopes, leaving only crop and produce certification. Recent USDA audits highlighted the need for structural improvements.
   - **Farmer Testimonies**: Organic farmers, including David Trumble and Joyce Ford, emphasized the importance of maintaining an affordable and accessible certification program. They expressed concerns that proposed fee increases (up to $4,900 for some farms) could drive farmers to out-of-state certifiers, potentially leading to the program's collapse.
   - **Support**: Farmers and organizations like NOA New Hampshire advocated for a sliding scale fee structure based on gross income rather than acreage, making certification more equitable. They highlighted the economic and environmental benefits of organic farming, including soil health, water quality, and climate resilience.

2. **HB 1618: Mandating a Cooperative Agreement with USDA**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill aims to require the Department of Agriculture to maintain a cooperative agreement with the USDA to provide organic certification services, including all four scopes (crops, wild crops, livestock, and processing/handling).
   - **Testimony**: Representative Dan Wolf, the bill’s sponsor, argued that changing the statute from “may” to “shall” would ensure the program’s continuation and restore all four scopes. Supporters stressed the economic and environmental benefits of organic farming and the challenges of seeking certification from out-of-state agencies.

### **Equine Welfare: Banning Inhumane Practices**
The committee also discussed a bill aimed at banning specific inhumane practices in horse training and competition, such as **gingering**, **tail nicking**, **tail blocking**, and **hoof soring**.

1. **Practices Described**:
   - **Gingering**: Inserting irritants like ginger into a horse’s anus or vagina to force a high tail carriage.
   - **Tail Nicking**: Cutting tendons in the tail to permanently lift it.
   - **Tail Blocking**: Injecting nerve-blocking agents to prevent tail movement.
   - **Hoof Soring**: Applying chemicals to the hooves to induce a high-stepping gait.

2. **Support and Opposition**:
   - **Support**: Representative Ellen Reed and organizations like the Humane Society and PETA argued that these practices are cruel and unnecessary, causing pain and long-term harm to horses.
   - **Opposition**: Some equestrian competitors, like George Cook, argued that the bill is unnecessary because these practices are already banned under federal law and by equestrian organizations. They expressed concerns about overburdening law enforcement and the potential for vague enforcement.

### **Puppy Mill Legislation: HB 1680**
The committee discussed **HB 1680**, a bill aimed at eliminating puppy mills by restricting the sale of puppies in pet stores.

1. **Bill Overview**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prevent New Hampshire from becoming a hub for puppy sales and encourages responsible breeding and adoption from shelters.
   - **Support**: Kurt Aronberg from the Humane Society of the United States supported the bill, highlighting the decline in commercial breeding due to similar laws in other states. He emphasized the importance of preventing the import of puppies from inhumane sources.
   - **Opposition**: Commissioner Jasper of the Department of Agriculture opposed the bill, arguing that it unfairly targets pet stores without addressing the broader issue of animals imported by shelters and rescues.

2. **Public Testimony**:
   - **Support**: Testifiers shared personal experiences of rescuing sick puppies from pet stores, emphasizing the need for humane treatment of animals.
   - **Opposition**: Representatives from the pet industry and dog owner organizations argued that pet stores are already highly regulated in New Hampshire. They expressed concerns that banning pet store sales would limit consumer choice and increase the risk of scams and disease.

3. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Suggestions were made to focus on enforcing existing laws, improving sourcing transparency, and addressing issues with rescue organizations that may also source animals from problematic breeders.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
1. **Organic Farming**: The discussions underscored the importance of maintaining a viable organic certification program in New Hampshire, with calls for adequate funding, staffing, and equitable fee structures to support local agriculture and environmental sustainability.
2. **Equine Welfare**: The bill to ban inhumane equine practices highlighted the need for legislative action to ensure the ethical treatment of horses, despite opposition from some equestrian competitors.
3. **Puppy Mills**: The debate over HB 1680 reflected a strong push to curb the sale of puppy mill dogs in New Hampshire, with concerns about the bill’s scope, potential impact on small businesses, and the need for clearer definitions and enforcement mechanisms.

The committee planned further work sessions to deliberate on these bills, emphasizing the need for balanced solutions that address animal welfare, consumer protection, and economic interests.
