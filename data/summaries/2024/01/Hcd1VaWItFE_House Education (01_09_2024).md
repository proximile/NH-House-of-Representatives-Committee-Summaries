### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/09/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss several key bills related to higher education, focusing on free speech, due process, hazing prevention, higher education transparency, diversity initiatives, and community service programs. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from each segment:

---

### **Free Speech and Freedom of Association (HB 1305)**  
The committee extensively debated **HB 1305**, which aims to protect free speech and freedom of association on public university campuses. The bill seeks to codify First Amendment protections, ensuring that universities cannot discriminate against student groups based on viewpoint when allocating resources or recognizing organizations. Key provisions include banning "free speech zones," establishing public forums in outdoor campus areas, and allowing belief-based organizations to require leaders and members to share their core beliefs.  

- **Support**: Testifiers from organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression emphasized the need for statutory protections to prevent administrative overreach and viewpoint-based discrimination.
- **Concerns**: University representatives raised issues with the bill’s narrow definition of "materially and substantially disrupts," arguing it could limit their ability to manage campus events effectively. They also highlighted the importance of their permitting process, which they view as an educational tool for ensuring safety.
- **Amendments**: The bill’s sponsor expressed openness to amending language to address concerns while maintaining core principles.

### **Due Process Protections (HB 1288)**  
**HB 1288** proposes to establish due process rights for students, student organizations, and faculty facing disciplinary actions at state higher education institutions. The bill outlines specific rights, including notice, presumption of innocence, cross-examination of witnesses, and live hearings.  

- **Federal Context**: Sponsor Representative Glenn Cordelli highlighted pending federal Title IX rule changes that could roll back due process protections, arguing that New Hampshire should set a higher standard.
- **Opposition**: The University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the Community College System opposed the bill, citing concerns about its one-size-fits-all approach, increased administrative costs, and potential to overburden institutions with minor infractions.
- **Amendments Suggested**: Opponents recommended excluding employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and clarifying that the bill applies only to serious disciplinary cases.

---

### **Hazing Prevention (HB 1305)**  
The committee discussed an amended version of **HB 1305**, which strengthens hazing laws and requires educational institutions to provide hazing prevention programs and publicly report incidents annually.  

- **Key Changes**: The amendment removed unenforceable requirements, extended the statute of limitations for hazing offenses, and clarified penalties, with hazing resulting in serious injury or death classified as a Class B felony.
- **Support**: USNH supports the bill, aligning with their existing practices, such as reporting incidents to law enforcement and providing training during orientation.
- **Opposition**: The Community College System expressed concerns about vague language, potential costs, and privacy issues.

---

### **Higher Education Transparency (HB 1436)**  
**HB 1436** requires higher education institutions to maintain statistical information on their websites, such as debt levels, job prospects, and tuition costs, to promote transparency for students and families.  

- **Concerns**: Opponents argued the bill is duplicative of federal efforts (e.g., the College Scorecard) and would impose additional costs on institutions.
- **Debate**: Questions arose about the feasibility of collecting employment data and maintaining 99% website uptime.

---

### **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (HB 1690)**  
**HB 1690** seeks to prohibit the use of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements in hiring, promotion, graduation, or admissions processes in higher education.  

- **Purpose**: Supporters argue DEI statements can be used to assess ideological alignment rather than merit, leading to discrimination.
- **Opposition**: Representatives from UNH and Keene State emphasized that DEI statements ensure candidates can engage respectfully with diverse students and colleagues, fostering inclusive environments.
- **Concerns**: Critics highlighted the bill’s vagueness, potential for frivolous litigation, and risk of stifling academic excellence.

### **Community Service Tuition Credit Program (HB 1534)**  
**HB 1534** proposes a program allowing high school and college students to earn tuition credits by volunteering at state-approved sites, such as nursing homes and food banks.  

- **Details**: Students could earn up to $2,500 per year for 100 hours of service, renewable for up to 8 years (total $20,000).
- **Goals**: The program aims to reduce student loan debt, promote community service, and address workforce shortages by encouraging students to stay and work in New Hampshire after graduation.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about funding, eligibility, and the potential for expanding the program to include private colleges.

---

### **Higher Education Consolidation (HB 1450)**  
**HB 1450** establishes a commission to study the strategic alignment of public higher education in New Hampshire, focusing on improving efficiency and addressing declining enrollment trends.  

- **Background**: The bill mirrors the governor’s executive order creating a task force to study higher education alignment.
- **Challenges**: Declining K-12 enrollment is projected to continue, impacting higher education enrollment. The state faces competition from institutions like UMass and the University of Maine.
- **Proposed Solutions**: The bill emphasizes collaboration between community colleges and four-year institutions, including dual enrollment programs and workforce development initiatives.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing institutional needs with student rights, addressing emerging challenges in higher education, and promoting transparency and inclusivity. Key themes included the importance of free speech, due process protections, hazing prevention, and innovative approaches to reducing student debt and fostering community engagement.
