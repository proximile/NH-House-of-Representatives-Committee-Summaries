**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/09/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss several key bills aimed at addressing issues in higher education, including free speech, due process, hazing, transparency, and community service. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Free Speech and Due Process Protections**
1. **House Bill 1288**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill seeks to establish robust due process rights for students, student organizations, and faculty facing disciplinary actions at state higher education institutions. Provisions include the right to notice, live hearings, cross-examination of witnesses, and the presumption of innocence.
   - **Context**: Introduced by **Representative Glenn Cordelli**, the bill responds to potential federal Title IX changes that could weaken due process protections.
   - **Opposition**: The **University System of New Hampshire (USNH)** and the **Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH)** opposed the bill, arguing that their existing processes already ensure due process. They expressed concerns about increased administrative burdens, costs, and the inclusion of minor infractions like reprimands under the same stringent procedures.
   - **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included excluding employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, clarifying the definition of reprimands, and focusing on serious disciplinary matters.

2. **House Bill 1305**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill aims to protect free speech and association rights on public college campuses. It prohibits free speech zones, ensures student organizations can select leaders aligned with their values, and allows spontaneous speech without unnecessary red tape.
   - **Support**: Organizations like the **Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE)** and **Alliance Defending Freedom** testified in favor, citing cases where students faced administrative hurdles for exercising their First Amendment rights.
   - **Concerns**: USNH raised issues with the bill’s narrow definition of "materially and substantially disrupts" and its broad definition of "Campus Community," which could complicate campus management and safety.
   - **Controversial Discussions**: The committee debated whether taxpayer or student activity funds should support groups with extreme or abhorrent views, emphasizing the need to protect all speech equally under the Constitution.

### **Hazing Prevention**
- **House Bill 1657**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill updates New Hampshire’s hazing laws to strengthen prevention, education, and reporting requirements. It introduces mandatory hazing prevention training, extends the statute of limitations for misdemeanors, and classifies aggravated hazing as a Class B felony.
   - **Support**: USNH supports the bill, noting its alignment with existing practices and its focus on addressing hazing in unrecognized organizations.
   - **Concerns**: Questions arose about defining emotional harm and social exclusion in the context of hazing, as well as the estimated $400,000 cost for developing training modules.

### **Higher Education Efficiency and Transparency**
1. **House Bill 1450**:
   - **Purpose**: Proposes the establishment of a commission to study the consolidation and alignment of public higher education systems in New Hampshire to address declining enrollment, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.
   - **Context**: The bill is seen as a placeholder to support ongoing task force efforts, focusing on strategic alignment rather than merger.

2. **House Bill 1436**:
   - **Purpose**: Requires higher education institutions to maintain detailed statistical information on their websites, including enrollment, costs, graduation rates, and employment outcomes.
   - **Opposition**: USNH and the New Hampshire College University Council testified against the bill, arguing that it duplicates federal transparency initiatives like the College Scorecard and would impose unnecessary costs.

### **Community Service Tuition Credit**
- **House Bill 1534**:
   - **Purpose**: Introduced by **Representative Schultz**, this bill proposes a program where students can earn **$2,500 in tuition credits** per year by volunteering **100 hours** at state-approved sites. The credits, renewable for up to 8 years, aim to reduce student loan debt, encourage community service, and retain students in New Hampshire post-graduation.
   - **Discussion**: Committee members raised questions about funding (estimated at **$25 million annually**), eligibility for private colleges, and whether high school students already required to perform community service for graduation could qualify. Suggestions included making the program need-based and exploring partnerships with private colleges.

### **Anti-Discrimination in Hiring and Admissions**
- **House Bill 1690**:
   - **Purpose**: Prohibits the use of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements in hiring and admissions processes, arguing that they are a form of ideological discrimination. Inspired by the recent Supreme Court ruling against Harvard University’s admissions practices.
   - **Opposition**: Representatives from UNH and Keene State College testified against the bill, stating that it is redundant, unclear, and could lead to frivolous lawsuits. They emphasized that DEI statements assess candidates’ ability to engage respectfully with diverse communities, not to discriminate.
   - **Concerns**: The bill’s vagueness, potential for costly litigation, and severe penalties for non-compliance were major concerns.

### **Dual and Concurrent Enrollment Program**
- The committee discussed the expansion of the Dual and Concurrent Enrollment Program, which allows high school students to earn college credits. Initially limited to grades 11-12 and STEM courses, the program has expanded to include grades 10-12 and a broader range of subjects. The discussion emphasized starting small and gradually expanding the program over time.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**
- **Balancing Protections and Practicality**: Many bills aimed to balance fundamental rights (e.g., free speech, due process) with practical concerns about administrative burdens, costs, and implementation.
- **Amendments and Collaboration**: Committee members and stakeholders expressed willingness to work on amendments to address concerns, particularly for bills like HB 1288, HB 1305, and HB 1657.
- **Focus on Transparency and Efficiency**: Efforts to improve higher education transparency (HB 1436) and efficiency (HB 1450) were discussed, with a focus on avoiding duplication of federal efforts and reducing costs.
- **Innovative Solutions**: Bills like HB 1534 proposed innovative solutions to address student debt and workforce shortages through community service tuition credits.

The committee will continue to refine these bills, considering amendments and further discussions to ensure they effectively address the needs of New Hampshire’s education system.
