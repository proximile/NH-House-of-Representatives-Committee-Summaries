### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Children and Family Law (01/09/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Children and Family Law convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss a series of bills aimed at improving child welfare, family law, and child support systems. The meeting focused on addressing systemic inefficiencies, protecting vulnerable children, and ensuring fairness in family law enforcement. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and bills:

#### **Child Support and Enforcement**
1. **House Bill 1189**: This bill addresses the reporting of child support delinquencies to federal agencies, particularly in cases involving passport denials due to unpaid child support. Representative James Spain introduced the bill based on his personal experience of being denied a passport renewal for a minor arrearage ($3-$6) below the federal threshold of $2,500. The bill seeks to ensure that only arrears meeting the federal threshold are reported and that specific dollar amounts are included in the data. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) testified that the state’s system is already federally compliant, but concerns were raised about transparency and the handling of temporary arrears caused by payment schedules.

2. **House Bill 1425**: This bill proposes prohibiting the suspension of driver’s licenses for non-payment of child support, arguing that such suspensions hinder individuals’ ability to work and meet their obligations. The Bureau of Child Support Services opposed the bill, citing federal mandates that require license suspensions as an enforcement tool. Non-compliance could result in the loss of significant federal funding. The Division of Motor Vehicles provided statistics showing that in 2023, 2,400 requests for license suspensions were made, with 258 enforced and 708 cleared before suspension.

3. **House Bill 1595**: This bill proposes reforms to child support guidelines, focusing on parenting time adjustments, medical and childcare costs, and the income shares methodology. The bill introduces a **1.5 multiplier model** for calculating child support based on parenting time, used by 22 other states, to reduce deviations and legal disputes. Testimonies highlighted the financial inequities faced by higher-earning parents with 50/50 custody, who often pay full support despite shared responsibilities. The committee acknowledged the bill’s complexity and will consider further refinements.

#### **Child Welfare and Protection**
1. **House Bill 1111**: This bill, reintroduced after being sent to interim study by the Senate, proposes penalties for knowingly false reports of child abuse or neglect. Representative Spain advocated for the bill to deter the weaponization of the system, emphasizing the need to protect families from malicious false accusations. The bill sets a high bar, requiring intent to harm and exempting mandatory reporters. Concerns were raised about a potential "chilling effect" on legitimate reports, but supporters argued it would balance child protection with the rights of accused individuals. The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) testified about the existing immunity for good-faith reporters and the department’s ability to screen out unfounded cases.

2. **House Bill 1590**: This bill mandates training for licensed physicians, advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants on identifying and reporting child abuse and neglect. Testimonies highlighted cases where abuse went unrecognized due to insufficient medical training. The bill requires healthcare providers to complete accredited training every two years, with the Granite State Children’s Alliance offering a voluntary three-hour course as a model. The committee expressed support for the bill, emphasizing the need to improve outcomes for vulnerable children.

3. **House Bill 1598**: This bill addresses the management of Social Security and veterans’ benefits for children in foster care. Currently, the state retains these benefits to reimburse foster care costs, but the bill proposes creating accounts to conserve these funds for the children until they leave foster care. The bill aims to provide resources for housing, education, and other needs when children age out of the system. The committee voted 12-1 in favor of moving the bill forward, acknowledging its potential to help children transition to adulthood with financial stability.

#### **Juvenile Justice and Homelessness**
1. **House Bill 1588**: This bill aligns New Hampshire’s Juvenile Justice statutes with the new upper age limit (22) for special education services. It ensures that students in residential treatment centers or foster care can continue receiving special education services until they age out. The committee expressed support but noted the need for additional resources to implement the bill.

2. **House Bill 1199**: This bill expands the Office of the Child Advocate’s role to address youth homelessness, focusing on individuals up to age 25. Advocates highlighted the high rates of youth homelessness and the mental health risks associated with it, including suicide. The bill aims to connect homeless youth with social services and protective factors to improve outcomes. Supporters emphasized the importance of addressing homelessness at a younger age to prevent chronic homelessness and reduce long-term costs.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Systemic Inefficiencies**: Several bills addressed gaps in the child support and child welfare systems, particularly in reporting, enforcement, and transparency.
- **Protecting Vulnerable Children**: Bills focused on improving medical training to identify abuse, managing benefits for foster children, and addressing youth homelessness.
- **Fairness in Family Law**: Reforms to child support guidelines and enforcement methods aimed to balance the rights and responsibilities of parents while ensuring the well-being of children.
- **Federal Compliance and Funding**: Discussions highlighted the tension between state reforms and federal mandates, particularly in child support enforcement and the potential loss of federal funding.

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to improving child welfare and family law systems in New Hampshire, with a focus on fairness, efficiency, and the protection of vulnerable populations. The committee will continue to evaluate the bills, consider amendments, and seek further testimony in subsequent sessions.
