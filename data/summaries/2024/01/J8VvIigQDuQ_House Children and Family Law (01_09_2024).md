**Summary of the New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Committee Meeting (January 9, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss several key bills addressing child welfare, family law, and support systems. The meeting featured robust debates, testimonies, and discussions on various legislative proposals, with a focus on ensuring fairness, protecting vulnerable populations, and aligning state practices with federal guidelines. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Child Support Reporting and Enforcement**
   - **House Bill 1189 (Child Support Delinquencies and Passport Denials):**  
     Representative James Spain introduced this bill to address inconsistencies in reporting child support arrears to federal agencies, particularly concerning passport denials. Spain shared a personal anecdote where he was denied a passport renewal due to minor arrears ($3 to $6), despite the federal threshold being $2,500. The bill proposes that the state must report arrears only if they meet the federal threshold and include the exact dollar amount.  
     The Bureau of Child Support Services testified that New Hampshire’s system is already compliant with federal guidelines, raising questions about the bill’s necessity. The committee deferred action, indicating a need for further discussion and potential amendments before the January 30th executive session.

   - **House Bill 1425 (Driver’s License Suspension in Child Support Cases):**  
     This bill seeks to prohibit the suspension of driver’s licenses in child support enforcement matters. Supporters argued that license suspensions hinder individuals’ ability to work and pay child support, while opponents warned of potential loss of federal funding. Testimonies included personal stories of individuals who lost their livelihoods due to license suspensions. The committee did not reach a decision, with further discussions planned.

### **2. Juvenile Justice and Special Education**
   - **House Bill 1588 (Juvenile Justice and Special Education):**  
     This bill aligns court jurisdiction with the upper age limits for special education (up to age 22), ensuring continuity of care for students with disabilities. Supporters emphasized the importance of providing consistent support, especially for those in residential treatment centers. The committee voted to pass the bill (OTP - Ought to Pass), acknowledging its alignment with federal special education laws and the need for adequate resources.

### **3. False Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect**
   - **House Bill 1111 (Penalties for False Reports):**  
     This bill proposes penalties for knowingly filing false reports of child abuse or neglect to the Department of Children and Families (DCF). Representative Spain highlighted that 28 states already have similar laws, and false reports waste resources and harm families. DCF officials expressed concerns about a potential chilling effect on reporting, fearing that penalties might discourage legitimate concerns. Testimonies included a personal story from Alicia Leus, whose granddaughter was removed from her family for 14 months due to a malicious false report. The committee debated the balance between deterring false reports and encouraging legitimate ones, with no immediate decision made.

### **4. Child Welfare and Family Reunification**
   - **House Bill 1598 (Social Security and Veterans' Benefits for Foster Children):**  
     This bill aims to conserve Social Security and veterans' benefits for children in foster care in trust accounts, rather than using them to reimburse the state for foster care costs. Supporters, including Representative Mary Jane Wallner and attorney Michelle Wangerin, emphasized the importance of providing resources for foster children when they age out of the system. The Department of Health and Human Services supported the bill but noted significant fiscal and administrative challenges. The committee voted to pass the bill (OTP), with further financial discussions planned in the finance committee.

### **5. Child Abuse Education for Healthcare Providers**
   - **House Bill 1590 (Mandatory Training for Medical Professionals):**  
     This bill mandates accredited training for licensed physicians, advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants on identifying and reporting child abuse and neglect. Testimonies from Child Advocate Cassandra Sanchez and child abuse pediatrician Dr. Reem Oral highlighted cases of missed diagnoses and the need for better training. The committee expressed strong support for the bill, with discussions focusing on ensuring the training is effective and accessible.

---

### **6. Youth Homelessness Services**
   - **House Bill 1199 (Youth Homelessness Services):**  
     This bill establishes a position within the Office of the Child Advocate to oversee programs for homeless youth. Testimonies emphasized the lack of services for homeless youth and the mental health impacts of homelessness. The bill passed with a 12-0 vote in the executive session.

---

### **7. Child Support Duration**
   - **House Bill 1282 (Child Support Duration):**  
     This bill clarifies when child support ends, particularly for children in high school or special education. The discussion addressed ambiguities in the current law and proposed linking the end of support to the completion of education, including homeschooling. Concerns were raised about the bill’s effective date and retroactive application, with further amendments planned.

---

### **8. Parenting Time and Child Support Adjustments**
   - **House Bill 1595 (Child Support Calculations Based on Parenting Time):**  
     This bill proposes adjustments to child support calculations using a **1.5 multiplier model** to account for shared parenting time, moving medical and childcare costs to add-on expenses, and adopting a full income shares methodology. Supporters argued the current system disproportionately burdens higher-income parents and discourages co-parenting. Opponents highlighted the complexity of child support calculations and recommended further study. The committee did not make an immediate decision, with a deadline of February 13th to advance the bill.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**
   - **Fairness and Compliance:** Many bills aimed to align New Hampshire’s practices with federal guidelines and ensure fairness in child support and family law matters.  
   - **Protecting Vulnerable Populations:** Discussions emphasized the need to protect foster children, homeless youth, and families affected by false reports or financial hardships.  
   - **Resource Allocation:** Several bills highlighted the need for additional resources, funding, and administrative support to implement proposed changes effectively.  
   - **Further Discussions:** The committee deferred action on several bills, indicating a need for amendments, additional input, and collaboration before final decisions.

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to improving child and family welfare while balancing policy goals with practical implementation challenges. Further discussions and executive sessions are planned to refine and advance the proposed legislation.
