### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (January 31, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 31, 2024, focused on several key healthcare-related bills, with discussions centered on midwifery, ambulance services, psychedelics, medication administration in assisted living facilities, and Medicaid coverage for transgender surgeries. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from each segment:

---

### Segment 1: **County Nursing Homes, Ambulance Services, and Midwifery**
1. **County Nursing Homes and Community Residences**: Representatives discussed the inclusion of County nursing home administrators in studies and addressed staffing ratios in community residences for individuals with developmental disabilities or acquired brain disorders, noting higher ratios compared to assisted living facilities.
2. **Ambulance Services and Billing (HB 1568)**: The bill proposes allowing ambulance providers to bill for services rendered even if the patient is not transported, particularly for cases like hypoglycemic diabetic patients. The fiscal impact and potential cost savings were debated, with emphasis on shifting costs from towns to federal reimbursement.
3. **Midwifery and Home Births (HB 1010)**: Representative Leah Kushman introduced a bill to expand midwifery access for higher-risk pregnancies, such as vaginal births after cesarean sections (VBACs), breech births, and multiples. Supporters argued that midwives are highly trained and that current regulations overly restrict their practice, forcing some women to give birth alone at home. Concerns were raised about the risks of VBACs, breech births, and multiple deliveries, as well as the need for informed consent and midwife certification.

### Segment 2: **Expanding Midwifery Care (HB 1010)**
1. **Support for Midwifery**: Advocates, including Representative Emily Phillips, shared personal experiences with midwifery and emphasized patient autonomy and the right to choose birth settings. They argued that midwives provide safe, low-risk maternity care and are skilled at identifying when to transfer patients to hospitals.
2. **Safety Concerns**: Opponents, including OB/GYNs and the New Hampshire Medical Society, raised concerns about the risks of high-risk pregnancies outside hospitals, such as uterine rupture, breech entrapment, and twin delivery complications. They stressed the importance of hospital safety nets and the dangers of delayed transfers in rural areas.
3. **Midwifery Council’s Position**: Beth Gabby of the New Hampshire Midwifery Council opposed the bill as written but expressed openness to further discussion, emphasizing the need for specialized training for handling high-risk pregnancies.

### Segment 3: **Therapeutic Use of Psychedelics (HB 1693) and Medication Administration (HB 1585)**
1. **Therapeutic Use of Psychedelics (HB 1693)**: Major Bill Bright of the New Hampshire State Police raised public safety concerns about allowing psychedelics outside clinical settings, citing risks like impaired driving and underage access. Representatives suggested an interim study to explore the use of psychedelics in controlled clinical settings.
2. **Medication Administration in Assisted Living Facilities (HB 1585)**: The bill aims to address staffing shortages by allowing unlicensed staff to assist with medication administration under certain conditions. Stakeholders recommended a study committee to develop a comprehensive solution, given the complexities of overlapping regulations and varying levels of care in facilities.

### Segment 4: **Medicaid Coverage for Transgender Surgeries (HB 1660) and Psychedelics (HB 1693)**
1. **Medicaid Coverage for Transgender Surgeries (HB 1660)**: Representative Jim Kofalt introduced a bill to exclude Medicaid coverage for gender reassignment surgeries for minors, aligning New Hampshire with 11 other states. Opponents argued that Medicaid should cover all medically necessary treatments and warned of a slippery slope that could restrict other care. Questions were raised about the bill’s scope, potential discrimination, and whether such surgeries are performed in New Hampshire.
2. **Therapeutic Use of Psychedelics (HB 1693)**: Representative Keith Ammon outlined the bill’s intent to address conditions like PTSD, depression, and addiction through the medical use of psychedelics. Discussions focused on the need for clinical oversight and the potential benefits for veterans and others with PTSD.

1. **Opposition to HB 1010**: Healthcare professionals, including OBGYNs and certified nurse midwives, opposed the bill, citing increased risks for maternal and infant mortality in home births, particularly for high-risk pregnancies. They emphasized the importance of hospital-based care and immediate access to emergency interventions.
