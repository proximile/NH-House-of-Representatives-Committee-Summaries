- **Purpose**: The bill allows ambulance providers to bill for on-scene treatment without transporting patients, addressing financial challenges for ambulance services.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - Current practices often require unnecessary transports to generate reimbursement, increasing costs and ER visits.
  - The fiscal note predicted increased ambulance reimbursement costs but suggested savings from avoided ER visits.

  - **Opponents**, including medical professionals, expressed concerns about the safety of high-risk home births, citing risks like postpartum hemorrhages, uterine ruptures, and neonatal complications. They emphasized the need for hospital resources in emergencies.
  - Testimonies included personal experiences from both sides, with some advocating for patient autonomy and others stressing the importance of evidence-based safety standards.
