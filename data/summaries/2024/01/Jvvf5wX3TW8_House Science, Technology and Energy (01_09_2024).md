**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (January 9, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss and vote on several bills and amendments related to energy, carbon credits, and environmental conservation. The meeting highlighted the committee's cautious approach to addressing complex issues, emphasizing the need for thorough analysis, stakeholder involvement, and clear communication. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

---

### **1. Carbon Credits and Forest Management**
- **House Bill 1697**: The committee debated a bill proposing a **two-year moratorium** on the sale of carbon credits from New Hampshire woodlands. The goal is to allow time to develop regulations that balance carbon credit sales with sustainable timber harvesting, protect property rights, and safeguard the state’s economy.
  - **Concerns**: Testifiers highlighted that carbon credit sales have reduced timber harvesting, negatively impacting loggers, sawmills, and local economies. For example, a lumber company in Pittsburgh had to shut down temporarily due to a lack of timber supply.
  - **Amendments**: The bill was clarified to specify that it does not affect the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) or other emissions trading programs. It focuses solely on carbon credits from New Hampshire woodlands.
  - **Stakeholder Input**: Blake Stansell of Aurora Sustainable Lands testified that their carbon credit program is compatible with recreational use and sustainable timber harvesting, and they are working with local communities to address concerns.

### **2. Energy Procurement and Price Stability**
- **House Bill 1617**: This bill aims to introduce **reasonable price stability** in energy procurement by requiring utilities to consider contracts of varying lengths (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) and review them quarterly. The goal is to mitigate price volatility and reduce risk premiums associated with natural gas contracts.
  - **Concerns**: Stakeholders, including the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and the Department of Energy (DOE), expressed concerns that the bill could **restrict flexibility**, lead to **higher costs**, and delay price reductions for consumers. They emphasized that **market-reflective pricing** benefits consumers in the long term.
  - **Alternatives**: Testifiers noted that **competitive supply** and **community power** already provide options for consumers seeking price stability. Utilities like Eversource suggested that any laddering strategy should be implemented **flexibly**, with PUC approval rather than being mandated by legislation.
  - **Next Steps**: The committee plans to consider amendments to make the bill less prescriptive and more flexible.

### **3. Net Metering and Utility Cost Recovery**
- **House Bill 1499** and **House Bill 1398**: Both bills addressed utility recovery of costs associated with **net energy metering**.
  - **HB 1499**: After adopting an amendment, the committee voted 10-10 on whether the bill should pass, resulting in its referral for **interim study** (20-0). Concerns included the bill’s impact on the competitive energy market and transparency of charges on customer bills.
  - **HB 1398**: Similarly, after adopting an amendment unanimously, the committee voted 10-10 on the bill, leading to its referral for **interim study** (20-0). Ongoing concerns about the unresolved net metering tariff docket influenced this decision.

### **4. Weatherization and Clean Energy Initiatives**
- **Weatherization Study**: A bill proposing a committee to study weatherization initiatives was debated. Some representatives argued that existing programs like **New Hampshire Saves** already address weatherization effectively, while others emphasized the importance of measuring program effectiveness and improving communication.
- **Civilian Clean Energy Corps**: A bill to study the establishment of a **civilian clean energy corps** was discussed. An amendment was proposed to require a **cost-benefit analysis** to ensure the program’s economic viability.
- **Peirce Plant Replacement**: A bill to study replacing the Bow power plant with clean energy solutions was deemed **inexpedient to legislate** (unanimous vote). The committee noted that a study commission cannot dictate actions to a private business.

---

### **5. Procedural Decisions and Minority Reports**
- **Amendments and Voting**: The committee standardized its voting process by voting on amendments first before considering the full bill. This approach was adopted to ensure clarity and consistency.
- **Minority Reports**: For bills like **HB 1230**, which the committee voted 14-6 to recommend as **inexpedient to legislate**, a minority report will be written by dissenting members.
- **Consent Calendar**: Bills like **HB 1047** (studying outreach to residents without computer access) and **HB 1289** (Peirce Plant replacement study) were placed on the **consent calendar** due to unanimous votes.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Carbon Credits**: The committee is seeking a balance between carbon credit sales and sustainable timber harvesting, with a focus on protecting the timber industry and local economies.
2. **Energy Procurement**: Stakeholders emphasized the need for **flexibility** in energy procurement strategies to avoid higher costs and ensure market-reflective pricing benefits consumers.
3. **Net Metering**: Concerns about the impact of net metering on the competitive energy market and transparency of utility charges led to the referral of several bills for **interim study**.
4. **Weatherization and Clean Energy**: While some initiatives were supported, others were deemed redundant or impractical, highlighting the need for clear objectives and measurable outcomes.
5. **Procedural Clarity**: The committee adopted a standardized voting process to ensure consistency and transparency in decision-making.

The committee plans to reconvene for further discussions and consider amendments to improve the proposed legislation. Future work sessions and public hearings are scheduled to address unresolved issues and gather additional stakeholder input.
