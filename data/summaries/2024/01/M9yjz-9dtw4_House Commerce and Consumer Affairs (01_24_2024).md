**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/24/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee met on January 24, 2024, to discuss a wide range of legislative proposals, including recycling and waste management, foreign ownership of farmland, single-use plastics, digital currency, cannabis legalization, and alcohol-related issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

---

### **1. Recycling and Waste Management (Bottle Bill)**
The committee debated a proposed bottle bill aimed at increasing recycling rates through a bottle deposit system, modeled after successful programs in states like Michigan. Key points included:
- **Goals and Challenges**: The bill seeks to address New Hampshire’s low recycling rate (23%) but acknowledges the need for refinement to address stakeholder concerns, particularly from the business community.
- **Exemptions and Adjustments**: Discussions focused on potential exemptions (e.g., for the Liquor Commission) and adjustments for handling materials like glass and aluminum.
- **Interim Study**: A motion passed to send the bill to an interim study for further refinement, with the sponsor agreeing to lead this effort.
- **Enforcement**: The bill proposes creating a compliance enforcement position within the Department of Environmental Services, with a suggested five-year sunset clause to reassess its necessity.
- **Impact on Communities**: Concerns were raised about the potential burden on small towns and businesses, emphasizing the need for a convenient and sustainable system.

### **2. Foreign Ownership of Farmland**
The committee discussed **Bill HP 1183**, which aims to protect New Hampshire farmland from foreign ownership, particularly from Chinese entities. Key points included:
- **Concerns and Realities**: While some members highlighted the need to safeguard the food supply chain, others noted that American companies are the primary buyers of land in the state.
- **Interim Study**: The committee voted 4-2 to send the bill to an interim study, recognizing the need for further analysis of its necessity and effectiveness.

### **3. Single-Use Plastics and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**
- **Single-Use Plastic Ban**: The committee debated banning single-use plastic foodware, with some members advocating for market-based solutions or consumer education instead. The bill was sent to an interim study.
- **CBDC Prohibition**: A bill seeking to prohibit the use of Central Bank Digital Currency by state or local governments raised concerns about government surveillance, privacy, and the expiration of digital money. The committee voted 6-2 for an interim study, citing the Federal Reserve’s unpreparedness for CBDC implementation.

### **4. Gender-Based Pricing and Liquor Commission Operations**
- **Gender-Based Pricing**: A bill addressing gender-based pricing of goods and services was briefly discussed and voted 7-1 as inexpedient to legislate.
- **Liquor Commission**: Discussions included allowing liquor stores to open on certain holidays and requiring the Liquor Commission to distribute information about alcohol use disorder. Amendments were proposed to allow electronic distribution of such information to reduce costs.

---

### **5. Cannabis Legalization**
The committee engaged in extensive discussions on cannabis legalization, focusing on the following key areas:
- **State-Run vs. Agency Store Models**: The state-run model, similar to New Hampshire’s liquor stores, was favored by some legislators, but concerns were raised about state liability and costs. The agency store model, where private entities operate under state oversight, was proposed as an alternative to reduce state involvement and risks.
- **Franchise Model**: Debate centered on whether cannabis retail outlets should operate under a franchise model, with concerns about legal exposure and clarity in the proposed amendment.
- **Integration of Therapeutic Cannabis Program**: Stakeholders emphasized the importance of integrating the existing therapeutic cannabis program with the new adult-use program to avoid harming patients and ensure a smooth rollout.
- **Drafting Errors and Next Steps**: Several drafting errors and missing provisions were identified, including the ability for cultivators to sell directly to consumers. The committee planned to reconvene to address these issues and finalize the bill.

### **6. Alcohol Treatment Modalities**
The committee discussed requiring the Liquor Commission to distribute information about alcohol use disorder, with amendments allowing for electronic distribution to minimize costs. The debate focused on the effectiveness of awareness campaigns and the potential for repetition to lead to action.

---

### **7. Technology and Legislative Processes**
- **AI in Legislation**: A representative shared their use of AI to summarize hearing transcripts, highlighting the intuitive nature of such tools.
- **Product Testing Technology**: Questions were raised about the availability of technology, such as handheld X-ray devices, to test products for harmful substances like lead.

---

### **8. Condominium Dispute Resolution**
The committee briefly touched on establishing a condominium dispute resolution board, with a request for more time to identify a suitable administrative home for the board.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Interim Studies**: Many bills, including those on the bottle deposit system, foreign farmland ownership, single-use plastics, and CBDC, were sent to interim studies for further refinement.
- **Balancing Act**: The committee sought to balance environmental, economic, and social goals, particularly in areas like cannabis legalization and alcohol regulation.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: There was a strong emphasis on involving stakeholders, including businesses, industry representatives, and patients, to ensure practical and effective legislation.
- **Technological Integration**: Discussions highlighted the role of technology, from AI in legislative processes to digital currency and product testing tools.

Overall, the meeting reflected a collaborative and deliberative approach to addressing complex legislative issues, with a focus on refining proposals through interim studies and stakeholder engagement.
