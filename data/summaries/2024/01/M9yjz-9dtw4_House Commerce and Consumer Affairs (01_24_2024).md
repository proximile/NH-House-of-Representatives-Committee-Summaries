The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on January 24, 2024, addressed a wide range of bills and topics related to commerce, consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The discussions reflected a collaborative effort to balance regulatory measures with practical implementation, economic considerations, and stakeholder input. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions across all segments:

### **Recycling and Waste Management**
The committee discussed a proposed bill aimed at improving recycling rates and reducing landfill waste in New Hampshire. Key points included:
- **Bottle Bill Impact**: The sponsor highlighted the success of bottle deposit systems in other states, noting that New Hampshire’s recycling rate of 23% lags behind states with such programs. The bill seeks to introduce a redemption system to boost recycling.
- **Industry Concerns**: While some industry stakeholders opposed the bill, the sponsor argued it would benefit recycling industries by increasing the supply of recycled materials.
- **Exemptions and Amendments**: Debates arose over exemptions for entities like the Liquor Commission and industries such as medical devices and pesticides. The sponsor proposed simplifying the bill by removing certain labeling and notification requirements.
- **Enforcement and Costs**: The bill includes funding for a new enforcement position at the Department of Environmental Services, with a potential sunset clause after five years.
- **Targeted Bans**: The bill focuses on banning products containing harmful substances like PFAS, aligning with existing state and federal regulations.

### **Commerce and Consumer Affairs**
Several bills related to consumer protection and commerce were discussed:
- **Compliance and Enforcement**: Representatives emphasized the importance of measuring the effectiveness of bans and compliance monitoring through reduced enforcement actions.
- **Technology in Product Testing**: The potential use of handheld X-ray devices to test products for toxic substances like lead was discussed, with an eye toward future technological advancements.
- **Tokenization of Assets**: A bill proposing the tokenization of real-world assets, such as gold and silver, raised concerns about state involvement and potential misuse in illegal activities.
- **Liquor Store Operations**: The committee debated allowing liquor stores to open on major holidays, considering the impact on employee pay, sales, and state revenue.
- **Alcohol Use Disorder Awareness**: A bill aimed at distributing information about alcohol use disorder resources in liquor stores was discussed, with a focus on cost-effectiveness and measurable impact.

### **Foreign Ownership of Farmland and Single-Use Plastics**
- **Foreign Ownership of Farmland**: A bill to protect New Hampshire farmland from foreign ownership, particularly citing concerns about Chinese Communist Party influence, was sent to interim study. Concerns were raised that the bill might not address the real issue, as American companies are the primary land buyers in the state.
- **Single-Use Plastics**: The committee favored a market-based approach over government bans for single-use plastic foodware accessories, emphasizing consumer education and empowerment. The bill was also sent to interim study.

### **Central Bank Digital Currency and Gender-Based Pricing**
- **CBDC Ban**: A bill to prohibit the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by state or local governments was debated, with concerns about privacy, government surveillance, and constitutional implications. The committee voted to send the bill to interim study.
- **Gender-Based Pricing**: A bill addressing gender-based pricing of goods and services was quickly deemed "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), effectively killing it.

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The committee extensively discussed cannabis legalization and regulation, focusing on the following:
- **State-Run Model**: The debate centered on a state-run model for cannabis sales, similar to New Hampshire’s liquor stores, with concerns about state liability and operational control. The concept of an "agency store" model was introduced as an alternative to a franchise model.
- **Franchise Model Concerns**: Representatives raised concerns about the franchise model’s potential legal and financial risks, including lawsuits against the state and exposure of state assets.
- **Integration of Therapeutic Cannabis Program**: Stakeholders emphasized the need to integrate the existing therapeutic cannabis program with the proposed recreational market, particularly regarding dual-use licenses for Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs).
- **Municipal Regulation**: The bill’s language preventing municipalities from prohibiting cannabis retail outlets sparked debates about local control and zoning.
- **Drafting Errors and Amendments**: Drafting errors, such as the exclusion of provisions allowing cannabis cultivators to sell directly to consumers, were identified. Stakeholders called for more collaboration to address these issues.

### **Next Steps**
The committee agreed to work on amendments to refine the cannabis bill, focusing on integrating the therapeutic program, clarifying dual-use licenses, and correcting drafting errors. Several other bills, including those on recycling, foreign ownership of farmland, and single-use plastics, were sent to interim study for further discussion and refinement.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the importance of:
- **Collaboration and Stakeholder Input**: Ensuring that bills are practical and effective by involving industry and other stakeholders.
- **Balancing Regulation and Practicality**: Addressing regulatory needs while considering economic impacts and implementation challenges.
- **Focusing on Real Issues**: Prioritizing legislation that addresses tangible problems rather than hypothetical concerns.
- **Adapting to Emerging Trends**: Exploring new technologies and models, such as tokenization, CBDCs, and cannabis regulation, while mitigating associated risks.

The committee’s discussions reflected a commitment to thoughtful, data-driven policymaking that balances environmental, economic, and social considerations.
