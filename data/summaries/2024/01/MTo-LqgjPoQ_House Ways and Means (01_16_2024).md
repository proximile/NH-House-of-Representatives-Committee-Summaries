The January 16, 2024, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee centered on critical discussions and testimonies regarding various tax-related bills, with a focus on equity, economic growth, and fiscal responsibility. The meeting was divided into three main segments, each addressing distinct but interconnected issues.

### **Segment 1: Interest and Dividends Tax**
The first segment focused on the **interest and dividends tax**, a long-standing tax affecting primarily retirees who rely on interest and dividends as their main income source. Key points included:
- **Purpose and Impact**: The tax generates approximately $140 million annually, largely from about 2,000 high-income individuals. While some argue it disproportionately affects wealthy retirees, others contend it unfairly burdens lower-income elderly residents.
- **Constitutional and Equity Concerns**: Critics argue the tax violates the NH Constitution’s mandate for proportional and reasonable taxation. Supporters believe it ensures the wealthy contribute to public services.
- **Proposal to Reinstate the Tax**: A bill was introduced to reinstate the tax with updated exemptions and a 5% rate, with proceeds directed to the Education Trust Fund to provide property tax relief.
- **Economic and Competitive Arguments**: Opponents argue that eliminating the tax makes NH more competitive, attracting wealthier residents and businesses. Supporters worry about revenue shortfalls impacting essential services like transportation and education.
- **Historical Context**: The tax has existed for over 100 years, originally designed to ensure equitable taxation. Comparisons were made to the 1784 tax law, which taxed assets rather than income.
- **Public and Legislative Perspectives**: Testimonies highlighted differing views on the tax’s fairness, economic impact, and alignment with NH’s constitutional principles.

### **Segment 2: Business Tax Adjustments and Deductions**
The second segment addressed several bills aimed at adjusting business taxes and deductions to support economic growth while considering state revenue implications. Key points included:
- **Inflation and Taxation**: Concerns were raised about inflation eroding purchasing power, particularly for older individuals who saved in traditional bank accounts rather than tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s.
- **HB 1531 - Business Profits Tax Adjustment**: This bill allows businesses to claim 100% of the cost of qualifying assets in the first year under federal depreciation rules, potentially reducing taxable income.
- **HB 1533 - Safe Harbor Compensation**: The bill proposes increasing the safe harbor provision for compensation under the business profits tax and tying future increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to benefit small businesses and partnerships.
- **HB 1536 - Expense Deduction Increase**: This bill seeks to align New Hampshire’s Section 179 expense deduction with federal provisions, allowing businesses to deduct more expenses in the first year.
- **Apportionment and State Finances**: Discussions emphasized how businesses with operations both in and outside NH are taxed, with deductions subject to apportionment based on the percentage of business conducted in the state.
- **Technical and Policy Questions**: Representatives sought clarification on the specifics of the tax provisions, and the Department of Revenue agreed to provide additional information for further analysis.

### **Segment 3: Consumer Tax Relief and Municipal Impact**
The third segment focused on **House Bill 1422**, the **Consumer Tax Relief Act**, and **House Bill 1492**, which addresses the interest and dividends tax. Key points included:
- **HB 1422: Consumer Tax Relief Act**: This bill aims to reduce state taxes, including the **Business Profits Tax (BPT)**, **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**, **Communications Services Tax (CST)**, and **Meals and Rooms Tax**, while increasing distributions to the Municipal Revenue Fund to protect municipalities from financial harm.
  - **Sponsor Testimony**: Representative Sweeney emphasized the bill’s importance in addressing inflation and rising living costs, arguing that tax cuts would stimulate economic growth and make NH more competitive.
  - **Revenue Impact**: The Department of Revenue estimated a cumulative $2 billion reduction in state revenue over six years, raising concerns about potential budget shortfalls and impacts on public services.
  - **Municipal Impact**: Testimonies highlighted the importance of ensuring municipalities are not adversely affected by state tax changes, particularly through the **Meals and Rooms Tax** distribution.
- **HB 1492: Interest and Dividends Tax**: This bill seeks to adjust the rate and exemptions for the interest and dividends tax, though the sponsor noted that the purpose clause was inadvertently removed during drafting.
- **Key Themes**: The segment emphasized the balance between providing tax relief and maintaining state revenue, with debates over whether tax cuts stimulate economic growth or lead to fiscal challenges.

### **Overall Themes and Conclusions**
The meeting reflected deep divisions on tax policy, with arguments centered on equity, economic growth, and constitutional compliance. Key themes included:
- **Equity vs. Competitiveness**: Supporters of tax measures like the interest and dividends tax argue they ensure the wealthy contribute to public services, while opponents believe they deter economic growth and competitiveness.
- **Revenue vs. Relief**: There was significant debate over the balance between providing tax relief to residents and businesses and the potential loss of state revenue, which could impact essential services and local property taxes.
- **Municipal Impact**: Ensuring municipalities are not adversely affected by state tax changes was a recurring concern, particularly regarding the distribution of the **Meals and Rooms Tax**.
- **Historical and Constitutional Context**: Discussions often referenced historical tax laws and constitutional principles to justify or critique proposed measures.

The committee concluded by preparing for further detailed discussions on the proposed bills, underscoring the complexity and high stakes of tax policy in New Hampshire.
