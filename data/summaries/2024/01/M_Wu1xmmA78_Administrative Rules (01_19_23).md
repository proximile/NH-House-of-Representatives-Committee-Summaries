**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Administrative Rules Committee Meeting (01/19/23)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Administrative Rules Committee convened on January 19, 2023, to address several key issues related to administrative rules and petitions. The meeting focused on balancing modern practices with consumer protection, particularly in the context of electronic document delivery and regulatory clarity. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting:

---

### **1. Electronic vs. Paper Delivery of Condominium Documents**
A central topic of discussion was a petition to allow electronic delivery of public offering statements and purchase and sales agreements for condominiums. The debate highlighted the following points:
- **Current Regulations**: Existing rules mandate paper copies, but electronic delivery is neither explicitly prohibited nor clearly permitted.
- **Consumer Protection Concerns**: Some representatives argued that paper copies are essential for protecting consumers, particularly older individuals who may be less comfortable with electronic documents. They emphasized the importance of ensuring consumers fully understand the legal documents they are signing.
- **Industry Practices**: Attorneys representing developers and the American Resort Development Association (ARDA) noted that New Hampshire lags behind other states in allowing electronic delivery. They advocated for giving consumers the choice between electronic and paper copies, highlighting the efficiency and accessibility benefits of digital documents.
- **Proposed Rule Change**: The petitioner, Riverwalk at Lon Mountain LLC, proposed allowing electronic delivery while still providing paper copies upon request. This approach aimed to balance modern efficiency with consumer protection.
- **Committee Decision**: The committee ultimately denied the petition, citing the complexity of the issue and the need for a legislative solution. They referred the matter to the Commerce Committee or the Committee on Condominium Development for further review, emphasizing the need to address statutory ambiguities and ensure clarity in document delivery timelines and the right of rescission.

- Requests for waivers to extend deadlines for certain rule reviews.

### **3. Rule Revisions and Clarifications**
The committee discussed revisions to various administrative rules, focusing on clarity, consistency, and compliance with statutory requirements. Key areas included:
- **Board of Mental Health Practice**: Discussions centered on ensuring that rules align with statutory mandates and provide clear guidance for practitioners.

### **5. Consumer Protection in Administrative Rules**
Throughout the meeting, the committee emphasized the importance of consumer protection in administrative rulemaking. This was particularly evident in the discussion on electronic document delivery, where the Assistant Attorney General from the Consumer Protection Bureau argued against electronic-only disclosures. They highlighted the risks of consumers not thoroughly reading or retaining digital documents and advocated for maintaining hard copy requirements to ensure clarity and understanding in complex legal transactions.

### **6. Legislative Referral and Next Steps**
For issues requiring further review, such as the electronic delivery of condominium documents, the committee opted to refer them to relevant legislative bodies, including the Commerce Committee or a special committee on condominium matters. This approach ensures that complex issues receive thorough consideration and that any changes to administrative rules align with statutory requirements and consumer protection goals.

While modern practices like electronic document delivery were acknowledged as efficient and accessible, the committee prioritized safeguarding consumer rights and understanding. The decision to refer key issues to legislative bodies reflects the complexity of balancing innovation with traditional protections in regulatory frameworks. The committee’s deliberations set the stage for continued review and potential legislative action to address these critical issues.
