The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee meeting on January 10, 2024, centered on heated debates surrounding reproductive rights and abortion legislation, with a focus on three key proposals: **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 23 (CACR 23)**, **House Bill 1248**, and **House Bill 1541**. The discussions reflected deep divisions over the role of government in regulating abortion, the moral and ethical implications of reproductive healthcare, and the importance of protecting individual autonomy and medical privacy.

### **CACR 23: Constitutional Amendment to Protect Abortion Rights**
**CACR 23** seeks to enshrine the right to abortion in the New Hampshire Constitution, explicitly protecting abortion access up to 24 weeks and allowing doctors and patients to make decisions thereafter. Key arguments included:

- **Support**: Advocates, including Representative Ben Ming (the prime sponsor), emphasized the need to safeguard reproductive freedom following the Supreme Court’s overturning of *Roe v. Wade*. They argued that New Hampshire lacks explicit abortion protections, making it vulnerable to future restrictions. Medical professionals, such as Dr. Amy Lee, stressed the importance of abortion training and retaining healthcare providers in the state. Personal testimonies highlighted the deeply personal nature of reproductive decisions and the need for government non-interference.
  
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about the amendment’s language, particularly the phrase “every individual has a fundamental right to abortion,” which they argued could be misinterpreted. Some questioned the 24-week threshold and the potential for abortions after that point. Opponents also argued that the amendment conflicts with the state constitution’s emphasis on protecting life and could lead to legal and ethical challenges.

- **Bipartisan and Public Support**: The resolution garnered bipartisan backing, reflecting widespread public support for reproductive freedom. Many speakers called for allowing New Hampshire voters to decide on the issue through a ballot measure, aligning with the state’s tradition of direct democracy.

### **HB 1248: 15-Week Abortion Ban**
**HB 1248** proposes reducing the legal abortion limit from 24 weeks to 15 weeks and adding an additional doctor to the process. The debate highlighted:

- **Support**: Proponents, including Representative Dave Testerman, framed the bill as a measure to protect life, arguing that life begins at conception and that the bill aims to save lives by limiting abortion access.

- **Opposition**: Critics, including medical professionals and advocates, argued that the bill would endanger women’s health, autonomy, and economic security. They emphasized that 15 days is too early for most individuals to know they are pregnant, making the ban effectively an outright prohibition on abortion. Concerns were raised about the lack of exceptions for rape, incest, or medical emergencies, as well as the potential for driving healthcare providers out of the state.

### **HB 1541: 15-Week Abortion Ban**
**HB 1541**, similar to HB 1248, proposed a 15-week abortion ban. The discussion focused on:

- **Medical and Practical Concerns**: Doctors testified that 15 weeks is biologically implausible for detecting pregnancy and that such restrictions would force providers to perform medically unnecessary interventions. They warned that restrictive laws could exacerbate New Hampshire’s healthcare shortages and undermine trust in medical professionals.

- **Social Justice and Equity**: Advocates framed abortion access as a racial justice issue, noting that restrictions disproportionately harm marginalized communities, including people of color, immigrants, and low-income individuals. Personal testimonies highlighted the emotional and medical challenges faced by individuals needing abortions later in pregnancy due to complications.

- **Previous Legislation**: Witnesses reminded the committee that a similar bill (HB 346) was defeated the previous year, emphasizing that no law can adequately address the complexities of pregnancy and abortion care.

### **Key Themes and Broader Context**
The debates reflected broader national discussions on abortion rights following the *Dobbs* decision, with New Hampshire being the only New England state without explicit abortion protections. Key themes included:

- **Balance of Rights**: The tension between protecting the rights of the unborn and ensuring women’s reproductive freedom and bodily autonomy was a central issue. Supporters of CACR 23 and opponents of HB 1248 and HB 1541 emphasized the importance of allowing individuals to make private medical decisions without government interference.

- **Medical Expertise**: Medical professionals played a significant role in the discussions, stressing the safety and necessity of abortion care and the dangers of restrictive laws.

- **Public Opinion and Democracy**: Many speakers highlighted the importance of letting New Hampshire voters decide on reproductive rights, citing polls showing widespread support for abortion access.

- **Economic and Social Impacts**: Opponents of restrictive bills warned of the negative economic and social consequences, including increased poverty, reduced quality of life, and healthcare provider shortages.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the deeply personal and contentious nature of the abortion debate in New Hampshire. Supporters of CACR 23 and opponents of HB 1248 and HB 1541 emphasized the need to protect reproductive freedom, trust healthcare providers, and prioritize individual rights. Opponents of CACR 23 and supporters of the restrictive bills focused on the moral and ethical imperative to protect life from conception. The discussions highlighted the importance of balancing personal autonomy, medical expertise, and public health in shaping reproductive rights legislation. The decisions on these proposals will have significant implications for New Hampshire’s healthcare system, its residents, and its political landscape.
