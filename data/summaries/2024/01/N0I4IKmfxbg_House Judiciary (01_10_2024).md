### **CACR 23: Constitutional Amendment to Protect Abortion Rights**
CACR 23 proposes a constitutional amendment to explicitly protect the right to abortion in New Hampshire up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and beyond in cases of compelling medical necessity. The discussion centered on the need for constitutional protections in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of *Roe v. Wade*.

#### **Support for CACR 23**
1. **Personal Testimonies**: Legislators and constituents shared personal stories of abortion, adoption, and pregnancy complications, emphasizing the importance of reproductive autonomy and the right to make private medical decisions. A pediatric emergency medicine physician testified that abortion saved her life and allowed her to continue her career.
2. **Medical Professionals**: OB-GYNs and other healthcare providers argued that access to abortion care is essential for patient health and medical training. They warned that restrictive laws could drive healthcare providers out of the state and exacerbate New Hampshire’s healthcare shortage.
3. **Advocacy Groups**: Organizations like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU supported the amendment, stressing that it aligns with New Hampshire’s values of freedom, privacy, and trust in doctors. They cited polls showing bipartisan support for abortion rights, with 64% of Republicans favoring protections.
4. **Public Involvement**: Proponents urged the committee to allow voters to decide on the issue through a ballot measure, reflecting the state’s tradition of direct democracy.

#### **Opposition to CACR 23**
1. **Constitutional and Moral Concerns**: Opponents, including representatives from Cornerstone Action and the Knights of Columbus, argued that abortion is not a deeply rooted right in U.S. history or the New Hampshire Constitution. They asserted that life begins at conception and that abortion is morally wrong.
2. **Legal and Policy Criticisms**: Critics questioned the 24-week threshold, arguing it could be interpreted to allow abortion up to birth and that it might restrict future legislative flexibility. They also expressed concerns about the amendment’s potential to grant men influence over abortion decisions.
3. **Sanctity of Life**: Some speakers shared adoption stories, emphasizing the value of choosing life and arguing that abortion devalues women’s unique role as bearers of life.

### **HB 1248: 15-Day Abortion Ban**
HB 1248 proposes a highly restrictive abortion ban at 15 days post-fertilization, effectively making it one of the most stringent bans in the country. The bill faced overwhelming opposition during the hearing.

#### **Opposition to HB 1248**
1. **Medical and Practical Concerns**: Healthcare professionals testified that 15 days is too early for most individuals to know they are pregnant, rendering the ban unworkable and medically unsound. They warned that such laws intrude on medical decision-making and could drive providers out of the state.
2. **Impact on Healthcare**: Critics argued the bill could lead to delayed or denied care, particularly in cases of medical emergencies or fetal anomalies, putting patients at risk.
3. **Discriminatory and Unconstitutional**: Opponents criticized the bill as discriminatory, targeting women’s reproductive healthcare while ignoring men’s rights. They argued it is out of touch with New Hampshire’s values of individual liberty and the state motto, “Live Free or Die.”
4. **Lack of Exceptions**: The bill’s lack of exceptions for rape, incest, or fetal anomalies was widely criticized as overly restrictive and harmful.

#### **Support for Reproductive Rights**
Several witnesses advocated for **CACR 23** as a more balanced approach, emphasizing the importance of access to safe and timely reproductive healthcare. Personal stories highlighted how abortion access had positively impacted individuals’ lives.

### **HB 1541: 15-Week Abortion Ban**
HB 1541 proposes a 15-week abortion ban and imposes additional restrictions on abortion care, including requirements for immediate life-sustaining care for nonviable fetuses.

#### **Support for HB 1541**
1. **Pro-Life Perspective**: Supporters argued that abortion is not healthcare but the termination of life, emphasizing that life begins at conception and that abortion exploits women and ends innocent lives.
2. **Medical Ethics**: Some speakers referenced the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, asserting that abortion is not healthcare and that physicians must care for both the woman and the unborn child.

#### **Opposition to HB 1541**
1. **Healthcare Providers**: Physicians testified that the bill would prevent doctors from exercising their best medical judgment, particularly in cases of pregnancy complications or fetal anomalies. They called the requirement to resuscitate nonviable fetuses traumatic and medically futile.
2. **Advocacy Groups**: Organizations like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU argued the bill would limit access to safe, legal abortion care and disproportionately harm marginalized communities, including Black, Indigenous, and low-income individuals.
3. **Resource Strain**: Critics warned that the bill’s requirements for ICU availability and a second physician would strain healthcare resources, especially in rural areas.
