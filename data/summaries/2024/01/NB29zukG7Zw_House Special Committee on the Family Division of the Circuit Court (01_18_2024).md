### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court (01/18/2024)  

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on January 18, 2024, to address critical issues impacting the Family Division’s efficiency, resource allocation, and overall effectiveness. The discussions centered on judicial workload, training, funding, accountability, and access to justice, highlighting systemic challenges and potential solutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and recommendations from the meeting:  

#### **Judicial Workload and Resource Allocation**  
- **Workload Challenges**: Judges in the Family Division are restricted to working approximately 80 days per year due to statutory limitations. This constraint hinders the ability of retired judges to contribute more significantly, such as by serving as court observers or mentors.  
- **Staffing Shortages**: The Circuit Court is understaffed, with only three staff attorneys supporting over 60 judicial officers. This shortage impacts the timely preparation of written orders and thorough legal research. A weighted case study revealed a need for 67 full-time equivalent judges, but the court currently operates with only 43 full-time judges, supplemented by part-time and retired judges.  
- **Case Management**: Coordination between judges in cases involving multiple legal issues within the same family is limited by the Code of Judicial Conduct. Efforts are underway to cross-reference related cases in the case management system to improve efficiency.  

#### **Judicial Training and Efficiency**  
- **Training Programs**: Since its creation in 2011, the Circuit Court has trained over 50 judges, with plans to train an additional 10 in 2024. Training is tailored to judges’ backgrounds, with a focus on family law for those with less experience in the area. Ongoing training includes mandatory sessions five times a year and specialized training in areas like probate and domestic violence.  
- **Funding for Training**: The judicial branch relies on grants, such as the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funds and Access and Visitation funds, to support training. The general training budget of $94,500 is insufficient for the number of employees and judges, necessitating additional funding to enhance training resources.  
- **Opportunity Costs**: Training requires taking judges off the bench, which impacts case processing timelines.  

#### **Technology and Access to Justice**  
- **Electronic Filing Systems**: While electronic filing has streamlined processes, it has created challenges for self-represented litigants. Initiatives such as Court Navigators and community resources are being developed to assist these individuals.  
- **ARPA Funds**: American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds are being utilized to improve access to justice through projects like community navigators and remote assistance programs.  

#### **Judicial Accountability and Evaluation**  
- **Evaluation Process**: Judges undergo formal evaluations every three years. Complaints about judges are reviewed, often involving the assessment of hearing audio to determine their validity.  
- **Proposed Mentorship Program**: A proposal to use retired judges as court observers and mentors aims to provide ongoing feedback and support, particularly for new judges.  

#### **Legislative Proposals and Transparency**  
- **Written Rulings on Objections**: A legislative proposal would require judges to provide written reasons for their rulings on objections to evidence during trials, enhancing transparency and understanding for litigants.  

#### **Mental Health and Well-being**  
- **Emotional Toll**: The emotionally taxing nature of family court cases has raised concerns about the mental health of judges and staff. While resources like the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) are available, additional support is needed to address this issue.  

#### **Future Committee Work**  
- The subcommittee plans to compile a report summarizing findings and recommendations. The full committee will review and finalize these suggestions, with the possibility of reactivating the committee if new issues arise related to the Family Division.  

### **Key Recommendations**  
1. **Increase Judicial and Staff Resources**: Address staffing shortages by hiring additional judges, staff attorneys, and support personnel to manage the growing caseload.  
2. **Enhance Training Programs**: Secure additional funding to expand training resources and ensure judges and staff are well-prepared for their roles.  
3. **Improve Case Coordination**: Develop mechanisms to better coordinate cases involving multiple legal issues within the same family, potentially revising the Code of Judicial Conduct to allow judge-to-judge communication.  
4. **Support Self-Represented Litigants**: Expand Court Navigator programs and community resources to assist self-represented litigants in navigating the electronic filing system.  
5. **Promote Judicial Accountability**: Implement mentorship programs using retired judges to provide ongoing feedback and support to sitting judges.  
6. **Address Mental Health Needs**: Provide additional mental health resources for judges and staff to mitigate the emotional toll of family court cases.  

The meeting underscored the urgent need for systemic improvements within the Family Division to ensure fair, timely, and effective justice for families in New Hampshire.
