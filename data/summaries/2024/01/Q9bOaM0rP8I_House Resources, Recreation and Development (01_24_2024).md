The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 24, 2024, focused on a range of bills related to resources, recreation, and development, with significant attention on environmental protection, public safety, housing affordability, and septic system regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Opening and Procedural Matters**
The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance and announcements, including scheduling a work session for **House Bill (HB) 1121**, which proposes wetland permit exemptions after natural disasters or flooding events.

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **Environmental and Recreational Bills**
1. **HB 1046**: A friendly amendment was proposed and unanimously approved to address timing issues for boat owners reporting accidents, closing a loophole that required reporting within 15 days.

2. **HB 1423**: The committee passed an amendment limiting mapping to state forests and establishing a definite timeline. The bill was approved with a 15-5 vote.

3. **HB 1429**: An amendment enabling towns to control and fund infrastructure improvements was adopted, and the bill passed unanimously (19-0).

4. **HB 1045**: The bill, requiring powerboat operators to wear engine cut-off switches, was passed with a 19-1 vote, emphasizing safety concerns.

5. **HB 1049**: The bill proposing to prohibit overnight moorings of houseboats was indefinitely postponed (18-2 vote) due to concerns about property rights, water quality, and housing needs.

6. **HB 1103**: The bill revising penalties for Shoreland Protection Act violations passed unanimously. It simplifies enforcement by removing the requirement to prove damage to a water body.

#### **Septic System Regulations**
The committee extensively discussed several bills related to septic system regulations, aiming to balance housing affordability, environmental protection, and public health.

1. **HB 1139**:  
   - **Purpose**: Reduces the required vertical separation distance for septic systems from 4 feet to 2 feet above the seasonal high water table for new installations, aligning with replacement system standards.  
   - **Support**: Backed by the Department of Environmental Services (DES) and the Special Housing Committee, the bill aims to reduce housing development costs without compromising water quality.  
   - **Discussion**: DES assured that 50 years of data show 2 feet of separation, with proper sand treatment, is sufficient. The bill passed with unanimous support.

2. **HB 1140**:  
   - **Purpose**: Allows homeowners to install or replace their own septic systems without a permit, provided they meet specific conditions, including hiring a permitted installer to certify the system and signing an affidavit stating they will reside in the home for at least two years.  
   - **Amendment**: Introduced to tighten regulations, ensuring homeowners (not developers) perform the work and prevent system abuse.  
   - **Support**: DES supports the bill, noting it addresses issues with developers exploiting homeowner installation rules and ensures proper system construction.  
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about enforcement of the affidavit, feasibility for homeowners, and potential system failures due to improper installation. Discussions focused on refining the amendment to balance homeowner rights with oversight.

3. **HB 1141**:  
   - **Purpose**: Addresses requirements for approving increases in the load on septic systems, particularly when there is a change in use (e.g., adding a commercial kitchen or transitioning to full-time occupancy).  
   - **Key Focus**: The bill seeks to close a loophole related to properties over five acres, ensuring older, non-compliant systems are updated when new structures are introduced.  
   - **Concerns**: Representatives discussed defining "change in use" and ensuring homeowners are aware of permit requirements. DES requested an amendment to address rule-making, which will be drafted for future discussion.

4. **HB 1142**:  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes stricter licensing requirements for septic system designers and installers, including mandatory on-the-job training (1 year for installers, 2 years for designers) before taking the licensing exam.  
   - **Goal**: Improve the pass rate for licensing exams (currently an 80% failure rate) and ensure systems are designed and installed correctly to protect public health and the environment.  
   - **Concerns**: Representatives debated the potential impact on workforce availability and whether the training period could delay entry into the profession. Suggestions included allowing equivalent training (e.g., classes) to count toward the experience requirement.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Environmental Protection**: Bills like HB 1103 and HB 1423 emphasized safeguarding natural resources and simplifying enforcement mechanisms.
- **Public Safety**: Measures such as HB 1045 and HB 1046 highlighted the committee’s focus on safety in recreational activities.
- **Housing Affordability**: Bills like HB 1139 and HB 1140 aimed to reduce housing development costs while maintaining environmental standards.
- **Septic System Regulations**: Discussions on HB 1141 and HB 1142 focused on updating regulations to protect public health and the environment, balancing training requirements for professionals, and addressing homeowner and developer concerns.
