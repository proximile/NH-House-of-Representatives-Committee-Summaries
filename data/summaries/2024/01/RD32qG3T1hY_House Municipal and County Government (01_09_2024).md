### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Municipal and County Government (January 9, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss several bills addressing property tax exemptions, abatements, and other municipal governance issues. The meeting featured extensive testimonies, debates, and concerns from representatives, stakeholders, and local officials. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills:

---

### **Property Tax Exemptions and Abatements**

1. **House Bill 1055**:
   - **Purpose**: This "housekeeping" bill aims to provide municipalities with flexibility in accepting late documentation from charities for property tax exemptions. Currently, charities must submit financials by June 1st to qualify. The bill proposes extending this deadline to before the tax rate is set and allows assessors to request necessary documentation (e.g., Articles of Incorporation) within 30 days without penalty.
   - **Testimony**: Todd Haywood, a contract assessor, supported the bill, emphasizing its administrative benefits.

2. **House Bill 1258**:
   - **Purpose**: Introduced by Representative Mike Moffett, this bill enables municipalities to offer a property tax waiver of up to 100% for disabled veterans, increasing the current cap of $4,000. It is enabling legislation, allowing local governments to decide implementation.
   - **Concerns**: Administrative challenges and fiscal impacts on towns were raised during discussions.

3. **House Bill 1040**:
   - **Purpose**: Proposed by Representative Les, this bill seeks to adjust the interest rate on property tax abatement refunds. Currently fixed at 4%, the bill would tie the rate to the Department of Revenue Administration's rate plus 2% to reflect economic conditions.
   - **Concerns**: Jim Misho, a town assessor, highlighted potential administrative complexities and costs for municipalities if the rate fluctuates annually.

4. **House Bill 1154**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill clarifies eligibility criteria for property tax exemptions for disabled veterans. Veterans must own a home adapted through VA-approved grants (Special Adaptive Housing or Special Home Adaptation grants) to qualify. Surviving spouses lose the exemption if they remarry.
   - **Concerns**: Assessors raised issues about retroactive application and the potential exclusion of veterans who previously qualified.

### **Homestead Exemption and Tax Relief**

1. **House Bill 1034**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill allows municipalities to adopt a homestead property tax exemption for primary residences, providing tax relief to local residents, particularly in communities with high property values driven by vacation homes and short-term rentals. The exemption would be up to 35% of the assessed value of residential property, with the greatest benefit going to lower-valued properties.
   - **Discussion**: Representative Paige emphasized its importance for communities like Conway, where rising property taxes are pricing out long-term residents. Concerns included administrative burdens, potential tax shifts, and the need for clear residency requirements.

2. **House Bill 180**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill clarifies and expands the homestead exemption to ensure both spouses, including non-titled spouses, can claim the exemption in cases of bankruptcy or death. It addresses a recent legal case that excluded non-titled spouses from the exemption.
   - **Discussion**: Representative Scott Wallace introduced the bill, highlighting its role in protecting spouses' rights. Questions were raised about the $120,000 exemption limit, its application to property taxes, and the definition of "common law" unions.

### **Other Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1086**:
   - **Purpose**: Introduced by Representative Ren Zulu, this bill allows zoning board notices to be published on municipal websites instead of newspapers, reducing costs for applicants and municipalities while increasing accessibility.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about its impact on local newspapers and absentee property owners.

2. **House Bill 1342**:
   - **Purpose**: Introduced by Representative Shan Filio, this bill seeks to prevent publishers from charging libraries significantly higher rates for ebooks compared to the public, addressing unfair pricing practices and ensuring equitable access to digital materials.
   - **Concerns**: Assistant Attorney General Mary Stewart highlighted concerns about enforcement provisions, particularly the potential granting of administrative enforcement authority to private parties.

3. **Opposition to a Bill**:
   - Katherine Heck from the Municipal Association expressed opposition to an unspecified bill, citing confusion in its wording and the need for clarity on interest rate application and cutoff dates. The committee discussed potential amendments to address these issues.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**

- **Administrative Challenges**: Many bills raised concerns about the complexity of implementation, including tracking residency, managing fluctuating interest rates, and ensuring fairness in tax shifts.
- **Tax Shifts**: Several bills, particularly those related to homestead exemptions, could lead to tax shifts, with reduced taxes for some resulting in higher taxes for others, especially commercial and second-home owners.
- **Local Control**: Bills like HB 1034 and HB 1258 emphasized local autonomy, allowing municipalities to decide whether to adopt exemptions or waivers based on their needs.
- **Clarity and Fairness**: Throughout the meeting, representatives and stakeholders stressed the need for clear, consistent legislation to address housing affordability, veteran benefits, and historic property preservation.
