### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee Meeting (January 9, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on January 9, 2024, to discuss a series of bills related to property tax exemptions, municipal governance, and public access to information. The meeting highlighted the committee's focus on balancing tax relief for residents with the financial sustainability of municipalities, while addressing administrative challenges and ethical considerations. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills:

---

### **Property Tax Exemptions and Relief**

1. **HB 1034 (Homestead Exemption)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill aims to provide property tax relief to primary homeowners, particularly in communities with high proportions of non-tax-paying properties (e.g., non-profits or short-term rentals). It allows municipalities to adopt a local option homestead property tax exemption of up to 35% of the assessed value of residential property.
   - **Discussion**: Testimony highlighted the impact of rising property values and taxes on residents, especially in tourist-heavy areas like Conway, where short-term rentals have driven up housing costs and displaced long-term residents. The bill is intended to be revenue-neutral, with tax increases on non-homestead properties offsetting exemptions for primary homeowners.
   - **Concerns**: Administrative challenges, such as verifying residency and handling exemptions during revaluation years, were raised. There were also concerns about the potential shift in tax burdens to commercial property owners and renters.
   - **Outcome**: The committee recognized the bill’s potential to provide significant tax relief but acknowledged the need for further clarification and possible amendments to address administrative and policy concerns.

2. **HB 1154 (Property Tax Exemptions for Disabled Veterans)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill seeks to clarify eligibility criteria for property tax exemptions for disabled veterans who require specially adapted housing due to severe service-connected disabilities.
   - **Discussion**: Testimony emphasized the need to align state law with federal VA definitions to avoid confusion and ensure consistency in application across municipalities.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about veterans potentially losing exemptions due to stricter eligibility criteria, particularly regarding remarried surviving spouses and the definition of a veteran.
   - **Outcome**: The bill does not change who qualifies but clarifies the language to ensure only those with specific VA-approved housing adaptations receive the exemption.

3. **HB 180 (Scope of the Homestead Exemption)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill aims to clarify and expand the homestead exemption rights for non-titled spouses in cases of bankruptcy or the death of a spouse, ensuring that each spouse or property owner can claim the exemption.
   - **Discussion**: The bill addresses a gap in current law highlighted by a recent New Hampshire Supreme Court case.
   - **Concerns**: Committee members raised questions about the implications for surviving spouses, the $120,000 exemption amount, and whether the bill should also address updating the exemption amount to reflect current property values.
   - **Outcome**: The committee considered the bill straightforward but noted potential areas for clarification, such as the treatment of common-law couples and the exemption amount.

4. **HB 1258 (Property Tax Waivers for Disabled Veterans)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill proposes enabling municipalities to offer property tax waivers of up to 100% for disabled veterans, as opposed to the current $4,000 cap.
   - **Discussion**: Supporters highlighted the financial struggles of disabled veterans, particularly those with service-related disabilities.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the potential fiscal impact on municipalities and the lack of a fiscal note.
   - **Outcome**: The bill sparked debate over its feasibility, with some suggesting it should be tied to specific dollar amounts rather than percentages to simplify administration.

5. **HB 1040 (Interest Rates on Tax Abatement Refunds)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill proposes adjusting the interest rate on tax abatement refunds based on the Department of Revenue Administration’s (DRA) rate plus 2%.
   - **Discussion**: Supporters argued that the fixed rate is often unfair to either taxpayers or municipalities, depending on interest rate fluctuations.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents, including assessors, raised concerns about administrative complexity and potential software changes required for municipalities.
   - **Outcome**: The bill faced opposition from assessors who preferred the simplicity of the fixed rate, citing potential challenges in implementation.

### **Nonprofit Tax Exemptions**

6. **HB 1055 (Flexibility for Nonprofit Tax Exemptions)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill aims to provide flexibility for municipalities to accept late documentation from nonprofits, churches, and charities seeking tax exemptions.
   - **Discussion**: Currently, nonprofits must submit financials by June 1 to qualify for tax exemptions; otherwise, they are denied. The bill seeks to allow municipalities to accept late submissions before the tax rate is set.
   - **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the lack of clarity in the bill’s language, particularly around terms like "mistake or misfortune," and whether it could lead to inconsistent interpretations.
   - **Outcome**: The bill received mixed feedback, with support for its intent but calls for clearer definitions and administrative guidelines.

### **Municipal Governance and Public Access**

7. **HB 1086 (Public Notice of Zoning Board Hearings)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill proposes allowing municipalities to post public notices for Zoning Board of Adjustment hearings on their websites instead of in newspapers.
   - **Discussion**: Proponents argue it reduces costs and increases accessibility, while concerns were raised about the impact on local newspapers and absentee property owners' awareness.
   - **Outcome**: The committee discussed the potential benefits and drawbacks, with a focus on balancing cost efficiency and accessibility.

8. **HB 1342 (Licensing of Electronic Literary Materials by Libraries)**:
   - **Purpose**: This bill seeks to prevent publishers from charging libraries significantly higher rates for ebooks compared to the general public.
   - **Discussion**: Supporters argue it protects taxpayer dollars and ensures equitable access to digital materials.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about potential legal challenges and enforcement issues, particularly regarding private parties' administrative enforcement authority.
   - **Outcome**: The committee recognized the bill’s intent to protect taxpayer dollars but noted the need to address potential legal and practical implications.
