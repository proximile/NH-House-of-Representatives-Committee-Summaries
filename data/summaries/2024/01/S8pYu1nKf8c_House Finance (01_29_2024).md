**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting – January 29, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on January 29, 2024, to discuss critical financial and policy issues, focusing primarily on education funding, pension contributions, and public accessibility to foundational documents. The meeting highlighted tensions between dedicated funding for education, broader state financial needs, and the state’s responsibility to support local governments. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Education Trust Fund (ETF) and Surplus Allocation**
The Education Trust Fund (ETF) was a central topic, with debates centering on the potential transfer of its surplus to the **General Fund**. Key points included:
1. **Surplus and Legal Concerns**: The ETF currently holds a nearly $200 million surplus due to higher-than-expected business tax revenues. Members debated whether these funds should remain dedicated to education or be transferred to the General Fund for broader state needs. Concerns were raised about violating New Hampshire Supreme Court rulings, which mandate that state funds be spent exclusively on educational needs.
2. **Educational Adequacy**: Recent court rulings have required increased educational spending. Some members argued that the state already meets adequacy levels, citing calculations showing total educational expenditures of approximately $7,200–$7,300 per student (including special education, transportation, and retirement costs).
3. **Special Education Costs**: Local property taxpayers pay nearly $900 million annually for special education, with state aid only kicking in after certain thresholds are met. Questions arose about the frequency of full state reimbursement for these costs.
4. **Charter Schools**: The impact of charter schools on funding was discussed, particularly regarding special education costs for charter school students, which remain the responsibility of sending school districts.
5. **Opposition to Transfer**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Educators Association (NEA) opposed transferring funds out of the ETF, citing uncertainties such as lawsuits, workforce shortages, and charter school expansion. They argued that the surplus should remain dedicated to public education.
6. **Proposed Amendment**: A constitutional amendment related to education funding was mentioned, set to be heard in the Judiciary Committee.

### **House Bill (HB) 1279: State Contribution to Political Subdivision Pension Costs**
HB 1279 aimed to address the state’s historical failure to fulfill its commitment to fund a portion of pensions for teachers, police officers, and firefighters:
1. **Background**: The state’s contribution to these pensions decreased from 40% in 1967 to 0% by 2011. A one-time 75% contribution was restored in 2022 but reverted to zero afterward.
2. **Proposal**: The bill requires the state to pay 7.5% of political subdivision employer pension contributions.
3. **Arguments For**: Sponsors argued that the state’s failure to fulfill its promise has shifted costs to local municipalities, increasing property taxes. The bill aims to partially reinstate the state’s commitment and provide relief to local governments.
4. **Opposition Concerns**: Some members questioned the necessity of HB 1279, as a related bill (HB 50) is already under Senate consideration. Others raised concerns about funding mechanics and potential redundancy.
5. **Testimony**: Supporters, including teachers’ unions and municipalities, emphasized the financial burden on local governments. Opponents questioned the bill’s alignment with other legislative efforts and its impact on unfunded liabilities.

### **House Bill (HB) 1323: Appropriation for Printing the NH State Constitution**
HB 1323 sought to increase funding for printing copies of the New Hampshire State Constitution:
1. **Current Situation**: Currently, 5,000 copies are printed every two years, primarily for schoolchildren. Public requests often exceed available copies, necessitating the use of archived versions.
2. **Proposal**: The bill proposes doubling the printing budget to 10,000 copies per biennium to make the Constitution more widely accessible.
3. **Funding Source**: The Secretary of State suggested using the notary fee account (RSA 5:10-b), which has a surplus that lapses to the general fund annually.
4. **Arguments For**: Supporters highlighted the educational value of physical copies and the importance of making the Constitution readily available to all citizens.

### **House Bill (HB) 1560: Transfer of ETF Surplus to General Fund**
HB 1560 proposed transferring the ETF surplus to the General Fund:
1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to provide more flexible use of the surplus for other pressing state needs (e.g., highway fund, Fish and Game).
2. **Arguments For**: The sponsor argued that the surplus should not sit unused in the ETF but rather address broader state needs.
3. **Opposition Concerns**: Critics questioned whether the transfer aligns with the ETF’s original purpose and expressed concerns about the impact on education funding, particularly for programs like special education and building aid.
4. **Testimony**: Supporters emphasized financial flexibility, while opponents argued that the surplus should remain in the ETF to ensure funding for education-related expenses.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Financial Responsibility**: Both HB 1279 and HB 1560 focus on reallocating funds to address financial burdens on local governments and the state.
2. **Accessibility and Education**: HB 1323 emphasizes the importance of making foundational documents like the state Constitution widely accessible.
3. **Legislative Efficiency**: Concerns were raised about the redundancy of introducing similar bills (HB 1279 and HB 50) and the need for clear funding mechanisms.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing dedicated funding for education with broader state financial needs. Discussions also highlighted the state’s responsibility to support local governments and the importance of making foundational documents accessible to the public. The committee will continue deliberating on these bills before making recommendations to the full House.
