**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/16/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representativesâ€™ Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on January 16, 2024, focused on several bills addressing condominium governance, financial management, energy rates, and dispute resolution. The discussions highlighted tensions between **homeowner rights**, **board responsibilities**, and **management company practices**, with calls for greater accountability, transparency, and fairness in condominium associations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key issues and bills discussed:

---

### **1. Financial Management and Special Assessments**
- **House Bill 1430**: This bill proposed changes to the **Condominium Act** and **RSA 378**, addressing **special assessments** and **electric rates** for condominium associations.  
  - **Special Assessments**: Homeowners expressed frustration with rogue boards or management companies imposing large assessments without homeowner approval. Proposals included capping special assessments at **5% of the budgeted expenses** unless approved by a majority of homeowners.  
  - **Financial Planning**: Proper **reserve studies** and budgeting for future capital improvements (e.g., roofing, paving) were emphasized to avoid unexpected expenses.  
  - **Fiduciary Duties**: Boards have a **fiduciary duty** to maintain properties, but concerns were raised about the current **two-thirds vote** threshold to reject assessments, which some argued is too high.  
  - **Condominium Loans**: Associations can take out loans for capital improvements, with payments incorporated into the budget.  

---

### **2. Energy Rates for Condominiums**
- **House Bill 1430** also addressed **electric rate classifications** for condominium associations.  
  - **Residential vs. Commercial Rates**: Debate centered on whether common areas (e.g., pools, septic systems, streetlights) should be charged **residential or commercial rates**. Condominium representatives argued that strictly residential facilities should not be classified as commercial, while the **New Hampshire Department of Energy** opposed the bill, asserting that condominium associations are inherently commercial entities.  
  - **Economic Impact**: Condominium owners highlighted the financial burden of commercial rates on residential associations, emphasizing that common areas are not used for profit.  

---

### **3. Governance and Transparency**
- **House Bill 1172**: Proposed reducing the notice period for condominium association meetings from 10 to 5 days for associations with 70% or more full-time residents. It also clarified that committees are not subject to the same notice requirements as full boards.  
- **Monthly Meetings**: A separate proposal to require monthly board meetings was debated, with opponents arguing it would burden volunteer boards and increase management fees.  
- **Proxy Voting**: Another bill aimed to clarify the use of **directed and undirected proxies** in condominium voting, particularly in associations with many out-of-state owners.  

---

### **4. Dispute Resolution**
- **House Bill 11129**: Proposed the creation of a **Condominium Dispute Resolution Board** to handle complaints from unit owners about associations failing to follow governing documents or state laws.  
  - **Proxy Voting and Notice**: The bill clarified the use of proxies and required proper notice for meetings and voting procedures.  
  - **Dispute Board Powers**: The board would provide an alternative to costly court proceedings, but concerns were raised about unclear powers, jurisdiction overlaps, and the inability of associations to file complaints against unit owners.  
  - **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal note estimated a cost of $374,000 for staffing the board, though some argued only a **board administrator** (costing around $80,000) was necessary.  
  - **Opposition**: The **Community Associations Institute (CAI)** opposed the bill, arguing it undermines self-governance and creates a "one-way street" favoring unit owners.  

---

### **5. Legal and Procedural Concerns**
- **Transparency**: Homeowners criticized the lack of timely release of meeting minutes, with current law requiring minutes within 60 days but often ignored.  
- **Enforcement**: Homeowners face difficulties enforcing existing laws, with calls for better mechanisms to hold boards accountable without resorting to litigation.  
- **Frivolous Complaints**: The dispute board would have the authority to dismiss frivolous or meritless complaints, but procedures for handling complaints forwarded from the Consumer Protection Bureau remained unclear.  

---

### **6. Testimony and Stakeholder Input**
- **Homeowners** shared personal experiences of mismanagement, excessive spending, and lack of transparency in their condominium associations, highlighting the need for reform.  
- **Legal Experts** and **attorneys** supported bills aimed at increasing flexibility and efficiency in condominium governance.  
- **State Agencies**: The **New Hampshire Department of Energy** opposed bills addressing electric rate classifications, while the **Assistant Attorney General** provided technical feedback without taking a position.  

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Accountability**: Calls for greater oversight of management companies and boards to prevent mismanagement and excessive spending.  
- **Transparency**: Proposals to increase transparency in financial planning, meeting notices, and decision-making processes.  
- **Fairness**: Advocacy for equitable electric rate classifications and accessible dispute resolution mechanisms.  
- **Self-Governance vs. Regulation**: Tensions between preserving self-governance in condominium associations and the need for state intervention to address systemic issues.  

The meeting concluded with plans to form subcommittees to further review and refine the legislation, ensuring clarity and fairness in addressing the concerns of condominium owners, boards, and management companies.
