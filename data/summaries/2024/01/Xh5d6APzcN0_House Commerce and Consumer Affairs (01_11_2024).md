The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on January 11, 2024, focused on a range of bills and amendments related to alcohol regulation, licensing, and the craft brewing industry. The discussions highlighted the tension between fostering economic growth in the craft brewing industry and maintaining regulatory controls to ensure public safety and prevent underage drinking. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **House Bill 1334: Sale of Beer in Refillable Containers (Growlers)**
The primary focus of the discussion was **House Bill 1334**, which aims to clarify that breweries can fill refillable containers, specifically **Growlers**, with their beer, regardless of the branding on the container. The bill addresses inconsistencies in current practices, where some breweries and Liquor Commission inspectors have interpreted the law differently. Key points included:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill seeks to support New Hampshire’s craft beer industry by removing unnecessary barriers to beer sales while maintaining consumer clarity and safety.
- **Testimony from Brewers**: Rob Collins, owner of Frost Heave Brewery, testified in support of the bill, emphasizing that Growlers are essential for small breweries. He argued that the current prohibition on filling branded Growlers with another brewery’s beer is unnecessary, as customers are fully aware of what beer they are purchasing.
- **Liquor Commission’s Position**: Representatives from the Liquor Commission, including Chief Mark Armaganian and Lieutenant Matt Culver, expressed no opposition to the bill but suggested adding language to ensure it does not conflict with existing liquor laws, particularly those prohibiting the refilling of liquor bottles.
- **Concerns and Clarifications**: Committee members raised questions about the definition of **refillable containers** and whether the bill should specify that Growlers must have a secure cap or closure. There was also discussion about potential misuse of refillable containers by unscrupulous businesses.
- **Next Steps**: The bill is considered workable but may require amendments to address definitions and ensure it does not conflict with existing liquor regulations.

### **Three-Tier System and Craft Brewing**
The committee also debated the three-tier alcohol distribution system (producer, distributor, retailer) and its impact on craft brewing. Key discussions included:
- **Economic Benefits**: Representatives emphasized the economic benefits of craft brewing and the need for regulatory flexibility, including the creation of a "nano brewery" license for small-scale producers.
- **Free Market vs. Regulation**: Some representatives questioned whether the state should allow the free market to operate more freely, making activities illegal only if problems arise, rather than preemptively restricting them. This discussion referenced historical alcohol regulation, such as Prohibition, and compared it to modern zoning laws.
- **Revenue and Licensing**: The committee examined the financial impact of alcohol licensing and taxation, particularly the revenue generated from rooms and meals taxes. There was discussion about the low beer tax in New Hampshire and the potential effects of proposed changes on state revenue.

### **Keg Labeling and Specialty Beer**
Other key discussions included:
- **Keg Labeling Requirements**: A bill was introduced to eliminate the requirement for kegs to be labeled with customer information to prevent underage drinking. The Liquor Commission explained the historical rationale for the labeling system, which was intended to deter adults from providing alcohol to minors. However, it was noted that the system had not been effective in preventing such incidents.
- **Specialty Beer Definition**: Another bill aimed to redefine "specialty beer" by lowering the minimum alcohol content threshold from 6% to 0.5%. Representatives and Liquor Commission officials discussed the potential overlap with other beverage categories and the need to avoid confusion in the market.

### **House Bill 1018 and Amendments**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 1018**, which addresses technical clarifications for liquor licenses, including changes to definitions and license types. An amendment was introduced to include hookah lounges under the cigar bar license, allowing them to comply with existing regulations by including hookah sales in the 60% revenue requirement for cigar-related products. Testimony from Matthew Culver of the New Hampshire State Liquor Commission highlighted the need for clarity in statutes to help industry members and enforcement divisions.

### **House Bill 1076: On-Premises Licenses for Wine Manufacturers**
**House Bill 1076** allows wine manufacturers to hold an on-premises license either at their manufacturing facility or at their retail outlet. The intent is to provide flexibility for wine manufacturers whose primary locations may not be suitable for restaurants. The discussion also touched on New Hampshire’s three-tier system and how this bill fits within that framework.

### **House Bill 1358: Contract and Tenant Manufacturing**
**House Bill 1358** aims to standardize contract and tenant manufacturing for liquor, wine, and beverage manufacturers, aligning them with existing practices in the beer industry. The discussion emphasized the complexity of the bill and the need for further refinement in subcommittee.

### **House Bill 1380: Brew Pub Licenses**
**House Bill 1380** expands the privileges of brew pub licenses, allowing holders to also hold on-premises or off-premises licenses, provided they do not hold any other manufacturing license. The bill addresses issues faced by restaurants with multiple locations that want to operate brew pubs, ensuring compliance with the three-tier system. The discussion included the history of brew pubs in New Hampshire and the regulatory challenges they face.

### **Overall Implications**
Throughout the meeting, representatives and stakeholders discussed the implications of these bills on New Hampshire’s three-tier alcohol distribution system, the need for regulatory clarity, and the economic impact on local businesses. The committee also addressed specific concerns from industry members and explored how the proposed changes would affect existing businesses and compliance with state laws.

In summary, the meeting highlighted the ongoing effort to modernize alcohol regulations in New Hampshire, balancing the needs of the growing craft brewing industry with the necessity of maintaining public safety and regulatory controls. The committee considered various amendments and proposals to achieve this balance, with plans to revisit several bills in future sessions.
