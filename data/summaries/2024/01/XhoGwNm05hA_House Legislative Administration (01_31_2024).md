The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 31, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative topics, focusing on workers' rights, financial security, procedural improvements, and youth engagement. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Workers' Rights and Financial Security**
Representatives emphasized the importance of workers' rights to earn a living wage, access healthcare, and live with dignity. Data from the MIT Living Wage Calculator highlighted significant variations in living wages based on family size and housing costs in New Hampshire. Discussions also addressed financial insecurity, with one in four households earning less than $50,000 annually and 17.7% earning less than $35,000. The need to tackle poverty, affordable housing, and public education funding was underscored.

### **House Resolution 29 (HR29)**
HR29 proposed establishing a commission for longitudinal studies on legislative impacts. The committee debated the necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a commission, with suggestions for pilot programs or hiring external firms for specific studies. The motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill passed 8-6, with a minority report expected.

### **House Bill 1219**
This bill sought to allow members of the general court to participate in the Department of Health and Human Services' employee assistance program (EAP). Supporters argued it would provide valuable mental health resources, while opponents noted redundancy with existing services like 211, funded by charitable donations. The ITL motion passed due to concerns about unnecessary costs and the availability of free resources.

### **Study Committee and Legislative Process**
Members discussed the need for a study committee to address unresolved issues in a bill, emphasizing the importance of identifying and addressing concerns before moving forward. The committee was given until mid-March to report back.

### **Diversity in Education**
A member proposed adding "ideological diversity" to the statute, advocating for greater representation from homeschooling, private schooling, and charter schooling. The discussion highlighted the need for broader socioeconomic and geographic diversity in educational settings.

### **Legislative Youth Advisory Council (LYAC)**
Rebecca Leak, a member of LYAC, testified in support of HB 1080, urging the inclusion of amendments that would expand eligibility for postsecondary members, particularly those taking online classes from out-of-state institutions. She emphasized the value of LYAC in providing youth a voice in legislative matters.

### **Economic Justice Bill of Rights (HR 29)**
Representative Schultz introduced HR 29, a resolution inspired by FDR's "Second Bill of Rights," aimed at addressing economic inequality and ensuring basic rights such as fair wages, affordable housing, quality education, and healthcare. The resolution seeks to foster bipartisan dialogue on economic justice and the common good.

### **Testimonies in Support of HR 29**
Viola Ksim (Granite State Organizing Project) and Claudia Stelle (United Church of Christ) spoke in favor of HR 29, stressing the need for economic security and the importance of valuing all residents, regardless of background. They highlighted issues like homelessness, lack of affordable childcare, and the struggle for basic needs.

### **Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Discussion**
Members discussed the role of EAP counselors in helping employees maintain productivity by identifying problems and connecting them with appropriate resources. The assigned case worker would monitor progress and ensure employees receive necessary support.

### **House Bill 1363**
The motion for "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) on HB 1363 was passed with a vote of 9-5, indicating the bill would not proceed. A Minority Report was mentioned but not detailed.

### **House Bill 1000**
The bill aimed to classify New Hampshire legislative services as public service for certain federal purposes. Rep. Costable argued it was unconstitutional, as legislators are not state employees and the bill would bend federal program rules for personal benefit. The motion for ITL passed with an 11-3 vote.

### **House Bill 1290**
This bill addressed protections for legislators from being fired for legislative activity. Rep. Costable argued it was unconstitutional, while others compared it to existing protections like FMLA. The motion for ITL passed with a 13-1 vote.

### **House Bill 152**
The motion for ITL on this bill, which involved mental health awareness flags, was unanimously passed (14-0). Members suggested alternative ways to promote mental health awareness, such as displaying flags at hospitals or distributing buttons.

### **House Bill 1666**
This bill focused on income reporting requirements for lobbyists. It was amended to allow online filing of registration and reporting forms, reduce reporting periods from four to three times a year, and set an effective date of January 1, 2027. The bill, as amended, passed unanimously (14-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.

### **House Bill 1343**
Representative Ross Berry introduced the bill, which aims to establish additional procedures for the use of gubernatorial emergency orders concerning election laws. The bill seeks to prevent unilateral changes to election laws by requiring the consent of the majority and minority leaders of both the House and Senate before any emergency order affecting election laws can be implemented. This is to ensure bipartisan oversight and prevent potential abuses of power, such as postponing elections or altering voting methods without legislative input.

### **House Bill 1080**
Representative Jody Nelson and Youth Co-Chair James Tebo introduced the bill, which aims to refine the practices and procedures of the Legislative Youth Advisory Council (LYAC). The bill seeks to streamline the appointment process for council members, lower the minimum age for applicants from 15 to 14, and establish a formal application process to ensure transparency and prevent favoritism. It also introduces anti-nepotism clauses, mandates collaboration with other youth councils, and allows for remote participation in meetings.

### **Overall**
The meeting highlighted ongoing debates about fiscal responsibility, the role of government in providing support services, and the importance of addressing poverty and financial insecurity in New Hampshire. Discussions also focused on procedural improvements, safeguarding election laws, and enhancing the effectiveness and inclusivity of the Legislative Youth Advisory Council. The need for bipartisan cooperation and creative solutions to economic challenges was a recurring theme throughout the meeting.
