**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 10, 2024**  
The New Hampshire House of Representatives Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on January 10, 2024, to discuss several bills addressing environmental, recreational, and infrastructure issues. The meeting highlighted the complex interplay between environmental protection, economic interests, and community needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **1. Wake Surfing and Wake Boats Regulation (House Bills 1301 and 1046)**  
The committee focused extensively on **House Bill 1301**, which proposes a petition process to regulate or ban **wake surfing** on public bodies of water. The debate centered on balancing **environmental protection**, **public safety**, and **recreational access**.  

#### **Support for the Bill:**  
- **Environmental Concerns**: Supporters, including residents and environmental advocates, cited issues such as **shoreline erosion**, **sediment disruption**, and **cyanobacteria blooms**, particularly in smaller or shallower lakes like Arlington Pond.  
- **Safety Issues**: Wake surfing was described as a safety hazard for swimmers, boaters, and shoreline properties, with testimonies highlighting property damage and unsafe conditions.  
- **Community Involvement**: The bill allows **25 or more residents** to petition the Department of Safety for restrictions, fostering community-driven solutions.  

#### **Opposition to the Bill:**  
- **Economic Impact**: Opponents, including the **Water Sports Industry Association** and **New Hampshire Marine Trades Association**, argued that wake surfing is a **$2.5 billion industry** and a key part of family recreation and tourism.  
- **Lack of Evidence**: Critics contended there is **no definitive scientific evidence** linking wake surfing to environmental damage, pointing to **runoff** and **wind erosion** as more significant contributors.  
- **Enforcement Concerns**: Opponents emphasized the need for **education** and **enforcement of existing laws** rather than new restrictions, citing the **Wake Responsibly Campaign** as an effective alternative.  

#### **Proposed Solutions:**  
- Increasing the **safe passage distance** from shore (from 150 to 200 feet).  
- Creating **depth maps** for wake boat operation.  
- Promoting **educational initiatives** to encourage responsible boating.

### **2. Boating Accident Reporting (House Bill 1046)**  
**House Bill 1046** addresses gaps in boating accident reporting by requiring **boat owners** to notify law enforcement and file a report if the operator fails to do so within 15 days. The bill received broad support as a **common-sense measure** to improve accountability and safety on waterways.

### **3. Environmental Accountability and Bonds (House Bill 1477)**  
The committee discussed **House Bill 1477**, which proposes requiring **environmental security bonds** for businesses that pose significant risks to natural resources. The bill aims to ensure companies, rather than taxpayers, cover cleanup costs in cases of environmental damage, such as **PFAS contamination** in Merrimack.  

#### **Key Concerns:**  
- The bill’s broad scope and potential unintended consequences.  
- Administrative burden on the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**.  

#### **Proposed Solutions:**  
- Forming a **study committee** to refine the bill and target high-risk industries effectively.

### **4. Taxation of Carbon Credits on Forest Lands (House Bill 1709)**  
**House Bill 1709** proposes taxing **carbon credits** generated from New Hampshire forest lands to offset potential losses in **Timber tax revenue**. The bill aims to ensure local property taxpayers are not subsidizing carbon credit programs that benefit entities outside the state.  

#### **Key Concerns:**  
- The complexity of assessing the value of carbon credits and integrating them into the existing **Timber tax system**.  
- Potential disincentives for forest land ownership or conversion to less beneficial uses.  

#### **Proposed Solutions:**  
- Spreading the cost of carbon credits over time to encourage timber harvesting.  
- Engaging experts, such as **Charlie Levesque**, to refine the proposal.  

---

### **5. Dam Management and Funding (House Bill 1429)**  
**House Bill 1429** addresses the management and funding of aging dams in New Hampshire, establishing a **revolving fund** to provide financial options for municipalities to take ownership or repair dams.  

#### **Key Points:**  
- Over 200 dams in the state are in disrepair, with significant capital needs.  
- The bill allows municipalities to take ownership of dams, focusing on economic viability and community benefits.  
- Concerns were raised about the environmental impact of keeping dams versus removing them, particularly for river health and fish passage.

### **6. Identifying Old Growth and Mature Forests (House Bill 1423)**  
**House Bill 1423** requires the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to identify and map **old growth and mature forests** on public lands.  

#### **Supporters:**  
- Highlighted the importance of old growth forests for **climate change mitigation**, **biodiversity**, and **carbon storage**.  

#### **Opponents:**  
- Argued the bill’s scope is too broad and costly, with the state’s **Forest Action Plan** already addressing forest management.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the **complexity of balancing environmental protection, economic interests, and community needs**. Key themes included:  
- The need for **scientific research** to inform policy decisions on wake surfing and carbon credits.  
- The importance of **community involvement** in resource management.  
- The challenge of integrating **new regulations** (e.g., environmental bonds, carbon credit taxes) into existing systems without unintended consequences.  

The committee will continue deliberating on these bills, with further discussions and potential amendments to address concerns from stakeholders.
