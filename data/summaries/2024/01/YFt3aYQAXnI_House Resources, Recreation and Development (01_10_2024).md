  - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Marine Trades Association and Water Sports Industry Association opposed the bill, citing its potential to harm tourism, create confusion, and unfairly target wake surfing. They advocated for education and enforcement of existing laws instead of new restrictions.
  - **Environmental Concerns**: David Neils from the Department of Environmental Services highlighted studies showing wake surfing’s impact on shoreline erosion and sediment resuspension.
  - **Community Conflict**: The bill has caused tension among lake residents, with some feeling their recreational activities are unfairly targeted.
  - **Outcome**: The committee voted to recommend **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)**, citing insufficient evidence and the need for more research.

### **House Bill 1423: Identification of Old Growth and Mature Forests**
- **Purpose**: Requires the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to identify and map old growth and mature forests on public lands to aid in climate change mitigation, biodiversity protection, and water quality management.
- **Discussion**:
  - **Support**: Environmental groups, including the New Hampshire Sierra Club, emphasized the ecological and recreational value of old growth forests.
  - **Concerns**: The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources expressed concerns about the feasibility of the bill, citing the vast acreage of public lands and the high costs of inventorying.

  - **Outcome**: The committee did not make a final decision but expressed interest in exploring amendments to address fiscal and logistical concerns.

### **House Bill 1429: Dam Ownership Transfer**
- **Purpose**: Establishes a procedure for transferring dam ownership to municipalities, including a revolving fund for dam repairs.
- **Discussion**:
  - **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill empowers municipalities to take local control of dams, ensuring long-term management and maintenance.
  - **Case Study**: Representative Lisa Mazour highlighted the case of the Hadley Falls Dam in Goffstown, where the town was blindsided by the state’s decision to surrender the dam’s license.

- **Discussion**:
  - **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill ensures fair taxation as landowners shift from timber harvesting to carbon credit generation.
  - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association opposed the bill, citing its complexity and potential to discourage forest land ownership.

### **Key Themes**:
1. **Environmental Protection vs. Economic Interests**: Many bills highlighted the tension between preserving natural resources and supporting local economies, particularly in industries like tourism, timber, and recreation.
2. **Local vs. State Control**: Discussions often centered on the balance between state management and local empowerment, particularly in decisions about natural resources and infrastructure.
3. **Need for Research and Dialogue**: Several bills were deferred or recommended for further study due to insufficient evidence or the need for broader community engagement.
4. **Accountability and Regulation**: Bills like HB 1046 and HB 1477 emphasized the importance of accountability in environmental and recreational activities.

The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing environmental, economic, and community interests in New Hampshire’s natural resource management.
