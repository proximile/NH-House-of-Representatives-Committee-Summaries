The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 11, 2024, centered on a series of pension-related bills aimed at addressing disparities, inequities, and challenges within the state's retirement system, particularly for municipal employees, firefighters, and police officers. The discussions highlighted the impact of the 2011 reforms, which reduced retirement benefits, and explored legislative efforts to restore fairness, improve retention, and address recruitment issues in public safety roles. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key themes and bills discussed:

### **1. Pension Calculations and Overtime (Segment 1/5)**  
The meeting began with a focus on how overtime work affects pension calculations, especially for employees hired before July 1, 2011. Mandatory overtime, driven by staffing shortages, has significant implications for work-life balance, health, and safety. Bills like **House Bills 1653 and 1673** were introduced to restore retirement benefits altered in 2011, ensuring overtime is consistently included in pension calculations. Testimonies emphasized the fiscal impact of these changes, including increased employer contributions to the retirement system. Firefighters, in particular, were highlighted for their long hours and unique challenges, underscoring the need to recognize their contributions in retirement benefits.

### **2. Standardizing Pension Multipliers (Segment 2/5)**  
**House Bill 1647** took center stage as a cost-effective solution to address the inequities created by the 2011 reforms, which reduced the pension multiplier for employees hired after July 1, 2011, from **2.5%** to **2%**. The bill proposes standardizing the multiplier at **2.5%** after 10 years of service, with an initial appropriation of **$55.9 million** and ongoing costs for municipalities and the state. While seen as a step forward, stakeholders acknowledged that it is not a complete fix. Retention and recruitment challenges persist, with many public safety employees leaving for neighboring states offering better benefits. **HB 436**, which would have fully restored pre-2011 benefits, remains the ideal but more costly solution.

### **3. Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs) for Retirees (Segment 3/5)**  
**House Bill 1307** addressed the financial struggles of retired firefighters and police officers in Group 2, who do not receive Social Security benefits. Over the past decade, COLAs for these retirees have risen by only **1.5%**, compared to a **29.3%** increase in the cost of living. The bill proposes amendments to include retirees making up to **$50,000**, which would cover **95%** of affected members. Testimonies highlighted the inadequacy of average pensions ($40,000–$45,000) and the need for legislative action to restore purchasing power for these essential public servants.

### **4. Management of Pension Assets and Supplemental Allowances (Segment 4/5)**  
The discussion expanded to include **House Bill 1421**, which proposes a competitive system for managing the state’s **$11.5 billion** pension assets by hiring two firms to incentivize better performance. Concerns were raised about the current management’s inaction during market downturns. Additionally, **HB 1307** was revisited to provide supplemental allowances and COLAs to retirees on accidental disability who retired before completing 20 years of service. The fiscal note estimated a cost of **$41,000** for **802** eligible individuals. Opposition to **House Bill 1211**, which allows part-time retirees to rejoin the workforce, was voiced due to concerns about undermining the retirement system’s sustainability.

### **5. Classification of Fire Instructors and Educators (Segment 5/5)**  
The final segment focused on **House Bill 1299**, which seeks to allow fire educators and instructors transitioning from active firefighting roles to remain in **Group 2** of the retirement system, which offers more favorable benefits than **Group 1**. Proponents argued this is necessary to attract experienced firefighters to teaching roles, while opponents raised concerns about inequities and the potential for other groups to seek similar reclassifications. The bill’s fiscal impact was noted to apply only to transitioning individuals, not the entire community system. **House Bill 1211** was also briefly discussed, proposing an increase in the number of hours retirees can work post-retirement to address staffing shortages, with a **10-year sunset provision**.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**  
- **Fairness and Equity**: The 2011 reforms created significant disparities in retirement benefits, particularly for public safety employees. Legislative efforts aim to restore fairness and address inequities.  
- **Retention and Recruitment**: Pension reforms are critical to retaining experienced employees and attracting new hires, especially in firefighting and law enforcement, where staffing shortages are acute.  
- **Fiscal Impact**: Many of the proposed changes carry financial implications for municipalities and the state, requiring careful consideration of long-term sustainability.  
- **Cost-of-Living Adjustments**: Retirees, especially those in Group 2, face financial challenges due to inadequate COLAs, necessitating legislative action to restore their purchasing power.  
- **Management of Pension Assets**: Introducing competition in managing the state’s pension assets could improve returns and address concerns about current management practices.  
- **Complexity of Retirement System**: Balancing recruitment needs with the integrity of the retirement system remains a challenge, with stakeholders expressing both support and opposition to proposed changes.  

Overall, the meeting underscored the urgent need to address pension inequities, support retirees, and ensure the long-term sustainability of New Hampshire’s retirement system while balancing fiscal responsibility and fairness.
