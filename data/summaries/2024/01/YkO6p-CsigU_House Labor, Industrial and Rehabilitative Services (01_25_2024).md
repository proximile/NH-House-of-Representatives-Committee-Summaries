The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Committee meeting on January 25, 2024, addressed several key labor-related bills, focusing on unemployment benefits, payroll cards, youth employment, and employee rights. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Unemployment Benefits and Trust Fund**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 1522**, which proposes increasing the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $427 to $753, a 75% increase. The current benefit, unchanged since 2007, has failed to keep pace with the rising cost of living, as evidenced by a 38.7% increase in the Consumer Price Index since 2007. The bill also introduces 21 new tiers, raising the top earning threshold to $57,500 annually, and increases wage replacement rates to 70% for lower tiers and 65% for new tiers.

**Concerns about the Unemployment Trust Fund** were a major focus. The fund, currently at around $160 million, is above the $150 million threshold indicating potential trouble but below the $250 million and $400 million triggers that ensure solvency during economic downturns. The proposed changes could reduce the fund by $50 million under current conditions, with additional losses of $85 million in a modest recession and a drop to $78 million in a severe recession. This raises concerns about the fund’s sustainability and the potential need for federal borrowing.

**House Bill 1597**, introduced by Representative Sullivan, seeks to incentivize part-time work by increasing the earnings threshold from 30% to 40% of the weekly benefit before deductions apply. This aims to encourage workforce participation without penalizing individuals for earning additional income.

### **Employer Costs and Regional Comparisons**
New Hampshire’s unemployment insurance (UI) tax burden is the lowest in the Northeast and the 14th lowest nationally, with employers paying a 0.57% tax on the first $14,000 of each employee’s wages. The state’s average weekly benefit of $353 is below the national average of $433, and its exhaustion rate of 11% is the lowest in the country. While the proposed $753 maximum benefit would be the 8th highest nationally, it would still be the 3rd lowest in the Northeast, behind states like Massachusetts ($1,400) and Maine ($894).

### **Youth Employment and Homeschooling**
**House Bill 1519**, introduced by Representative Linda Cam, clarifies that minors can work during traditional school hours if they are not required to be in school, such as homeschooled students or seniors with partial schedules. The Department of Labor emphasized the need for formal documentation from schools or parents to verify student schedules, raising concerns about the practicality of enforcement.

### **Payroll Debit Cards**
**House Bill 1648**, introduced by Representative Jim Kofalt, addresses the use of payroll cards as an alternative to traditional paper paychecks. The bill aims to protect employees by ensuring they are not responsible for fees associated with lost or stolen cards and requiring employers to provide a list of free ATM locations. The bill excludes union workers to avoid interfering with collective bargaining agreements.

**Concerns about payroll cards** included the potential for double payments if employees cannot access their funds immediately, especially over weekends or holidays, and the fees associated with card usage, such as ATM transaction fees, inactivity fees, and reload fees. Employers would not be charged for loading payroll funds onto the cards, but questions were raised about the costs of issuing and replacing cards.

### **Employee Rights and Severance Agreements**
**House Bill 1375**, introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, seeks to prevent employers from requiring employees to waive labor law rights in severance agreements, particularly non-disparagement clauses. Gallagher framed this as a freedom of speech issue, arguing that employees should be free to discuss their workplace experiences without fear of legal repercussions. Opponents, including the Business and Industry Association (BIA) and the New Hampshire Association of Counties, argued that the bill is unnecessary, as severance agreements are voluntary and already regulated by federal law.

### **Federal vs. State Labor Standards**
Mike Summers from the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association highlighted discrepancies between state and federal labor standards, particularly regarding work hours for minors. He urged legislators to align state standards with federal ones to avoid confusion and compliance issues for businesses.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing the need to support unemployed workers with the financial sustainability of the unemployment trust fund, while also encouraging workforce participation through part-time employment. Discussions around payroll cards, youth employment, and employee rights underscored the importance of clarity and alignment between state and federal labor laws to avoid compliance challenges. The committee acknowledged the need for further refinement of several bills to address concerns raised during the discussions.
