The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee meeting on January 22, 2024, focused on **House Bill 1025**, which proposes repealing the prohibition against using "derisive or offensive words" in public that are likely to provoke a violent reaction. The discussion centered on the implications of this change, particularly whether it would allow individuals to verbally harass or provoke others without legal consequences.

Key points from the discussion include:
1. **Concerns About Provocation**: Members questioned whether removing this prohibition would permit individuals to use offensive language to provoke violence, such as punching someone in response to verbal harassment.
2. **Free Speech vs. Harassment**: While free speech is protected, there was debate over whether the bill would enable harassment, intimidation, or incitement of violence. Some argued that if someone provokes another person, the provoked individual should not face legal consequences for retaliating.
3. **Real-Life Examples**: Members cited examples of harassment, such as a woman in Nashville being called racial slurs in front of her grandchildren and a group of protesters aggressively confronting individuals outside an event. These cases highlighted the potential consequences of removing the prohibition.
4. **Sponsor's Intent**: The sponsorâ€™s intent was unclear, but it seemed to focus on allowing individuals to use offensive language in public without legal repercussions.
5. **Recommendation**: The subcommittee, lacking a quorum, informally recommended **killing the bill (ITL)**. Members expressed concerns that the bill could lead to increased harassment and undermine civil society.

Overall, the subcommittee leaned against the bill, emphasizing the importance of maintaining legal protections against verbal harassment and provocation in public spaces.
