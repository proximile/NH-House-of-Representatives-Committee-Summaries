### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1340: Exclusion of Incarceration as Voluntary Unemployment for Child Support**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to codify existing case law and federal requirements that incarceration should not be considered voluntary unemployment for calculating child support.  
   - **Proposal**: Child support orders could be adjusted to $50/month or zero while a parent is incarcerated, reflecting their inability to earn income.  
   - **Debate**: Concerns were raised about fairness to custodial parents and potential abuse of the system by incarcerated individuals with hidden assets. Supporters argued that the bill aligns with federal regulations and prevents excessive child support arrears.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously in committee (16-0), with acknowledgment of the need for further amendments to address fairness and potential loopholes.

2. **House Bill 1308: Parental Access to Children’s Library Records**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill would allow parents access to their children’s library records, including books checked out from public and school libraries.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that parents should have oversight of their children’s reading materials, especially in light of controversial content in libraries.  
   - **Opposition**: Librarians and opponents raised concerns about privacy for older children, logistical challenges for libraries, and potential liability issues if non-custodial parents access records.  
   - **Testimonies**:  
     - **Representative Arlene Corello**, the bill’s sponsor, emphasized parental oversight and shared anecdotes about challenges parents face in tracking library materials.  
     - **Amber Coughlin**, a children’s librarian, opposed the bill, highlighting the importance of confidentiality for children dealing with sensitive issues like domestic violence or identity exploration.  
   - **Amendments**: Suggestions were made to clarify that only the parent or guardian who sponsors the library card should have access to records, addressing some custodial concerns.

3. **House Bill 1392: Consideration of the Child’s Opinion in Parenting Time**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to ensure children have a voice in court regarding parenting time without causing trauma.  
   - **Proposal**: Therapists or school counselors could assess a child’s maturity and provide input to the judge, with testimony occurring in chambers to avoid parental influence.  
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about potential manipulation by children and the role of therapists in assessing maturity.  
   - **Amendments**: A second amendment is pending based on feedback from judges.

4. **Constitutional Amendments on Parental Rights (CACR 25 and CACR 17)**  
   - **Purpose**: The amendments aim to reaffirm parental rights in controlling the health, education, and welfare of their children, consolidating existing Supreme Court rulings into the state constitution.  
   - **Debate**: Representatives discussed whether the amendments add anything new to existing law and raised concerns about the implications of broad vs. specific language.  
   - **Legal Concerns**: Questions were raised about the need for consultation with constitutional law experts to ensure the amendments are legally sound and align with the state’s constitutional framework.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee considered forming a subcommittee to refine the language and create a unified version of the amendments.

### **Key Themes and Concerns**

1. **Parental Rights vs. Children’s Privacy**:  
   - The meeting highlighted the tension between parental rights and children’s privacy, particularly in the context of library records and parenting time decisions.

2. **Logistical and Financial Challenges for Libraries**:  
   - Librarians testified that implementing HB 1308 would require significant additional staff and resources, which many libraries cannot afford.  
   - Concerns were raised about the impracticality of tracking every book or activity a child engages in, particularly in large libraries with extensive programs.

3. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**:  
   - Discussions on constitutional amendments and library records underscored the need for clarity and consistency with existing laws.  
   - Representatives emphasized the importance of narrowly tailored approaches to avoid unintended consequences and ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.
