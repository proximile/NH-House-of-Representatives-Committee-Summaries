**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Resources, Recreation, and Development (01/31/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 31, 2024, convened by the House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee, addressed a range of legislative proposals aimed at environmental protection, resource management, and public safety. Key discussions centered on bills related to cyanobacteria management, shoreline protection, timber harvesting, firewood cutting, and water safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key topics and outcomes:

---

### **1. Cyanobacteria Management (House Bill 1143)**
The committee focused on **House Bill 1143**, which addresses the growing issue of **cyanobacteria blooms** in New Hampshire lakes. Key points included:
- **Amendment to the Bill**: An amendment was introduced to streamline permitting for in-lake management projects, such as **alum applications**, which reduce phosphorus levels and prevent blooms. The amendment removed the requirement for the Department of Fish and Game’s concurrence, simplifying the process.
- **Phosphorus Control**: The bill emphasizes controlling phosphorus, a key nutrient driving cyanobacteria blooms, from both external (e.g., runoff, septic systems) and internal (e.g., sediment release) sources. The **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** will develop rules for in-lake treatments.
- **Health Risks**: Cyanobacteria pose significant health risks, including neurotoxicity and gastrointestinal issues. The state has issued warnings for 122 water bodies, with some blooms lasting over 100 days.
- **Funding and Support**: While the bill does not allocate new funding, it leverages existing resources like the **Cyanobacteria Mitigation Loan and Grant Fund**. Stakeholders, including **New Hampshire Lakes**, strongly supported the bill for its science-based approach.

### **2. Shoreline Protection (House Bill 1229)**
**House Bill 1229** aims to improve awareness of the **Shoreland Protection Act** among property buyers. Key discussions included:
- **Notification Requirements**: The bill requires that buyers of shoreline properties be informed of their responsibilities under the Act, including restrictions on tree cutting and fertilizer use near water bodies.
- **Realtors’ Opposition**: The **New Hampshire Association of Realtors** opposed the bill, citing redundant paperwork and liability concerns. They suggested alternative educational methods, such as direct notifications from municipalities or DES.
- **Environmental Support**: **New Hampshire Lakes** supported the bill, emphasizing the importance of educating property owners to protect water quality.
- **Proposed Amendments**: An amendment removed civil penalties, focusing instead on education and notification.

### **3. Timber Harvesting and Wetland Protection (House Bill 128)**
**House Bill 128** addresses permitting requirements for tree cutting in wetland buffer zones. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to ensure that tree-cutting services inform homeowners about wetland regulations to prevent unintentional violations.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including the **Division of Forest and Lands** and the **New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association**, argued the bill is overly broad and unworkable, particularly for commercial timber harvesting.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Stakeholders recommended focusing on education rather than legislation, such as providing informational materials at town offices.

---

### **4. Firewood Cutting Regulations**
The committee debated regulations around firewood cutting, particularly the requirement for landowners to file an "intent to cut" form. Key discussions included:
- **Personal Use**: Representatives questioned whether the requirement should apply to small-scale, personal firewood harvesting, citing administrative burdens on towns.
- **Wetland Laws**: The conversation emphasized the importance of understanding wetland laws, regardless of the scale of the operation.

---

### **5. Stream Debris Removal**
A bill allowing property owners to clear storm debris from streams without permits was discussed. Key points included:
- **Proposed Amendments**: The bill’s sponsor suggested removing the word "remove" from the statute to clarify that property owners can clear debris without permits.
- **DES Perspective**: DES indicated openness to revising rules to address confusion around woody debris in streams.
- **Broader Concerns**: Committee members raised concerns about uncoordinated stream alterations leading to downstream issues.

---

### **6. Towing Inflatables on Water (House Bill 1249)**
**House Bill 1249** clarifies regulations for towing inflatables on water. Key discussions included:
- **Safety Concerns**: The **Marine Patrol** opposed the bill, arguing that reducing the number of spotters could endanger individuals in emergencies.
- **Proposed Amendments**: The bill’s sponsor expressed openness to amendments to refine language and address safety concerns.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Education vs. Enforcement**: Several bills sparked debates on whether education or enforcement is the better approach to achieving compliance with environmental and safety regulations.
- **Clarity in Legislation**: There was a recurring call for clearer language in bills to avoid confusion among stakeholders.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Representatives and stakeholders emphasized the need for collaboration to refine bills and address concerns.
