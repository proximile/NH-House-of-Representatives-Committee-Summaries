The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 10, 2024, centered on critical discussions surrounding education funding, with a particular focus on addressing the inadequacies of the current system. The meeting highlighted several bills aimed at reforming school funding, improving equity, and ensuring compliance with constitutional mandates. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

### **1. Inadequate Base Adequacy Funding**
- **Current State of Funding**: The state’s base adequacy funding is $4,100 per student, far below the actual cost of education, which averages over $20,000 per pupil, including expenses like transportation, school nurses, and building maintenance.
- **Proposed Increases**: HB 1583 proposes increasing base adequacy funding to $10,000 per student, a figure derived from the ConVal lawsuit and supported by superintendents and education experts. However, some argue this is still insufficient, with Judge Ruof’s ruling suggesting $7,300 as a conservative baseline and experts recommending $9,900.
- **Impact on Local Taxes**: Small rural districts face significant financial strain, with local taxpayers bearing the brunt of funding shortfalls. Even modest budget increases result in substantial tax hikes for residents.

### **2. Special Education Funding**
- **Current Shortfalls**: The state provides $2,100 per special education student, far below the actual cost of $28,000 per student. HB 1656 proposes increasing this to $27,000 to better reflect the true costs of providing these essential services.
- **Testimonies**: Educators and parents emphasized the increasing complexity and costs of special education, exacerbated by factors like COVID-19, the opioid crisis, and mental health challenges. They stressed the need for equitable funding to ensure all students receive necessary support.

### **3. Equity and Economic Impact**
- **Disparities in Funding**: Low-income and rural districts face significant inequities, with property taxes disproportionately burdening residents. Speakers argued that the state must take greater responsibility to ensure all students, regardless of zip code, have access to quality education.
- **Economic Concerns**: The state’s aging population and the need to retain young people by improving educational opportunities were highlighted. Underfunding schools could hinder economic growth and exacerbate demographic challenges.

### **4. Judicial and Legislative Context**
- **Court Rulings**: The ongoing Claremont and ConVal lawsuits have ruled the state’s funding system unconstitutional, emphasizing the state’s obligation to provide an adequate education. The Rand lawsuit further declared the “swept tax” practice unconstitutional, where wealthy communities retain excess funds meant for education.
- **Legislative Action**: Legislators were urged to act on these rulings to ensure compliance with constitutional mandates, rather than waiting for further judicial intervention.

### **5. Specific Bills and Proposals**
- **HB 1586 (Foundation Opportunity Budget Program)**: This bill proposes shifting from an input-based to an outcome-based funding model, focusing on student performance. It aims to ensure equitable funding for districts that cannot meet their foundation budget through local property taxes, with mechanisms for accountability.
- **HB 1686 (Swept Tax Issue)**: This bill addresses the unconstitutional practice of allowing wealthy communities to retain excess statewide property tax (SWEPT) funds. It requires excess funds to be remitted to the Education Trust Fund, ensuring they are used for their intended purpose of funding adequate education statewide. The bill also expands property tax relief for low-income homeowners.
- **HB 1675 (Proficiency-Based Funding)**: This controversial bill ties school funding to student proficiency in reading and math, with provisions for partial reductions and exemptions for students with disabilities. Critics argue it would disproportionately harm low-income districts, while supporters believe it incentivizes schools to improve outcomes.

### **6. Broader Themes and Concerns**
- **State Responsibility**: The state’s constitutional obligation to adequately fund public education was a recurring theme, with calls for a bipartisan approach to address funding issues sustainably.
- **Accountability**: Several bills included provisions to ensure funds are used effectively to improve student outcomes, with a focus on equity and transparency.
- **Technical and Fiscal Challenges**: Representatives discussed the complexities of implementing these reforms, including tax rate calculations, timing of funding distributions, and the need for accurate accounting practices.

### **7. Call for Comprehensive Solutions**
- **Future Directions**: There was a consensus on the need for a comprehensive approach to education funding, with suggestions for using excess funds to enhance targeted aid programs, support low-income taxpayers, and fund initiatives like universal preschool or literacy programs.
- **Historical Context**: Speakers provided historical context on the evolution of education funding in New Hampshire, emphasizing the need to rectify long-standing inequities and ensure fair distribution of resources.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for increased state funding for education to alleviate the financial strain on local districts, ensure equitable access to quality education, and comply with constitutional mandates. Legislators were urged to act swiftly and collaboratively to address these challenges, with a focus on sustainable, equitable, and accountable solutions that benefit all New Hampshire students.
