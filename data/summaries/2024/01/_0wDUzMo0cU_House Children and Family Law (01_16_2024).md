The New Hampshire House of Representatives Children and Family Law Committee convened on January 16, 2024, to discuss several bills aimed at improving family law processes, enhancing transparency, and addressing systemic issues within the state’s child welfare and family court systems. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key bills and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **House Bill 1263: Parenting Coordinators in High-Conflict Family Court Cases**
- **Purpose**: Introduces parenting coordinators—professionals with backgrounds in psychology, social work, or law—to help high-conflict parents reach agreements on parenting plans, reducing litigation costs and time.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Both parents must agree to use a coordinator, and any court report requires mutual consent.
  - Coordinators focus on mediation and collaboration, unlike Guardians ad Litem (GALs), who make recommendations to the court.
  - Concerns were raised about the lack of enforcement authority, with some suggesting amendments to grant **qualified immunity** instead of full immunity to balance accountability and protection.
  - Training requirements (24 hours) and judicial discretion in appointing coordinators were also discussed.
- **Testimonies**:
  - Supporters, including sponsor Rep. Caitlyn Cab, emphasized the cost-effectiveness and conflict-reducing benefits.
  - Critics, like Tim P., shared experiences of coordinators lacking enforcement power, rendering them ineffective in high-conflict cases.
- **Next Steps**: The committee will revisit the bill in 2-3 weeks, with potential amendments to address enforcement and immunity concerns.

### **House Bill 1341: Repealing Grandparent Liability for Support**
- **Purpose**: Repeals RSA 167:3-a, which holds grandparents financially liable for supporting their grandchildren if the parents cannot or will not provide support.
- **Discussion**:
  - The law is rarely enforced and was deemed administratively burdensome following a $116,000 state-funded review.
  - Federal programs like TANF do not require grandparent liability, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) indicated no fiscal impact on the state.
- **Next Steps**: The bill will be revisited in an executive session in a few weeks.

---

### **House Bill 1266: Recording Family Court Proceedings**
- **Purpose**: Allows parties in open Family Court proceedings to record their own hearings, provided the recording does not interfere with proceedings or include private communications.
- **Discussion**:
  - Proponents, including former Rep. Betty Gay, emphasized the need for accurate records for transparency and appeals.
  - Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with existing court policies and the need to clarify the bill’s language.
- **Next Steps**: The bill will be addressed in an upcoming executive session, with potential amendments to align with judicial rules.

### **House Bill 1564: Child Support Guidelines**
- **Purpose**: Addresses child support guidelines, focusing on shared parenting, income disparities, and deviations from current guidelines.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill suggests no child support may be necessary when parents have equal income and parenting time.
  - Concerns were raised about deviations lacking clear guidance, potentially leading to inconsistency.
  - Supporters highlighted the need for fairness in shared parenting arrangements, while opponents argued that child support laws can be misused, particularly in cases involving domestic violence protection orders (RSA 173-B).
- **Next Steps**: The committee will review testimony and consider amendments.

### **House Bill 10006: Enforcement of Parenting Plans and Visitation Rights**
- **Purpose**: Addresses non-compliance with court-ordered parenting plans, particularly regarding visitation, by introducing stricter consequences and expediting court processes.
- **Key Points**:
  - Modeled after Missouri legislation, the bill emphasizes penalties for withholding visitation, not minor issues.
  - Concerns were raised about the judiciary’s reluctance to enforce penalties unless behavior is egregious.
  - Supporters, including parents and legal professionals, highlighted the importance of timely enforcement to protect children’s relationships with both parents.
- **Next Steps**: The committee will consider amendments, particularly regarding penalties and judicial discretion.

### **House Bill 1667: Establishing a Standalone Department for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF)**
- **Purpose**: Elevates DCYF from a division within DHHS to a standalone department to improve transparency, accountability, and case management.
- **Key Points**:
  - Proponents argued that DCYF’s current structure lacks sufficient oversight, citing systemic issues like the Harmony Montgomery case.
  - Opponents, including DHHS officials, emphasized the synergy and efficiency of keeping DCYF within DHHS and highlighted existing oversight mechanisms.
  - Fiscal impact was discussed, with no new funding proposed but potential costs for restructuring.
- **Next Steps**: The committee will reconvene in a few weeks to deliberate further.

---

### **House Bill 1511: Notification Procedures for Children with Disabilities**
- **Purpose**: Clarifies that notifications for episodes of treatment for children with disabilities should come from DHHS or school districts, not the courts.
- **Next Steps**: The bill will be addressed in an upcoming executive session.

### **Key Themes Across Bills**:
1. **Transparency and Accountability**: Several bills (e.g., HB 1266, HB 1667) aim to enhance transparency in family court and child welfare systems.
2. **Efficiency and Fairness**: Proposals like HB 1263 (parenting coordinators) and HB 1564 (child support guidelines) seek to reduce conflict and ensure fairness in family law processes.
3. **Systemic Reform**: HB 1667 and HB 10006 address systemic issues in child welfare and family court enforcement, emphasizing the need for timely and effective solutions.

The committee will reconvene in a few weeks to vote on these bills, with potential amendments to address stakeholder concerns and refine their language.
