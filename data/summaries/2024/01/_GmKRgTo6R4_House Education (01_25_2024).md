The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on January 25, 2024, to discuss several bills and issues related to special education, student privacy, and support for military-connected students. The meeting highlighted the complexities of special education funding, the importance of parental involvement, and the need for streamlined processes to ensure equitable access to education for all students. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

### **Special Education Legislation and Funding**
1. **HB 1639**: This bill proposes updating terminology related to facilities for adjudicated youth, replacing "Youth Services Center" with "State facilities for adjudicated Youth and County correctional facilities." The change aims to create more generic language to avoid future legislative updates due to facility name changes.

2. **HB 1480**: This bill seeks to reintroduce the Individualized Education Program (IEP) facilitation process into state law, which was repealed in 2015. The facilitation process involves a neutral third party assisting in IEP meetings to help parents and schools reach mutual agreements. The Department of Education emphasized the need for legislative backing to ensure the process’s continued effectiveness, and an amendment was proposed to clarify that the State Board of Education, not the Department of Education, would adopt the necessary rules.

3. **HB 1176**: This bill proposes establishing a commission to study current special education funding and explore alternative funding sources. The discussion highlighted the growing financial burden on school districts, particularly in rural areas, due to rising costs of student needs, administrative and legal expenses, and delays in receiving catastrophic aid. Testimonies from education administrators and advocates stressed the need for a comprehensive review of funding mechanisms, improved data collection, and advocacy for increased federal funding under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

4. **Special Education Funding Transparency**: A bill was introduced to prohibit the use of special education funds for other purposes and require reporting of fund balances to school boards. Supporters argued it would ensure transparency and accountability, while opponents, including school administrators, contended that existing mechanisms already ensure proper use of funds and that the bill could negatively impact inclusionary practices.

### **Parental Involvement and Classroom Observation**
1. **Parental Observation**: A bill allowing parents of special education students to observe their children in classrooms was discussed. Proponents argued that observation fosters collaboration between parents and teachers, while opponents raised concerns about potential Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) violations, classroom disruptions, and policy redundancy, as many schools already have visitor and observation policies. Suggestions included requiring parents to sign confidentiality agreements and expanding the bill to include all students to avoid singling out special education.

### **Dispute Resolution and Neutral Conferences**
1. **Neutral Conference Process**: A bill proposing changes to the neutral conference process, an alternative dispute resolution method for special education conflicts, was discussed. The changes aimed to make the process more flexible and user-friendly by allowing neutrals to offer opinions or options to resolve disputes. Testimonies highlighted that neutral conferences are underutilized and that the process may not be accessible to parents without legal expertise or resources. Concerns were raised about the formality and potential imbalance of the process, favoring school districts over parents.

### **Military-Connected Students and IEPs**
1. **HB 1382**: This bill aims to support military-connected students with disabilities by ensuring timely evaluations (within 30 days) and reimbursing expert witness fees for parents who prevail in due process cases. Military families often face challenges in transferring IEPs and ensuring continuity of care during frequent relocations. The Department of Defense and other stakeholders supported the bill, emphasizing the need for streamlined processes to support military families.

2. **Interstate Compact**: Questions were raised about whether the bill duplicates existing provisions in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children. While the compact addresses some issues, the bill aims to provide more specific timelines and protections for military families.

### **Student Privacy and FERPA**
1. **HB 1695**: This bill seeks to notify parents within 14 business days if their child’s personally identifiable information (PII) is released to a third party under FERPA exceptions. Advocates emphasized the need for transparency and parental consent, pointing out loopholes in FERPA that allow third-party vendors to share student data without explicit consent. Testimonies supported the bill but suggested improvements, such as requiring specific data elements shared and enforcing penalties for non-compliance.

### **Executive Session and Voting**
The committee went into executive session to discuss and vote on the bills, passing them with amendments and no opposition.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Special Education Funding**: The discussions underscored the urgent need for a comprehensive review of special education funding to address rising costs, administrative burdens, and the impact on local communities. Advocacy for increased federal funding under IDEA was a recurring theme.
- **Parental Involvement**: The importance of parental involvement in the IEP process was emphasized, with discussions focusing on balancing parental rights with the need to maintain classroom integrity and student privacy.
- **Dispute Resolution**: The need for accessible, transparent, and user-friendly dispute resolution processes for parents was highlighted, with calls to simplify the neutral conference process and reduce barriers for unrepresented parents.
- **Military Families**: The challenges faced by military-connected students with disabilities were addressed, with a focus on ensuring timely evaluations, continuity of care, and streamlined processes during relocations.
- **Student Privacy**: The discussions highlighted the need for greater transparency and parental consent in the handling of student data under FERPA, with calls to close loopholes that allow third-party vendors to share data without explicit consent.

Overall, the meeting reflected a strong commitment to improving special education services, ensuring equitable access to education, and addressing the needs of vulnerable student populations in New Hampshire.
