**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting on January 31, 2024**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on January 31, 2024, to discuss a wide array of legislative proposals, focusing on issues ranging from individual rights and public safety to technological challenges and industry accountability. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **1. Marriage License Modernization and Genealogical Data (House Bill 1220)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1220 seeks to remove the requirement for individuals applying for marriage licenses to provide information about their race and ancestry, a practice rooted in outdated laws historically used to limit interracial marriages.
- **Background**: The requirement, codified in 1858, was flagged as constitutionally suspect and deemed unnecessary. Efforts to remove it began in 2020 but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Debate**: Supporters argued that the requirement is outdated and invasive, with no modern utility. Opponents raised concerns about losing genealogical data and potential future health implications. The bill also prompted discussions about removing education-related data collection, which is similarly unused.
- **Outcome**: The bill aims to modernize marriage license applications by eliminating unnecessary and invasive requirements.

### **2. Guardianship and Access to Records (House Bill 1245)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1245 addresses the rights of adults under guardianship to access their personal records, including medical, financial, and educational records.
- **Background**: Current guardianship orders often restrict wards from accessing their own records, which advocates argue is an oversight.
- **Debate**: Disability rights supporters emphasized the importance of autonomy and transparency for wards. The Office of Public Guardian (OPG) raised concerns about the distinction between access to records and the authority to release them, particularly in sensitive cases.
- **Outcome**: The bill seeks to ensure wards can access their records unless a court finds a compelling reason to deny access.

### **3. The CROWN Act (House Bill 1169)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1169 aims to prohibit discrimination based on natural hairstyles, particularly protective styles like braids, locks, twists, and afros, which are often associated with people of color.
- **Testimonies**: Individuals shared personal experiences of discrimination in schools and workplaces, highlighting the emotional and professional toll of conforming to Eurocentric hair standards.
- **Debate**: The bill is part of a national movement, with 22 states having already passed similar legislation. Concerns were raised about the bill potentially undermining existing anti-discrimination laws.
- **Outcome**: Supporters emphasized the need for explicit protections against hair-based discrimination, with the bill’s sponsor open to amendments to address concerns.

### **4. Constitutional Amendment on Education Funding (CACR 12)**
- **Purpose**: CACR 12, introduced by Representative Dan Maguire, aims to address the **Claremont ruling**, a 30-year-old New Hampshire Supreme Court decision mandating the state to fund an "adequate education" for all public school children.
- **Debate**: Maguire argued that the ruling misinterpreted the state constitution, particularly the word "cherish," and created a $1 billion annual expense. Critics cautioned against undermining the state’s obligation to fund education.
- **Outcome**: The discussion highlighted the tension between local control and state responsibility for education funding, with no final decision reached.

### **5. Public Records Accessibility and Digitization (House Bill 1696 and Amendment 2024 d202 37h)**
- **Purpose**: The amendment proposes creating a centralized digital repository for municipal records to improve public access and reduce the burden on towns handling right-to-know requests.
- **Debate**: Supporters emphasized transparency and efficiency, while concerns were raised about implementation costs and the scope of digitization efforts.
- **Outcome**: The amendment aims to streamline recordkeeping and provide training for municipalities on digitization and metadata standards.

### **6. Regulation of Artificial Intelligence and Deepfakes (House Bill 1432)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1432 seeks to penalize the use of AI, particularly deepfake technology, to create harmful content that damages reputations, finances, or entraps individuals in criminal activity.
- **Debate**: The bill references incidents like deepfake pornographic videos of Taylor Swift and concerns about political deepfakes. Law enforcement raised questions about enforceability and legal definitions.
- **Outcome**: The bill aims to establish a private right of action for victims and address the rapid evolution of AI technology.

---

### **7. Firearm Industry Liability (House Bill 1037)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1037 proposes repealing a 2003 state law that shields firearm manufacturers and dealers from liability when their products are used in crimes.
- **Debate**:
  - **Supporters**: Argued that the law prioritizes industry protection over public safety and accountability, citing cases like the Sandy Hook lawsuit.
  - **Opponents**: Stressed the economic importance of the firearm industry and Second Amendment rights, arguing that manufacturers should not be held liable for criminal misuse.
- **Outcome**: The discussion highlighted the deep divide between public safety advocates and defenders of gun rights and industry protections.

---

### **8. Anti-SLAPP Legislation (House Bill 1475)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1475 aims to protect free speech by preventing Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs), which are lawsuits intended to silence critics through legal costs.
- **Debate**:
  - **Supporters**: Highlighted the importance of empowering individuals to speak out without fear of retaliation, particularly in cases involving public discourse or whistleblowing.
  - **Opponents**: Raised concerns about the bill potentially weaponizing free speech protections and the inclusion of punitive damages.
- **Outcome**: The bill seeks to balance free speech rights with the need to prevent abusive lawsuits.

### **9. Regulation of Local Ordinances on Public Nudity (House Bill 1603)**
- **Purpose**: HB 1603 seeks to prohibit towns and cities from enacting ordinances that discriminate based on sex or race, particularly in cases involving public nudity.
- **Debate**: The bill was inspired by a 2018 court case (*State v. Lily*) and aims to ensure gender-neutral laws. Concerns were raised about enforcement and the distinction between sex and gender.
- **Outcome**: The discussion highlighted ongoing debates about gender equality and local governance.
