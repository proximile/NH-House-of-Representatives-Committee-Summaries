**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (January 26, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on January 26, 2024, to discuss a wide range of healthcare and human services topics, focusing on Medicaid, maternal mortality, behavioral health, and public awareness campaigns. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Medicaid Enrollment and Redetermination**
The committee reviewed the ongoing Medicaid redetermination process following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. As of December 2023, only 350 redeterminations remained, with income being the primary reason for closures (47% of cases). The committee emphasized outreach efforts to vulnerable populations, including the homebound and disabled, to ensure they complete the process. Managed care organizations (MCOs) have been instrumental in assisting individuals with redeterminations.

- **Children’s Medicaid Enrollment**: A decline in children’s Medicaid enrollment was noted, attributed to factors such as aging out of eligibility and fewer children in the state. New Hampshire’s eligibility threshold for children’s Medicaid remains higher than the national average. Families are transitioning to other coverage options, such as ACA exchange plans, to maintain healthcare access.
- **Long-Term Care and Disabled Population**: The majority of remaining redeterminations involve long-term care and disabled individuals. Outreach continues to address closures due to income or incomplete paperwork.
- **Ex Parte Renewals**: The committee highlighted the success of ex parte renewals, which use existing data to determine eligibility without requiring additional paperwork, particularly for programs like Granite Advantage (Medicaid expansion).

### **Dental Care**
Progress in adult dental care coverage under Medicaid was reviewed. The number of providers and patients accessing services has increased, though claims slightly declined during the holiday period. Mobile dental clinics are being deployed to reach underserved areas.

### **Public Awareness Campaign on Alzheimer’s and Dementia**
The committee received an update on the public awareness campaign for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. A request for proposals (RFP) has been released, and the procurement process is underway. The subcommittee on Alzheimer’s and other dementias has met twice, focusing on education, outreach, and updating the state plan on Alzheimer’s. Upcoming meetings will include presentations on the basics of Alzheimer’s and a clinical perspective from a geriatrician.

### **DHHS Commissioners Update**
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) provided updates, including the introduction of Justin Luer, the new Chief Executive Officer of Hamet Hospital. Luer discussed his background in behavioral health and his goals for improving hospital operations, particularly reducing emergency room wait times and enhancing services for children. He emphasized building stakeholder relationships, implementing safety huddles, and addressing safety concerns through hospital renovations.

Carol Whitmann and Dr. Caroline Yamas presented the New Hampshire Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC) report. Key findings included:
