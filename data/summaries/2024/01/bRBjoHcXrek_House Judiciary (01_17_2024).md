### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting (January 17, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 17, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative topics, with a primary focus on amendments to the state's **Right-to-Know Law (RSA 91-A)**, judicial conduct and training, and election recounts. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Right-to-Know Law Amendments (House Bills 102 and 1696)**

#### **House Bill 102: Fees for Large Requests**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to address the burden of large or voluminous Right-to-Know requests, particularly those made for commercial purposes, by allowing municipalities to charge fees for requests exceeding 10 hours of work.
- **Support**: Municipal officials, including representatives from Rochester, Keene, and Nashua, supported the bill, citing the strain on resources caused by excessive or weaponized requests. They proposed amendments to cap hourly charges at $25 and clarify the application of fees.
- **Opposition**: Transparency advocates, journalists, and residents opposed the bill, arguing it would deter public access to information, disproportionately affect media and out-of-state entities, and create barriers for citizens seeking accountability. Concerns were raised about potential discriminatory practices and the bill's constitutionality.
- **Key Issues**: Debate centered on balancing transparency with administrative burdens, the definition of "citizen" in the law, and the role of the Right-to-Know Ombudsman in resolving disputes. Amendments were proposed to ensure fairness and prevent misuse of the fee structure.

#### **House Bill 1696: Electronic Records**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to codify the requirement that public bodies provide requested documents in electronic format when feasible, following court rulings like *Green v. SAU 55*.
- **Support**: Advocates, including the ACLU, Right to Know NH, and the NH Press Association, emphasized the efficiency, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of electronic records. They highlighted the importance of modernizing public records access for transparency and accountability.
- **Challenges**: Some municipalities have stopped providing electronic records due to ambiguity in the law or technical limitations. Concerns were raised about handling large files, redacting sensitive information, and potential misuse of automated requests.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included mandating electronic provision for records already in digital format, allowing requesters to choose delivery methods (e.g., email, thumb drive), and clarifying language to ensure broader accessibility.

### **Judicial Conduct, Training, and Oversight**

#### **HB 13: Name Changes for Violent Offenders**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to prevent violent offenders from changing their names without justification, ensuring public safety and accountability.
- **Support**: Testimonies from victims, law enforcement, and legal professionals highlighted the risks of offenders concealing their identities and the need for victims to have a say in such decisions.
- **Concerns**: Some cautioned against mandatory victim notification, as it could retraumatize victims. Amendments were suggested to align the billâ€™s definitions with existing statutes.

#### **HB 104: Repeal of the Judicial Conduct Commission**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to repeal the Judicial Conduct Commission, deemed unconstitutional in 2004, as judicial oversight is now handled by the Judicial Conduct Committee.
- **Debate**: While some supported the repeal as redundant, others argued the commission provided necessary checks and balances on the judiciary.

#### **HB 15: Judicial Training**
- **Purpose**: The bill would establish judicial training requirements and create a Judicial Training Coordinator position to ensure judges are adequately trained, especially when assigned to unfamiliar areas.
- **Support**: Advocates emphasized the need for consistent and relevant training to improve judicial skills and public trust.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the legislature's authority to mandate training and the heavy workload of judges, particularly in the Circuit Court, which limits their ability to attend training sessions.

### **Election Recounts and Legal Processes**

#### **HB 1489: Ballot Recount Appeals**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows individuals who successfully challenge a municipal or school ballot recount to recover attorney fees and court costs, providing more protection and incentive for such challenges.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the current process is costly and discouraging, and the amendment would enhance accountability in election recounts.

#### **Indigent Defense System**
- **Discussion**: The Judicial Council proposed streamlining the appointment of attorneys for indigent defendants, including using contract attorneys in certain cases. They also suggested tracking the frequency and costs of such appointments to assess their impact.

#### **Witness Fees and Mileage Reimbursement**
- **Proposal**: A debate ensued about reinstating witness fees and increasing mileage reimbursement rates, which were historically low. The Judicial Council suggested that raising rates would not significantly impact the budget.

### **Broader Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted several overarching themes:
1. **Transparency vs. Administrative Burden**: Discussions on Right-to-Know Law amendments reflected the tension between ensuring public access to information and addressing the practical challenges faced by municipalities.
2. **Judicial Accountability and Training**: Proposals for judicial training and oversight underscored the importance of improving judicial skills, ensuring accountability, and maintaining public trust in the judiciary.
3. **Legislative Authority and Separation of Powers**: Debates about the legislature's role in mandating judicial training and repealing oversight bodies raised questions about the boundaries of legislative authority.
4. **Accessibility and Fairness**: Efforts to modernize public records access, streamline legal processes, and protect victims emphasized the need for fairness, efficiency, and inclusivity in governance.

### **Next Steps**
The committee will consider proposed amendments and testimony before making recommendations on the bills. Key areas for further discussion include clarifying language in Right-to-Know Law amendments, addressing concerns about judicial training mandates, and ensuring the fairness and accessibility of legal and electoral processes.
