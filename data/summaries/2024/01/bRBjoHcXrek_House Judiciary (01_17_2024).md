### **Right-to-Know Law Reforms (House Bills 102 and 1696)**

1. **House Bill 102**:  
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to regulate public records requests by defining "reasonable" requests and allowing public bodies to charge up to **$25 per hour** for labor costs exceeding **10 hours** in a one-month period. It also permits public bodies to suggest modifications to large or burdensome requests.  
   - **Support**: Proponents, including Representative Caitlyn Kouta, argued that the bill addresses the burden of voluminous or vexatious requests, often from out-of-state entities seeking data for financial gain. Municipal and state officials emphasized the need to protect taxpayer resources and staff time.  
   - **Opposition**: Advocacy groups like the ACLU of New Hampshire and Right to Know NH, along with journalists and citizens, opposed the bill, arguing it would deter legitimate requests, harm transparency, and disproportionately impact individuals with limited financial resources. Concerns were also raised about potential constitutional violations.  
   - **Amendments**: Discussions included adding provisions for individuals to file complaints with the Ombudsman if they believe the estimated cost or hours for a request is unreasonable.

2. **House Bill 1696**:  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to codify the provision of public records in **electronic format**, ensuring accessibility and efficiency. It responds to municipalities ceasing electronic delivery due to advice from the New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA), despite court rulings supporting it.  
   - **Support**: Witnesses from the New Hampshire Press Association, ACLU, and citizens highlighted the convenience, accessibility, and environmental benefits of electronic records. Amendments were suggested to mandate electronic delivery when records exist in that format and to prohibit charges for electronic copies.  
   - **Concerns**: Some representatives raised concerns about potential abuse of electronic requests, such as automated or repeated requests. Practical issues like email size limits and cybersecurity risks were also discussed.  
   - **Municipal Association’s Role**: The NHMA’s advice to stop electronic delivery was criticized as contrary to transparency and accessibility.

### **Judicial Training and Oversight (House Bills 15 and 14)**

1. **House Bill 15**:  
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes **mandatory judicial training** for new and current judges, including the establishment of a Judicial Training Coordinator position. It aims to ensure fair and consistent application of the law, particularly when judges are assigned to areas outside their expertise.  
   - **Support**: Supporters emphasized the need for training to address systemic issues in the courts, such as family court problems and lack of accountability.  
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the legislature’s authority to mandate judicial training, given the separation of powers. Amendments were suggested to replace "may" with "shall" to make training mandatory and to ensure transparency by allowing public access to training materials.  

2. **House Bill 14**:  
   - **Purpose**: The bill seeks to **repeal the Judicial Conduct Commission statute (RSA 494-A)**, which was deemed unconstitutional in 2004.  
   - **Support**: Representative Kitlin Kutab argued the statute is outdated and unused, as the Judicial Conduct Committee now handles judicial discipline.  
   - **Opposition**: Critics like Randall Ker argued that judges policing themselves leads to a lack of accountability and fairness, citing personal experiences with dismissed complaints.

### **Judicial Cleanup and Recount Reforms (House Bills 1274 and 1489)**

1. **House Bill 1274**:  
   - **Purpose**: This "judicial cleanup bill" corrects inconsistencies in current law to align with existing practices. It includes adjustments to the **Judicial Council membership**, reinstates **witness fees and mileage reimbursement**, and allows courts to appoint contract attorneys directly in certain cases to ensure continuity of representation.  
   - **Amendments**: An amendment was proposed to allow the judicial branch to transfer appropriations between class lines and accounting units, increasing the transfer threshold from $75,000 to $100,000.  

2. **House Bill 1489**:  
   - **Purpose**: The bill amends RSA 669:35 to apply only to **municipal and school election recounts**, allowing individuals who successfully challenge a recount to recover attorney fees and court costs.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued this would incentivize proper recount procedures and provide recourse for those wronged by improper recounts.

### **Notification of Name Changes by Violent Offenders (House Bill 103)**

1. **Purpose**: The bill requires offenders convicted of **violent felonies or crimes against children** to notify the prosecuting jurisdiction when requesting a name change.  
2. **Support**: Witnesses, including Pamela Keilig from the NH Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence and Bonnie Sider, shared personal stories emphasizing the need for victim input and public safety.  
3. **Concerns**: Discussions included harmonizing the bill with the annulment statute and addressing discrepancies in the listed offenses.
