### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/10/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 10, 2024, to discuss several bills addressing consumer protection, right to repair, liquor regulations, and gender-based pricing. The meeting highlighted legislative efforts to modernize regulations, promote fairness, and balance economic benefits with public safety concerns. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and proposals:

---

### **Consumer Protection and Gender-Based Pricing**
1. **Gender-Based Pricing ("Pink Tax") (HB 1406)**:
   - Representative Ellen Reed introduced **HB 1406**, which seeks to ban gender-based pricing disparities, where products marketed to women (e.g., pink razors) are priced higher than identical products marketed to men. 
   - The bill aims to address the estimated $2,400 annual cost burden women face due to such pricing practices. It applies to goods and services but excludes sex-based products like menstrual items.
   - Enforcement challenges were raised by the Attorney General’s office, particularly in determining whether products are "substantially similar" and handling potential complaints. Additional resources would be required to enforce the bill effectively.
   - Proponents argued that the bill promotes equity and challenges societal gender norms, while opponents expressed concerns about feasibility and clarity in enforcement.

2. **Consumer Protection Ambiguity**:
   - Representatives discussed the ambiguity in defining "unfair practices" under current consumer protection laws and whether they adequately prevent gender-based pricing discrimination. This issue will be revisited in a subcommittee meeting in February.

---

### **Right to Repair (HB 1071)**
- **HB 1071**, introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, focuses on the right to repair educational technology, such as Chromebooks, which schools often cannot repair due to manufacturer restrictions. 
- While Google has since allowed repairs, the bill aims to codify this right to prevent future issues. 
- **TechNet**, a trade association, opposed the bill, citing data security concerns and advocating for authorized repair channels. Supporters emphasized the importance of reducing waste and ensuring access to repairs.

### **Liquor Regulations**
1. **Home Distillation of Spirits (HB 1624)**:
   - Representative Scott Wallace proposed **HB 1624**, which would legalize home distillation of spirits, similar to homebrewing beer and wine. 
   - Wallace argued that federal enforcement is unlikely and pointed to other states that have legalized home distillation. The Liquor Commission remained neutral but open to further discussion.

2. **Liquor Store Hours (HB 1198)**:
   - Representative Timothy Horrigan introduced **HB 1198**, which would allow state liquor stores to open on holidays like Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, days they are currently closed. 
   - The bill is enabling legislation, meaning stores can choose to open if financially beneficial. Fiscal notes suggest potential revenue gains, and the bill aims to better serve travelers and businesses during holidays.

3. **Alcohol Serving Hours (HB 1227)**:
   - Representative Jessica Grill proposed **HB 1227**, which extends the time alcoholic beverages can be served on-site from 1:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. statewide, with an option for municipalities to authorize a 3:00 a.m. limit. 
   - Proponents argued it would align New Hampshire’s laws with neighboring states, boost nightlife, and provide local control. Concerns about public safety, particularly drunk driving, were addressed by noting the availability of ride-sharing services and law enforcement’s role.

### **Public Health and Education**
1. **Alcohol Use Disorder Awareness (HB 1621)**:
   - Representative David Priest supported **HB 1621**, which aims to distribute educational materials about alcohol use disorder in liquor stores. 
   - New Hampshire has the highest per capita alcohol consumption in the U.S., and the bill seeks to address the health, social, and economic costs of excessive drinking. Concerns about fiscal impact led to suggestions for cost-effective alternatives like posters or messages on receipts.

---

### **Modernizing Regulations**
1. **Auto Financing Regulation (HB 1243)**:
   - The Banking Department proposed amendments to RSA 361a to modernize and streamline auto financing regulations, addressing consumer protection issues. 
   - Amendments include regular examinations of retail sellers, additional reporting requirements, and a net worth requirement for lenders. The Auto Dealers Association supported the bill, emphasizing the need for modernization.

---

### **Economic Benefits vs. Public Safety**
- A recurring theme in discussions about extending alcohol sales hours was the balance between economic benefits and public safety. Proponents argued that extended hours would boost revenue, support hospitality workers, and keep New Hampshire competitive with neighboring states. 
- Opponents, including law enforcement, raised concerns about increased drunk driving incidents, staffing challenges, and the strain on resources. The importance of local control and responsible alcohol service was emphasized.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on addressing consumer protection, modernizing regulations, and promoting fairness while balancing economic and public safety considerations. Key issues like gender-based pricing, right to repair, and alcohol regulations will be further discussed in subcommittee meetings and work sessions. The representatives emphasized the need for clarity, practicality, and stakeholder input in crafting effective legislation.
