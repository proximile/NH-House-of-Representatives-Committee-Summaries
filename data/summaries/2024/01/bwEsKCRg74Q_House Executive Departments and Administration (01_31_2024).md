### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 31, 2024

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Executive Departments and Administration committee convened on January 31, 2024, to discuss several bills focused on professional licensing, workforce barriers, retirement benefits, payment methods, and employee classifications. The discussions highlighted tensions between streamlining regulatory processes, reducing liability, and maintaining robust oversight and professional standards. Below is a cohesive summary of the key issues and debates:

---

### **Professional Licensing and Advisory Boards**

1. **House Bill 1271 (Advisory Boards)**:
   - The bill proposes converting several professional licensing boards, including those for acupuncture and midwifery, into advisory boards to streamline operations, reduce liability risks, and address workforce barriers.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Liability Concerns**: The advisory model aims to mitigate liability risks for board members by shifting oversight to the state, particularly in light of the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case *North Carolina Dental Examiners v. FTC*.
     - **Workforce Barriers**: Advocates argued that current licensing requirements, such as the bachelor’s degree mandate for acupuncturists, are overly restrictive and limit workforce growth.
     - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Midwifery Council and acupuncture professionals strongly opposed the bill, emphasizing the need for specialized oversight and autonomy to maintain public safety and professional standards.
     - **Efficiency and Compliance**: Proponents highlighted inefficiencies in some boards, such as the Installation Standards Board, which met only once in FY23, leaving the state out of compliance with federal regulations.

2. **House Bill 1408 (Board Consolidation)**:
   - The bill proposes merging several licensing boards, including the Board of Mental Health Practice, Board of Psychologists, and Board of Licensing for Alcohol and Other Drug Use, into a single entity.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Psychological Association (NHPA) and addiction counselors, strongly opposed the bill, arguing that consolidation would undermine specialized expertise and public safety, particularly in addressing New Hampshire’s mental health and opioid crises.
     - **Historical Context**: Psychologists cited past inefficiencies and increased liability from previous consolidations, emphasizing the benefits of maintaining separate boards.
     - **Workforce Shortages**: Consolidation could exacerbate workforce shortages by discouraging professionals from practicing in New Hampshire due to increased regulatory risks.
     - **Proposed Solutions**: Stakeholders recommended maintaining separate boards while increasing collaboration with the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to address inefficiencies.

3. **House Bill 1285 (Podiatry and Medicine Boards)** and **House Bill 1286 (Land Surveyors and Engineers Boards)**:
   - These bills propose merging the Board of Podiatry with the Board of Medicine and the Board of Land Surveyors with the Board of Professional Engineers, respectively.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Opposition**: Podiatrists and land surveyors strongly opposed the mergers, emphasizing the distinct regulatory needs and specialized expertise required for their professions.
     - **Public Safety**: Testifiers argued that merging boards could dilute oversight and compromise public safety, particularly in areas like diabetic foot care and land surveying.
     - **Efficiency Concerns**: Opponents noted that merging boards would increase administrative burdens and workload without achieving cost savings or improving efficiency.
     - **Volunteer Challenges**: The increased time commitment for volunteer board members could deter qualified individuals from serving.

### **Payment Methods and Equity**

1. **House Bill 1411 (Cash Payments)**:
   - The bill mandates the acceptance of cash payments for state services to ensure accessibility for low-income individuals and those without bank accounts.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Equity and Accessibility**: Supporters emphasized the importance of cash for vulnerable populations, arguing that cashless systems exclude those without access to electronic payment methods.
     - **Logistical Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the logistics of reintroducing cash payments on toll roads, including the need to rehire toll booth operators and associated costs.
     - **Safety Concerns**: Testifiers highlighted the risks of handling large cash payments and proposed limits on cash transactions to address safety issues.
     - **Fiscal Implications**: The fiscal note for the bill was debated, with questions about whether increased revenue from cash payments would offset the absence of fees from electronic transactions.

### **Retirement Benefits and Employee Classification**

1. **House Bill 1299 (Fire Educator Retirement Benefits)**:
   - The bill proposes allowing fire educators in the community college system to retain Group 2 retirement benefits after transitioning from active fire service.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Fairness and Equity**: Concerns were raised about creating separate classifications within the faculty workforce and the potential costs of retaining Group 2 benefits.
     - **Proposed Amendment**: An amendment was suggested to require 20 years of fire service experience to qualify for Group 2 benefits, balancing retention incentives with cost savings.

2. **House Bill 1307 (One-Time COLA for Retirees)**:
   - The bill proposes a $500 one-time cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for certain retirees, particularly those in Group 2.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Amendment**: An amendment was suggested to raise the income threshold to $50,000 to include more retirees.

3. **House Bill 1548 (Employee Classification Updates)**:
   - The bill incorporates changes to state employee classifications and salary ranges made by the Joint Committee on Employee Classification over the past two years.
