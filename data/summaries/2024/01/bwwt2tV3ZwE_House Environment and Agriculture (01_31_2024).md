**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (01/31/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee meeting on January 31, 2024, addressed a wide range of environmental, agricultural, and waste management issues. The discussions centered on improving waste management and recycling systems, updating landfill regulations, addressing emerging contaminants, supporting local food systems, and enhancing animal welfare protections. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered across the six segments:

---

### **1. Waste Management and Recycling**
- **Wastewater Treatment and Clean Water Act Compliance**: The committee emphasized the importance of wastewater treatment plants complying with Clean Water Act discharge permits, particularly regarding leachate treatment from landfills and meeting discharge limits into rivers.
- **Landfill Leachate and Groundwater Monitoring**: Concerns were raised about tracking leachate from landfills, including its treatment locations and data trends. Groundwater monitoring, especially in areas like Rochester, NH, was highlighted as critical for detecting contaminants and ensuring compliance with quality standards.
- **Recycling Challenges**: Patrick Creger from the Plastics Industry Association noted that New Hampshire’s recycling rates (23%) lag behind the national average (32%). Contamination in recycling streams (e.g., non-recyclable items) and the need for improved public education and advanced sorting technologies (e.g., optical sorters, robotics) were discussed.
- **Chemical and Mechanical Recycling**: Both traditional mechanical recycling and advanced chemical recycling technologies were explored, with the latter offering potential for processing degraded materials and creating new polymers for medical and food-contact applications.

### **2. Landfill Management and Emerging Contaminants**
- **Leachate and Landfill Gas Monitoring**: The committee discussed monitoring leachate and landfill gas at both lined and unlined landfills. Leachate is either piped or trucked to wastewater treatment plants, though emerging contaminants like PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) pose significant challenges due to their persistence in the environment.
- **Groundwater Permits and Corrective Actions**: Landfills are subject to groundwater monitoring permits, with corrective action plans required if contamination is detected. The long-term nature of landfill impacts and the need for ongoing monitoring were emphasized.
- **Public vs. Private Landfills**: Concerns were raised about private landfills accepting out-of-state waste and the handling of leachate from these sources.

### **3. Updates to Solid Waste Management Rules (Chapter 800)**
- **Rulemaking Process**: Mike Winsatt, Director of the Waste Management Division at DES, provided updates on the Chapter 800 rulemaking process. A draft released in October 2023 was revised based on feedback from the regulated community, particularly regarding hydraulic conductivity standards.
- **Hydraulic Conductivity Debate**: The October draft proposed stricter standards (10⁻⁵ cm/s), but the January draft reverted to a less stringent standard (10⁻⁴ cm/s) due to industry concerns. Committee members questioned the change and called for greater transparency in the rulemaking process.
- **Balancing Environmental Protection and Feasibility**: Winsatt highlighted the challenge of crafting rules that ensure safe landfill operations without making waste management prohibitively expensive or inaccessible.

### **4. Supporting Local Food Systems**
- **Bill on Food Production and Agricultural Practices**: The committee debated a bill aimed at strengthening local food communities. Concerns were raised about selective support for certain types of farmers (e.g., organic vs. conventional) and potential food safety risks. Some representatives advocated for an interim study to refine the bill and ensure it supports all farmers equitably.
- **Consumer Rights and Food Safety**: Discussions emphasized the importance of consumer choice and the need to balance promoting local food systems with maintaining safety standards.
- **Historical Context**: The pandemic’s impact on supply chains was cited as a reason to strengthen local food systems and ensure food security.

### **5. Agriculture, Food Safety, and Animal Welfare**
- **HB 1680 - Prohibiting the Sale of Dogs and Cats by Retail Pet Shops**: Concerns were raised about sourcing animals from puppy mills. Representatives debated whether banning retail pet shops or regulating sourcing would be more effective.
- **HB 1572 - Labeling for mRNA Technology in Food**: The bill aimed to require labeling for lab-grown meat, insect-based foods, and foods containing mRNA technology. Representatives discussed the feasibility and potential health implications, with some suggesting federal oversight to avoid inconsistent state regulations.
- **HB 1565 and HB 1685 - Sale of Homestead Food**: These bills focused on loosening regulations for small-scale food producers. Discussions highlighted the need to balance supporting local producers with ensuring food safety.

---

### **6. Equine Practices and Animal Cruelty (HB 1182)**
- **Adding Specific Practices to Animal Cruelty Laws**: The bill sought to explicitly prohibit practices like hoof soring, gingering, tail nicking, and tail blocking in equine events. Supporters argued that specificity would aid enforcement, while opponents contended that existing laws were sufficient.
- **Enforcement and Education**: Questions were raised about the practicality of enforcement and the need for education and reporting rather than new legislation.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included broader language about "cosmetic changes that cause harm" and mandatory inspections at horse shows.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
The meeting underscored the importance of:
- Improving waste management and recycling systems through better data tracking, advanced technologies, and public education.
- Rigorous monitoring and management of landfills to protect groundwater and public health, with ongoing challenges posed by emerging contaminants like PFAS.
- Balancing environmental protection with industry feasibility in rulemaking processes.
- Supporting local food systems while ensuring food safety and consumer choice.
- Enhancing animal welfare protections through clear legislation and enforcement.

The committee emphasized the need for further study, transparency, and collaboration with experts to address these complex issues effectively.
