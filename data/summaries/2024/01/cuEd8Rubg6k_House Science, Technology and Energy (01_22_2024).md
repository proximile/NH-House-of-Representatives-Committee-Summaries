The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 22, 2024, to address a range of critical issues, including forest carbon credits, timber taxation, electric vehicle (EV) rebates, and geoengineering. The meeting featured extensive discussions, expert testimonies, and debates on proposed legislation aimed at balancing economic, environmental, and public health concerns.

### **Forest Carbon Credits and Timber Taxation**

A significant portion of the meeting focused on the implications of forest carbon credit programs, particularly their impact on New Hampshire's timber industry and local economies. Key points included:

1. **Concerns About Carbon Credits**: Stakeholders expressed worries that carbon credit programs could reduce timber harvesting, negatively affecting local sawmills, trucking industries, and small businesses. The complexity of assessing carbon credits was highlighted, with local assessors struggling to evaluate these programs effectively.

2. **Timber Tax Bill**: Representative Kaplan introduced a bill to simplify the assessment of carbon credits, requiring landowners to condense complex documents into a single form for easier evaluation by local assessors.

3. **Economic Impact**: The potential reduction in timber harvesting could drive up housing costs, as wood is a primary material for home construction. The discussion also touched on the systemic effects of large-scale landowners using carbon credits to restrict timber harvesting.

4. **Moratorium Proposal**: House Bill 1697 proposed a two-year moratorium on New Hampshire's participation in carbon credit programs to allow for a comprehensive study of their economic and environmental impacts. The moratorium would apply to new carbon credit sales, not existing contracts.

5. **Private Property Rights**: While respecting private property rights, there was concern about the long-term economic impact on local communities and the need for a regulatory framework to balance environmental goals with the forest economy.

6. **Expert Testimony**: Forestry experts and county commissioners testified about the potential consequences of carbon credit programs, emphasizing the need for a study committee to thoroughly examine the issue.

### **Electric Vehicle Rebates**

The committee also discussed **House Bill 1472**, which proposes a two-year pilot program for point-of-sale EV rebates funded by $3 million from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) proceeds. Key points included:

1. **Rebate Mechanics**: The rebate would be applied at the dealership, reducing the purchase price, with the dealership later reimbursed by the state. This would shift funds from ratepayers to EV buyers, with an estimated monthly impact of about 21 cents per household.

2. **Equity Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the rebate primarily benefiting wealthier individuals, as EV buyers tend to be higher-income. Proponents suggested adding income guidelines to ensure fairness.

3. **Program Design**: The bill lacked specifics on rebate amounts, eligibility criteria, and whether it applies to new or used EVs. There were also concerns about administrative challenges for the Department of Energy (DOE) to implement the program.

4. **Opposition from DOE**: The DOE testified in opposition, citing increased electricity costs for ratepayers, lack of administrative resources, and the absence of a sunset clause for the funding mechanism beyond the two-year pilot.

5. **Alternative Suggestions**: Some representatives suggested exploring pilot programs for EV battery storage to stabilize the grid rather than focusing on EV rebates. Others recommended forming a work group to refine the bill and address its gaps.

### **Geoengineering and Solar Radiation Management**

The meeting also addressed **House Bill 1700**, which seeks to prohibit the intentional release of polluting emissions, including cloud seeding, weather modification, and excessive electromagnetic radiation. Key points included:

1. **Support for HB 1700**: Environmental organizations and other stakeholders expressed strong support for the bill, emphasizing the need to protect New Hampshire's air, water, and soil from harmful experimental practices like solar radiation modification (SRM) and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI).

2. **Concerns About Weather Modification**: Testifiers highlighted the lack of public consent and transparency regarding weather modification experiments, referencing historical examples where such practices were conducted without public knowledge.

3. **Public Health and Environmental Impact**: Concerns were raised about the potential health risks of nanoparticles and other pollutants used in weather modification experiments, which could harm wildlife, agriculture, and human health.

4. **Calls for Transparency and Consent**: Many speakers stressed the importance of public consent and transparency in governance, particularly concerning environmental and health risks.

5. **Proposed Solutions**: Suggestions included adding transponders to planes to monitor and prevent unauthorized spraying, revising the bill to focus on private sector regulation, and establishing a study committee to explore the issue further.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the complexity of the issues at hand, with strong arguments for and against the proposed legislation. The committee was urged to carefully consider the potential impacts on landowners, the timber industry, the stateâ€™s economy, and public health. The need for more information, equitable program design, and a balanced approach that respects both private property rights and public interests was a recurring theme throughout the discussions. The committee planned further work sessions to refine the bills and address the gaps identified during the meeting.
