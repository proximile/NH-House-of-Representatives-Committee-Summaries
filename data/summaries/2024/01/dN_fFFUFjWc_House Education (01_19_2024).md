**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (01/19/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on January 19, 2024, centered on the complexities of education funding, with a focus on equity, adequacy, and the challenges of addressing disparities across school districts. The discussions spanned multiple segments, covering key issues such as the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT), funding formulas, special education costs, and proposed legislative changes. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key points:

---

### **1. Adequacy and Equity in Education Funding**
The meeting highlighted ongoing concerns about the adequacy and equity of New Hampshire’s education funding system. Representatives debated whether the current funding formula meets the needs of all districts, particularly those with lower property valuations. Disparities in state aid per pupil were a recurring issue, with some districts receiving significantly more funding than others. The discussion emphasized the need for a more equitable system that ensures all students have access to adequate educational resources.

---

### **2. Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) and Excess Funds**
The Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) and the handling of excess funds were contentious topics. Some representatives argued that excess SWEPT funds should remain with local districts to support education, while others advocated for redirecting these funds to the state to address funding disparities. The concept of negative property tax rates, which occur when non-property tax revenues exceed appropriations, was also discussed, with examples illustrating the unique challenges faced by municipalities.

---

### **3. Funding Formulas and Disparities**
The committee examined historical and modern funding formulas, particularly the 2008 model, and discussed the need for updates to address fiscal capacity disparities among communities. Concerns were raised about "fiscal cliffs" in funding distribution and the lack of alignment between the 2008 targets and current mechanisms. The committee emphasized the importance of thorough data analysis to inform future decisions and ensure equitable aid distribution.

---

### **4. Special Education and Base Cost Funding**
Special education funding was a major focus, with House Bill 1656 proposing to increase the adequacy grant for special education from $2,100 to $27,000 per pupil. The committee debated whether this amount should be uniform or differentiated based on the level of services required. Additionally, House Bill 1583 addressed the base cost of education, currently set at $4,100 per pupil. Members questioned whether this amount is sufficient, citing the ConVal court case, which found that a higher amount (around $7,356 per pupil) is needed to provide an adequate education.

---

### **5. Proposed Changes to Education Funding (House Bill 1586)**
House Bill 1586 introduced significant changes to the state’s education funding formula, including:
- A new **Foundation Opportunity Budget** based on student needs, district size, and grade levels.
- A **minimum local contribution** of $425 per $1,000 of property value, with the state covering the gap.
- A **95% efficiency factor** and an **80% phase-in** to gradually increase funding.
The bill aims to benefit smaller, economically challenged districts (e.g., Berlin, Claremont, Manchester) while reducing funding for wealthier districts (e.g., Alton). However, it requires an additional $200 million in state funding and lacks fiscal capacity disparity aid, raising concerns about equity.

---

### **6. Legal and Policy Challenges**
The committee acknowledged the legal complexities surrounding SWEPT and the need to address potential constitutional issues. The discussion highlighted the importance of developing a sustainable and legally sound funding system that balances state and local contributions while ensuring adequacy and equity.

---

### **7. Interim Studies and Future Work**
Throughout the meeting, there was strong support for conducting interim studies to thoroughly examine the education funding formula, special education costs, and other key issues. These studies would involve gathering detailed data from the Department of Education, analyzing historical models, and exploring differentiated funding approaches. The committee plans to continue its work in future meetings, with a focus on refining variables like the minimum contribution rate and phase-in percentage.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Equity and Adequacy**: The current funding system fails to meet the needs of all districts, particularly those with lower property valuations. Addressing disparities is a top priority.
- **Special Education**: Increased funding for special education is necessary, but the amount should be differentiated based on the level of services required.
- **Funding Formulas**: Historical models need modernization to eliminate fiscal cliffs and ensure equitable aid distribution.
- **Legislative Proposals**: House Bill 1586 aims to create a fairer funding model but faces challenges in balancing state and local contributions and addressing property value disparities.
- **Interim Studies**: Further analysis is needed to develop precise funding models and address complex legal and policy issues.

The meeting underscored the complexity of education funding in New Hampshire and the need for thoughtful, data-driven policy development to ensure that all students have access to an adequate and equitable education. The committee’s work will continue as it seeks to refine funding mechanisms and address the diverse needs of the state’s school districts.
