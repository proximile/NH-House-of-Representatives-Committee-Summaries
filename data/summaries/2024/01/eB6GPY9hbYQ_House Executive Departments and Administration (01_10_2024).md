**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (January 10, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Executive Departments and Administration convened on January 10, 2024, to address two major areas of focus: the rule-making process and its alignment with legislative intent, and the findings of a performance audit on mental health workforce licensing. The meeting underscored the importance of legislative oversight, public involvement, and administrative efficiency in ensuring that rules and processes serve the public interest and align with state laws.

### **Rule-Making Process and Legislative Oversight**

The committee began by discussing the rule-making process, emphasizing the need for alignment with legislative intent and the prevention of agency overreach. Key points included:

1. **Rule-Making Procedures**: The committee highlighted the importance of reviewing new rules published in the upcoming register and scheduling meetings accordingly. Most meetings are expected to be brief and attached to full committee meetings.

2. **New Rules Under Review**:
   - **PLC 1700**: A new rule regulating professional bail bondsmen, a novel area for the committee. A public hearing is scheduled for early February to gather stakeholder input.
   - **PLC 1600**: A rule addressing the registration of nursing agencies. The committee noted that concerns from the previous year had been addressed, and the rule now aligns with legislative intent.

3. **Legislative Oversight**: The committee emphasized the role of the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) in ensuring that agency rules do not exceed legislative authority. Once rules are approved by JLCAR, the legislature’s oversight ends, and implementation becomes the executive branch’s responsibility.

4. **Concerns About Agency Overreach**: Members expressed concerns about some agencies exceeding their legislative authority in rule-making. Examples included disproportionate requirements, such as a restaurant being mandated to install an excessively large grease trap, which was later resolved through collaboration and revised rules.

5. **Public Involvement**: The committee stressed the importance of public participation in the rule-making process, particularly during public hearings, to ensure rules reflect legislative intent and address practical concerns.

### **Mental Health Workforce Licensing Audit**

The second segment of the meeting focused on the findings of a performance audit conducted by the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) office, which examined barriers to entry into mental health professions in New Hampshire during fiscal year 2022. Key findings and discussions included:

1. **Audit Overview**: The audit reviewed licensing requirements for 15 mental health professions and the processes of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC). While New Hampshire’s requirements generally align with national standards, some board practices unnecessarily prolonged the licensing process.

2. **Key Findings**:
   - **Portability Issues**: Inefficiencies in license portability for professionals moving from other states were identified, including redundant documentation and case-by-case reviews.
   - **Temporary Licensing**: Temporary licensing processes were inconsistent, with some boards imposing additional requirements beyond state law.
   - **Military Applicants**: Boards had not developed processes to facilitate licensing for military members and their spouses, despite state law requiring it.
   - **Criminal Background Checks**: Disqualifying criminal convictions were not clearly defined, leading to inconsistent application of rules.
   - **Exam Requirements**: Some exam requirements were overly restrictive, hindering portability for out-of-state professionals.

3. **Recommendations**: The audit made 12 observations, six of which may require legislative action. Recommendations included streamlining the licensing process, clarifying temporary licensing rules, and addressing inconsistencies in criminal background checks.

4. **OPLC Response**: OPLC representatives acknowledged the issues and outlined steps to address them, including transitioning to a new licensing portal and developing interim rules to streamline processes. They also cited challenges with the state’s outdated licensing system and resource constraints.

5. **Committee Discussion**: Committee members expressed concerns about licensing delays and the lack of alignment between board practices and state laws. Potential legislative changes were discussed, particularly around expediting licensing for military families and improving portability.

6. **Rulemaking Subcommittee**: The committee discussed the role of its subcommittee on rulemaking, which reviews rules related to bills under the committee’s purview to ensure alignment with legislative intent. The subcommittee plans to meet regularly to address these issues.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**

The meeting highlighted several overarching themes:

1. **Balancing Oversight and Implementation**: The committee emphasized the delicate balance between legislative oversight and executive implementation of rules, ensuring that rules align with legislative intent and avoid overreach.

2. **Public Participation**: Public involvement, particularly through public hearings, was underscored as critical to ensuring that rules and processes address practical concerns and reflect legislative intent.

3. **Streamlining Processes**: The audit revealed inefficiencies in mental health licensing, prompting discussions on legislative and administrative changes to improve portability, support military applicants, and clarify inconsistent practices.

4. **Collaboration and Transparency**: The committee stressed the importance of collaboration between agencies, legislators, and the public to address issues such as agency overreach and licensing delays.

Overall, the meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to ensuring that state rules and processes are efficient, transparent, and aligned with legislative intent, while addressing practical concerns and supporting public needs.
