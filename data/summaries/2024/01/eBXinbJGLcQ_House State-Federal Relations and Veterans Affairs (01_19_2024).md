The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 19, 2024, to address a range of legislative measures, focusing on state-federal relations, veterans' affairs, constitutional amendments, and reproductive rights.

### **Key Legislative Discussions:**

#### **1. Child Labor Amendment (HR24)**
- **HR24** reaffirmed New Hampshire's support for the **Child Labor Amendment**, proposed in 1924 but not yet ratified nationally. Introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, the resolution emphasized the need to protect children from labor exploitation, especially amid recent efforts in some states to relax child labor laws. Gallagher urged neighboring states to ratify the amendment to empower Congress to regulate child labor effectively.

#### **2. Repeal of the Jones Act (HR19)**
- **HR19** called for the repeal of the **Jones Act**, a 1920 law requiring cargo between U.S. ports to be carried on U.S.-built, -owned, and -crewed ships. Representative Moffett argued the Act is outdated, increases costs, and stifles competition, citing its impact on fuel prices and cruise ship routes. 
- Opponents, including Kyle Burlson of the American Waterways Operators and former Merchant Mariner Andrew Strel, defended the Act, highlighting its role in national security, job creation, and maintaining a skilled maritime workforce. They noted its minimal impact on fuel prices and its importance in disaster response, such as during Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.

#### **3. Article 5 Convention of States (HCR8, HCR9, and Related Discussions)**
- **HCR8** proposed a limited **Article 5 Convention** to address **campaign finance reform** and **electoral integrity**. Supporters argued it is necessary to curb federal corruption and restore democracy, citing the 10th Amendment and states' sovereignty. Opponents feared a "runaway convention" with unintended consequences, emphasizing the lack of a clear rulebook.
- **HCR9** sought to rescind New Hampshire’s previous support for an Article 5 Convention, addressing a **balanced budget amendment**. Supporters of Article 5 conventions argue it is a constitutional tool to rein in federal overreach, while opponents warned of potential risks to constitutional rights and the lack of historical statesmanship.
- Discussions also touched on **election reform**, with supporters advocating for voter ID laws and absentee ballot reforms to restore public trust in democracy.

#### **4. Reproductive Rights and Medication Abortion (HCR1)**
- **HCR1** condemned medically unnecessary restrictions on **mifepristone**, a medication abortion drug, in response to a U.S. Supreme Court case challenging its FDA approval. The resolution aimed to protect access to medication abortion, particularly for rural patients and those managing abortions at home.
- Supporters, including Representative Alexis Simpson and Planned Parenthood, emphasized the drug’s safety and efficacy, while opponents questioned its necessity and expressed concerns about high abortion rates in the state. The resolution was symbolic, reaffirming New Hampshire’s commitment to reproductive rights.

#### **5. Veterans' Affairs and State-Federal Relations**
- **HCR10** urged the federal government to fulfill its promise to fund 40% of special education costs, passing unanimously due to the financial burden on local schools.
- **HB1179** proposed extending state park fee waivers to spouses of retired military members, with concerns about costs and potential impacts on state parks’ budgets.
- **HR20** expressed support for Taiwan, highlighting its democratic values and economic importance, though some members opposed state involvement in international affairs.
- A resolution to nullify the **Selective Service Act** in New Hampshire and allow conscientious objector status was debated, with concerns about future conflicts and the need for a draft system.
- A bill to investigate the **USS Liberty incident** (1967) was discussed, with concerns about the commission’s makeup and potential false hope for survivors.

#### **6. Constitutional Amendment on Slavery (CACR13)**
- **CACR13**, a constitutional amendment addressing slavery and involuntary servitude, passed unanimously. The Commissioner of Corrections supported the measure, alleviating concerns about its impact on corrections.

#### **7. Militia Resolution**
- A resolution to support the **unorganized militia** as a last line of defense in case of invasion was discussed, with confusion about its relationship to the National Guard.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes:**
- **Federal Overreach vs. State Sovereignty:** Discussions on Article 5 conventions, the Jones Act, and selective service reflected tensions between federal authority and state autonomy.
- **Economic and National Security Concerns:** The Jones Act debate highlighted the balance between economic efficiency and national security, while veterans' bills emphasized financial and logistical considerations.
- **Reproductive Rights and Healthcare:** HCR1 underscored New Hampshire’s commitment to protecting reproductive healthcare amid federal threats.
- **Bipartisan Support and Division:** While measures like HCR10 and CACR13 saw unanimous support, issues like Article 5 conventions and reproductive rights revealed deep ideological divides.
