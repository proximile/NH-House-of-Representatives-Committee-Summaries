The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee meeting on January 18, 2024, focused on several bills and constitutional amendments related to abortion. Here are the key points:

1. **CACR 23 (Constitutional Amendment on Abortion Rights)**:
   - The committee debated a proposed constitutional amendment (CACR 23) that would enshrine the right to abortion in the New Hampshire Constitution, allowing abortions up to 24 weeks and beyond if deemed necessary.
   - Opponents argued that the amendment was too broad and could allow abortions up to birth for any reason, which they believed did not reflect the majority of voters' views. Some members also felt it conflicted with the state's traditional values and constitutional protections for life.
   - Supporters emphasized the importance of reproductive rights and privacy, arguing that the amendment would protect women's autonomy and align with the state's libertarian values.
   - The committee ultimately voted 10-10 on whether to recommend the amendment, resulting in its failure.

2. **House Bill 1248 (15-Day Abortion Ban)**:
   - The committee discussed HB 1248, which proposed a 15-day ban on abortions.
   - Critics argued that the bill was draconian, as most women are unaware they are pregnant within 15 days, and pregnancy tests are unreliable at that stage. They also noted it would force women to seek care out of state.
   - The committee voted 19-1 to recommend killing the bill (ITL), with only one member opposing.

3. **House Bill 1541 (Abortion Regulations)**:
   - HB 1541 proposed requiring a second physician to be present during abortions to care for a baby born alive during the procedure.
   - Supporters argued it was necessary to protect infants, while opponents criticized the bill for conflating viability with abortion limits and imposing unnecessary restrictions.
   - The committee voted 19-1 to recommend killing the bill (ITL), with one member opposing.

4. **Other Discussions**:
   - The committee chair addressed scheduling concerns, noting that hearings were set through February 21st, and executive sessions would start at 10:00 AM to ensure quorum.
   - Members debated the role of the state in regulating abortion, with some arguing for minimal interference and others emphasizing the state's interest in protecting life.

The meeting concluded with assignments for committee members to write reports on the bills and amendments discussed.
