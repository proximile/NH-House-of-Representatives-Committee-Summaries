### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 30, 2024)

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on January 30, 2024, to discuss several bills related to charitable gaming, lottery regulations, and historic horse racing. The meeting focused on addressing legislative clarity, balancing stakeholder interests, and ensuring the financial viability of charitable activities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

#### **Charitable Gaming and Tournament Poker Regulations**

1. **HB 1525: Moratorium on Historical Horse Racing (HHR)**  
   - Representative Ducet highlighted a drafting error in the bill, which incorrectly stated that HHR licenses were "approved" rather than "applied for" by October 18, 2023.  
   - The committee discussed potential amendments to correct the error and ensure clarity in the law.  
   - No further testimony was heard, and the public hearing was closed.

2. **HB 1549: Tournament Poker Rake Caps**  
   - This bill proposes capping the rake (the percentage taken by the state, operators, and charities) at $250 for high-stakes poker tournaments, even if the buy-in exceeds $2,500.  
   - Representative Ducet explained that the current 20% rake on high buy-ins (e.g., $500 on a $2,500 tournament) discourages players and prevents such tournaments from occurring.  
   - The bill aims to encourage higher-stakes tournaments by making them more financially viable for players while still generating revenue for charities and the state.  
   - Alicia Preston, representing the NH Charitable Gaming Operators Association, supported the bill, stating it would increase tournament participation and revenue.  
   - Committee members discussed the potential impact on revenue, competition with neighboring states, and the feasibility of hosting high-stakes tournaments.

3. **HB 1203: Prohibiting Rent Charging to Charities by Charitable Gaming Facilities**  
   - Representative Susan Almy introduced the bill, which aims to prevent charitable gaming facilities from charging rent to charities.  
   - Representative Michael Cahill, the bill's sponsor, argued that charging rent contradicts the purpose of charitable gaming, as it reduces the proceeds charities receive.  
   - Alyssa Margolin from the New Hampshire Center for Nonprofits testified in support, highlighting the financial burden rent places on charities and the lack of transparency in the selection process for charitable gaming days.  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential impact on gaming operators if rent charges are eliminated, but it was noted that the Gaming Operators Association supports rent repeal.

4. **HB 1255: Extending the Historic Horse Racing Moratorium**  
   - Representative Susan Almy introduced the bill, which extends the moratorium on new historic horse racing licenses from 2024 to 2026.  
   - No testimony was provided, and the committee will review the sponsor’s written testimony in an executive session.

#### **Lottery Regulations**

1. **HB 1389: Allowing Lottery Winners to Remain Anonymous**  
   - Representative Ron Dunn sponsored the bill, which would allow lottery winners to remain anonymous to protect their privacy and safety.  
   - Dunn argued that anonymity would prevent winners from being targeted by criminals or facing unwanted attention.  
   - Charlie McIntyre, Director of the New Hampshire Lottery, opposed the bill, stating it would reduce transparency and make promotional events difficult. He noted that winners can already use trusts to remain anonymous.  
   - Public testimony from Sean Faber supported the bill, emphasizing the right to privacy and the potential risks of publicizing lottery winners.  
   - The committee discussed the need for clarity in the bill’s language and the process for ensuring transparency in lottery payouts.

#### **Logistics and Scheduling**

- The chair outlined the schedule for upcoming meetings, noting the shared use of the room with the Criminal Justice committee.  
- Plans were made to prioritize Mondays and Tuesdays for future sessions, with possible adjustments to accommodate Democratic leadership meetings on Tuesdays.  
- The chair emphasized the challenges of scheduling and the need for flexibility, especially with short notice for Monday meetings.
