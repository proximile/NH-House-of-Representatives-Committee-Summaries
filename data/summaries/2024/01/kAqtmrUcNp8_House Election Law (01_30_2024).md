### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. HB 1446: Eliminating Fees for Electronic Voter Checklists**
- **Purpose**: This bill proposes removing the $25 fee for electronic copies of voter checklists, arguing that public information should be accessible at no cost.
- **Support**: Representative Claudine Burnham and supporters emphasized that the fee hinders civic participation and access to public information. They noted that providing electronic copies requires minimal effort and no additional time.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised issues about potential revenue loss for towns, estimated at over $180,000, and questioned whether other states charge similar fees.
- **Outcome**: Public testimony showed strong support, with 46 in favor and 17 opposed.

#### **2. HB 1577: Reviewing Digital Ballot Images**
- **Purpose**: This bill aims to allow citizens to review digital images of ballots to verify the accuracy of new digital ballot tabulating devices, ensuring election integrity.
- **Support**: Representative Alvin C introduced the bill, which proposes supervised access to digital images after the recount period to avoid distractions during official processes.
- **Concerns**: Secretary of State David Scanlan supported the intent but noted the need for refinement, particularly regarding ballot privacy, finality in elections, and preventing potential fraud.

#### **3. HB 1426: Independent Redistricting Commission**
- **Purpose**: This bill seeks to establish an independent redistricting commission to draw district maps for the House, Senate, Executive Council, and Congressional districts starting in 2031.
- **Support**: Advocates, including organizations like Open Democracy, the League of Women Voters, and the ACLU, argued that the commission would increase transparency, fairness, and public trust. The commission would be advisory, proposing maps for legislative approval, and include safeguards like excluding politically affiliated individuals and requiring retired judges to appoint commissioners.
- **Concerns**: Critics questioned the feasibility of selecting truly independent members and the potential for bias among Independents. Some suggested a constitutional amendment might be necessary for effectiveness.
- **Outcome**: The bill received broad bipartisan and organizational support, though some concerns about its advisory nature and potential legislative override were noted.

#### **4. HB 1704: Election Integrity and Transparency**
- **Purpose**: This bill proposes serializing ballots and requiring hand-counting, arguing that machines violate the NH Constitution’s mandate for human oversight in vote counting.
- **Support**: Testimony from advocates like Russan Chester emphasized the need for transparency and accountability, citing concerns about anomalies in local elections and the use of Dominion voting machines.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including Nashua City Clerk Dan Healey, highlighted logistical challenges, such as the time-consuming nature of hand-counting and the impracticality of 24-hour surveillance for ballot security.

#### **5. HB 1699: Caucus Identification on Ballots**
- **Purpose**: This bill would allow candidates to identify their caucus affiliations (e.g., veterans, environmental groups) on ballots, provided the caucus has at least five members in the House.
- **Support**: Supporters argued it would provide voters with more information about candidates’ priorities and affiliations.
- **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about potential ballot clutter, the difficulty of verifying caucuses, and the possibility of creating “dummy caucuses” for political gain. Secretary of State David Scanlan opposed the bill, citing complications in ballot design.

#### **6. HB 577 and HB 1705: Election Audits and Ballot Accessibility**
- **Purpose**: These bills address election audits and ballot accessibility, with HB 1705 proposing to classify ballots as public information for citizen audits and research.
- **Support**: Proponents argued for increased public access to ballot images to build confidence in election results.
