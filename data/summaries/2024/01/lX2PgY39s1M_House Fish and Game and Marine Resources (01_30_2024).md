### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Fish and Game and Marine Resources (01/30/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee convened on January 30, 2024, to discuss a series of bills and issues related to fish, game, marine resources, and conservation. The meeting emphasized maintaining decorum, transparency, and accountability while addressing diverse stakeholder interests. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Committee Decorum and Procedures**
The chair opened the meeting by reminding committee members of the importance of decorum, stressing that the committee’s role is to listen to public testimony and ask pertinent questions, not to debate the public. This set the tone for respectful and focused deliberations throughout the session.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Firearms and Hunting Legislation**
Several bills addressed hunting regulations and firearm usage:
- **House Bill 1116 (HB 1116)**: Introduced by Representative James Spain, this bill seeks to expand the types of rifles (e.g., pump-action, single-shot) allowed for hunting in areas previously restricted to handguns or shotguns. It also aims to streamline the listing of permissible calibers for handgun hunting.
- **House Bill 1077 (HB 1077)**: Similar to HB 1116, this bill focuses on expanding rifle actions for hunting with pistol calibers. The Fish and Game Department opposed both bills, recommending further study.
- **House Bill 1424 (HB 1424)**: A housekeeping bill introduced by Representative Spain, it aims to correct errors in the RSA’s listing of permissible handgun calibers for hunting. The Fish and Game Department opposed this bill, citing concerns about discussing gun-related legislation in an election year.
- **House Bill 1024 (HB 1024)**: Introduced by Representative Brian Cole, this bill proposes legalizing air rifles for hunting in New Hampshire. The Fish and Game Department recommended an interim study to evaluate the safety and ethical use of air rifles.

#### **2. Guide Licensing Process (House Bill 1228)**
Representative Claudine Burnham introduced **HB 1228**, which addresses issues in the fishing and hunting guide licensing process:
- **Current Issues**: Applicants must pass a written and oral exam, but those who fail the oral exam are not provided detailed feedback, leading to frustration and concerns about transparency and potential bias. The involvement of current guides in the examination process was also criticized for potential conflicts of interest.
- **Proposed Changes**: The bill suggests creating a five-person committee (composed of active or retired conservation officers) to oversee the licensing process, excluding current or former guides to eliminate bias. It also calls for clearer study materials and curriculum.
- **Testimony**: Supporters, including applicant Jody Person, highlighted the need for fairness and transparency. Opponents, such as David P. from the NH Guides Association, defended the current process, emphasizing its rigor and the need for competent guides.

#### **3. Body-Worn Cameras for Conservation Officers (House Bill 1530)**
Representative Hull introduced **HB 1530**, which mandates body-worn cameras for Fish and Game conservation officers:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to increase transparency, accountability, and provide evidence in legal cases.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including the Fish and Game Department, raised fiscal concerns, as the department is self-funded through user fees. Privacy issues were also debated, particularly regarding recordings of private interactions and the proposed three-year retention period for footage.
- **Testimony**: Attorney Penny Dean supported the bill, citing instances of incorrect legal interpretations by officers during hunter education classes. Suggestions were made to amend the bill to align with existing laws and limit its scope to Fish and Game officers.

### **Other Key Discussions**
- **Interim Studies**: Several bills, including those related to air rifles and firearms, were referred to interim studies for further research and analysis.
- **Firearms Amendments**: Amendments to clarify firearm types (e.g., removing ".38" from ".357" caliber references) passed with broad support, though concerns were raised about their use in residential areas.
- **Alternative Testing Methods**: Discussions included alternative testing methods for hunter education and management issues within the Fish and Game Department.

### **Committee Dynamics and Challenges**
The meeting was marked by tight time constraints, with members expressing frustration over the workload and the need for efficient decision-making. Despite these challenges, the committee maintained a focus on balancing transparency, accountability, and fiscal responsibility.

2. **Ethical Hunting Practices**: Discussions emphasized the importance of ethical hunting practices, particularly regarding the use of firearms and air rifles.
3. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Concerns about the cost of implementing new measures, such as body-worn cameras, highlighted the need for careful financial planning.

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing complex issues related to New Hampshire’s fish, game, and marine resources.
