**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (January 16, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Education Committee convened on January 16, 2024, to discuss several key bills addressing a range of educational issues, including school meal eligibility, teacher retention, student proficiency, school infrastructure, air quality, curriculum standards, and scholarship program oversight. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

---

### **1. HB 1212: Expanding Eligibility for Free School Meals**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to expand eligibility for free school meals to families earning up to 350% of the federal poverty level (e.g., $105,000 for a family of four), ensuring that low- to middle-income families can access nutritious meals for their children.
- **Key Points**:
  - Addresses food insecurity, with over half of NH children and 46% of adults reporting insufficient food.
  - School meals improve health, academic performance, and reduce obesity rates.
  - Fiscal impact is estimated at $50–75 million, with uncertainties around participation and federal reimbursements.
  - Concerns were raised about food quality and the state’s ability to set its own nutritional standards rather than following federal USDA guidelines.
  - Supporters emphasized that the benefits of feeding hungry children outweigh the financial costs.

### **2. HB 1516: Enrollment of Children of School District Employees**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows school districts to enroll children of employees in the district where they work, even if they are not residents, as a recruitment and retention incentive.
- **Key Points**:
  - Employees would be responsible for transportation and additional costs.
  - Special education costs would remain the responsibility of the resident district.
  - The bill is enabling legislation, giving districts the option to adopt this policy.
  - Concerns were raised about potential discrimination and the financial burden of special education services.

### **3. HB 1402: High School Proficiency Exam Waiver for Mandatory School Attendance**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows students who demonstrate competency in high school-level material to opt out of traditional schooling and pursue other interests or career paths.
- **Key Points**:
  - Students can take a proficiency test to demonstrate knowledge and, upon passing, no longer be required to attend school.
  - Supporters argued it would provide flexibility for students to focus on apprenticeships, music, or starting a business.
  - Concerns included reduced oversight on child labor, parental approval, and readiness for the workforce.
  - Amendments were suggested to clarify diploma issuance and school policy adherence.

### **4. HB 1165: Procedures for School Facilities and Infrastructure**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses school construction, infrastructure funding, and air quality in schools.
- **Key Points**:
  - Streamlines language and processes for school building aid grants and the public school infrastructure fund.
  - Debates focused on changing the term "project manager" to "owner's representative" to ensure qualified oversight of construction projects.
  - Provisions for air quality investigations in schools were discussed, with questions about whether measurements should be included.
  - A suggestion was made to allow public preschools to apply for infrastructure funds.

---

### **5. HB 1153 FN: Mandatory and Elected Public School Curriculum**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses federal influence on local curriculum and pedagogy.
- **Key Points**:
  - Representative Beller argued that federal mandates already influence local education, citing programs like ESSER.
  - Opposition testimony criticized the bill as based on conspiracy theories, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and credible sourcing.

---

### **6. HB 1160: School Assessments of Statewide Academic Standards**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to align local assessments with state academic standards in subjects like history, government, geography, civics, and economics.
- **Key Points**:
  - While some subjects are included in statewide assessments, others are assessed locally, and the bill seeks to ensure consistency.

---

### **7. HB 1019: Interstate Compact and Educational Opportunity for Military Children**
- **Purpose**: The bill makes a minor one-word change to align state statute with federal code, changing “sections” to “chapters.”
- **Key Points**:
  - The committee passed the bill unanimously in an executive session.

---

### **8. HB 1128: Scholarship Organization Oversight in Education Tax Credit Program**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires scholarship organizations administering the state’s Education Freedom Account (EFA) program to be incorporated in New Hampshire, rather than merely qualified to do business in the state.
- **Key Points**:
  - Sponsor Representative Dave Luneau argued the bill improves transparency and accountability in managing taxpayer funds.
  - Opposition, led by Kate Baker DeStefano of the Children’s Scholarship Fund (CSF), argued the bill unfairly targets CSF and could disrupt programs serving thousands of students.
  - Public testimony highlighted the positive impact of CSF programs on low-income families and school choice.
  - Concerns were raised about potential legal challenges and the bill’s impact on educational opportunities.

### **Discussion Highlights**
- **Equity and Access**: Many bills focused on expanding access to resources like school meals, educational opportunities, and infrastructure improvements, while balancing costs and equity concerns.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: Discussions emphasized the need for transparency in managing taxpayer funds, particularly in scholarship programs and school construction projects.
- **Flexibility and Innovation**: Bills like HB 1402 and HB 1516 aimed to provide flexibility for students and teachers, though concerns about oversight and implementation were raised.
- **Federal vs. Local Control**: Debates over curriculum standards and air quality highlighted tensions between federal mandates and local autonomy.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing critical educational issues in New Hampshire, from food insecurity and teacher retention to infrastructure and curriculum standards. While the bills aimed to improve access, accountability, and flexibility, questions about costs, implementation, and equity remained central to the discussions.
