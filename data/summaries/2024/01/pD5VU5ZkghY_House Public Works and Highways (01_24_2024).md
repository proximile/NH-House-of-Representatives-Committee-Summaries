**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (01/24/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Public Works and Highways Committee convened on January 24, 2024, to discuss a range of bills and amendments focused on public works, infrastructure, hazard mitigation, and conservation. The meeting was divided into three main segments, each addressing distinct but interrelated topics. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting.

### **1. Infrastructure Funding and Hazard Mitigation**
The session began with discussions on the repurposing of funds for critical infrastructure projects and the introduction of new funding mechanisms for hazard mitigation.

- **Repurposing Funds for Infrastructure Projects**: Representatives debated the reallocation of previously appropriated funds to address urgent infrastructure needs. Key projects included security enhancements and facility repairs, such as boiler repairs and tactical center flooring at the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training facility. These funds were not new but were being redirected to meet pressing demands.

- **Parking Garage Project**: Clarifications were provided regarding the funding and progress of a legislative parking garage project. The design phase was complete, and construction was expected to begin soon, with funding secured through separate legislation.

- **Hazard Mitigation Funding**: Representative Aon introduced **House Bill 1488**, which proposes adding $2 million to the existing Disaster Relief Fund. This funding is intended to assist municipalities, particularly small towns with limited resources, in implementing hazard mitigation plans to prevent future damage from natural disasters. The bill includes criteria for municipalities to apply for grants, emphasizing the protection of critical infrastructure and commerce.

- **Committee Reassignment**: A procedural issue arose regarding the assignment of **House Bill 1510** to the wrong committee. The chair decided to recess the hearing and work with the clerk and speaker to reassign the bill to the appropriate committee (Science, Technology, and Energy) for a proper public hearing.

### **2. Renaming a State Forest and Mileage-Based Exit Numbers**
The second segment focused on two significant topics: the renaming of a state forest and the implementation of mileage-based exit numbers on highways.

- **Renaming Blair State Forest**: The committee debated **House Bill 1253**, which seeks to rename Blair State Forest in Campton to Jane Kellogg State Forest in honor of Jane Kellogg, a notable conservationist and educator. Kellogg’s contributions, including the establishment of the Moose Plate program, were widely acknowledged. However, concerns were raised about the administrative complexities and the precedent it might set for renaming state properties. The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR) opposed the bill, citing its memorial policy, which requires an "extraordinary association" between the person and the land. Despite strong community support, the committee ultimately opposed the renaming.

- **Mileage-Based Exit Numbers**: Representative Timothy Horgan introduced **House Bill 1547**, which proposes transitioning New Hampshire's highway exit numbers from a sequential system to a mileage-based system, aligning with federal standards since 2009. The bill aims to reduce confusion for out-of-state drivers and improve emergency response efficiency. The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) expressed concerns about the logistical and financial challenges, estimating the cost at $1.4 million. The committee discussed potential funding sources, including federal highway safety funds, and the timeline for implementation, which could span up to 10 years.

- **Capital Appropriations for Legislative Complex**: Representative David Mills introduced **House Bill 1043**, which seeks to repurpose previously approved capital appropriations for new needs, including the renovation of the legislative complex. Terry Pfaff, the Chief Operating Officer for the General Court, highlighted the aging infrastructure, such as 50-year-old chairs and tables, and the need for emergency funds to maintain the complex. The bill aims to address these long-term maintenance needs without requiring additional appropriations.

### **3. Regulation of Grass Clippings and Yard Debris on Highways**
The final segment focused on **House Bill 1379**, which addresses public safety concerns related to grass clippings and yard debris on highways.

- **Purpose and Background**: Sponsored by Representative Tom Corman, the bill aims to prohibit the placement of grass clippings or yard debris more than two feet into paved highways (classes 1 through 5). This is intended to reduce hazards for motorcyclists and bicyclists, who may lose traction on slippery debris. The bill was inspired by a conversation with a Dartmouth staff member and a personal story of a friend who was injured in a motorcycle accident due to grass clippings.

- **Key Provisions and Concerns**: The bill would make it a violation for individuals or agencies to direct yard debris more than two feet into paved highways. However, concerns were raised about enforcement challenges, potential neighbor disputes, the impact on municipal waste collection practices, and unfunded mandates on local governments. The Department of Transportation (DOT) neither supports nor opposes the bill but expressed concerns about unintended consequences, such as debris blocking drainage and confusion over allowable debris placement. They noted that existing statutes (RSA 236:39) already address hazards on highways.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on addressing critical infrastructure needs, modernizing the state’s highway system, and balancing administrative, financial, and practical considerations in decision-making processes. Key takeaways include the importance of reallocating existing funds for urgent projects, the challenges of implementing new policies like mileage-based exit numbers, and the complexities involved in renaming state properties. The committee will likely consider amendments to address concerns raised during the discussions before making final recommendations on the proposed bills.
