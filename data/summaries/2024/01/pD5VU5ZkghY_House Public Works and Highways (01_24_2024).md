**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (01/24/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on January 24, 2024, to discuss several bills and amendments focused on public works, highways, disaster relief funding, and infrastructure maintenance. The meeting highlighted the importance of efficient fund allocation, proactive disaster mitigation, and infrastructure improvements, particularly for small towns with limited resources. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Funding Reappropriation and Infrastructure Projects**
1. **Reappropriation of Funds**: The committee discussed the reallocation of previously allocated funds for various projects, including security enhancements and infrastructure improvements. It was clarified that these were not new appropriations but rather the repurposing of existing budgets.
2. **Parking Garage Project**: Confusion arose regarding the status of funds for a parking garage project. It was clarified that the design and development phase is complete, and the project is progressing under separate legislation.
3. **Police Standards and Training Facility**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council highlighted aging infrastructure issues, such as boiler controllers, tactical center flooring, and range ventilation systems. They requested flexibility to use leftover funds from a boiler replacement project to address these repairs, as they lacked sufficient budget allocations.

### **Disaster Relief and Hazard Mitigation**
4. **Hazard Mitigation Funding**: Representative Aon introduced **House Bill 1488**, which proposes allocating $2 million to the Disaster Relief Fund to assist small towns with hazard mitigation projects. The bill aims to help municipalities implement mitigation plans to prevent future damage from natural disasters, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of such investments.
5. **Committee Clarifications**: Legislative budget assistance clarified that the discussed bills and amendments involved repurposing existing funds rather than new appropriations. The committee also outlined criteria for municipalities to qualify for hazard mitigation grants.

### **Bills on Highway Safety and Conservation**
6. **House Bill 137 FN: Grass Clippings and Yard Debris on Highways**:
   - **Sponsor Rep. Tom Corman** introduced the bill to prohibit placing grass clippings or yard debris more than two feet into paved highways, aiming to improve safety for motorcyclists and bicyclists. The bill excludes natural debris (e.g., falling leaves) and trash/recycling containers.
   - **Concerns**: Enforcement challenges, potential neighbor disputes, and unintended consequences for homeowners and municipal debris collection practices were raised. The Department of Transportation (DOT) noted that the bill’s language could encourage debris placement and block drainage systems, suggesting the issue might already be covered under existing statutes.

7. **House Bill 1253: Renaming Blair State Forest**:
   - The bill proposes renaming Blair State Forest in Campton to the **Jane Kellogg State Forest** to honor her contributions to conservation, particularly her role in creating the NH Moose Plate program, which has raised over $20 million for conservation and heritage projects.
   - **Support**: Representatives, the Campton Select Board, and local conservation groups emphasized Kellogg’s statewide impact and lifelong dedication to conservation.
   - **Opposition**: The **Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR)** opposed the renaming, citing their memorial policy, which requires an "extraordinary association" between the person and the land. They suggested renaming town forests where Kellogg contributed instead.
   - **Discussion**: The committee questioned the administrative burden of renaming, including updating maps, files, and forest management plans. DNCR confirmed there are no deed restrictions preventing the renaming but emphasized logistical complications.

### **Mileage-Based Exit Numbering**
8. **House Bill 1547: Mileage-Based Exit Numbers**:
   - The bill mandates **mileage-based exit numbering** on **Tier 1 highways** in New Hampshire, aligning with federal standards set in 2009.
   - **Background**: New Hampshire is one of the few states still using **sequential exit numbering**. The federal **Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)** requires mileage-based numbering for consistency nationwide.
   - **Support**: Representative **Timothy Horgan**, the bill’s sponsor, argued that mileage-based numbering reduces confusion, especially for out-of-state drivers, and cited successful transitions in neighboring states.
   - **Costs**: The estimated cost for the project is **$1.4 million**, with a proposed completion date of **2035**.
   - **Concerns**: DOT highlighted the project’s complexity, including updating signs, addressing structural issues, and ensuring emergency responders are not confused during the transition. They proposed a **transition period** where both old and new exit numbers would be displayed.
   - **Federal Compliance**: While New Hampshire has not faced penalties yet, non-compliance with federal standards could risk losing federal highway funding.

### **Additional Discussions**
9. **Chair Replacement**: The committee discussed repurposing funds from a previous capital appropriation to replace **50-year-old chairs** and tables in the legislative complex, which are nearing the end of their lifespan.

---

### **Procedural Matters**
10. **Recess and Reassignment**: Due to a procedural error, the committee recessed a hearing on **House Bill 1510**, which was mistakenly assigned to the wrong committee. It will likely be reassigned to the **Science, Technology, and Energy Committee** for a proper hearing.

---

### **Outcome and Next Steps**
The committee heard extensive testimony on all bills, with questions focusing on enforcement, unintended consequences, administrative burdens, and the significance of renaming Blair State Forest. No immediate decisions were made, and further discussions, potential amendments, and reassignments are expected before final votes.

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing infrastructure needs, enhancing public safety, and honoring conservation efforts while navigating budgetary and logistical challenges.
