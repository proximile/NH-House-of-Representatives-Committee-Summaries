**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Commerce and Consumer Affairs (January 17, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 17, 2024, focused on a variety of bills related to commerce and consumer affairs, with significant attention given to cannabis legalization, financial regulations, automotive repair, and credit card consumer protection. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The meeting extensively debated **House Bill 1633** and **House Bill 1639**, both of which propose the legalization and regulation of adult-use cannabis in New Hampshire. The discussions highlighted several themes:

1. **Economic and Social Benefits**:
   - Proponents argued that legalization would generate substantial tax revenue, reduce property taxes, create jobs, and support small businesses and farmers. They cited the success of neighboring states like Massachusetts and Maine, which have seen economic growth from cannabis legalization.
   - Tax revenues from cannabis sales would fund education, affordable housing, and infrastructure improvements, addressing recent court rulings that have increased school tax burdens.

2. **Regulation and Safety**:
   - The bills emphasize the importance of regulation to ensure product safety, prevent black market activity, and provide consumer education. A **Cannabis Control Board** would oversee the industry, including training requirements for retail employees.
   - Concerns were raised about the **state monopoly model** (via the Liquor Commission), with critics arguing it could violate federal law and expose the state to legal risks. Supporters advocated for a **free-market or hybrid model** to align with New Hampshire’s "Live Free or Die" ethos.

3. **Public Health and Youth Protection**:
   - Opponents highlighted potential risks, including increased cannabis use among youth, addiction, mental health issues, and impaired driving. They called for stricter regulations, potency limits, and robust advertising restrictions.
   - Proponents countered that legalization would allow for better regulation and harm reduction compared to the current black market.

4. **Historical and Legal Context**:
   - The discussion referenced past legislative efforts to study cannabis legalization and public banking, noting repeated rejections due to feasibility and financial risk concerns.
   - Testimonies from stakeholders, including the **New Hampshire Cannabis Trade Association**, emphasized the bill’s potential to create a new industry, support small farmers, and attract tourists.

5. **Public Testimony**:
   - Supporters, including **Dr. Riley Kirk** and **Ross Connelly**, praised the bill’s focus on education, harm reduction, and small business support.
   - Opponents, such as **Kate Fry** of New Futures and **Beth Skur**, raised concerns about youth protection, public health, and the lack of reliable roadside testing for cannabis impairment.

### **Financial Regulations**
Several bills addressed financial regulations, with a focus on money transmitters and cash dispensing machines:

1. **House Bill 1241 (HB 1241)**:
   - This bill revises regulations for money transmitters, adopting the **Model Money Transmission Modernization Act (MTMA)**. It includes exemptions for cryptocurrency firms unless they handle fiat currency.
   - The **New Hampshire Banking Department** supported the bill, emphasizing its clarity for fintech and crypto firms. However, payroll processing companies raised concerns about compliance costs and requested exemptions similar to other states.

2. **House Bill 1559 (HB 1559)**:
   - This bill proposes repealing **RSA 399-F**, which regulates non-bank cash dispensing machines (e.g., ATMs). The Banking Department supports the repeal, citing minimal consumer complaints and administrative burdens. Consumer protection issues would still be addressed under the **Consumer Protection Act (RSA 358-A)**.

### **Automotive Repair and Right to Repair**
**House Bill 1576 (HB 1576)** addressed the "right to repair" issue, requiring vehicle manufacturers to disclose proprietary repair systems on window stickers. Key points included:

- The bill aims to ensure consumers are aware of repair limitations before purchasing vehicles, particularly for electric vehicles with complex technology.
- An amendment was proposed to exclude motorcycles from the requirement.
- The **Auto Dealers Association** and the **Alliance for Automotive Innovation** opposed the bill, arguing that independent repair shops already have access to necessary diagnostic and repair information.

### **Credit Card Consumer Protection**
Two bills focused on enhancing consumer protection in credit card services:

1. **First Bill**:
   - Requires retailers to provide a **90-day notice** to consumers if they switch credit card providers, addressing complaints about unexpected bills and fees.

2. **Second Bill**:
   - Seeks to limit late fees and interest charges on small credit card balances, arguing that excessive fees disproportionately penalize consumers for minor oversights.
   - Concerns were raised about enforcement, as many credit card companies are federally chartered and beyond state jurisdiction.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting reflected a robust debate on balancing economic benefits with public health, safety, and consumer protection. Key themes included:

- **Economic Growth vs. Public Health**: Discussions on cannabis legalization and financial regulations highlighted the tension between economic opportunities and potential risks to public health and consumer rights.
- **Regulatory Clarity and Fairness**: Bills aimed to provide clarity for businesses and consumers, though concerns were raised about compliance costs and enforcement challenges.
- **Consumer Awareness and Protection**: Efforts to enhance transparency in automotive repair and credit card services emphasized the importance of informed decision-making.

The committee was tasked with refining the bills to address concerns and ensure they align with New Hampshire’s values and priorities.
