The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on January 30, 2024, addressed a wide range of transportation-related bills, focusing on modernizing regulations, addressing emerging technologies, and improving infrastructure and enforcement. The discussions and votes reflected a balance between promoting innovation, ensuring public safety, and honoring community values.

### Key Topics and Bills Discussed:

#### **Electric Bicycles and Personal Electric Vehicles (PEVs):**
- **HB 1445 and HB 1543:** These bills aimed to regulate electric bicycles, scooters, and unicycles, but the committee encountered significant confusion over their classification and usage. After debate, both bills were recommended as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), with the committee suggesting further study to address unresolved issues. Concerns were raised about unclassified e-bikes that exceed standard speed limits, posing safety risks, while supporters highlighted their benefits for older adults and individuals with health issues.

#### **Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Infrastructure:**
- **EV Parking and Safety:** Discussions centered on bills addressing EV parking, particularly the issue of non-EVs occupying charging spaces. A proposal to prohibit EVs from parking in garages due to fire hazards and structural weight concerns was debated, with opponents arguing that such fears were not data-driven, as EV fires are less common than gasoline vehicle fires. Another bill, **HB 1416**, proposed a $100 fine for non-EVs parking in EV charging spaces, with enforcement mechanisms similar to handicap parking violations. The committee acknowledged the need for better EV charging infrastructure and statewide regulation.
- **EV Fire Concerns:** Concerns about the intensity and toxicity of EV fires, especially in enclosed parking garages, were raised, though some members noted that such incidents are rare.

#### **Vehicle Registration and Ownership:**
- **HB 1044:** This bill, dealing with the non-mandatory issuance of certificates of title for certain vehicles, was recommended as ITL, as it was deemed redundant due to the passage of **HB 1032**.
- **HB 1083:** This bill, which simplifies the process for transferring vehicle ownership after the death of a joint owner, was recommended for passage.

#### **Driver’s Licenses and Fines:**
- **HB 1127:** This bill updates procedures for the revocation and suspension of driver’s licenses, aligning them with modern practices, such as not requiring the surrender of physical licenses in certain cases. It was recommended for passage.
- **HB 1138:** This bill equalizes fines for operating off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs) and snowmobiles with a suspended license. While recommended for passage, there was debate over the necessity of increasing fines.

#### **License Plates and Vehicle Identification:**
- **HB 1329:** This bill proposes special license plates for fire department vehicles to improve identification at emergency scenes. The committee supported the idea, clarifying that the plates would be for department-owned vehicles, not personal ones.
- **HB 1354:** This bill allows surviving spouses of veterans to retain veteran license plates indefinitely, rather than surrendering them after one year. The bill received strong support, with members emphasizing the importance of honoring veterans’ legacies and supporting their families.

#### **Other Bills:**
- **HB 1062:** This bill clarifies the use of special cover plates on vehicles, allowing one special plate alongside a regular license plate. It was recommended for passage after a close vote.
- **HB 1122:** This bill regulates the use of lights on motor vehicles, particularly those used by ride-share companies, to prevent confusion with law enforcement vehicles. It was recommended for passage.
- **HB 1158:** This bill proposed an exception to vessel registration for small boats, such as those used for lemonade stands. The committee expressed interest in refining the bill to address concerns raised during the meeting.

### Broader Themes:
- **Modernizing Transportation Laws:** The committee focused on updating regulations to accommodate new technologies, such as electric bicycles and ride-share services, while addressing safety concerns.
- **Balancing Innovation and Safety:** Discussions highlighted the tension between promoting EV and e-bike adoption and addressing safety and infrastructure challenges.
- **Honoring Community Values:** Bills like **HB 1354** and **HB 1329** reflected efforts to recognize the contributions of veterans and first responders, emphasizing emotional and practical significance.

### Next Steps:
The committee recommended several bills for passage while suggesting further study on others, particularly those related to electric bicycles and EVs. The formation of subcommittees was proposed to refine bills like **HB 1158** and address unresolved issues.

Overall, the meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to creating balanced, forward-thinking transportation policies that address current challenges while supporting innovation and community values.
