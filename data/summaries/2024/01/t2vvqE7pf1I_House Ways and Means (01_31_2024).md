The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee meeting on January 31, 2024, addressed a range of critical issues impacting the state, including border security, child care, housing, environmental contamination, and taxation. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and legislative proposals:

### **Border Security Funding (HB 1054)**
- **Debate on Necessity**: Representatives questioned the justification for allocating $1.4 million to the Border Alliance program, given the minimal border crossings in New Hampshire compared to neighboring states like Vermont and Maine. Data from the ACLU showed low apprehension rates at the state’s border with Canada, suggesting that border security issues are more prevalent in other parts of the Swanton Sector.
- **Reallocation of Funds**: Concerns were raised about whether these funds could be better utilized for pressing state needs such as housing, education, and mental health services. The Indigenous Commission emphasized prioritizing essential services over border security.

### **Child Care Tax Credit (HB 1193)**
- **Proposal**: A bill was introduced to provide a child care tax credit for businesses, capped at $100,000 per business annually, with a total program cap of $10 million. The goal is to incentivize employers to offer child care benefits, thereby retaining young families and workers in the state.
- **Concerns**: While supporters argued the credit would help address the child care crisis, concerns were raised about its fiscal impact and potential benefits skewing toward larger businesses over smaller ones.

### **Constitutional Amendment on Taxation (CACR 15)**
- **Proposal**: Representative Jason Osborne introduced a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds supermajority to pass new taxes, aiming to solidify New Hampshire’s low-tax status and protect taxpayers. The amendment includes provisions to safeguard state bond payments.
- **Debate**: Concerns were raised about its impact on emergency situations, bond ratings, and local property taxes. Greg Moore from Americans for Prosperity testified in support, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the state’s low-tax reputation.

### **Environmental Contamination Funds**
- **HB 1613**: This bill proposes creating a trust fund for environmental contamination settlements, ensuring funds are used for remediation rather than being absorbed into the general fund. It was inspired by a $25 million PCB contamination settlement from Monsanto.
- **Agency Oversight**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) was suggested as the appropriate agency to oversee the fund, given its expertise in environmental remediation. Flexibility in fund use was emphasized to address diverse contamination issues effectively.

### **Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (HB 1470)**
- **Proposal**: Discussions focused on the mechanics of low-income housing tax credits, which can generate significant development equity for affordable housing projects. New Hampshire’s 2024 allocation is $4 million, potentially generating $35–40 million in development equity.
- **Housing Crisis**: The state faces a severe housing shortage, with a need for 60,000 units by 2030 and 990,000 by 2040. Advocates highlighted the importance of these credits in addressing housing instability, particularly for vulnerable populations.
- **Study Committee**: Representative Matt Wilhelm proposed establishing a study committee to explore the feasibility of implementing a state-level low-income housing tax credit, potentially piggybacking on the federal program.

### **Child Care Scholarship Program**
- **Cost Sharing**: The state’s child care scholarship program requires parents to share costs based on income levels, targeting families at or below 250% of the federal poverty level. The program aims to alleviate financial burdens for low-income workers, particularly single mothers.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The program is federally funded, with New Hampshire receiving about $30 million annually. Suggestions were made to amend the program to expand eligibility and clarify cost-sharing responsibilities.

### **Key Themes and Concerns**
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Across all discussions, there was a strong emphasis on ensuring fiscal responsibility and the effective use of state funds.
- **Urgent Needs**: The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing critical issues such as housing shortages, child care affordability, and environmental contamination.
- **Legislative Action**: There was a call for targeted funding mechanisms and comprehensive strategies to tackle these challenges, with a focus on flexibility, clarity, and efficient administration.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the need for innovative solutions to New Hampshire’s pressing challenges, including housing, child care, and environmental health. While proposed tax credits and amendments were seen as potential solutions, concerns about implementation timelines, administrative complexity, and program scope remained. The establishment of study committees and further legislative action were viewed as critical steps in developing effective strategies to address these issues.
