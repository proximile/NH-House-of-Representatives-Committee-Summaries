**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/31/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 31, 2024, to discuss several key bills and amendments, focusing on topics ranging from alcohol fund restructuring and food service regulations to the recognition of gold and silver as legal tender and public health concerns related to PFAS chemicals. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Alcohol Fund Restructuring and Liquor Licensing (House Bills 1702 and 1540)**
1. **House Bill 1702**:  
   - The bill proposes removing the automatic 5% allocation of gross profits from alcohol sales to the Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund (AAPF), instead directing funds to the general budget for legislative appropriation.  
   - **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), behavioral health organizations, and recovery centers, strongly opposed the bill. They emphasized the fund’s predictability and flexibility in addressing substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, treatment, and recovery services. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on Medicaid expansion and the risk of reverting to inconsistent funding levels.  
   - **Support**: Sponsors argued for increased funding flexibility and oversight, with Representative Peter Lehman citing a lack of accountability since the Liquor Commission became an enterprise fund in 2009.  

2. **House Bill 1540**:  
   - The bill proposes changes to restaurant alcohol licensing requirements, including reducing the food sales requirement from 50% to 15% of total revenue and lowering mandatory operating days from five to three per week.  
   - **Concerns**: The Liquor Commission and industry representatives highlighted potential unintended consequences but agreed to refine the language in subcommittee.

### **Food Service Regulations for Bed and Breakfasts (House Bill 1346)**
- The bill seeks to allow bed and breakfasts (B&Bs) to provide snacks and limited meals to guests, as current regulations restrict them to serving only breakfast.  
- **Support**: Representative Peter Lehman argued that B&Bs in rural areas often have guests arriving late when local restaurants are closed, and current rules harm tourism and guest experience.  
- **Concerns**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) raised issues about expanding food service to include meals, as B&B kitchens are residential and not equipped for large-scale food preparation.  
- **Committee Discussion**: Legislators debated the need for strict limits on snacks and the practicality of defining "snacks" versus "meals."

### **Gold and Silver as Legal Tender (House Bill 1674)**
- The bill proposes to make gold and silver legal tender in New Hampshire, with an amendment removing provisions for a state depository and electronic currency.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Concerns were raised about municipalities being compelled to accept gold and silver, tax implications, and the practicality of implementation.  
  - Supporters, including former state senator Jim Forsight, emphasized the need for an alternative currency option in response to inflation and concerns about the national debt.  
- **Committee Discussion**: Members questioned the necessity of the bill given existing legal frameworks and raised concerns about unintended consequences.

### **Condominium Dispute Resolution Board**
- Representative Almy proposed an amendment to establish a dispute resolution board for condominium associations, addressing issues like governance, elections, and transparency.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - The board would be housed under the Department of Administrative Services, with a proposed budget of $80,000 annually.  
  - Concerns were raised about the board’s effectiveness in handling serious issues and the potential for frivolous complaints.  
- **Outcome**: The committee moved to conduct an interim study to refine the proposal.

### **PFAS Legislation**
- The committee reviewed an amendment to a bill addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), harmful chemicals found in consumer products.  
- **Key Changes**:  
  - The amendment removed certain definitions and exclusions, such as fabric treatments and fluorinated containers, while adding textile furnishings to the list of banned products.  
  - Exclusions were introduced for FDA-regulated medical devices, water utilities, wastewater treatment plants, and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs).  
  - Notification and labeling requirements were removed, and a sunset clause was introduced for the Department of Environmental Services' position related to the bill.  
- **Discussion**: Legislators emphasized the need for better data on PFAS content in products and the importance of public health protections.

### **Key Themes Across Discussions**
1. **Funding and Accountability**: Debates centered on balancing automatic funding for critical programs (e.g., SUD prevention) with the need for legislative oversight and flexibility.  
2. **Regulation vs. Flexibility**: Discussions highlighted the tension between public health regulations and the practical needs of businesses, such as B&Bs and restaurants.  
3. **Public Health and Economic Concerns**: Legislators grappled with the dual priorities of protecting public health (e.g., PFAS exposure) and supporting economic growth (e.g., liquor licensing and B&B regulations).  
4. **Practicality and Necessity**: Several bills, such as the gold and silver legal tender proposal, were scrutinized for their necessity and potential unintended consequences.

### **Outcome and Next Steps**
The committee concluded with plans for further refinement of several bills in subcommittee, interim studies for complex proposals like the condominium dispute resolution board, and continued collaboration with stakeholders to address concerns raised during the hearing.
