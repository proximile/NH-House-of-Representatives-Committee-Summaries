The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 10, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative discussions, focusing on transparency, accountability, election integrity, and honoring military families. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **House Bill 1495: Automatic Repeal Mechanism for Laws**
Sponsored by Representative Gearheart, this bill proposes an automatic repeal mechanism for laws based on the percentage of votes they receive in the General Court:
- **51%-64%**: Repeal after 3 years  
- **65%-79%**: Repeal after 7 years  
- **80%+**: Repeal after 10 years  
The bill also allows 100 registered voters to petition for the repeal of a law, which would then be reviewed by the relevant committee.  

**Key Points**:  
- **Purpose**: Inspired by Thomas Jefferson’s idea that laws should not be permanent, the bill aims to ensure laws are regularly evaluated for their effectiveness and relevance.  
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about practicality in a part-time legislature, potential gaps in law, and the bill’s alignment with the NH Constitution, particularly its exclusion of the Senate’s role.  
- **Support**: Some representatives appreciated the innovative approach to reducing outdated laws and increasing citizen participation.

- **Concerns**: Testimonies highlighted the constitutionality of electronic voting machines, the removal of sworn affidavits for absentee ballots in 1979, and the significant increase in absentee voting since 2020.  
- **Opposition**: A lawyer argued that the resolution relies on eccentric legal theories and lacks support from NH Supreme Court precedents, potentially complicating future election law changes.
