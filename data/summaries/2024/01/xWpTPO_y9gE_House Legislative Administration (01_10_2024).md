The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Legislative Administration committee convened on January 10, 2024, to address a range of legislative matters, focusing on election integrity, transparency, veteran recognition, and legislative processes. The meeting began with procedural matters, including the Pledge of Allegiance and scheduling updates for hearings on various bills.

### Key Legislative Discussions:

1. **House Bill 1495 (Automatic Repeal Dates for Legislation)**:
   - Introduced by Representative Jason Gard, HB 1495 proposes automatic repeal dates for new legislation based on the percentage of votes in favor. Bills passing with 51-64% support would expire in 3 years, 65-79% in 7 years, and 80%+ in 10 years. The bill also allows for citizen-initiated repeal petitions with 100 registered voters. Gard argued this ensures laws remain relevant and effective, referencing Thomas Jefferson's idea that laws should not outlive their necessity. Concerns included logistical challenges, potential gaps in law enforcement, and the constitutionality of bypassing the Senate.

2. **House Bill 1666 (Lobbyist Income Disclosure)**:
   - Introduced by Representative Penza, HB 1666 requires lobbyists to disclose their income to enhance transparency and prevent conflicts of interest. Penza emphasized the importance of understanding financial relationships between lobbyists, their clients, and policymakers. Supporters highlighted the need for accountability, while potential concerns included implementation costs and the impact on lobbying activities.

### Election Integrity and Constitutional Compliance:

3. **House Resolution 25 (HR 25)**:
   - HR 25 seeks to enforce strict adherence to the New Hampshire Constitution regarding election processes, particularly emphasizing the need for hand-counting ballots instead of relying on electronic machines. The resolution argues that electronic voting machines are unconstitutional and undermine public trust in the electoral system. Supporters cited concerns about election transparency, the potential for fraud with electronic machines, and the need to restore faith in the voting process. Critics questioned the practicality and necessity of such changes, with some noting that HR 25 does not carry the force of law.

4. **Constitutional Concerns and Absentee Voting**:
   - Several speakers stressed that the New Hampshire Constitution requires human eyewitnesses to count votes, not machines. They argued that the use of voting machines violates constitutional mandates and undermines election integrity. Concerns were also raised about the significant increase in absentee voting, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether this practice aligns with the constitutionâ€™s original intent.

### Honoring Veterans and Gold Star Families:

5. **House Bill 1434 (Honor and Remember Flag)**:
   - HB 1434 seeks to officially recognize the Honor and Remember Flag, a symbol honoring fallen service members and their families, to be flown on designated veteran-related holidays. Supporters, including Gold Star families, emphasized the importance of recognizing their sacrifices. The New Hampshire Department of Military Affairs and Veterans Services also supported the bill. However, opposition argued that the American flag is the appropriate symbol for honoring fallen service members and raised concerns about the commercial nature of the Honor and Remember organization.

### Legislative Transparency and Process:

6. **House Bill 1309 (Transparency in Legislative Processes)**:
   - HB 1309 aims to increase transparency by allowing the public and legislators to track the status of bills between their passage in the legislature and their signing by the governor. Representative Weber, the prime sponsor, explained that the bill addresses delays in the bill-signing process. House Clerk Paul Smith testified that the bill would help address frequent inquiries from the public about bill statuses, as the current system lacks transparency.

### Legislative Immunity and Marginalized Communities:

7. **House Bill 1367 (Legislative Immunity)**:
   - Introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, HB 1367 grants immunity to individuals testifying in public legislative hearings regarding potential criminal conduct related to the subject of the hearing. The goal is to encourage honest testimony without fear of legal repercussions. Testimony from marginalized communities, including the Erotic Laborers Alliance of New England, supported the bill, arguing that marginalized individuals deserve protection when sharing their experiences in legislative hearings.

### Conclusion:
The meeting highlighted a strong push from some legislators and constituents to ensure election integrity, transparency, and constitutional compliance, while others questioned the practicality and necessity of such changes. The discussions underscored the tension between modern practices and constitutional mandates, with a focus on upholding the rule of law and restoring public trust in the legislative and electoral processes. The meeting concluded with plans for further discussion and potential amendments to the bills.
