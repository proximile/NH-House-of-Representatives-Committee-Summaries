**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (January 30, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on January 30, 2024, to discuss several bills and issues related to public works, highways, and transportation infrastructure. The meeting addressed a range of topics, including road maintenance, funding mechanisms, sidewalk construction, and toll collection enforcement. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **Sidewalks and Easements**
- **House Bill 1196**: Introduced by Representative Eric Gallagher, this bill aims to address the lack of sidewalks along state-owned roads, particularly in Concord, by requiring the state to grant easements to municipalities for sidewalk construction. Concerns were raised by the NH Department of Transportation (NHDOT) regarding the state’s interest in certain properties (e.g., state hospital grounds) and the practicality of maintenance and utility relocations. Representatives questioned whether existing laws already address the issue.
- **General Concerns**: Broader discussions highlighted challenges related to constructing sidewalks on state-maintained roads, including conflicts with land rights and municipalities’ interest in maintaining them.

#### **Class Six Roads (House Bill 1234)**
- This bill focuses on the repair of Class Six roads not maintained by municipalities, addressing issues such as voluntary road associations, equitable contributions for maintenance, and the potential for civil actions against non-paying residents. The bill faced opposition from groups like the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association and the New Hampshire Farm Bureau, who argued it was unnecessary and could lead to litigation. Supporters emphasized the difficulties of maintaining roads with voluntary associations and the need for enforceable agreements.

#### **Commission on Revenue Alternatives (House Bill 1631)**
- The bill proposes extending the commission tasked with studying alternatives to the road toll for funding transportation infrastructure. Discussions emphasized the challenges of declining gas tax revenues due to increased vehicle efficiency and electric vehicle adoption. The commission aims to explore sustainable funding mechanisms for roads and bridges, with hopes of a federal solution.

#### **Vehicle Registration and Toll Collection Enforcement (House Bill 1439)**
- Introduced by Representative Coma, this bill addresses issues with the E-ZPass system, particularly for low-income constituents who face financial hardships due to administrative fees and unpaid tolls. It aims to remove administrative fees for vehicle registration and improve toll collection enforcement, especially for out-of-state drivers. NHDOT opposed the bill, citing the importance of toll revenue for road maintenance, debt service, and capital projects, and warning of potential revenue loss and system abuse if reciprocity agreements with Massachusetts and Maine were removed.

#### **Study Committee on Road Tolls and Vehicle Registration Fees (House Bill 1464)**
- Sponsored by Representative Caitlyn Cab, this bill proposes a study committee to explore alternatives to road tolls and vehicle registration fees, including electric vehicle fees. Supporters, such as the NH Auto Dealers Association, highlighted the rising costs of vehicle registrations and the need for equitable funding for road maintenance. Discussions focused on the scope of the study committee, its timeline, and the fiscal impact of reducing vehicle registration fees.

### **Public Testimony**
- Various stakeholders, including representatives from environmental services, timberland owners, motor transport associations, and auto dealers, provided testimony supporting or opposing the bills. Concerns were raised about the quality of road construction, the impact on private property owners, and the potential financial burdens on residents.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Equity and Accessibility**: Several bills focused on addressing financial burdens for low-income residents, particularly related to tolls and vehicle registration fees.
2. **Fiscal Impact**: Discussions highlighted concerns about the potential loss of revenue from tolls and the costs associated with sidewalk construction and maintenance.
3. **Collaboration**: Emphasized the need for collaboration between state agencies, municipalities, and property owners to address infrastructure challenges.
4. **Sustainable Funding**: The meeting underscored the importance of finding sustainable funding solutions for transportation infrastructure, especially in light of declining gas tax revenues and the rise of electric vehicles.
