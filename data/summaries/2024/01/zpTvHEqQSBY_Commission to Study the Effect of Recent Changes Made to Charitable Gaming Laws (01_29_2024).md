**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws (01/29/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 29, 2024, to discuss the Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws, with a particular focus on the newly authorized Historical Horse Racing (HHR) machines. The meeting highlighted the complexities of regulating charitable gaming, the need for accurate data, and the importance of balancing the interests of charities, operators, and the state while ensuring responsible gaming practices. Key topics and discussions are summarized below:

---

### **1. Historical Horse Racing (HHR) and Revenue Allocation**
- **HHR Proliferation**: The rapid expansion of HHR machines has raised concerns, with approximately 1,950 machines now in operation—far exceeding initial estimates of 1,500. This growth has outpaced regulatory oversight, as the Lottery Commission has issued licenses without statutory restrictions.
- **Revenue Distribution**: The allocation of revenue from HHR machines was a central issue. While the original bill proposed 12% of revenue to the state and charities, this was increased to 25% based on fiscal calculations. However, charities’ share of revenue has decreased from 27.9% to 18.3%, prompting questions about fairness. Operators have invested heavily in infrastructure, incurring long-term debt, while charities benefit from increased revenue without bearing these costs.
- **Breakage Funds**: Breakage—small amounts left over from wagers that are not paid out—was a significant topic. Some vendors do not account for breakage, creating inconsistencies. State law mandates that breakage funds support responsible gaming programs, but some funds are redirected to the education trust fund. The commission discussed requiring vendors to implement breakage systems and imposing fees on manufacturers to fund responsible gaming initiatives.

### **2. Data Collection and Decision-Making**
- **Need for Accurate Data**: The commission emphasized the importance of gathering detailed data to make informed decisions. Initial premises about HHR revenue and machine numbers have changed, necessitating updated information. The commission is hiring a consultant to analyze revenue allocations and compare them to other states.
- **Charity Survey**: The University of New Hampshire is conducting a survey of charities to assess the impact of recent changes to charitable gaming laws. This feedback will inform future recommendations.

### **3. Legislation and Enforcement**
- **Legislative Proposals**: Several bills related to gaming were discussed, including:
  - A permanent moratorium on rent for charities using gaming facilities.
  - A cap on poker rake fees at $250 for major tournaments.
  - A two-year moratorium on historical horse racing.
  - A bill allowing lottery winners to remain anonymous.
  - A bill directing unclaimed historical horse racing vouchers to the governor’s scholarship fund.
  - Two bills proposing moratoriums on new HHR licenses—one permanent and one for seven years—to address proliferation concerns.
- **Enforcement Resources**: Concerns were raised about the adequacy of resources for enforcing gaming laws as the industry expands. Suggestions included inviting guest speakers from Massachusetts or Maine to discuss their enforcement mechanisms and considering the need for state law enforcement to handle potential gambling crimes.

### **4. Responsible Gambling Initiatives**
- **Problem Gambling Hotline**: The state operates a 24/7 hotline for problem gambling, currently answered by a private individual. Efforts are underway to formalize its operation, though funding challenges have impacted the Council for Responsible Gambling’s activities.
- **Self-Exclusion Programs**: The commission explored the need for a centralized self-exclusion system. Currently, individuals must visit each casino to self-exclude, and there is no shared database among operators. Potential legislative changes were discussed to facilitate a more efficient system.

### **5. Local Control and Community Impact**
- **Local Challenges**: Dr. Deborah Warner from Littleton shared the town’s struggles with a proposed casino, highlighting the limitations of local control due to state preemption and the threat of lawsuits.
- **Local Opt-In/Opt-Out Provisions**: The commission debated the merits of allowing towns to opt-in or opt-out of hosting charitable gaming facilities. Some members advocated for zoning solutions rather than outright bans, emphasizing the need to balance state oversight with local autonomy.

---

### **6. Future Steps**
- **Next Meeting**: The commission tentatively scheduled its next meeting for March 4th, with plans to invite speakers and potentially review the RFP for the consultant.
- **Further Research**: The commission acknowledged the need for additional discussion on legal barriers to data sharing for self-exclusion, technological solutions, and the implications of local opt-in or opt-out provisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the multifaceted challenges of regulating charitable gaming in New Hampshire. The commission is tasked with making recommendations that address revenue allocation fairness, responsible gaming practices, enforcement needs, and the balance between state oversight and local control. As the HHR industry continues to grow, the commission’s work will be critical in shaping a regulatory framework that supports charities, protects consumers, and ensures sustainable growth for the gaming sector.
