**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (January 22, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on January 22, 2024, focused on workforce development, social services, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The meeting emphasized collaboration, resource allocation, and innovative strategies to address workforce development, poverty, and family stability in New Hampshire.

### **Workforce Development**
The New Hampshire Pathways (NHP) program was highlighted as a key initiative to build a skilled workforce pipeline that meets business needs while fostering self-confidence and preparing participants for employment. Collaboration with the Workforce Innovation Board, Department of Business and Economic Affairs, Department of Education, Employment Security, and the NH Community College System was emphasized. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and local service providers like the Community Action Partnership (CAP) support these efforts.

### **TANF Program**
The TANF program, established in 1996, is a federal block grant designed to provide assistance to needy families, promote job preparation and work, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encourage the formation of two-parent families. New Hampshire receives $38 million annually in federal funds and must contribute $32 million in state funds as maintenance of effort (MOE). The state has broad discretion in how it uses TANF funds, which can include cash assistance, job training, and other supportive services, though there are restrictions such as a 15% cap on administrative costs.

**Key Initiatives Supported by TANF:**
- **Cliff Effect Pilot Program**: This program provides income disregards for participants entering high-demand jobs or seeking promotions to incentivize work and increase household earnings and savings.
- **Kinship Navigation Programs**: These programs support family members caring for children in place of parents.
- **Comprehensive Family Support Services**: These services aim to stabilize families and promote economic growth.
- **Childcare Assistance**: Addressing childcare costs to support working families.

### **Economic Analysis**
A 2021 economic analysis study provided recommendations for mitigating the "cliff effect," where increased income leads to loss of benefits. A two-year pilot program was implemented in October 2022, and ongoing studies are exploring further mitigation strategies and graduated assistance programs.

### **Housing and Childcare**
Challenges in housing affordability and childcare costs were discussed, with efforts to collaborate with the Bureau of Housing and Homeless Services and the NH Housing Finance Authority. The "Whole Family Approach to Jobs" initiative, launched in 2017, aims to address intergenerational poverty and economic growth by focusing on family stability and employment.

### **Staffing Challenges**
The Bureau of Family Assistance faces staffing shortages, with a 19.8% vacancy rate due to low pay and high expertise requirements. This impacts service quality, causing delays in processing applications and resolving client issues.

### **Future Plans**
The committee discussed potential site visits to state-funded institutions like the NH Hospital and the Veterans Home to better understand their operations and challenges. Educational sessions on topics like long-term care were also proposed.

### **Legislative Updates**
The committee reviewed legislative changes under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, including new reporting requirements and participation in a six-year pilot program to evaluate statewide performance metrics beyond work participation rates.

### **Funding and Spending**
New Hampshire has a TANF balance of $69 million as of September 30, 2023. The state has broad discretion in how it uses TANF funds, which can include cash assistance, job training, and other supportive services. However, there are restrictions, such as a 15% cap on administrative costs and prohibitions on using funds for certain purposes like medical services or buildings.

### **Eligibility and Benefits**
TANF eligibility is based on income and family size, with benefits calculated as 60% of the federal poverty level. The program has a five-year lifetime limit on assistance for recipients. The state also discussed the potential for transferring up to 30% of TANF funds to other programs like the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) or the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG).

### **Program Trends**
Nationally, there has been a shift away from direct cash assistance, with states spending less on cash aid and more on work supports and education. The federal government is considering new rules to ensure states are meeting TANF requirements, including setting a ceiling on the definition of "needy" and excluding third-party non-governmental spending from MOE calculations.

### **New Hampshire Employment Program (NHP)**
New Hampshire invests TANF funds in the NHP, which focuses on workforce development, education, and reducing barriers to employment. The program aims to upskill individuals and prepare them for higher-wage positions.

### **Audits and Oversight**
The state undergoes regular audits of TANF spending, with no critical findings in the most recent audit. The committee discussed the importance of transparency and oversight to ensure funds are used appropriately.

### **Future Considerations**
The committee discussed the need for a long-term strategy for TANF funds, particularly given the large unspent balance. They also considered the potential for expanding the program to support two-parent families, which aligns with TANF's statutory goals but has not been a focus in New Hampshire in recent years.

**Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a commitment to further explore how TANF funds can be used more effectively to support needy families and address barriers to employment, with a focus on aligning state spending with federal goals and ensuring accountability. The discussion underscored the importance of innovative strategies, collaboration, and resource allocation to enhance workforce development, reduce poverty, and promote family stability in New Hampshire.
