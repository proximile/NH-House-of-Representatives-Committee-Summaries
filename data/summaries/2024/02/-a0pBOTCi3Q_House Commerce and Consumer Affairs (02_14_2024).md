**NH House of Representatives Meeting Summary: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (02/14/2024)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on February 14, 2024, addressed a range of healthcare and consumer-related topics, reflecting ongoing debates about patient care, fiscal responsibility, and policy clarity. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Healthcare Policy and Insurance Coverage**

1. **Biosimilar Drug Substitution**  
   - The committee debated whether pharmacists should be allowed to substitute biosimilar drugs for brand-name biologics when the FDA deems them interchangeable.  
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of studies proving interchangeability between different biosimilars and the potential confusion for physicians and patients regarding delivery mechanisms and insurance coverage.  
   - The committee decided to **refer the bill for interim study** to further examine the risks and implications of biosimilar substitution.

2. **Glucose Monitoring Devices (HB 1571)**  
   - The committee discussed mandating insurance coverage for glucose monitoring devices for individuals with type 2 and gestational diabetes, expanding existing coverage for type 1 diabetes patients.  
   - Concerns about the fiscal impact and the need for clear clinical criteria led the committee to proceed with a **mandate study** to assess the bill’s financial and medical implications.

3. **Breast Cancer Diagnostic and Supplemental Imaging Coverage (Bill 1296)**  
   - The bill aims to eliminate cost-sharing for diagnostic and supplemental breast cancer screenings, shifting financial responsibility from patients to insurers.  
   - Fiscal concerns were raised, with ongoing efforts to update the fiscal note to reflect potential costs.  
   - Testimonies emphasized the importance of ensuring access to follow-up imaging for women who cannot afford the costs, with some members advocating for the bill’s passage.

4. **Prescription Drug Affordability Board Conflict of Interest (Bill 1365)**  
   - The committee discussed a bill to address conflicts of interest within the Prescription Drug Affordability Board, proposing a mechanism for removing conflicted members.  
   - Concerns were raised about the board’s autonomy and access to commercial data, with suggestions to involve the Attorney General’s office in determining conflicts.  
   - The discussion highlighted the need for accountability and a clear process for addressing conflicts of interest.

### **Ambulance Insurance Payments (House Bill 1081)**  
   - The bill aimed to ensure insurance payments are sent directly to ambulance providers rather than to patients, who are currently responsible for forwarding payments.  
   - Issues with the current system include patients cashing checks and failing to pay ambulance companies, as well as confusion about where to send payments.  
   - While the bill received support for simplifying the process, concerns were raised about balance billing and the broader financial challenges faced by ambulance providers.  
   - The committee moved to **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** the bill, citing its failure to address the root issues of balance billing and ambulance funding. However, the discussion underscored the need for continued work on this complex issue.

### **Cannabis Bill Amendment**  
   - Representative Lean proposed amendments to a cannabis-related bill, including:  
     1. Removing a reference to a memo from the governor to avoid naming individuals in the bill’s purpose.  
     2. Redirecting 15% of cannabis funds from pensions to the education trust fund, addressing concerns about federal entanglement and public preference.  
   - The amendments passed with a **17-3 vote**, reflecting a focus on harm reduction and education funding.

### **Other Legislation**  
1. **House Bill 1236**  
   - The committee moved to pass this bill, which seeks to repeal the Commission on the Status of Health Coverage Markets for Individuals and Small Employers, as the commission has not met and its mission is no longer relevant.  

2. **Biological Product Substitution (House Bill 1365)**  
   - A representative from Amgen opposed the bill, arguing that it undermines physician choice and patient care by allowing the substitution of interchangeable biosimilars without FDA evaluation of their interchangeability with each other.

### **Overall Outcomes**  
- The meeting highlighted ongoing debates about healthcare policy, particularly in drug substitution, diabetes care, and insurance coverage for critical services.  
- The committee opted for further studies on biosimilar substitution and glucose monitoring device mandates to ensure patient safety and fiscal responsibility.  
- While some bills, such as the cannabis amendments, passed with broad support, others, like the ambulance insurance payments bill, were tabled due to unresolved complexities.  
- The discussions underscored the need for continued work to balance patient care, fiscal responsibility, and policy clarity in healthcare and consumer affairs.
