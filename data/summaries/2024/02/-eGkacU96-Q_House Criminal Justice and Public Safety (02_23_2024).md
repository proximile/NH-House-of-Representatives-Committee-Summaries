**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (02/23/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on February 23, 2024, to discuss and vote on a wide range of bills and amendments. The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing property rights, law enforcement responsibilities, juvenile justice, public safety, and emerging technological challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Property Rights and the Open Fields Doctrine**  
   - Representatives debated a bill addressing the Open Fields Doctrine, which allows law enforcement to search open lands without a warrant. Proponents argued the bill would codify property rights, ensuring government agents cannot trespass on private property posted with "no trespassing" signs. Opponents felt the bill was unnecessary, as police are already trained to respect property rights.  
   - A related bill (House Bill 1204) was amended to require law enforcement to obtain a warrant to access private property with "no trespassing" signs, except in emergencies or for hunting/fishing purposes. The amendment aimed to protect property rights while allowing exceptions for specific scenarios.

2. **Law Enforcement and Body Cameras**  
   - Discussions centered on removing redundant language regarding body cameras in statutes, as existing laws already mandate their use during law enforcement functions.  
   - House Bill 1021, which addressed access to body camera footage for defendants, was deemed redundant and voted **inexpedient to legislate**.

3. **Restorative Justice and Juvenile Hate Crimes**  
   - A bill proposing a study committee to explore restorative justice programs for juveniles, particularly those involved in hate crimes, was discussed. Supporters argued such programs could rehabilitate juveniles and reduce recidivism, while opponents questioned the need for a new committee, suggesting existing programs could address the issue.

4. **Protective Custody and Medical Evaluations**  
   - An amendment to a bill regarding protective custody for intoxicated individuals removed the requirement for immediate medical evaluation upon intake at correctional facilities. The amendment aimed to address staffing shortages and liability concerns while ensuring compliance with the law. The amended bill passed unanimously.

5. **Parental Rights and Child Risk-Taking (House Bill 1012)**  
   - The committee discussed a bill protecting parents’ rights to allow children to engage in reasonable risk-taking activities without being charged with neglect or endangerment. An amendment clarified that parents are not in violation of the law if they allow children to take reasonable risks for their development, provided there is no actual harm.  
   - Supporters emphasized the importance of fostering independence and learning from mistakes, while opponents raised concerns about the bill’s broad language potentially legitimizing neglect or emotional harm.

6. **Weapons and Public Safety**  
   - A bill repealing prohibitions on certain weapons (e.g., brass knuckles) for individuals aged 18 and over was passed with an amendment. Supporters argued it would allow self-defense and recognize these items as collector’s items, while opponents raised public safety concerns.  
   - A bill allowing employees to keep firearms in locked vehicles on employer property failed to pass (10-10), meaning it will proceed to the floor with no committee recommendation.

7. **Revenge Porn and AI-Generated Images**  
   - A bill amending New Hampshire’s revenge porn statute to include digitally generated synthetic images (e.g., deepfakes) was passed unanimously. The bill aimed to address the growing issue of non-consensual dissemination of synthetic media.

8. **Interim Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
   - Representatives voted to conduct an interim study on AI due to concerns about the misuse of AI-generated synthetic media, particularly in elections. The study will explore AI’s impact and potential regulations.

9. **Other Bills and Amendments**  
   - **House Bill 1038**: An amendment was adopted to align the bill with a version previously passed in committee, and the bill was passed as amended.  
   - **House Bill 1039**: The bill, which addressed judicial discretion in sentencing, was sent for interim study to allow further review.  
   - **House Bill 1097**: A bill allowing recording of conversations without consent was voted **inexpedient to legislate** due to privacy concerns.  
   - **House Bill 1197**: A bill authorizing additional state agencies to collect fingerprints for non-criminal background checks was amended and passed.

10. **Recess and Scheduling**  
   - Several bills, including House Bills 1539, 1711, and 1366, were recessed to March 6th and 8th for further discussion and amendments.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the committee’s efforts to address pressing issues in criminal justice and public safety, from property rights and parental freedoms to emerging challenges posed by AI and synthetic media.
