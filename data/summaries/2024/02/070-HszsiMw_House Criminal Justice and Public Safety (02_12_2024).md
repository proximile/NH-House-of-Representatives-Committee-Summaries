**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (02/12/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on February 12, 2024, to discuss and vote on a range of legislative proposals, primarily focusing on firearm regulations, public safety, and procedural fairness. The meeting highlighted bipartisan efforts to address concerns around individual rights, privacy, and government oversight, with several key bills and amendments debated and advanced. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **1. Disciplinary Review Panel and Procedural Concerns**
- Members raised concerns about the lack of clarity and structure in the disciplinary review panel’s appointment process, particularly the potential for unlimited appointments without clear guidelines. This issue was central to discussions on a proposed amendment, which passed 14-5 in committee. However, a motion to pass the bill with the amendment failed 8-11, and a subsequent motion to declare the bill "inexpedient to legislate" passed 12-7.
- Representatives emphasized the importance of procedural flexibility, including the option to introduce floor amendments to address unresolved policy issues. Members PR and Murphy were tasked with collaborating on a bipartisan floor amendment for future consideration.
- The committee will continue refining the amendment and prepare a majority report ahead of the next House session, scheduled for February 21, 2024.

#### **2. Firearm-Related Legislation**
Several bills addressing firearm regulations were discussed, reflecting a focus on balancing public safety with individual rights:
- **House Bill 1050**: This bill establishes a voluntary "do not sell" list for firearms, allowing individuals with episodic mental health issues to voluntarily waive their firearms rights to prevent self-harm. Framed as a libertarian measure emphasizing individual choice, the bill passed with overwhelming support (118 in favor).
- **House Bill 1186**: The committee debated a bill related to credit card companies tracking firearm purchases, raising concerns about privacy and government overreach. An amendment addressing these concerns was adopted, and the bill passed with strong support (127 in favor).
- **House Bill 1337**: A bill addressing domestic violence and firearms was deemed "inexpedient to legislate," with concerns that it would burden victims and make unnecessary changes to existing laws. The motion to kill the bill passed with near-unanimous support (190 in favor).
- **House Bill 1339**: An amendment to this bill clarified the process for returning firearms after restraining orders, introducing a 10-day timeframe for courts to issue return orders and ensuring background checks are conducted. The amendment was adopted, and the bill moved forward.
- **Mental Health and Firearm Rights**: A bill addressing the restoration of firearm rights for individuals previously committed for mental health reasons was discussed. The committee voted against the bill, citing the importance of maintaining records of involuntary commitments for ongoing healthcare assessments.

#### **3. EMS Disciplinary Review and Patient Privacy**
- **EMS Disciplinary Review Panel**: A bill proposed creating a three-member review panel for EMS disciplinary cases, replacing the current single-investigator model. The panel, composed of peers or higher-level professionals, aims to ensure fairer and more informed decisions. The bill also seeks to remove public listings of EMS disciplinary actions to prevent misuse while still allowing access for legitimate inquiries.
- **Patient Privacy Concerns**: A bill addressing the sharing of patient medical information was debated, with concerns raised about potential privacy violations. The committee voted to study the issue further, emphasizing the need to balance patient safety with privacy rights and avoid unintended consequences.

#### **4. Interim Studies and Further Amendments**
Several bills were referred for interim study or further amendment, reflecting the committee’s commitment to refining language and addressing concerns:
- A bill related to hospital data sharing was referred for further study to ensure transparency while protecting individuals’ rights.
- Another bill addressing EMS disciplinary processes will undergo further refinement to clarify procedural fairness and accountability.

- **Procedural Fairness**: Efforts to streamline processes, such as firearm returns after restraining orders and EMS disciplinary reviews, were central to the meeting. The committee emphasized the importance of due process, transparency, and clarity in legislative actions.
- **Bipartisan Collaboration**: Representatives demonstrated a willingness to collaborate across party lines, particularly in crafting floor amendments and addressing unresolved policy issues.
