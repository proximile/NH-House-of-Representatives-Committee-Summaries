The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 20, 2024, to discuss a series of election-related bills, focusing on redistricting reform, election security, accessibility for voters with disabilities, voter roll accuracy, and the balance between election integrity and voter access. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Redistricting Reform (CACR 19)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes establishing an independent redistricting commission to draw boundaries for state and federal offices, aiming to reduce partisan gerrymandering and ensure fair representation.
- **Support**: Representatives and advocacy groups, including the League of Women Voters, strongly supported the bill, emphasizing the need for nonpartisan redistricting to promote competitive elections and fair representation for all voters, including those in rural areas.
- **Opposition**: No significant opposition was noted during the public hearing, with overwhelming online submissions in favor (241 in support, 5 opposed).

### **Election Security (House Bill 1200)**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to enhance the security of printed paper ballots through controlled storage, inventory tracking, and video surveillance at printing facilities.
- **Concerns**: The Deputy Secretary of State and some representatives raised concerns about the bill’s language, particularly the requirement for immediate destruction of incorrectly printed materials, which was seen as excessive and potentially harmful to public confidence in the election process.
- **Amendments**: Representative Robert Weary acknowledged the need for amendments to section two, which currently restricts access to two employees.

### **Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities (House Bill 1264)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to extend the use of accessible voting systems (e.g., the "One4All" system) to municipal elections, ensuring that individuals with disabilities can vote privately and independently in all elections.
- **Support**: Advocacy groups, including the Disability Rights Center and Granite State Independent Living, along with visually impaired residents, testified in favor of the bill, highlighting the importance of aligning with federal disability laws (ADA) and ensuring dignity and independence for all voters.
- **Concerns**: The Deputy Secretary of State and the Municipal Association raised logistical and fiscal challenges, such as the need for additional tablets and manpower to reprogram devices for local elections.
- **Outcome**: The public hearing closed with overwhelming support (324 in favor, 3 opposed), and stakeholders were encouraged to work on amendments to clarify the bill’s language.

### **Voter Roll Accuracy and ERIC (House Bill 1557)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes that New Hampshire join the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a multi-state system designed to improve election integrity by maintaining accurate voter rolls and identifying potential voter fraud.
- **Support**: Proponents, including Representative Angela Brennan, emphasized ERIC’s role in improving voter roll accuracy, increasing public confidence in elections, and its nonpartisan, nonprofit nature. They highlighted ERIC’s security measures, including cryptographic hashing, and its use in 25 states.
- **Concerns**: Secretary of State David Scanland and some representatives expressed reservations about data privacy, the politicization of ERIC, and the potential costs associated with membership, including undetermined expenses for data security, staffing, and compliance.
- **Outcome**: The committee discussed the potential benefits of ERIC but also weighed concerns about costs, data privacy, and state sovereignty, concluding with a recess to continue deliberations on the bill.

### **Eliminating Voter Identification Exemptions (House Bill 1569)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to eliminate the affidavit option for voters without proper identification, requiring proof of identity, citizenship, and domicile to vote.
- **Support**: Supporters argued that the bill would strengthen election integrity by ensuring that only eligible voters cast ballots.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including advocacy groups and individuals, argued that the bill would disproportionately affect marginalized groups, such as formerly incarcerated individuals, young voters, and those experiencing housing insecurity, and could disenfranchise eligible voters.
- **Outcome**: The bill faced significant opposition, with public testimony overwhelmingly against it, citing its potential to restrict voter access.

### **Other Key Bills and Discussions**
- **House Bill 1098**: This bill addresses the delivery of ballots to elder care facilities, with support from the Secretary of State but opposition from the state long-term care ombudsman, who argued it would place unnecessary burdens on residents and voting personnel.
- **House Bill 1310**: Introduced by Representative Erica Leon, the bill requires supervisors of the checklist to meet every 90 days for periodic maintenance of voter rolls, aiming to address inflated voter rolls by ensuring timely processing of data like death records, motor vehicle records, and property transactions.
- **House Bill 1523**: The bill proposes revising the moderator’s worksheet to improve accountability and accuracy in ballot counting, particularly for absentee and test ballots.
- **House Bill 1099**: This bill aimed to allow for partisan School District elections, but it failed to pass after significant debate, with concerns about introducing unnecessary partisanship into local elections.
