The New Hampshire House of Representatives, specifically the House Election Law Committee, held a meeting on February 27, 2024, to discuss critical issues surrounding campaign finance laws, political advertising regulations, and the emerging challenge of AI-generated deep fakes in political communication. The meeting encompassed three major segments, each addressing distinct but interconnected topics. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Regulation of Deceptive Political Advertising and Deep Fakes**
The committee focused on legislation aimed at addressing deceptive political advertising, particularly the use of AI-generated deep fakes and fraudulent content. Key points included:
- **Accountability for Creators and Distributors**: Representatives emphasized that creators of deceptive content should bear primary responsibility, while distributors should only face liability if they knowingly distribute fake content. Broadcasters and media outlets should not be burdened with policing political ads.
- **Challenges of Regulating AI**: The rapid advancement of AI technology complicates the distinction between satire, creativity, and intentional fraud. Defining clear legal boundaries was identified as a significant challenge.
- **Existing Laws and Gaps**: While some forms of deceptive content, such as voter suppression calls, are already illegal under existing statutes, the proposed legislation seeks to address gaps in political advertising.
- **Public Awareness and Education**: Representatives stressed the importance of public education to help voters recognize and verify potentially fraudulent content. Legal consequences for bad actors were seen as a deterrent.
- **Legal Language and Intent**: The bill incorporates tested legal language focusing on intent and reasonable person standards, though some complexity was acknowledged as necessary for effective enforcement.
- **Future Amendments**: The legislation was viewed as a first step, with potential amendments needed as technology evolves. Further regulation at both state and federal levels was anticipated.

### **2. House Bill 1150 and Campaign Finance Reform**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1150**, which proposes minor changes to political advertising regulations, and broader issues with New Hampshire’s campaign finance laws (RSA 664). Key points included:
- **House Bill 1150**: The bill seeks to remove the requirement for political ads in newspapers, periodicals, or billboards to be explicitly marked as political. An amendment was expected to clarify that compliance responsibility lies with the candidate, campaign, or entity purchasing the ad. The bill was prompted by a case where a newspaper owner was charged for failing to mark political ads, causing controversy.
- **Debate on Labeling Requirements**: Committee members questioned the necessity of labeling political ads in newspapers, given that ads already include disclaimers. There was also discussion about whether the law should apply to billboards, with some arguing it was redundant.
- **Opposition to the Bill**: Katherine Langle of Open Democracy opposed the bill, arguing that removing labeling requirements could harm the integrity of campaign processes and media messaging.
- **Broader Campaign Finance Issues**: RSA 664 was criticized as overly complex, confusing, and inconsistently applied. The committee planned a work session to rewrite the law, aiming to streamline and clarify it.
- **Political Committee Definitions**: There was debate about how to define political committees, candidate committees, and political advocacy organizations, with a focus on simplifying definitions and ensuring consistency with federal law and Supreme Court rulings.
- **Media Literacy and Transparency**: Some members emphasized the importance of transparency and media literacy, arguing that clear labeling of political ads helps voters understand the source and intent of messaging.
- **Future Work**: The committee planned to continue refining HB 1150 and addressing broader campaign finance reform, with a focus on bipartisan support and avoiding controversial policy changes.

### **3. Campaign Finance and AI Regulation: Balancing Transparency and Free Speech**
The discussion expanded to include campaign finance laws and the regulation of AI-generated deep fakes in political advertising. Key points included:
- **Barriers to Participation**: Members debated how to reduce barriers for candidates to participate in elections while ensuring transparency in campaign financing. Overly complicated processes were seen as discouraging candidates.
- **Transparency and Influence**: The primary goal of campaign finance laws was identified as ensuring the public can identify potential undue influence on candidates, particularly from large donors. Examples of significant campaign funding from individuals or organizations raised concerns about donor influence.
- **Candidate and Committee Definitions**: The committee discussed the functional equivalence of candidates and candidate committees, with a focus on simplifying filing requirements to encourage participation, even for unpopular candidates.
- **Disclosure Requirements**: Emphasis was placed on the importance of disclosing in-kind contributions and self-funding to ensure transparency without overly burdening candidates.
- **Political Communication and Advertising**: The committee debated the definition of political communication, particularly whether it should include social media and other digital forms. Concerns were raised about overregulation of free speech, with consensus that disclosure should focus on paid political communications rather than all forms of political speech.
- **Scope of AI Regulation**: There was debate over whether the bill should include static images (e.g., photoshopped images) or focus solely on audio and video deep fakes. Some argued that static images are less deceptive, while others maintained that any manipulated media can deceive voters.
- **Enforcement Challenges**: Practical enforcement issues were highlighted, including the difficulty of distinguishing AI-generated content from real content and proving intent and knowledge when distributing manipulated media.
- **Legal Liability and Anti-SLAPP Provisions**: The bill’s provision allowing candidates to sue for damages over deep fakes raised concerns about potential abuse through frivolous lawsuits (SLAPP suits). Suggestions were made to include anti-SLAPP provisions or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to protect free speech.
- **Focus on Creators**: Agreement was reached that liability should primarily target the creators of deceptive content rather than distributors who may unknowingly share it.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of balancing transparency in campaign finance with the need to regulate emerging technologies like AI in political advertising. Members grappled with ensuring accountability without stifling free speech or creating unenforceable regulations. Clear definitions, practical enforcement mechanisms, and protections against legal abuse were identified as critical components of effective legislation. The committee committed to continuing its work on campaign finance reform and AI regulation, with a focus on bipartisan collaboration and adaptability to evolving technological and legal landscapes.
