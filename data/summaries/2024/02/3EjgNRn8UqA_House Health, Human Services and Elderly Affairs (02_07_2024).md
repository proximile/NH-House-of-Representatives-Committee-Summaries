### **Healthcare and Patient Privacy**

1. **HB 1663: Strengthening Health Information Privacy**

Specific issues included the impact on discharge planning, long-term care applications, and cross-border care.  
   - **Next Steps**: The committee plans to request a detailed comparison with Minnesota’s laws and refine the bill to address stakeholder concerns.

2. **HB 1669: Protecting Personal Privacy in Immunization Records**  
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to ensure withdrawals from the vaccine registry are honored and restricts data sharing with other states.  
   - **Concerns**: Critics highlighted the bill’s broad language and potential unintended consequences.  
   - **Status**: The discussion was tabled for further amendments.

3. **HB 1280: Informed Consent and Patient Rights**

   - **Support**: The bill aligns with the AMA’s Code of Ethics and emphasizes patient-centric care.  
   - **Concerns**: Opponents, including the NH Hospital Association, argued the bill is redundant and may create additional burdens for providers.  

4. **HB 1300: Access to Experimental Treatments**  
   - **Purpose**: Allows patients with incurable diseases to access experimental treatments, protecting practitioners from liability with informed consent.

### **Infant Protection and Safe Haven Laws**

1. **HB 1606 and HB 67: Expanding Safe Haven Laws**  
   - **Purpose**: Extends the time frame for relinquishing infants from 7 days to 61 days and allows for the installation of “safe haven baby boxes” at 24-hour staffed facilities.  
   - **Support**: Advocates emphasized the need to save lives and provide compassionate options for parents in crisis.  
   - **Concerns**: The Department of Health and Human Services proposed amendments to ensure parents are not granted blanket immunity for prior harm to the child.  

2. **HB 1607: Exclusionary Rule for Safe Haven Parents**  
   - **Purpose**: Protects parents from prosecution solely based on surrendering a baby at a Safe Haven location.  
   - **Support**: The rule prioritizes infant safety over prosecuting parents, even if they have prior criminal offenses.  
   - **Concerns**: Some representatives worried about potential abuse of the system to avoid accountability for prior harm.

### **Healthcare Reform and Provider Autonomy**

1. **HB 1604: Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)**  
   - **Purpose**: Prevents insurers from mandating EMRs or penalizing providers who do not use them.  
   - **Support**: Sponsored by Representative David Nagel, the bill aims to reduce burnout and administrative burdens, particularly for small and rural practices.  
   - **Concerns**: Stakeholders, including the NH Medical Society, supported the intent but raised concerns about conflicts with federal mandates and care coordination.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

1. **Patient Privacy vs. Access**: Several bills highlighted the tension between enhancing patient privacy and ensuring timely access to care. Stakeholders emphasized the need for precise language to avoid unintended consequences.  
2. **Reproductive Autonomy**: Discussions underscored the importance of addressing systemic biases in reproductive healthcare while balancing the rights of patients and physicians.  
3. **Infant Protection**: Expanding Safe Haven laws and introducing baby boxes were seen as compassionate solutions to protect vulnerable infants, though concerns about accountability were raised.  
4. **Healthcare Reform**: Efforts to reduce administrative burdens, particularly around EMRs and prior authorization, received broad support but required careful consideration of federal and state conflicts.
