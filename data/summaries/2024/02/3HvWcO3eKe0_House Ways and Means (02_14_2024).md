### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

1. **Border Security and Communication Equipment Funding**  
   - The committee debated a **$1.4 million one-time funding project** aimed at enhancing border security and communication equipment along New Hampshire's northern border.  
   - The funds are intended to address illegal crossings and improve coordination among law enforcement agencies.  
   - A notable discussion centered on whether to lapse unspent funds allocated for border security operations (**HB 1054**). Supporters of lapsing argued the funds could be redirected to other needs, while opponents stressed the importance of maintaining them for ongoing security efforts.

2. **Local Service Funding and Taxation**  
   - **HB 1254**: A bill proposing a new fee on lodging to fund local services, particularly public safety, sparked extensive debate. Concerns were raised about the varying impacts on communities like Conway and Portsmouth, as well as the potential for a "checkerboard effect." The bill faced a tied vote (10-10) on both the motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) and the motion to pass (OTP), resulting in the bill proceeding without recommendation. Both majority and minority reports were submitted.  
   - **CACR 15**: A bill proposing a two-thirds majority requirement for raising taxes or fees was debated, with arguments focusing on fiscal responsibility and the potential impact on property taxes and state funding. Supporters argued it would protect taxpayers, while opponents warned it could hinder necessary funding for public services.

3. **Charities and Gaming Revenue**  
   - **HB 1203**: A bill to prohibit charging rent to charities was discussed, with an amendment ensuring charities receive at least 35% of gross revenue from games of chance. The amendment passed unanimously, and the bill was placed on the consent calendar, indicating broad support.

4. **Procedural and Administrative Matters**  
   - The committee addressed several procedural issues, including handling bills with tied votes, submitting minority reports, and correcting drafting errors in bills like **HB 1525**.  
   - Roll call votes were conducted on various bills, with most decisions placed on the consent calendar due to lack of objections.  
   - A motion to indefinitely postpone **HB 1255** was passed, as the issue was being addressed in a Senate bill.  
   - Future deliberations were scheduled for pending bills, such as **HB 1613**, which required further work.
