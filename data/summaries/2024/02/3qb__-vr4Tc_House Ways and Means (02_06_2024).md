### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (02/06/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee convened on February 6, 2024, to discuss and vote on several tax-related and policy bills. The meeting was divided into a work session and an executive session, with key discussions focusing on tax adjustments, education funding, conservation efforts, and nonprofit tax exemptions. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

#### **Key Bills and Outcomes**

1. **Tax Adjustments and Revenue Policies**  
   - **HB 1191**: Passed unanimously (20-0). This bill adjusts the Meals and Wheels program, reducing the state’s reimbursement from $13 to $12 by eliminating the interest and dividends tax, with no net loss to the state.  
   - **HB 1533**: Passed unanimously. It updates the safe harbor threshold for business profit tax from $75,000 to $100,000 and links it to the Consumer Price Index.  
   - **HB 1536**: Passed 16-4. It increases the asset limit for tax purposes from $500,000 to $1 million, aligning more closely with federal IRS standards.  
   - **HB 1492**: Debated extensively, with discussions on reinstating the interest and dividends tax to address revenue concerns. Some members suggested deferring the bill to a budget year or studying it further.  

2. **Education Funding**  
   - **HB 1563 & HB 1514**: Both bills related to the education property tax and excess funds. The committee agreed to postpone further discussion until after the education committee’s bills were addressed in mid-February, as these issues were interconnected.  

3. **Conservation and Land Use**  
   - **HB 1484**: Proposed modifications to current use taxation for forested lands, particularly regarding carbon credits and conservation efforts. Members raised concerns about the bill’s readiness and potential unintended consequences. It was moved to ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate).  

4. **Business and Nonprofit Tax Policies**  
   - **HB 1551**: Aimed to distinguish between C corporations and S corporations for business profits tax calculations. Members noted that the bill amended the wrong part of the law and was not ready for consideration. It was moved to ITL.  
   - **CACR 18**: A constitutional amendment seeking to remove tax exemptions for churches. Representative PL moved to ITL, arguing that churches provide essential services and that removing their tax exemptions would harm their operations. The motion passed unanimously.  

5. **Other Bills**  
   - **HB 1558**: Proposed changes to Fish and Game Department fees. The bill was moved to ITL, as the department had already implemented the fees.

#### **Discussion Highlights**  
- **Tax Fairness**: Concerns were raised about the distribution of the Meals and Rooms Tax, with some representatives arguing that urban hubs bear a disproportionate burden.  
- **Revenue Sustainability**: Members emphasized the need for incremental tax adjustments rather than drastic changes, particularly in light of uncertain future revenues and expenses.  
- **Interim Studies**: Several bills, including those related to education funding and tax adjustments, were recommended for interim study, meaning they will be revisited in future sessions, particularly during budget cycles.

#### **Key Themes**  
- **Equity in Taxation**: Discussions highlighted the need for fair and equitable tax policies, particularly in addressing municipal concerns and aligning state tax codes with federal standards.  
- **Education Funding**: The committee acknowledged the interconnected nature of education funding and property tax policies, agreeing to wait for the education committee’s recommendations before proceeding.  
- **Conservation and Nonprofits**: Members emphasized the importance of careful management of forested lands and the role of nonprofits and churches in providing essential services.
