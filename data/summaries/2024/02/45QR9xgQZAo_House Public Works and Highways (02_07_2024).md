**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (February 7, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on February 7, 2024, to discuss a range of bills and topics related to transportation, infrastructure, and public safety. The meeting highlighted key debates, stakeholder testimonies, and legislative actions across several areas, including traffic safety, housing development, electric vehicles (EVs), and railroad infrastructure.

### **Traffic Safety and Infrastructure**
1. **House Bill 1262 (Traffic Signal at Route 111 and Irma Road, Salem)**:
   - **Prime Sponsor**: Representative Joe Sweeney advocated for installing a traffic signal at a dangerous intersection in Salem, citing **133 accidents** in six years, including fatal collisions. He argued that a signalized intersection is preferred over a roundabout, which would require eminent domain and is less favored by the community.
   - **DOT Opposition**: Bill Oldenberg from the NH Department of Transportation (DOT) opposed the bill, emphasizing the need for an **alternatives analysis** before deciding on a solution. The intersection is part of a **10-year safety improvement project**, and DOT prefers a **roundabout** for its safety benefits, despite higher costs. The project is scheduled for construction in **March 2025**, but starting a new process for a signal could delay it until **2026**.
   - **Community and Committee Concerns**: Residents and local officials favored a traffic signal, while committee members raised questions about traffic studies, speed limits, and alternative solutions like rumble strips or raised medians. Sweeney introduced an amendment to clarify the town’s preference for a signalized intersection, supported by the New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA).

2. **House Bill 122 (Driveway Permit Timelines)**:
   - **Objective**: The bill proposes a **30- to 45-day timeline** for DOT to issue driveway permits, aiming to streamline the process and reduce delays for housing developments.
   - **Support and Challenges**: Stakeholders, including Housing Action NH and the NH Timberland Owners Association, supported the bill, citing delays and costs for affordable housing and forestry operations. DOT opposed strict deadlines, citing increased permit applications and reduced staffing, which could compromise safety and efficiency.
   - **Proposed Solutions**: Discussions included narrowing the bill’s scope to housing developments, implementing early scoping meetings, and creating an online permit tracking system. An amendment aligned the bill with existing planning board deadlines (65 days).

### **Electric Vehicles and Infrastructure**
1. **EV Growth and Challenges**:
   - The committee discussed the **15% year-over-year growth** in EV registrations in New Hampshire, with projections of **140,000 EVs** on the road by 2031. Concerns were raised about the impact of heavy EV batteries on road wear and the need for expanded charging infrastructure.
   - **Testimony**: State Fire Marshal Sean Tumi highlighted **fire safety challenges** posed by EVs, including new firefighting tactics and structural modifications for parking garages. Jessica Wilcox from the NH Department of Environmental Services discussed efforts to build EV charging infrastructure using **Volkswagen settlement funds**.

2. **Legislative Actions**:
   - **House Bill 1439** (vehicle registration and toll enforcement) and **House Bill 1464** (revenue alternatives to road tolls) were deemed inexpedient to legislate due to potential costs and redundancy.
   - A commission was established to study **revenue alternatives to road tolls**, focusing on sustainable funding mechanisms, including **mileage-based fees**.

### **Railroad Infrastructure and Recreational Trails**
1. **House Bill 1468 (Conway Branch Rail Corridor)**:
   - **Objective**: The bill proposes converting a **10-mile section** of the inactive Conway Branch rail corridor into a **recreational rail trail**.
   - **Amendment**: Representative Jonathan Smith introduced an amendment to form a **planning group** to explore the best public use of the corridor, balancing economic, social, and health benefits with potential rail-related activities.
   - **Community Support**: Testimonies from local officials and organizations, including Friends of the Osby Rail Trail and the Ossipee Chamber of Commerce, highlighted the **economic and recreational benefits** of rail trails. A survey in Ossipee showed **76% of respondents** in favor of the trail.
   - **DOT Position**: Shelley Winters from NHDOT explained that the state is preparing an **RFP (Request for Proposals)** for on-rail uses. If no viable proposals are received, the conversation could shift toward recreational trail use, which would likely require **private funding or grants**.

2. **Testimonies on Railroad Infrastructure**:
   - **David Camp** emphasized the high costs of rehabilitating rail lines, while **Daniel Day** and **Mike Lacy** discussed the economic benefits of the Conway Scenic Railroad and the need for reliable rail connections.

### **Other Legislative Actions**
- **House Bill 1196** (easements for sidewalks along highways) and **House Bill 1234** (repair of unmaintained class six roads) were deemed inexpedient to legislate.
- **House Bill 1631** (extending a commission to study revenue alternatives to road tolls) was passed with an amendment.

---

### **Next Steps and Future Work**
The committee planned extensive work sessions to review the **10-year transportation plan**, with presentations from department heads. The goal is to finalize the plan and address public input in subsequent meetings, ensuring a balanced approach to transportation challenges, public safety, and economic development.

### **Key Themes**
- **Local vs. State Priorities**: Tensions between local preferences and state procedural requirements were evident, particularly in the debate over the Salem intersection and driveway permits.
- **Safety and Efficiency**: Safety concerns drove discussions on traffic signals, driveway permits, and EV infrastructure, while efficiency and cost-effectiveness were central to debates on railroad infrastructure and funding mechanisms.
- **Community Engagement**: Strong community support for recreational rail trails and affordable housing highlighted the importance of aligning legislative actions with public needs and preferences.

The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing complex transportation challenges through collaborative, data-driven decision-making.
