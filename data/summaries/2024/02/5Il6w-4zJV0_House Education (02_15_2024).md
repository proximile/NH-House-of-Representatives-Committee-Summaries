### **HB 1087: Commission to Study Information and Media Literacy in Public Schools**
- **Overview**: This bill proposes the establishment of a commission to study and improve information and media literacy instruction in New Hampshire’s public schools.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Testimony**: Susan Ballard, a retired school district director of library media and technology, and Heather Inyard, leader of the nonprofit Media Power Youth, emphasized the urgent need for media literacy education. They highlighted the importance of equipping students with critical thinking skills to navigate the complex digital landscape and distinguish credible information from misinformation.
  - **Interdisciplinary Approach**: The discussion underscored the integration of media literacy into various subjects, including STEM, health, and language arts.
  - **Commission Composition**: Concerns were raised about the inclusion of specific organizations in the bill, with suggestions to adopt more open-ended language to allow for future organizational involvement.

### **HB 1418: Use of Education Freedom Account (EFA) Funds to Purchase School Uniforms**
- **Overview**: This bill seeks to prohibit the use of EFA funds for the purchase of school uniforms.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Rationale**: Representative Hope Damon Sullivan introduced the bill on behalf of Representative Horan, citing concerns about fairness. The bill argues that taxpayer funds should not subsidize uniforms for students in private or religious schools, especially since public school families receive no similar assistance.
  - **Data**: During the 2022-2023 school year, $3,059 in EFA funds were spent on uniforms for 282 students, averaging $106 per student. Additional spending on uniforms through other categories and vendors was also noted.
  - **Opposition**: Opponents of the bill argued that uniforms should not be funded by taxpayers and suggested alternative solutions, such as private charity or school-run programs to assist families in need.

### **HB 1646: Charter Public Schools**
- **Overview**: This bill, introduced by Representative Dave Luno, aims to establish minimum standards for charter public schools in New Hampshire.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Standards and Oversight**: The bill requires charter schools to be private corporations incorporated under NH law and operate as secular 501(c)(3) organizations. It seeks to address inconsistencies in approval standards, particularly between state-approved and locally approved (conversion) charter schools.
  - **Financial Accountability**: Recent instances of financial mismanagement and insolvencies in charter schools prompted calls for stricter oversight and accountability. The Department of Education and Department of Justice have been collaborating on revising minimum standards for charter school approval, and HB 1646 may serve as a vehicle for these changes.
  - **Impact on Existing Schools**: Questions were raised about the bill’s potential impact on existing charter schools and the distinction between state-approved and locally approved institutions.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
- **Equity and Access**: Both HB 1087 and HB 1418 address issues of equity and access in education. HB 1087 focuses on equipping students with essential media literacy skills, while HB 1418 tackles the fair use of public funds for school uniforms.
- **Accountability and Standards**: HB 1646 emphasizes the need for accountability and consistent standards in charter schools, particularly in light of recent financial challenges.
- **Interdisciplinary and Non-Partisan Approaches**: The discussions highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary education (e.g., media literacy across subjects) and the need for non-partisan solutions to educational challenges.
- **Next Steps**: The committee concluded with plans to move forward with further discussions and potential revisions to the bills, ensuring that they address the identified issues effectively and equitably.

This meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to strengthening educational standards, promoting equity, and preparing students for the complexities of the 21st century.
