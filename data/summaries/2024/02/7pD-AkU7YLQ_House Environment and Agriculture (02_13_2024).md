**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/13/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 13, 2024, to discuss several bills related to environmental protection, waste management, and landfill permitting. The meeting focused on key legislative proposals aimed at addressing landfill siting, waste reduction, and community impacts, while balancing environmental and economic considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed:**

1. **HB 1132 (Brownfield Sites for Landfills)**  
   - **Purpose**: Requires landfill permit applicants to evaluate **Brownfield sites** (previously contaminated land) as alternatives to **Greenfield sites** (pristine land). The bill does not mandate the use of Brownfield sites but ensures they are considered to minimize environmental harm.  
   - **Support**: Seen as a step toward sustainable waste management, aligning with New Hampshire’s environmental goals and Solid Waste Management Plan.  
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the feasibility of Brownfield sites, as many are too small, near waterways, or unsuitable for landfills. The **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** opposed the bill, citing unclear criteria for public benefit assessments and practical challenges.  
   - **Outcome**: Generally supported, though some suggested further study or expansion to include private and municipal projects.

2. **HB 1170 (Community Impact Assessments for Landfills)**  
   - **Purpose**: Requires landfill permit applicants to fund third-party studies to assess environmental and community impacts, including noise, traffic, property values, and groundwater pollution. The bill also mandates that landfills operate only when a demonstrated need exists.  
   - **Amendments**: Proposed amendments clarified the scope, focusing on landfills and addressing concerns about monopolies by ensuring permits are issued based on need.  
   - **Support**: Aimed at addressing resource disparities between developers and communities, particularly in regions affected by landfills.  
   - **Opposition**: DES expressed concerns about the bill’s broad scope and potential administrative challenges.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was amended to align with a Supreme Court ruling on public benefit, requiring need to be demonstrated for at least half of the permit’s lifetime.

3. **HB 1620 (Moratorium on New Landfill Permits)**  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes a moratorium on issuing new landfill permits until 2031, allowing time to explore alternatives like recycling, composting, and waste reduction.  
   - **Support**: Advocates argued that New Hampshire has sufficient landfill capacity until 2033-2034 and that the moratorium would provide a pause to address environmental and public health concerns, such as PFAS contamination.  
   - **Opposition**: Critics, including DES and business groups, warned that the moratorium could lead to a shortage of in-state waste disposal capacity, increased costs, and reliance on out-of-state facilities, undermining the state’s carbon reduction goals.  
   - **Outcome**: The debate highlighted the tension between environmental protection and economic considerations, with stakeholders urging careful evaluation of the state’s waste management needs.

4. **HB 1386 (Lithium-Ion Battery Disposal)**  
   - **Purpose**: Prohibits the disposal of lithium-ion batteries in solid waste facilities, composting facilities, or incinerators due to fire risks.  
   - **Amendments**: Exempts accidental disposal and focuses on lithium-ion batteries, excluding lithium batteries for now.  
   - **Support**: Emphasized the need for public education and recycling collection sites.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee supported the bill as amended, recognizing the importance of addressing hazardous materials.

5. **HB 1376 (Recycling Logo on Packaging)**  
   - **Purpose**: Prohibits certain packaging from carrying the recycling logo.  
   - **Concerns**: The committee questioned the bill’s necessity, noting the utility of recycling logos for sorting plastics and the financial benefits for municipalities.  
   - **Outcome**: Suggested that the issue might be better addressed at the federal level.

6. **HB 1681 (Labeling Biodegradable and Compostable Products)**  
   - **Purpose**: Addresses labeling products as biodegradable or compostable.  
   - **Concerns**: The committee acknowledged the bill’s intent but noted jurisdictional issues with placing it in Commerce law.  
   - **Outcome**: Recommended collaboration with the Commerce Committee or revisiting the issue in future legislation.

7. **HB 154 (Architectural Paint Recycling)**  
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on reducing paint waste in landfills through recycling programs.  
   - **Support**: Praised for aligning with model legislation used in other states.  
   - **Outcome**: Referred to the Solid Waste Subcommittee for further review and potential amendments.

### **Key Themes and Discussions:**

- **Environmental Protection vs. Economic Impact**: The debates highlighted the need to balance environmental goals, such as reducing landfill use and protecting public health, with economic considerations, including waste management costs and business impacts.  
- **Public Health and Community Concerns**: Many bills, particularly HB 1170 and HB 1620, focused on addressing the environmental and health risks posed by landfills, such as PFAS contamination and groundwater pollution.  
- **Waste Reduction and Alternatives**: There was strong emphasis on exploring alternatives to landfills, including recycling, composting, and advanced waste diversion methods, to reduce reliance on landfills and address capacity concerns.  
- **Regulatory Challenges**: The discussions underscored the complexities of landfill permitting, including the need for clear criteria, public benefit assessments, and alignment with ongoing rulemaking by DES.  
- **Public Engagement and Education**: Several bills, such as HB 1386 and HB 154, emphasized the importance of public education and clear definitions in legislation to ensure effective implementation.
