### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Subcommittee Work Session (02/02/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee held a work session on February 2, 2024, to discuss several bills: **HB1272**, **HB1410**, and **HB1676**. The session focused on occupational licensing reform, streamlining licensing processes, and evaluating the necessity of certain licensing boards. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **HB1676: Establishment of a Commission to Evaluate Occupational Licensing Boards**

1. **Commission Structure and Membership**:  
   - The bill proposes creating a commission to review and potentially reform occupational licensing boards in New Hampshire.  
   - Membership would include legislators (with minority party representation) and public members, with a focus on balancing public health, safety, and consumer protection.  
   - Debate centered on whether to include industry representatives (e.g., healthcare professionals) or maintain impartiality by excluding licensed professionals. Suggestions were made to involve organizations like the Business and Industry Association (BIA) in the appointment process.  

2. **Statement of Purpose**:  
   - The subcommittee revised the bill’s statement of purpose, removing the phrase “fundamental right” to avoid implying an absolute right to pursue lawful occupations. The revised language emphasizes the general court’s recognition of this right while acknowledging the need for regulation.  

3. **Sunset Provision**:  
   - The bill includes a sunset provision requiring the commission to review and issue reports on licensing boards before their potential repeal.  
   - To address feasibility concerns, the subcommittee discussed extending the repeal deadline by a year if the commission fails to issue timely reports.  

4. **Role and Authority**:  
   - The commission’s role is advisory; it can propose changes but cannot implement them. The legislature would ultimately decide on any reforms or repeals.  
   - Concerns were raised about the commission’s ability to effectively review the large number of licensing boards, prompting suggestions for a phased approach over several years.  

5. **Impartiality and Public Input**:  
   - The subcommittee emphasized the importance of impartiality, ensuring the commission represents the public interest rather than specific industries. Public hearings and stakeholder input were highlighted as essential components of the process.  

6. **Next Steps**:  
   - The subcommittee adjourned without finalizing decisions, opting to continue discussions at a future meeting. Members were encouraged to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the bill’s structure, membership, and purpose.

#### **HB1410: Streamlining Licensing Processes and Repealing Non-Functional Boards**

1. **Removing Conflicting Language**:  
   - The subcommittee discussed removing redundant or conflicting language in statutes, particularly concerning the authority of licensing boards versus the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**.  
   - Efforts focused on streamlining the licensing process, especially for **Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs)**, while ensuring temporary licensing and educational requirements remain intact.  

2. **Repealing the Board of Registration of Medical Technicians**:  
   - The subcommittee considered repealing the **Board of Registration of Medical Technicians**, which has been non-functional due to a lack of board members and registrants.  
   - Testimony indicated that the board has never met and is not providing utility, as complaints cannot be adjudicated without a functioning board.  
   - The subcommittee decided to **remove the board from the statute**, noting that employers and other licensing boards (e.g., nursing) could handle disciplinary issues.  

3. **General Licensing Issues**:  
   - The subcommittee discussed challenges related to **telemedicine** across state lines, particularly for border towns where licensing barriers prevent NH physicians from providing services to patients in neighboring states.

#### **HB1272: Occupational License Reciprocity and Licensing by Endorsement**

1. **Licensing Reciprocity and Endorsement**:  
   - The bill aims to streamline the process for professionals licensed in other states to obtain licenses in New Hampshire by endorsing their out-of-state licenses.  
   - Concerns were raised about ensuring that the **scope of practice** and **licensing requirements** in other states are **substantially similar** to those in New Hampshire to protect public safety.  

2. **Debate Over Terminology and Intent**:  
   - There was debate over whether the bill should focus on **reciprocity** (mutual recognition of licenses between states) or **licensing by endorsement** (allowing individuals with out-of-state licenses to practice in NH without re-licensing).  
   - Some members suggested renaming the bill to clarify its intent, as reciprocity implies a two-way agreement, which is not always feasible.  

3. **Outcome**:  
   - The subcommittee voted **5-0** to recommend **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** on HB1272, citing the need to allow the rulemaking process from a previous bill to conclude before making further changes.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

1. **Balancing Public Safety and Efficiency**:  
   - The subcommittee emphasized the need to protect public health and safety while minimizing unnecessary regulatory burdens and streamlining licensing processes.  

2. **Addressing Non-Functional Boards**:  
   - The subcommittee moved to repeal non-functional boards, such as the Board of Registration of Medical Technicians, to eliminate inefficiencies in the licensing system.  

3. **Next Steps**:  
   - The subcommittee plans to draft amendments based on the discussions and review them before finalizing recommendations. Continued focus will be on ensuring that the bills’ language accurately reflects the intent to balance public safety with regulatory efficiency.  

Overall, the session reflected a collaborative effort to reform occupational licensing in New Hampshire, addressing both immediate challenges and long-term goals.
