**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee Meeting (February 6, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee convened on February 6, 2024, to discuss several bills and issues related to wildlife management, fishing regulations, and environmental compliance. The meeting highlighted key legislative efforts, stakeholder concerns, and the complexities of balancing conservation, recreational use, and scientific management. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Lobster and Crab Landing License (Bill 1029)**
- **Purpose**: Clarify the distinction between recreational and commercial landing licenses for lobsters and crabs.
- **Concerns**: Ambiguity in the bill could create loopholes, making enforcement and data collection challenging. Opponents argued that exempting recreational licenses might lead to revenue loss for the department and hinder effective management.
- **Proposals**: Amendments were suggested, such as lowering fees for non-resident recreational licenses. Law enforcement emphasized the need for separate landing licenses for non-residential landings.
- **Outcome**: The bill was passed with an amendment clarifying that lobsters must be legally caught in other states or federal waters, though some members expressed reservations about enforcement and reporting.

#### **2. Nominating Group for Fish and Game Commission (Bill 1148)**
- **Purpose**: Expand the nominating group for the Fish and Game Commission to include 501(c)(3) organizations supporting hunting, fishing, trapping, and conservation.
- **Discussion**: The bill aimed to address perceived underrepresentation of non-consumptive users (e.g., hikers, birdwatchers) in wildlife management decisions. The sponsor acknowledged past legislative failures and called for a broader conversation.
- **Outcome**: The bill was recommended for interim study to allow for further discussion and consensus-building.

#### **3. Coyote Hunting Season (Bills 100 and 1100)**
- **Purpose**: Close the coyote hunting season during pup-rearing periods to prevent starvation of pups and reduce human-wildlife conflicts.
- **Discussion**:
  - **Opposition**: Opponents argued that hunting does not control coyote populations and may increase them due to responsive reproduction. The New Hampshire Wildlife Federation opposed the bill, advocating for season-setting authority to remain with Fish and Game biologists.
  - **Support**: Supporters emphasized ethical concerns about hunting during denning seasons and the ecological role of coyotes as predators.
  - **Scientific Data**: Dan Beron, Chief of the Wildlife Division, stated that New Hampshire’s coyote population has been stable for 30 years, and current hunting seasons do not negatively impact the population.
- **Outcome**: Both bills were recommended for interim study, with the committee emphasizing the need for scientific data and ethical considerations in setting hunting regulations.

#### **4. Wild Trout Management (Bill 1417)**
- **Purpose**: Codify the wild trout management plan and correct an incorrect definition of "brook trout" in the Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA).
- **Discussion**:
  - **Opposition**: The NH Fish and Game Department opposed the bill, arguing that current rules provide adequate management and codifying specific rules would limit adaptive management based on ongoing research.
  - **Support**: Supporters, including Representative Susan Portelli, highlighted the importance of managing native trout species for future generations and promoting outdoor activities for children.
  - **Public Testimony**: Anglers and conservationists shared mixed views, with some advocating for more protective measures and others expressing concerns about overpublicizing sensitive fishing spots.
- **Outcome**: The bill was recommended for interim study, with the department continuing work on a comprehensive trout management plan.

#### **5. Tree Stand and Game Camera Regulations (Bill 1532)**
- **Purpose**: Clarify enforcement rules for tree stands and game cameras on private and state-owned land, including placement dates, removal requirements, and landowners’ rights.
- **Discussion**:
  - **Concerns**: The New Hampshire Farm Bureau, Timberland Owners Association, and Fish and Game Department opposed the bill, arguing that the current law should be given time to work before further changes.
  - **Law Enforcement Perspective**: Colonel Kevin Jordan expressed concerns about confusing the public, creating enforcement challenges, and undermining evidence collection in legal cases.
  - **Amendments**: An amendment was proposed to allow labeling game cameras with placards or straps instead of directly on the device.
- **Outcome**: The bill failed to pass, but a motion for an interim study was approved to refine the language and address stakeholder concerns.

### **Additional Topics**

#### **Hatchery Modernization**
- **Presentation**: Diane Timmons, Inland Fisheries Division Chief, discussed the need for hatchery modernization due to outdated infrastructure and legal challenges related to phosphorus discharge limits.
- **Plan**: The $47.7 million project includes reducing production at Powder Mill Hatchery, relocating fish to other facilities, and modernizing New Hampton Hatchery with recirculating systems to meet environmental standards.
- **Timeline**: Construction is expected to begin in 2025, with the project aiming to ensure compliance with EPA permit deadlines and improve fish production efficiency.

#### **Scientific Permits and Wildlife Studies**
- **Discussion**: Testimony emphasized the importance of confidentiality in scientific permits for tracking and studying species like bears and rattlesnakes to prevent black market exploitation.

#### **Land Posting Amendment**
- **Proposal**: Representative Love introduced an amendment addressing who can post land, proposing penalties for those without legal interest in the property, inspired by a personal incident involving hunting rights and trespassing issues.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Data and Enforcement**: The importance of accurate data collection and enforcement was a recurring theme, particularly in discussions about lobster and trout management.
2. **Representation and Stakeholder Input**: Debates over the Fish and Game Commission’s composition highlighted the need for balanced representation of consumptive and non-consumptive users.
3. **Scientific Management**: Many discussions emphasized the role of scientific data in setting hunting, fishing, and wildlife management regulations.
4. **Ethical Considerations**: Ethical concerns, particularly regarding coyote hunting during denning seasons, played a significant role in the debates.
5. **Legislative Process**: The repetitive nature of legislative efforts and the need for more effective approaches to address underlying issues were acknowledged.

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**
- Several bills, including those related to coyote hunting, trout management, and tree stand regulations, were recommended for interim study to allow for further refinement and stakeholder input.
- The hatchery modernization project was highlighted as a priority, with urgent funding needs to meet environmental compliance deadlines.
- The committee emphasized the importance of balancing landowners’ rights, law enforcement needs, and conservation efforts in future legislative efforts.

The meeting concluded with a call for continued collaboration and scientific rigor in addressing the complex challenges of wildlife management and environmental compliance.
