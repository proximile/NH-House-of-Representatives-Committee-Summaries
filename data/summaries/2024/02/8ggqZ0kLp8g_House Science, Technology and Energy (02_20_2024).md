**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting on February 20, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 20, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on several key bills related to energy policy, regulatory actions, and energy efficiency programs. The meeting featured robust debates on state sovereignty, energy independence, and the balance between market dynamics and regulatory oversight. Here’s a detailed summary of the proceedings:

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

1. **House Bill 1600 (Net Energy Metering)**  
   The committee reviewed and passed an amended version of HB 1600, which addresses net energy metering for municipal and county aggregations. The amendment clarified that energy generated by municipal hosts would not be considered part of default service, potentially reducing transmission costs. The bill passed unanimously (18-0) and was placed on the consent calendar. Earlier discussions focused on refining the bill’s language, including moving certain provisions to more appropriate sections of the law and removing a section about retiring generators from the ISO New England market.

2. **House Bill 1036 (Energy Efficiency Cost Assessment)**  
   The committee debated an amendment to HB 1036, which provides the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) with greater flexibility to evaluate cost-effectiveness formulas for energy efficiency programs. The amendment allows the PUC to consider additional or modified cost-effectiveness tests, provided these changes are developed through an adjudicative process and approved before implementation. While the amendment was adopted, the bill itself failed in a 9-9 vote. Opponents argued that the existing statute already provided sufficient flexibility, while proponents emphasized the need for more adaptable evaluation methods.

3. **House Bill 1623 (State Energy Policy)**  
   The committee engaged in a heated debate over a significant rewrite of New Hampshire’s energy policy through HB 1623. The bill aimed to protect in-state energy generation resources and assert state sovereignty over energy decisions, including the authority to challenge federal regulations deemed unconstitutional, particularly those affecting energy generation facilities. Critics argued that the bill was overly protectionist, conflicted with free market principles, and could stifle innovation in the energy sector. Concerns were also raised about the removal of language promoting energy diversity and the impracticality of the state asserting control over private energy facilities. The bill ultimately failed in a 9-9 vote.

4. **Additional Discussions and Themes**  
   - **State Sovereignty vs. Federal Regulation:** Several representatives questioned the state’s ability to overrule federal regulations, particularly those from the EPA, and whether the state had the legal authority or resources to intervene in energy facility operations.  
   - **Energy Independence:** The concept of energy independence was heavily debated, with some arguing it was unrealistic for New Hampshire, given its reliance on regional energy grids and imported resources.  
   - **Protectionism vs. Market Dynamics:** Critics of the bills argued that the proposed legislation could interfere with market-driven changes in the energy sector, particularly the transition to cleaner energy sources.  
   - **Energy Generation Mix:** Data presented during the meeting highlighted that nuclear and natural gas are the primary sources of electricity in New Hampshire, while wind and solar contribute a much smaller percentage.  

### **Administrative Updates and Future Plans**  
The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and administrative updates, including a planned trip to ISO New England on March 15, 2024, and discussions about potential presentations from the Department of Energy (DOE) and other entities. The committee adjourned without setting additional meeting dates but expressed intent to continue discussions in future sessions.

### **Closing Remarks**  
The meeting concluded with plans for further engagement with the Department of Energy and Environmental Services. Committee members expressed varying opinions on the amendments and bills, with some supporting the changes for added flexibility and others cautioning against potential instability in energy programs. The discussions underscored the complexity of balancing state sovereignty, regulatory oversight, and market dynamics in shaping New Hampshire’s energy future.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to refine energy-related legislation, ensure cost-effectiveness, protect in-state energy generation, and provide clarity in state energy policy.
