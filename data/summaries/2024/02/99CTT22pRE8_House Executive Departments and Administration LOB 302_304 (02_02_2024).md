The transcript captures a New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee work session focused on **House Bill 1466**, which addresses emergency funding for towns dealing with disasters. Key points discussed include:

1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill aims to streamline the process for towns to access state emergency funds quickly after a disaster, bypassing lengthy federal FEMA procedures. This would allow towns to address immediate needs, such as repairing roads, without waiting for federal reimbursement.

2. **Current Challenges**: Towns often face delays in accessing FEMA funds, which can take years to arrive. Additionally, the process of obtaining loans or grants is cumbersome, requiring special town meetings and approvals, which can take months.

3. **Proposed Solution**: The bill suggests allowing towns to directly request grants from the stateâ€™s emergency management fund through the fiscal committee. This would provide immediate financial assistance (e.g., $50,000-$100,000) to address urgent issues while the town navigates the longer FEMA process.

4. **Fiscal Committee Role**: The fiscal committee oversees appropriations and can reallocate funds. The discussion explored how the committee could manage this new process, ensuring towns receive timely support without disrupting existing funding mechanisms.

5. **Concerns and Considerations**: There were concerns about how state-funded emergency work might impact FEMA reimbursements. The committee discussed the need for clarity on whether temporary repairs funded by the state would disqualify towns from receiving federal funds for permanent repairs.

6. **Emergency Management Perspective**: Representatives from the Department of Safety and Emergency Management emphasized the increasing frequency of disasters and the need for more flexible funding mechanisms. They also highlighted the challenges of managing multiple open disasters and the lengthy FEMA reimbursement process.

7. **Next Steps**: The subcommittee agreed to work on simplifying the language of the bill to make the process more straightforward. They also considered whether to recommend the bill for further study or send it to the finance committee for detailed funding discussions.

Overall, the discussion centered on creating a more efficient and responsive system for towns to access emergency funds, particularly in the face of increasing natural disasters and the limitations of federal aid.
