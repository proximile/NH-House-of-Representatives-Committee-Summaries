The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court met on February 5, 2024, to discuss **House Bill 1263**, which focuses on **parenting coordinators** in family court cases. The committee aimed to refine the bill before its execution, particularly addressing issues related to **domestic violence (DV) training**, **parenting coordinator roles**, and **funding mechanisms**. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Parenting Coordinators and Domestic Violence Training**:
   - The committee debated the need for parenting coordinators to receive specific training in domestic violence, as this is a critical area of concern in high-conflict cases. Some states, like New Jersey, already require such training.
   - There was discussion about whether DV cases should be excluded from parenting coordinator involvement, with concerns raised about potential risks. However, the committee leaned toward allowing survivors the choice to use parenting coordinators if both parties agree.

2. **Agreement and Reporting**:
   - The bill proposes that both parties must agree to use a parenting coordinator and must also agree on the coordinator’s report before it is submitted to the judge. This was a sticking point, as some attorneys expressed concerns that parties might not agree, rendering the process ineffective.
   - The committee considered whether the report should still go to the judge even if parties don’t agree, but feedback from family law attorneys suggested that requiring agreement ensures parties participate in good faith.

3. **Funding and Data Collection**:
   - The committee discussed the possibility of using the **mediation and arbitration fund** to cover parenting coordinator costs, though this would likely be limited to special cases.
   - There was a strong emphasis on collecting data to evaluate the effectiveness of parenting coordinators, including how often parties agree to use them and how often they agree to the final report. The court would need to track this data, which could require additional staffing resources.

4. **Guardian ad Litem (GAL) Comparison**:
   - The committee compared parenting coordinators to GALs, noting that GALs are underutilized due to lack of funding and are often attorney-based rather than psychology-focused. There was a suggestion to revisit GAL funding in the future, especially during the next budget cycle.

5. **Immunity for Parenting Coordinators**:
   - The committee discussed granting immunity to parenting coordinators for actions taken in good faith, similar to protections for judges and attorneys. This would encourage professionals to take on the role without fear of litigation.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee agreed to refine the bill, adding DV training requirements and removing the option for the court to confirm a parenting coordinator if one party objects.
   - They also planned to collect data on the effectiveness of parenting coordinators and revisit the issue of GAL funding in future legislative sessions.

The meeting concluded with the committee agreeing to draft the proposed changes and vote on them in a full committee session. The goal is to provide families with additional tools to resolve disputes while ensuring the process is fair and effective.
