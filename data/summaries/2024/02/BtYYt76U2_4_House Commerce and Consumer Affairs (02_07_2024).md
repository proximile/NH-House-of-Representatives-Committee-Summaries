### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

#### **1. Regulatory Sandbox for Financial Technology (Fintech) Services (House Bill 1507)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes the creation of a regulatory sandbox to allow fintech companies to test innovative financial products and services in a controlled environment with relaxed regulations, fostering innovation and attracting businesses to New Hampshire.
- **Concerns Raised**:
  - **Consumer Protection**: Questions were raised about handling consumer complaints, ensuring clear disclosures, and assigning liability in case of failures or breaches.
  - **Regulatory Oversight**: The banking commissioner expressed concerns about the department’s capacity to oversee products outside its expertise (e.g., securities) and the lack of clarity on coordination with other state agencies.
  - **Funding and Resources**: The banking department highlighted the need for additional staff and resources, noting the bill lacks a fiscal note.
  - **Effectiveness**: Some legislators questioned the necessity of a sandbox, arguing that New Hampshire’s accessible legislature and banking department already facilitate innovation.
- **Support**: Proponents, including **Americans for Prosperity**, argued the sandbox would position New Hampshire as a fintech leader and address regulatory gaps as technology evolves. They cited 14 other states with similar frameworks.
- **Neutral Stance**: The banking commissioner remained neutral on the concept but raised concerns about the bill’s drafting, procedural issues, and the need for stronger consumer protections.
