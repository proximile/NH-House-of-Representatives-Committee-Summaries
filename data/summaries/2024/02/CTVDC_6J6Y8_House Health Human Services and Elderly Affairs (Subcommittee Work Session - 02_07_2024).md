The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened a work session on **HB 1303** on February 7, 2024. The bill pertains to the distribution of funds from the intestate estate of a deceased individual, **Teest Banu**. The committee discussed amendments to allocate these funds to organizations supporting refugee and immigrant communities in New Hampshire.

### Key Points:
1. **Amendment Proposals**:
   - **Representative Weber** proposed amendments to distribute funds to **The International Institute of New England** and **Centria**, organizations aiding refugee settlement. Two options were presented: allocating all funds to The International Institute or splitting them equally between the two organizations.
   - **Representative Missour** suggested adding **Roa Kids of Manchester**, a nonprofit supporting refugee children, as a third recipient. She highlighted their impactful work, including providing meals, educational support, and safe spaces for refugee families.

2. **Final Agreement**:
   - The committee agreed to divide the funds equally among **Centria**, **The International Institute of New England**, and **Roa Kids of Manchester** (one-third to each).

3. **Legal and Administrative Considerations**:
   - The committee aimed to avoid violating existing court orders or creating new bureaucratic structures. The funds would be appropriated directly to the organizations without disrupting state budgets.
   - The amendment would be forwarded to the Finance Committee for final approval.

4. **Committee Support**:
   - Representative Missour emphasized the importance of supporting refugee families, particularly children, and praised the work of the proposed organizations.
   - The Department of Health and Human Services expressed support for the amendment, noting it would maximize the impact of the funds.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The subcommittee voted to recommend the amendment, which will be formally drafted and submitted for further legislative review.

The meeting concluded with gratitude for the committeeâ€™s collaborative efforts and adjourned.
