The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee meeting on February 9, 2024, centered on discussions of various bills aimed at reforming the state's professional licensing and regulatory framework. The meeting addressed several key themes, including the transition of regulatory boards to advisory roles, the reduction of workforce barriers, and the streamlining of board structures to improve efficiency and representation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Regulatory to Advisory Board Transitions**
A recurring theme across multiple segments was the transition of various professional licensing boards from regulatory to advisory roles. This shift is intended to reduce legal liabilities for board members, streamline rule-making processes, and address antitrust concerns. Specific boards discussed for this transition included acupuncture, massage therapy, reflexology, midwifery, and nursing home administrators. The transition would shift rule-making authority from the boards to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), with boards serving in a consultative capacity. Public feedback on this change has been positive, with improved responsiveness from state bodies noted.

---

### **Workforce Barriers and Public Safety**
Several bills included language aimed at "eliminating workforce barriers," which sparked debate among committee members. Some argued that this language was unnecessary and could hinder the bills' passage, while others emphasized its importance in removing unnecessary licensing hurdles that do not directly protect public safety. The discussion highlighted the need to balance public safety with avoiding anti-competitive practices, ensuring that licensing requirements are tied to genuine safety concerns rather than serving as barriers to market entry.

### **Board Composition and Representation**
The committee extensively debated the composition and representation of various boards, particularly the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) Advisory Board and the Board of Acupuncture Licensing. Key points included:
- **GAL Board**: The proposal to reduce the board from nine to three members raised concerns about oversight and complaint management. Suggestions included increasing the board to five members and ensuring representation from agencies like the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) and Casey Family Services. The inclusion of a public member with experience in the foster care system was also proposed.
- **Acupuncture Board**: Concerns were raised about the lack of representation for Acupuncture Detoxification Specialists (ADS), who serve unique populations. The transition to an advisory board included discussions about retaining a public member or shifting this role to the OPLC.

---

### **Merging Professional Boards**
The committee reviewed proposals to merge certain professional boards to improve efficiency and reduce redundancy:
- **Board of Land Surveyors and Board of Professional Engineers (HB 1286)**: The proposed merger faced opposition from land surveyors, who feared being overshadowed by engineers. Concerns about workload and representation led the subcommittee to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).
- **Board of Podiatry and Board of Medicine (HB 1285)**: The merger proposal raised concerns about workload disparities and the backlog of cases in the Board of Medicine. The subcommittee did not vote on the bill but noted the need for further study.

---

### **Workload and Efficiency**
Across all discussions, concerns about workload and efficiency were prominent. Merging boards or transitioning to advisory roles could increase the workload for volunteer members, particularly in smaller professions like land surveyors and podiatrists. Recent statutory changes, such as no longer requiring boards to review license applications, have reduced workloads, but further reforms could complicate processes. The committee emphasized the need for caution and further study before implementing mergers or transitions.

---

### **Legal and Financial Liability**
The transition to advisory boards was seen as a way to protect board members from personal financial liability and reduce legal risks for the state. Past legal challenges faced by regulatory boards were cited as a key reason for this shift. Advisory boards provide recommendations to state bodies, addressing antitrust concerns more effectively and ensuring rules are aligned with public safety rather than industry interests.

---

### **Procedural and Language Adjustments**
The committee worked on refining the language of several bills to ensure clarity and consistency. Amendments included removing or modifying contentious phrases like "eliminate workforce barriers" and replacing references to "board" with "executive director" where appropriate. The committee also discussed the importance of maintaining flexibility in language to accommodate future changes in organizational structures.

---

### **Next Steps**
The committee agreed to continue reviewing and refining the bills, with a focus on ensuring balanced representation, efficient processes, and clear language. Follow-up meetings were scheduled to finalize amendments and address unresolved issues, particularly regarding the GAL Board and the transition of specific professional boards to advisory roles.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Advisory Board Transition**: Emphasized as a way to reduce liability, streamline rule-making, and address antitrust concerns.
2. **Workforce Barriers**: Debated as a means to promote efficiency while ensuring public safety.
3. **Board Composition**: Focused on fair representation, workload management, and oversight.
4. **Mergers and Efficiency**: Cautioned against hasty mergers, with a focus on balancing efficiency and representation.
5. **Legal Protections**: Transition to advisory roles seen as a way to protect board members and the state from legal risks.

The meeting concluded with motions to recommend certain bills for passage, pending further review and amendments, reflecting the committee's commitment to thoughtful and balanced regulatory reform.
