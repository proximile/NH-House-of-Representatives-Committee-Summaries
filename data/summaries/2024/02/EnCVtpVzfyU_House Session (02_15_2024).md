He emphasized the state’s economic growth, low unemployment, and successful initiatives in mental health, education, and opioid crisis management. The Governor also discussed the importance of housing, workforce development, and maintaining fiscal responsibility.

### Legislative Business and Key Debates
The session featured extensive debates and votes on numerous bills, with some of the most notable discussions centered around education, child welfare, and state governance:

1. **HB 1212-FN-L**: This bill aimed to expand eligibility for free school meals to 350% of the federal poverty level. Supporters argued it would help low- to middle-income families, while opponents raised concerns about costs and federal program inefficiencies. After multiple motions and roll call votes, the bill ultimately passed.

2. **HB 1419-FN**: This bill sought to prohibit obscene or harmful sexual materials in schools. Proponents argued it protects children from inappropriate content, while opponents claimed it could lead to censorship and undermine local decision-making. The bill underwent extensive debate, with motions to table, reconsider, and indefinitely postpone. It was eventually indefinitely postponed.

3. **HB 1524**: This bill proposed allowing parents of special education students to observe their children in the classroom. Supporters argued it promotes transparency and parental involvement, while opponents noted existing policies already address this. The bill passed in a division vote.

4. **HB 1652-FN**: This bill would enable school districts to create local taxpayer-funded education freedom accounts for students to use for private or alternative education. Supporters emphasized local control and parental choice, while opponents criticized it as a subsidy for private education and a burden on taxpayers. The bill was debated extensively but no final vote was recorded in the transcript.

5. **HB 1677-FN**: Various motions and votes were taken, with some bills passing Ought to Pass (OTP) and others being tabled or reconsidered.

6. **HB 1152**: This bill to allow the mental health flag to be flown at the State House was discussed, with concerns raised about logistics and potential for similar requests.

7. **HB 1219**: A bill to create a commission for studying the feasibility of a legislative office for cost-benefit analysis was debated and ultimately deemed inexpedient to legislate.

8. **HB 1363-FN**: This bill allowing members of the general court to participate in the Department of Health and Human Services employee assistance program was debated and passed OTP.

### Resolutions and Other Bills
1. **HCR 8**: A resolution applying to Congress for a limited national convention to propose a constitutional amendment on elections was tabled.

2. **HCR 11**: A resolution condemning medically unnecessary restrictions on medication abortion was debated and passed OTP after a roll call vote. This led to passionate debates about reproductive rights, the safety of abortion medications, and the role of the legislature in such issues.

3. **HR 19**: A resolution calling for the repeal of the Jones Act, which restricts shipping between U.S. ports, was debated but not passed. Proponents highlighted its impact on national security and job creation, while opponents argued it increases costs and inefficiencies.

### Points of Order and Parliamentary Inquiries
