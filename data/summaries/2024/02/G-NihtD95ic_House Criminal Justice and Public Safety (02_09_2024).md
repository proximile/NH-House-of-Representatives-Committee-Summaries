#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 1658 - Mental Health and Law Enforcement Coordination**  
   - **Karen Rosenberg**, Policy Director at the Disability Rights Center of NH, opposed the bill, arguing it would compromise mental health confidentiality and violate federal laws like HIPAA. She emphasized the need for voluntary information-sharing systems and better law enforcement training for mental health crises.  
   - **Representative Kelly Penza** shared a personal story about the challenges of coordinating mental health care with law enforcement, underscoring the need for improved communication to support individuals with mental health issues.  
   - **Cynthia Babonis** of New Hampshire Hospital noted that the bill's current wording may not effectively address the need for law enforcement awareness of individuals under mental health commitments.

2. **HB 1527 - The Purple Paint Bill**  
   - **Ellen Reed**, the bill's sponsor, proposed allowing landowners to use purple paint as an alternative to "No Trespassing" signs, citing its durability and cost-effectiveness.  
   - **Supporters**, including **Joan O'Brien**, highlighted the challenges of maintaining traditional signs and the benefits of a tamper-proof option.  
   - **Opponents**, such as **Representative David Love** and **Rob Johnson** of the NH Farm Bureau, raised concerns about potential confusion, the durability of paint, and the risk of unauthorized individuals marking property. They argued that the current system promotes communication and open access to land.

3. **HB 1566 - Independent Investigations of Police Misconduct**  
   - **Representative Ralph B.** introduced the bill to allow independent reviews of local police investigations, citing cases like the Derry motorcycle accident where public distrust arose due to perceived bias.  
   - A mother whose daughter died in the accident testified about her frustration with the lack of transparency in the investigation.  
   - **Chief Alan Aldenberg** of the NH Association of Chiefs of Police opposed the bill, arguing it would strain State Police resources and that existing mechanisms (e.g., the Public Integrity Unit) already address misconduct concerns.  
   - **Matthew Broadhead** of the DOJ raised technical issues with the bill, suggesting revisions to align with existing laws.  
   - The committee discussed refining the bill to focus on cases with clear conflicts of interest rather than broadly enabling independent investigations.

4. **HB 1528 - Northern Border Alliance Reporting**  
   - **Representative Alexander Murray** introduced the bill to enhance reporting requirements for the Northern Border Alliance program, including data on arrests, citations, and field stops.  
   - **Devon Chaffy** of the ACLU of NH supported the bill, citing the lack of New Hampshire-specific data on border crossings and questioning the program's justification.  
   - **Christine Wellington** of the NH Immigrants Rights Network emphasized the importance of data collection to monitor potential racial profiling.  
   - The committee debated the necessity of collecting race and ethnicity data, with some arguing it was essential for transparency and others deeming it unnecessary.

5. **Firearm Background Checks and Restraining Orders**  
   - The committee discussed a bill addressing firearm background checks and the process for returning firearms after a restraining order expires.  
   - The bill was amended to allow the state police to provide additional information to judges rather than being strictly bound to issue a "proceed" letter.  
   - Concerns were raised about loopholes in the current system, where expired restraining orders are no longer in the background check system.  
   - The committee emphasized the need for clear timelines and due process in returning firearms while protecting victims and law enforcement.

6. **HB 1197 - Fingerprint Collection and Task Force**  
   - The committee discussed an amendment to delay the effective date of changes to fingerprint collection until June 30, 2025, to align with the budget cycle.  
   - A task force was proposed to oversee the implementation of uniform fingerprint collection processes across state agencies.  
   - The **Department of Health and Human Services** expressed concerns about resource allocation, while the **Department of Safety** supported the amendment.  
   - The committee unanimously recommended the amendment, noting it provides a structured approach to improving fingerprint collection.

7. **Border Security and Racial Profiling**  
   - The committee revisited the Northern Border Alliance program, debating the necessity of collecting race and ethnicity data to assess potential racial profiling.  
   - Some representatives argued that country of origin data was sufficient, while others stressed the importance of comprehensive data for informed decision-making.
