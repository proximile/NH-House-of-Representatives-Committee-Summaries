**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting (Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee) on February 6, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 6, 2024, to discuss a range of issues related to cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco regulation. The meeting was divided into three key segments, each focusing on different legislative priorities and regulatory challenges.

### **Cannabis Regulation and Market Dynamics**
The first segment centered on the complexities of cannabis regulation, including possession limits, retail licensing, and market structure. Key discussions included:
1. **Possession Limits and Annulment**: Legislators emphasized the need for precise language in defining possession limits to avoid legal loopholes and ensure clarity.
2. **Retail Outlets and Franchise Model**: The proposal to limit the number of cannabis retail outlets to 15 sparked debate, with concerns about market demand, monopolies, and the potential for a secondary market for licenses. The franchise model was scrutinized for its implications on fair competition and profit distribution.
3. **Lobbying and Campaign Contributions**: The absence of restrictions on lobbying and campaign donations related to cannabis businesses was debated, with some arguing that addressing market fairness would reduce the need for such restrictions.
4. **Licensing and Market Clearing**: Proposals included establishing a board to periodically review and adjust the number of retail outlets to meet market demand without creating a secondary license market. Concerns were raised about industry capture of such boards.
5. **Transfer of Licenses**: The transferability of licenses was discussed, with fears of creating a "medallion" system akin to New York City’s taxi medallions, where licenses could be sold at a premium.
6. **Casino Owners and Cannabis Outlets**: Concerns were raised about casino owners potentially owning cannabis outlets, though this issue was deemed outside the scope of the current bill.
7. **Next Steps**: The committee postponed further action on the bill for a week to allow for additional discussions and amendments, with a subcommittee meeting scheduled for the following week.

### **Alcohol and Tobacco Regulations**
The second segment focused on bills related to alcohol and tobacco, with the following highlights:
1. **HB 1582**: This bill sought to allow alcohol consumption in artist performance areas (e.g., stages) and clarify venue rules. Testimony from venue owners and performers highlighted the need for regulatory clarity to avoid excessive fines or license revocations. The Liquor Commission suggested technical adjustments to align the bill with existing statutes.
2. **HB 1151**: This bill proposed allowing hotel guests to carry alcoholic drinks from the hotel bar to their rooms, aligning with practices in other states. The Liquor Commission supported the bill but emphasized preventing alcohol consumption in unauthorized areas.
3. **HB 1591**: This bill aimed to regulate synthetic nicotine products, requiring licenses for their sale and restricting purchases to individuals over 21. It also proposed moving fines and penalties for tobacco violations from statute to administrative rules for greater enforcement flexibility. Discussions addressed counterfeit vaping products and the need for clearer regulations.

### **Cannabis and Public Health Initiatives**
The third segment focused on cannabis-related substances and public health messaging:
1. **Regulation of Delta 8 and Delta 9**: Legislators highlighted the lack of regulation on labeling and age restrictions for Delta 8 and Delta 9 products, advocating for their sale only through licensed, age-restricted facilities.
2. **Cannabis Legalization and Sunset Provisions**: Concerns were raised about meeting the sunset provision deadline for cannabis regulation, with calls for amendments to ensure equal treatment of all cannabis-related products.
3. **Public Consumption and Penalties**: Stricter penalties for public cannabis smoking were proposed, including more severe consequences for repeat offenses.
4. **Data Collection and Reporting**: The Department of Health and Human Services was tasked with collecting and publishing non-identifiable data on health and welfare outcomes before and after cannabis legalization, with biennial reports.
5. **Liquor Commission’s Role**: The Liquor Commission proposed a public health initiative to create educational commercials about alcohol use disorder, funded by a NAPA grant and developed with industry partners.
6. **Receipt Messaging**: While placing educational messages on liquor store receipts was considered, it was deemed less effective due to space limitations and the likelihood of receipts being discarded.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges of regulating emerging markets like cannabis while balancing public health, safety, and business interests. Key themes included the need for precise language in legislation, preventing monopolies, ensuring fair competition, and addressing regulatory loopholes. The committee’s focus on data collection and public health initiatives reflects a broader commitment to evidence-based policymaking and responsible consumption practices. Further discussions and amendments are expected as the committee continues to refine these proposals.
