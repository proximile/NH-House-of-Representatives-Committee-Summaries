**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (February 21, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee met on February 21, 2024, to discuss several bills related to animal welfare, dog ownership, and public safety. The meeting focused on balancing the needs of animal welfare, public health, and owner responsibilities, with significant debates on dog licensing, vicious dogs, rabies vaccination, and exotic animal ownership. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **1. Dog Licensing and Fees**
- **HB 1501 (Eliminating Annual Dog Licensing)**: The committee debated a bill proposing to eliminate the annual $7 dog licensing fee, requiring only a one-time registration. Supporters argued that the fee is burdensome, particularly for low-income families, and that rabies vaccinations can be managed privately. Opponents, including the American Kennel Club, emphasized the importance of annual licensing for tracking ownership changes, ensuring rabies vaccinations, and funding critical programs like spay/neuter initiatives, the state’s Diagnostic Lab, and animal control services. Concerns were raised about the potential loss of funding for public health and animal welfare programs if licensing requirements were removed.

### **2. Vicious Dogs and Penalties**
- **HB 1173 (Penalties for Vicious Dogs)**: This bill, introduced by Representative David Rochford, sought to address repeated attacks by vicious dogs by imposing strict penalties: $25 for the first offense, $100 for the second offense, and $400 for subsequent offenses within 12 months. It also mandated euthanasia after two incidents. The bill was inspired by a case where a dog repeatedly attacked another dog, causing severe injuries. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and the American Kennel Club, criticized the bill for its inflexibility and lack of due process, arguing that existing laws already address dangerous dogs and provide judicial discretion. Concerns were raised about the potential unfair impact on working dogs (e.g., police dogs, livestock guardian dogs) and the need to consider circumstances like provocation or self-defense. Alternatives, such as muzzling or behavior modification classes, were suggested instead of immediate euthanasia.

### **3. Rabies Vaccination and Exemptions**
- **HB 1556 (Rabies Vaccination Exemptions)**: This bill aimed to loosen requirements for rabies vaccination exemptions, particularly for dogs with health conditions that make vaccination risky. It proposed removing the muzzle requirement for exempted dogs and reducing the need for multiple veterinary approvals. Supporters argued that muzzling sick or elderly dogs is burdensome and unnecessary, while opponents expressed concerns about public safety, emphasizing that rabies is a fatal disease and strict protocols are necessary to prevent its spread. The committee heard extensive testimony, with most speakers opposing the bill due to public health risks.

### **4. Exotic Animal Ownership**
- **HB 1325 (Private Ownership of Exotic Animals)**: The committee discussed a bill allowing private ownership of exotic animals like small-tailed monkeys, raccoons, foxes, otters, skunks, and kangaroos. Representative Howard and others criticized the bill as frivolous, raising concerns about practicality, public safety, and animal welfare. The committee moved to kill the bill, citing the potential risks and ethical issues associated with private ownership of exotic animals.

---

### **5. Co-Ownership of Dogs**
- **HB 1316 (Co-Ownership of Dogs)**: This bill addressed the co-ownership of dogs, particularly in the context of doggy daycares. The legislation aimed to define co-ownership to prevent individuals from using it as a loophole to operate dog daycare centers without proper permits. Representative McKenzie proposed an amendment to clarify the definition of co-ownership and ensure that co-owners have genuine responsibilities for the dogs. The committee discussed the challenges of defining co-ownership and the potential misuse of the term to bypass zoning regulations. Suggestions included requiring notarized documents or legal proof of co-ownership to prevent abuse of the concept.

---

### **6. Animal Abuse Offender Registry**
- **HB 55 (Animal Abuse Offender Registry)**: The committee debated a bill establishing an animal abuse offender registry. There was discussion about the bill’s effectiveness and whether it met the sponsor’s intent. Suggestions were made to better support Animal Control Officers and consider the creation of an animal court to address animal abuse cases more effectively.

---

### **7. Humane Pest Control**
- **HB 1351 (Prohibiting Adhesive-Based Rodent Traps)**: The committee discussed a bill banning the sale and use of glue traps for rodents. Opinions were divided, with some arguing for the necessity of such traps in controlling rodent populations, particularly in agriculture, and others advocating for more humane alternatives. Representative Duty supported the bill, emphasizing the need for innovation in pest control.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Public Health and Safety**: The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining strict rabies vaccination protocols and ensuring that dog licensing supports public health initiatives and animal control services.
2. **Flexibility and Due Process**: Stakeholders advocated for judicial discretion in handling dangerous dog cases, rather than imposing strict liability or mandatory euthanasia.
3. **Funding and Animal Welfare**: The committee highlighted the critical role of dog licensing fees in funding spay/neuter programs, animal control, and public health initiatives.
4. **Clarity and Enforcement**: Discussions on co-ownership and exotic animal ownership underscored the need for clear definitions and regulations to prevent misuse and ensure public safety.
5. **Humane Practices**: The committee explored humane alternatives for pest control and debated the ethical implications of owning exotic animals.

The meeting concluded with the committee recognizing the complexity of these issues and the need for further research and discussion to refine the proposed legislation. The focus remained on balancing animal welfare, public health, and owner responsibilities while ensuring practical and enforceable regulations.
