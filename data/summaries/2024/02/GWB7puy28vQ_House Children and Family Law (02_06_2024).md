### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Children and Family Law (February 6, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 6, 2024, to discuss and vote on several bills related to children and family law. The meeting focused on improving child welfare, enhancing oversight of residential placements, reforming child support systems, and addressing family court processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Residential Placements and Oversight (House Bill 1573)**
The meeting extensively debated **House Bill 1573**, which aims to strengthen oversight and certification of residential treatment programs for children, particularly in response to the **Bledsoe Youth Academy scandal** in Tennessee. Key points included:

1. **Certification vs. Contracting**:
   - The **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)** argued that **certification** is sufficient for ensuring safety and quality, emphasizing that the process is rigorous and legally binding. They opposed universal **contracting**, citing bureaucratic delays that could harm children with specialized needs.
   - The **Office of the Child Advocate (OCA)** advocated for **contracting**, arguing it provides stronger legal accountability and oversight, especially in cases involving restraint and seclusion practices.

2. **Bledsoe Scandal**:
   - The OCA detailed appalling conditions at the Bledsoe facility, including abuse, neglect, and unsafe practices. Despite being certified by New Hampshire, the facility failed to meet basic care standards, highlighting the need for stricter oversight.

3. **Placement Crisis**:
   - New Hampshire faces a shortage of in-state placements, leading to children being sent out of state. The bill encourages community-based alternatives and proposes reallocating funds from out-of-state placements to support local services.

4. **Amendments and Vote**:
   - Two amendments were proposed: one by DHHS (focused on certification) and one by the OCA (focused on contracting). The DHHS amendment passed unanimously (15-0), and the amended bill also passed unanimously.

### **Child Support Reforms**
Several bills addressed child support systems, focusing on accountability, fairness, and federal compliance:

1. **House Bill 1180 (Child Support Delinquencies)**:
   - The bill proposed improving notification processes for obligors (parents owing child support) before reporting delinquencies to federal programs like the passport denial program.
   - Concerns were raised about the 10-day notice period being too short and the potential for minor delinquencies to result in severe consequences (e.g., passport denial for a $5 delinquency).
   - The bill was voted **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)** due to concerns about federal compliance and lack of evidence of widespread issues.

2. **House Bills 1564 and 1595 (Child Support Guidelines)**:
   - **HB 1564** focused on shared parenting time, while **HB 1595** proposed a broader formulaic adjustment to child support guidelines.
   - Both bills passed, with **HB 1564** receiving unanimous support (13-0) and **HB 1595** passing with a close vote (7-6).

3. **House Bill 1425 (Driver’s License Suspension)**:
   - The committee debated the financial impact of removing the ability to suspend driver’s licenses for non-payment of child support, as it could jeopardize federal funding.
   - The bill was voted **ITL** (13-0).

### **Family Court and Child Welfare Reforms**
The committee addressed several bills aimed at improving family court processes and child welfare systems:

1. **House Bill 1266 (Recording Family Court Proceedings)**:
   - The bill permits recordings of open Family Court proceedings, with restrictions on private communications and bench conferences.
   - It passed with a vote of 8-6, despite concerns about potential misuse and domestic violence implications.

2. **House Bill 1111 (Child Abuse Reporting)**:
   - An amendment removed civil or criminal immunity for mandatory reporters who knowingly fail to report suspected child abuse or neglect. It also added provisions for reporting with malice or intent to harm.
   - The amendment passed narrowly (8-7), and the amended bill also passed (8-7).

3. **House Bill 106 (Parenting Time Terminology)**:
   - An amendment changed terminology from "visitation" to "parenting time" to streamline court processes and avoid backlogs.
   - The bill passed unanimously (14-0).

### **Other Key Discussions and Votes**
1. **House Bill 1667 (Separating DCYF from DHHS)**:
   - The bill proposed establishing a separate Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) outside DHHS. Concerns about cost and lack of benefits led to the bill being voted **ITL** (13-0).

2. **House Bill 1282 (Child Support Obligations)**:
   - An amendment clarified when child support obligations end, particularly for children with disabilities. The bill passed unanimously (13-0).

3. **House Bill 1511 (Interagency Communication)**:
   - The bill ensures communication between DHHS and the Department of Education regarding court orders. It passed unanimously (13-0).

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Child Welfare**: A shared commitment to improving the safety and quality of residential care for children, with debates over the best methods (certification vs. contracting) to achieve this.
- **Accountability**: Enhanced oversight and reporting processes for child support and residential treatment programs, with a focus on legal accountability and transparency.
- **Federal Compliance**: Balancing state legislation with federal requirements, particularly in child support reporting and funding.
