The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Public Works and Highways Committee met on February 6, 2024, to discuss and vote on several bills. The session began with a brief recess for caucusing, followed by the consideration of five bills:

1. **House Bill 1547**: This bill proposed requiring mileage-based exit numbers on Tier 1 highways. After discussion, the committee voted 19-0 to move the bill to interim study, citing funding concerns and the need for further financial planning.

2. **House Bill 1488**: This bill addressed hazard mitigation funding. The committee voted 19-0 to move it to interim study, as it was an off-budget cycle request and required more thorough examination of costs.

3. **House Bill 1043**: This bill involved capital appropriations for the legislative parking garage design. A technical amendment was approved, and the bill passed 19-0 with the amendment.

4. **House Bill 1379**: This bill dealt with yard debris and roadside vegetation. The committee voted 19-0 to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, citing enforcement concerns.

5. **House Bill 1253**: This bill proposed renaming the Blair State Forest in Campton to the Jane Kellogg State Forest. The committee voted 19-0 to deem the bill inexpedient to legislate, noting the state's historical practice of not renaming state forests and the opposition from the state agency responsible for the forest.

The meeting concluded with administrative announcements and plans for future discussions, including an amendment related to the Conway Branch rail line.
