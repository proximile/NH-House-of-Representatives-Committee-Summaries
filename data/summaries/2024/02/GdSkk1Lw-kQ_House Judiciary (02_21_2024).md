The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on February 21, 2024, to discuss and debate several significant bills, addressing a range of complex and contentious issues. The meeting highlighted debates over individual rights, public safety, economic considerations, and legal frameworks. Below is a consolidated summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **House Bill 1002 (Right-to-Know Law Amendments)**
The committee revisited this bill, which aims to address the burden of large or excessive public records requests. Key points included:
- **Amendment Discussion**: Representative Katab proposed an amendment to allow municipalities to seek relief from the Ombudsman for burdensome requests, particularly those exceeding 10 hours of work. Concerns were raised about potential abuse by activists and the impact on everyday citizens.
- **Commercial Use and Vexatious Requests**: The bill proposes charging fees for commercial use requests and denying vexatious requests. Amendments were discussed to clarify definitions and exempt media organizations.
- **Ombudsman Role**: Concerns were raised about the Ombudsman’s capacity, as the position is set to sunset in 2025. Some suggested superior court as an alternative for handling commercial requests.
- **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on the bill, opting for further refinement and discussion.

### **House Bill 1283 (End-of-Life Options Act)**
This bill, which addresses assisted suicide, sparked significant debate:
- **Amendment Discussion**: Representative Smith proposed amendments to clarify the bill, including removing certain healthcare providers (e.g., PAs) from prescribing end-of-life medication and addressing concerns about coercion and oversight.
- **Concerns**: Representative Perez raised issues about safeguards, the definition of “peaceful death,” the use of telehealth, and the validity of a UNH poll cited in support of the bill. She also proposed an amendment to repeal the Suicide Prevention Council, arguing that assisted suicide undermines suicide prevention efforts.
- **Outcome**: The committee delayed voting until March 6th to allow for further review and potential revisions.

### **House Bill 1037 (Firearms Manufacturer Liability)**
The committee debated this bill, which repeals immunity for firearms manufacturers, distributors, and dealers:
- **Interim Study Motion**: Representative Smith moved for interim study, citing the need for further discussion to find common ground. Supporters emphasized the importance of the firearms industry to New Hampshire’s economy.
- **Opposition**: Opponents argued that the firearms industry should not have blanket immunity and that the bill should be addressed directly.
- **Outcome**: The motion for interim study was seconded, and the committee proceeded to discuss it further.

### **House Bill 1664 (Legal Remedies for Detransitioners)**
This bill, which expands legal remedies for individuals who detransition after gender-affirming care, particularly minors, generated heated debate:
- **Focus on Minors**: Proponents argued that minors lack the cognitive ability to consent to life-altering medical procedures and may face unintended consequences later in life. The bill would extend the statute of limitations for minors to sue for medical malpractice related to gender-affirming care.
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including representatives from Dartmouth Health and the New Hampshire Medical Society, argued that the bill unfairly targets gender-affirming care providers and could discourage necessary care.
- **International Perspectives**: Testimony referenced international reviews from countries like Sweden and Finland, which have raised concerns about the long-term effects of puberty blockers and hormones.
- **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on the bill, opting for further discussion.

### **House Bill 1672 (Substance Use Disorder and Housing)**
This bill seeks to allow individuals who have completed substance use disorder treatment to live in Section 8 or public housing, even with a history of drug-related offenses:
- **Federal vs. State Law**: Concerns were raised about conflicts with federal housing regulations, which prohibit certain individuals from participating in Section 8 programs.
- **Enforcement and Oversight**: The bill would require the state to create a new enforcement mechanism, potentially leading to increased costs and administrative burdens.
- **Existing Flexibility**: Witnesses noted that current HUD regulations already allow for mitigating factors, such as completing rehabilitation programs, to be considered during eligibility screening.
- **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on the bill, opting for further discussion.

---

### **House Bill 1684 (Loss of Consortium Expansion)**
This bill aims to expand the definition of loss of consortium to include children and pets:
- **Proposed Changes**: The bill would extend loss of consortium claims beyond spouses to include damages for the loss of a child or pet.
- **Arguments in Favor**: Supporters argued that the loss of a child or pet can cause significant emotional harm, and current laws do not adequately address these damages.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including the American Kennel Club and State Farm, raised concerns about increased litigation and insurance premiums, particularly for veterinarians and other businesses.
- **Outcome**: The committee did not vote on the bill, opting for further refinement and discussion.

---

### **PFAS Statute of Limitations**
The committee discussed a bill to eliminate the statute of limitations for lawsuits related to PFAS contamination:
- **Support**: Some members supported the bill, citing the long-term health effects of PFAS.
- **Opposition**: Others argued it would create bad public policy and harm businesses.
- **Outcome**: The motion for interim study passed 14-6, delaying further action.
