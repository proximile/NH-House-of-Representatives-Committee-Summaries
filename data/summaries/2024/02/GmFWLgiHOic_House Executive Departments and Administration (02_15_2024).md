**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (02/15/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee held a subcommittee meeting on February 15, 2024, focusing on **House Bill 1271**, which addresses professional licensing and advisory board issues. The meeting also touched on future legislative work and procedural updates. Here are the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Professional Licensing and Advisory Board Reforms**
1. **Nursing Home Administrators Board**:
   - The committee discussed transitioning the Board of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators to an **advisory board**, which the board supports due to its small size and active involvement. The motion to retain this section in the bill passed unanimously (5-0).

2. **Septic System Evaluators**:
   - The role of septic system evaluators, who set standards and ensure compliance, was reviewed. The board has faced **quorum issues**, leading to canceled meetings. The motion to retain this section in the bill also passed without opposition.

3. **Guardian ad Litem Board**:
   - Amendments to the board included changes to its membership and duties. Concerns were raised about handling complaints during ongoing court proceedings. A proposed amendment allows complaints to be paused until court proceedings conclude, preventing the statute of limitations from expiring. The board’s role was clarified as advisory, with the executive director assuming responsibilities previously held by the board. The motion to adopt the proposed amendments, including language adjustments for consistency with existing statutes, passed unanimously.

4. **Manufactured Housing Installation Standards Board**:
   - The committee debated reducing the board’s size from nine to three members, with concerns about losing expertise and representation. Stakeholders from the manufactured housing industry expressed worries about the loss of representation for **owner operators** and **cooperative members**. The committee considered expanding the board to five or seven members to better represent diverse interests, including **installers**, **dealers**, **code enforcement officers**, and **residents** of manufactured housing parks. The final motion to reduce the board to five members and add language for consultation with the advisory board on appointments passed unanimously.

5. **Midwifery Board**:
   - The committee considered making the Midwifery Board an advisory board due to the small number of licensed midwives (around 30). The board’s composition was changed to three midwives, one obstetrician, and one pediatrician. The motion passed unanimously.

6. **Massage Therapy and Reflexology Boards**:
   - The committee discussed merging these two advisory boards, which already have over 200 licensed members. There was no opposition to the merger, and the motion to keep the section as is passed unanimously.

### **General Concerns and Themes**
- **Quorum and Term Limits**: Several boards faced quorum issues, and there were discussions about term limits for board members, with some arguing that long-serving members provide valuable expertise.
- **Representation and Expertise**: The committee emphasized the need to balance reducing board size with maintaining adequate representation and expertise, particularly for smaller or specialized professions.
- **Transparency and Workforce Participation**: Throughout the meeting, there was a focus on ensuring transparency, reducing barriers to workforce participation, and addressing legal and ethical concerns related to small boards regulating their own professions.

### **Procedural Updates and Future Work**
- The chair outlined the process for finalizing amendments and scheduling future meetings, emphasizing the need to complete work by **March 13th**. Members were asked to confirm their availability for additional sessions in early March.
- The subcommittee planned to address **House Bill 1408** next, another lengthy bill requiring attention. Members were encouraged to review it in advance.
- The meeting concluded with light-hearted conversation, including an announcement about a member’s sheep having triplets, and gratitude for participants’ engagement.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting focused on streamlining professional licensing processes, addressing quorum challenges, and preparing for upcoming legislative work. The committee emphasized the importance of consultation with advisory boards in decision-making processes and sought to balance reducing board size with maintaining representation and expertise. The motions to adopt changes to various boards passed unanimously, reflecting a collaborative effort to address stakeholders’ needs while aligning with legislative goals.
