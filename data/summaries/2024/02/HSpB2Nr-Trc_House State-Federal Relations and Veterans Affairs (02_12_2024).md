The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 12, 2024, to address key issues related to state-federal relations and veterans' affairs. The meeting was divided into two main segments: the introduction and deliberation of **Senate Bill 317**, which aims to establish a **New Hampshire-Ireland Trade Commission**, and discussions on **veteran suicide prevention** and **mental health services**. Below is a cohesive summary of the proceedings:

### **Segment 1: Senate Bill 317 – New Hampshire-Ireland Trade Commission**
1. **Introduction of SB 317**:  
   Representative Packard introduced **Senate Bill 317**, which seeks to strengthen trade relations between New Hampshire and Ireland. The bill proposes the creation of a New Hampshire-Ireland Trade Commission to expand economic cooperation and foster closer ties between the two regions. New Hampshire is currently the sixth-largest trading partner with Ireland, and the bill is described as straightforward and uncomplicated.

2. **Historical and Cultural Context**:  
   Representatives highlighted the long-standing historical and cultural connections between New Hampshire and Ireland, including early settlements and contributions during the Irish famine. Several representatives shared personal ties to Ireland, emphasizing the significance of the relationship.

3. **Trade and Economic Goals**:  
   While specific goods traded were not detailed, the commission’s primary objectives include increasing trade opportunities, enhancing economic cooperation, and deepening the relationship between New Hampshire and Ireland.

4. **Fiscal Impact**:  
   The fiscal impact of the bill is currently indeterminable, but it is expected to be self-funded, similar to the Canadian-American Trade Council, which operates on a minimal budget.

5. **Committee Vote and Consent Calendar**:  
   The committee unanimously voted **11-0** to recommend the bill for passage. It was moved to the consent calendar for consideration by the full House. There was a brief discussion about whether to pull it off the consent calendar to allow for floor debate, but no final decision was made.

He emphasized the importance of community coalitions and public health approaches to address veteran suicide.

3. **Statewide Collaborative Efforts**:
