**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (February 21, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 21, 2024, to discuss a range of legislative bills and amendments, primarily focused on condominium association regulations, liquor licensing, and alcohol-related consumer affairs. The meeting highlighted the committeeâ€™s collaborative approach, with members emphasizing the need for clarity, stakeholder input, and alignment with federal and industry standards.

### **Condominium Association Legislation**
The committee dedicated significant time to reviewing and amending bills related to condominium associations and their management. Key discussions included:

1. **HB 1172 (Condominium Time-Share Interests)**: The committee agreed to remove the word "only" from a section of the bill, as proposed by Representative Aly, to clarify language regarding condominium time-share interests.

2. **Voting Procedures**: The committee addressed voting requirements in condominium meetings, stressing that amendments must be deferred until the next properly noticed meeting and that all owners must receive proper notice.

3. **Special Assessments**: A proposed amendment to limit special assessments for capital expenditures exceeding 5% of the budgeted gross expenses without unit owner approval sparked debate. Concerns were raised about potential mismanagement by condominium boards, prompting a motion for an interim study to gather more data and stakeholder input.

4. **Management vs. Board Accountability**: Members emphasized that condominium boards, not management companies, are ultimately responsible for financial decisions. This distinction was central to discussions about oversight and governance.

5. **HB 1357 (Monthly Board Meetings)**: The committee briefly discussed a bill proposing mandatory monthly condominium board meetings. Members suggested that quarterly meetings might be more practical, though no final decision was made.

The committee unanimously approved motions related to these bills, underscoring the need for further analysis and stakeholder engagement before finalizing legislative changes.

### **Liquor Licensing and Alcohol Regulations**
The committee also addressed several bills and amendments related to liquor licensing and alcohol regulations:

1. **HB 1018 (Liquor Licensing Amendments)**: Confusion arose over amendment numbers and specific provisions, leading the committee to defer the discussion until the next meeting for clarification.

2. **HB 1076 (Manufacturing Licenses)**: The committee approved an amendment to allow beverage manufacturers to operate under the same statute as wine manufacturers, advancing the bill.

3. **HB 1151 (Hotel Alcohol Regulations)**: The committee debated allowing guests to carry alcoholic beverages within hotel premises. Concerns about approved areas for drinking, such as lobbies and green rooms, led to amendments restricting consumption in places like bathrooms and parking lots. The bill passed with these changes.

4. **HB 1380 (Extended Liquor Sales Hours)**: The committee discussed extending liquor sales hours from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM, with some members advocating for local town control. A compromise was reached, allowing towns to decide their own hours.

5. **HB 1582 (Brew Pub Regulations)**: The committee considered reducing the production limit for Brew Pubs from 5,000 to 2,500 gallons. The discussion was deferred for further amendment.

6. **HB 1624 (Home Distillation)**: The committee passed a bill allowing hobby distillation of liquor at home, with the understanding that selling distilled spirits would still require a license and be subject to taxation.

7. **HB 1591 (Delta-8 THC)**: The committee deferred discussion on the legality of Delta-8 THC, a synthetic THC derived from hemp, as the Senate is considering a related bill.

### **Additional Discussions**
The committee also touched on other topics, including:

1. **HB 1129 (Condo Association Proxy Voting)**: Technical discussions focused on amendments related to proxy voting in condo associations, particularly for time-share properties. The committee emphasized the need for precise language and legal alignment.

Throughout the meeting, committee members frequently sought input from stakeholders and legal experts to refine legislation. The discussions reflected a commitment to balancing consumer protection, industry needs, and regulatory clarity. The meeting concluded with unanimous approvals for several motions, paving the way for further review and refinement of the proposed bills.
