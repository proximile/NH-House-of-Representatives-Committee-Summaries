The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee meeting on **February 23, 2024**, addressed a wide range of critical healthcare and human services issues facing the state. The meeting highlighted challenges, ongoing initiatives, and future plans to improve service delivery, workforce retention, and access to care. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics discussed:

---

### **Staffing and Workforce Challenges**
The committee identified **staffing shortages** as a significant issue, particularly in the northern and western regions of New Hampshire. Challenges include recruitment, retention, and transportation barriers for both healthcare providers and individuals receiving services. To address these issues, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) issued **27 contracts** to support workforce initiatives, focusing on retention and recruitment strategies. A new request for grant awards is planned to encourage providers to develop creative solutions. Additionally, the committee discussed the **staffing levels of area agencies** and their ability to meet service demands, emphasizing the need to track not only funding but also the actual delivery of services.

### **Mental Health and Emergency Department (ED) Boarding Crisis**
Deputy Commissioner **Dr. Marissa Hen** provided an update on efforts to address the crisis of patients with psychiatric needs boarding in emergency departments due to a lack of inpatient psychiatric beds. She outlined three key drivers of the problem: **front door issues** (preventive care and community services), **inpatient bed supply and coordination**, and **back door issues** (discharge planning and housing). To tackle these challenges, the state has implemented six initiatives:
1. Expanding **Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs)**.
2. Increasing **crisis stabilization centers**.
3. Improving **care traffic control** (centralized bed coordination).
4. Expanding **Designated Receiving Facility (DRF) beds**.
5. Enhancing **back door services** (housing and support).
6. Providing **landlord incentives** to house individuals with mental illness.

Dr. Hen emphasized that while no single solution is a "silver bullet," these combined efforts aim to reduce and eventually eliminate ED boarding. The state is also developing a **public-facing data dashboard** to track progress and ensure transparency. The committee also discussed the **timeline for court-mandated compliance** on ED boarding, set for **May 2024**, and the importance of **data metrics** to monitor progress.

### **Medicaid and Dental Care**
The committee reviewed the **Medicaid adult dental program**, which has served nearly **11,000 unique members** since its launch in April 2023. The program has seen steady growth in claims and provider participation, with **160 unique providers** in 109 locations, including 21 oral surgeons and 44 border community providers. The program has also delivered **26 denture services** and is expanding its reach through **mobile dental clinics**, which have been well-received and are targeting areas with lower provider availability. The financial aspects of mobile dental clinics were also examined, including operating costs and the state’s role in covering these expenses.

Additionally, the committee discussed **Medicaid reimbursement rates**, which are currently at approximately **78% of commercial rates**, up from 48%. They also highlighted the importance of conducting **provider surveys** to gauge satisfaction and identify potential issues early.

### **Home and Community-Based Services**
The committee discussed the **New Hampshire Easy System**, which has expanded significantly to integrate Medicaid eligibility and extended services, making it a comprehensive resource for accessing benefits. A **pilot program** was also highlighted, assisting individuals aged 18-21 who are ineligible for developmental disabilities waivers due to being in school. The program supports six individuals, with four receiving residential services and two receiving enhanced in-home support, at a total cost of approximately **$545,000**.

### **Suicide Prevention and Child Fatality Review**
The committee addressed **suicide prevention**, noting that suffocation (primarily hanging) is the leading method of suicide among younger teens, while firearms are more common among older teens. The discussion emphasized the need for **early interventions** and **lethal means reduction strategies** rather than relying solely on inpatient psychiatric care.

The **Child Fatality Review Committee (CFRC)** reviewed deaths in fiscal year 2023, focusing on motor vehicle crashes, overdoses, and fires. Recommendations included supporting parental roles in teen driving habits, affordable driver education, social media interventions, and promoting fire safety. The committee emphasized confidentiality and non-investigative review processes.

### **Mobile Healthcare Services and Geographic Access**
The committee discussed the operation of **mobile healthcare services**, including scheduling, waiting lists, and the strategic planning of mobile clinics to ensure consistent care across various counties. The mobile units are designed to provide ongoing care rather than one-time visits, with repeat visits to the same locations to ensure continuity. They also addressed **specialty shortages** in dentistry and the use of a management-by-exception technique to highlight problematic geographic areas.

### **Medicaid Enrollment and Redetermination**
The committee reviewed **Medicaid enrollment trends**, particularly the impact of the “unwind” process, where continuous coverage under the public health emergency ended. They discussed the retention rates of coverage, the reasons for closures (primarily income-related), and the efforts to reach out to individuals who failed to complete their redetermination.
