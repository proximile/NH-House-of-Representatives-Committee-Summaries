**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (February 7, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on February 7, 2024, to discuss several bills addressing criminal background checks, therapeutic cannabis penalties, hate crime reporting, firearm background checks, and open alcohol containers in vehicles. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **House Bill 1197: Streamlining Criminal Background Checks**
- **Purpose**: HB 1197 aims to improve the efficiency of the criminal background check process for employment and volunteer positions without expanding the scope of who requires checks.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Bill Structure**: The bill is divided into three parts: (1) outlining current laws and challenges, (2) proposing statutory changes to allow additional state agencies to collect fingerprints, and (3) establishing a multi-agency task force to review positions requiring FBI record checks and recommend process improvements.
  - **Support**: Captain Victor Muzzy of the New Hampshire State Police testified in favor of the bill, noting it would alleviate bottlenecks by enabling more agencies to collect fingerprints and prevent future delays.
  - **Cost Concerns**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) raised fiscal concerns, particularly regarding the cost of purchasing and maintaining fingerprinting machines. They recommended delaying the effective date to June 30, 2025, to align with the budget cycle.
  - **Task Force**: The bill creates a task force to explore long-term solutions, including funding and staffing needs. DHHS suggested adding language to ensure the task force identifies necessary resources and includes legislative representation.
- **Outcome**: The chair closed the public hearing and appointed a subcommittee to address DHHS concerns, refine the bill, and work with the sponsor.

### **House Bill 1295: Therapeutic Cannabis Penalties**
- **Purpose**: HB 1295 seeks to remove enhanced penalties for therapeutic cannabis patients who sell cannabis, aligning their penalties with those of non-patients.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Current Issue**: Therapeutic cannabis patients face additional penalties if convicted of selling cannabis, even though their certification is revoked in such cases.
  - **Support**: Representative Wendy Thomas, a therapeutic cannabis patient, highlighted the program’s success over 11 years without significant criminal activity. She argued that patients should not face extra penalties for using cannabis medicinally.
- **Outcome**: The committee unanimously recommended the bill for passage (OTP - Ought to Pass).

### **House Bill 1339: Firearm Background Checks**
- **Purpose**: HB 1339 proposes changes to background checks for firearm purchases using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).
- **Key Points**:
  - **Amendments**: Representative John Stone introduced amendments to address concerns raised by gun dealers and constituents, particularly regarding the process of returning firearms to individuals no longer prohibited from possessing them.
- **Outcome**: The bill was assigned to a subcommittee for further review.

### **House Bill 1462: Hate Crime Reporting**
- **Purpose**: HB 1462 mandates improved reporting and tracking of hate crimes, including creating a public database and requiring law enforcement to report suspected hate crimes to the Attorney General’s office within 72 hours.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Data Collection**: The bill seeks to gather more detailed information about victims, suspects, and surrounding circumstances to better understand hate crime trends.
  - **Debate**: Concerns were raised about the threshold for categorizing incidents as hate crimes, with some arguing that reported cases should be included rather than only proven cases.
  - **Support**: Testimony highlighted the importance of accurate data for prevention, particularly in schools, and the need for transparency to inform legislation. Youth advocates emphasized the role of addressing hate crimes in retaining young people and creating safer communities.
  - **Personal Impact**: A business owner shared experiences of repeated hate crime targeting, underscoring the need for better reporting and prevention.
- **Outcome**: The discussion emphasized the need for improved hate crime data collection and transparency, with support for better reporting mechanisms.

### **House Bill 152: Open Alcohol Containers in Vehicles**
- **Purpose**: HB 152 proposes repealing the prohibition on open alcohol containers in vehicles, arguing it incentivizes littering while providing law enforcement with tools to assess impaired driving.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Provisions**: The bill would allow open containers in vehicles but includes provisions for police to use a horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test to assess impairment.
  - **Support**: Proponents argued that open container laws incentivize littering and that tourism could benefit from relaxed restrictions.
  - **Opposition**: The Department of Safety and State Police raised concerns about increased impaired driving and the complexity of administering HGN tests without probable cause.
  - **Comprehensive Alternative**: Testimony highlighted the availability of a more comprehensive Senate bill (SB 418) addressing impaired driving.
- **Outcome**: The bill was unanimously deemed **inexpedient to legislate** due to constitutional concerns, practical challenges, and the availability of SB 418.

### **Overall Outcomes**
- **HB 1197**: Assigned to a subcommittee for refinement.
- **HB 1295**: Recommended for passage (OTP).
- **HB 1339**: Assigned to a subcommittee for further review.
