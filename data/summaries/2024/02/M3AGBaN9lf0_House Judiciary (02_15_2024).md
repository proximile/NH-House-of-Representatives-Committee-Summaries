### **Key Bills and Amendments**

1. **Amendment 0524**  
   - The committee voted on an amendment to a bill, with Vice Chairman Wallace and others voting in favor. However, the motion failed 9 to 1 due to confusion about the amendment's language and its potential impact on the ballot.

2. **Bill 1169 (Discrimination Based on Hairstyles)**  
   - Representative Kab moved the bill OTP (Ought to Pass). After brief discussion, the bill passed 17-2. It addresses discrimination based on hairstyles, though some members expressed concerns about adding specific language to existing anti-discrimination laws.

3. **Bill 1220 (Marriage Applications)**  
   - Representative Ming proposed an amendment to remove the collection of race, ancestry, and education level from marriage applications. The amendment passed 17-2, and the bill as amended also passed 17-2. Some members argued that ethnicity on marriage certificates is important for historical and medical reasons.

4. **Bill 1475 (SLAPP Lawsuits)**  
   - Representative Lynn moved to expedite legislation regarding SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) lawsuits, emphasizing that the bill doesn’t change substantive law but speeds up the process. The motion passed 20-0.

5. **Bill 1603 (Topless Laws)**  
   - The bill aimed to prohibit municipalities from passing laws that prevent women from being topless where men are allowed. The motion to pass the bill (OTP) passed 20-0.

6. **Bill 1037 (Firearms Immunity)**  
   - Representative Tur proposed an amendment to modify the bill, which would weaken firearms immunity by allowing civil cases to proceed without requiring a prior criminal conviction. The amendment failed, and the underlying bill was discussed. Representative Smith suggested sending the bill to interim study to address concerns about the firearms industry, but the committee proceeded to vote. The bill failed to pass, with some members expressing strong opposition, citing its potential negative impact on the firearms industry.

7. **House Bill 1283**  
   - This bill, which garnered significant attention, was the main focus of the meeting. Committee members expressed concerns about its language and unresolved issues, particularly regarding amendments. Representative Smith suggested delaying the discussion and vote until the following week to allow more time to address amendments.  
   - **Key Concerns**: Members noted the bill's potential impact on healthcare providers, including pharmacists, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants. There were also concerns about terms like "prescribing healthcare provider" and "attending physician," which could lead to confusion.  
   - **Voting Delay**: The committee decided to postpone voting on the bill until the next meeting (February 21) to allow for further review and potential amendments.

8. **CACR 12**  
   - The committee debated an amendment to CACR 12, which aimed to clarify the state's duty to "cherish" education. The amendment explicitly stated that the state is not required to fund public or private schools at any specific level and granted the legislature exclusive authority over education funding decisions.  
   - **Divergent Views**: Some members, including Representative Smith, opposed the amendment, arguing that it undermines the judiciary's role in ensuring access to public education. Others, like Representative Stapleton, supported the amendment, viewing it as a clear way to address the Claremont decision and limit judicial intervention in education funding.  
   - **Voting Outcome**: The committee voted on the amendment, resulting in a tie (10-10), meaning the amendment failed. The bill will proceed to the full House without recommendation.

9. **House Bill 1412 (Court Reporter Deregulation)**  
   - The committee discussed a bill related to court reporter deregulation. Some members argued that licensing court reporters is unnecessary since they are no longer used in courts, while others emphasized the importance of maintaining standards for transcription accuracy. The bill also resulted in a tie vote (10-10) and will move forward without recommendation.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Civil Rights**: Bills addressing discrimination based on hairstyles (Bill 1169) and gender equality in topless laws (Bill 1603) passed with strong support, reflecting the committee’s focus on advancing civil rights protections.
  
- **Firearms Legislation**: Bill 1037 (Firearms Immunity) sparked significant debate, ultimately failing to pass due to concerns about its impact on the firearms industry.

- **Healthcare Legislation**: House Bill 1283 raised complex issues related to healthcare providers and end-of-life care, with committee members divided on the bill's readiness for a vote. The decision to postpone voting underscored the need for careful deliberation on healthcare-related legislation.

- **Education Funding**: The discussion around CACR 12 highlighted ongoing tensions between the legislature and judiciary over education funding, stemming from the Claremont decisions. The tie vote on the amendment reflected deep divisions within the committee.

- **Licensing and Regulation**: The debate over court reporter licensing (House Bill 1412) reflected broader concerns about the role of professional regulation in evolving industries.
