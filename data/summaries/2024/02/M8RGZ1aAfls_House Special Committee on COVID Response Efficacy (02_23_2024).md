### **Key Discussions and Insights**

#### **1. Data-Driven Strategies and Pandemic Response**
- The committee emphasized the critical role of scientific data in evaluating COVID-19 strategies. Two primary approaches were highlighted: delaying new cases to allow time for treatment development and fostering natural immunity in less vulnerable populations (e.g., school-age children) to protect high-risk groups and potentially accelerate the pandemic’s end.
- Patricia Tilly, Associate Commissioner at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), presented a detailed timeline of New Hampshire’s pandemic response, from the first health alert in January 2020 to the end of the federal Public Health Emergency in May 2023. This included the declaration of a state of emergency, stay-at-home orders, testing, and vaccination efforts.
- The committee acknowledged the challenges of data collection, particularly with the rise of at-home rapid tests, which made it harder to track cases accurately. The state’s efforts to build new data systems for tracking cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were highlighted as crucial for informed decision-making.

#### **2. Healthcare and Long-Term Care Facilities**
- The committee discussed the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on long-term care facilities, where New Hampshire experienced higher death rates compared to the national average. The state’s older population and the challenges of managing outbreaks in these settings were key concerns.
- A “Health Day” was proposed to focus on hospital and nursing home policies during the pandemic, involving representatives from major facilities to understand implementation challenges and explore state-level mitigations.

#### **3. Vaccination Rollout and Public Health Measures**
- The phased approach to vaccine distribution, prioritizing high-risk groups such as healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with underlying conditions, was detailed. The committee also discussed the state’s vaccination rates and the challenges of ensuring widespread uptake.
- The “Swiss Cheese Approach” to combating the virus—layering imperfect but complementary measures such as masks, social distancing, air filtration, and vaccines—was highlighted as an effective strategy.

#### **4. Schools and Air Quality**
- The impact of COVID-19 on schools, including closures, reopenings, and the use of federal funds for pandemic response, was a significant topic. The committee explored how public, private, and charter schools handled the pandemic differently.
- Air filtration systems were emphasized as a critical tool for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in schools and long-term care facilities. Future guidance on public health measures, including federal funding for air quality improvements, was discussed.

#### **5. Broader Economic and Social Impacts**
- The committee addressed the pandemic’s wide-ranging effects, including the eviction moratorium, unemployment fraud, and the strain on the healthcare workforce. These issues underscored the need for comprehensive support systems during public health emergencies.

#### **6. Future Preparedness and Lessons Learned**
- The meeting concluded with reflections on lessons learned and recommendations for future preparedness. Key areas for improvement included stockpiling medical supplies, enhancing data infrastructure, ensuring transparent communication with the public, and developing robust strategies for managing public health emergencies.

### **Committee Planning and Next Steps**
- The committee scheduled follow-up meetings for March 8th, 15th, and 29th, with the March 29th session set for 9:00 a.m. to accommodate a key director’s availability. Longer, more comprehensive sessions were proposed to address complex topics such as education, air filtration in schools, and special education needs.
- Members recognized the need for continued research and weekly meetings to drive progress. A single point of contact was established to streamline questions and follow-ups, avoiding duplication of efforts.
