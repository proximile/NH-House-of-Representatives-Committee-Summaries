The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 13, 2024, to address a wide range of legislative issues related to liquor, beverage manufacturing, cannabis legalization, and regulatory frameworks. The meeting involved detailed discussions, amendments, and stakeholder feedback across three key segments.

### **Liquor, Beverage Manufacturing, and Regulatory Issues**
The committee focused on several bills and amendments concerning liquor sales, beverage manufacturing, and compliance with state laws. Key highlights included:
1. **Legislation and Amendments**: Support was expressed for legislation addressing state stores, franchises, and free-market controls, with an emphasis on preventing issues observed in other states like Maine. Amendments were passed related to the sale of beer in refillable containers (Growlers) and the oversight of the Liquor Commission's funding, including moving the alcohol treatment fund to the general fund.
2. **Liquor Commission Compliance**: Concerns were raised about the Liquor Commission's adherence to state laws, particularly regarding funding and internal audits. Discussions emphasized the need for better management and statutory compliance.
3. **Beverage Manufacturing and Licensing**: The committee debated bills extending privileges to beverage manufacturers, including wine and beer producers, regarding on-premise licenses and retail outlets. The concept of prohibited interests in the context of brew pubs and the three-tier system (manufacturing, distributing, retailing) was also examined.
4. **Delta 8, 9, and 10 Regulations**: A proposed amendment to regulate Delta 8, 9, and 10 products was deferred pending further legislative action on a related sunset clause.
5. **Contract and Tenant Brewing**: House Bill 1358 was discussed, aiming to expand contract and tenant brewing to include wine and liquor manufacturers. The bill seeks to clarify distinctions between tenant manufacturing and contract brewing, though concerns were raised about maintaining the integrity of the three-tier system.

### **Cannabis Legalization**
The committee reviewed a cannabis legalization bill, with Representative Leon presenting significant amendments to align the bill with the governor's priorities and enhance its passability. Key points included:
1. **Framework and Licensing**: The bill proposed starting with 15 retail stores, with provisions for future expansion to ensure statewide access. It removed the dual-use license model, allowing retail outlets to sell therapeutic cannabis and enabling existing Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) to compete for retail licenses.
2. **Law Enforcement and Public Use**: The bill ensured law enforcement would be informed about cannabis operations and introduced escalating fines and misdemeanor charges for public cannabis use.
3. **Funding Allocation**: $8 million was allocated for administration, with funds distributed to pensions, community reinvestment, substance use prevention, and public safety.
4. **Stakeholder Concerns**: ATCs expressed worries about the potential decline of the therapeutic cannabis program if retail stores also served patients. The ACLU raised concerns about the severity of penalties for public cannabis use, arguing it contradicted harm reduction goals.
5. **Committee Support**: Despite reservations about the state-run model, many committee members supported the bill, emphasizing the need for harm reduction and progress toward legalization.

### **Brew Pubs and the Three-Tier System**
The committee addressed issues related to brew pubs, contract brewing, and the three-tier system. Key discussions included:
1. **Prohibited Interest Statute**: The case of a restaurant owner seeking to establish a brew pub highlighted challenges posed by the prohibited interest statute, which prevents cross-tier ownership. A temporary solution involving nano brewery licenses was proposed, though the Senate is considering legislation to eliminate nano breweries in favor of a tiered system.
2. **Three-Tier System Integrity**: Stakeholders emphasized the importance of maintaining the three-tier system to prevent monopolistic practices and ensure fair competition. Concerns were raised about the potential negative impact on small breweries and distributors if cross-tier ownership were allowed.
3. **Proposed Solutions**: Suggestions included setting production limits for self-distribution and finding compromises to allow flexibility without undermining the regulatory framework.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of balancing regulatory frameworks with the evolving needs of the liquor, beverage, and cannabis industries in New Hampshire. The committeeâ€™s discussions reflected a commitment to addressing stakeholder concerns, ensuring compliance with state laws, and advancing legislation that promotes fair competition, public safety, and harm reduction. Amendments and proposed solutions aimed to create a more adaptable and equitable regulatory environment while preserving the integrity of long-standing systems like the three-tier model.
