**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (February 21, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on February 21, 2024, addressed a wide range of topics related to transportation infrastructure, funding challenges, and public involvement. The discussions centered on the state's 10-year transportation improvement plan, road and bridge maintenance, funding strategies, and innovative approaches to infrastructure management. Here are the key points from the meeting:

### **10-Year Transportation Improvement Plan**
1. **Project Amendments and Updates**: The committee reviewed amendments to the 10-year plan, including project removals, cost adjustments, and updates based on delays, cost overruns, or community requests. Several projects were advanced, removed, or adjusted to reflect current needs.
2. **Funding Adjustments**: A $55 million increase was added to the existing $500 million budget, bringing the total 10-year plan budget to approximately $5 billion. This adjustment accounts for inflation, grant funding, and reallocations from removed projects.
3. **Public Input and Transparency**: The committee emphasized the importance of public input and transparency in updating the plan, ensuring that amendments accurately reflect community needs and priorities.

### **Road and Bridge Maintenance**
1. **Paving and Road Conditions**: The Department of Transportation (DOT) historically paves around 300 miles of roads annually, prioritizing roads based on condition using a pavement management system. Rising costs of asphalt, labor, and equipment have reduced paving capacity, with Tier 3 and Tier 4 roads (lower-volume roads) requiring significant attention.
2. **Red List Bridges**: The state has 119 red-listed bridges (structurally deficient), with $156 million allocated over 10 years for repairs. Municipal red-listed bridges (214 total) face funding challenges, with 56 being addressed using federal funds.
3. **Funding Challenges**: The expiration of Senate Bill (SB) 367, which provided significant funding for road maintenance, is expected to reduce paving capacity. The DOT estimates a $20 million annual shortfall to sustain current paving levels.
4. **Continental Boulevard Maintenance**: A contentious issue was the transfer of maintenance responsibility for Continental Boulevard in Merrimack from the state to the town. The state had been maintaining the road at $80,000 annually, but with the removal of nearby tolls, it was argued that the town should assume responsibility. Concerns were raised about the town’s financial burden and the road’s condition.

### **Funding Strategies and Cost Management**
1. **Discretionary Grants**: The DOT discussed federal discretionary grants for road projects, some of which are awarded directly to municipalities. These grants supplement state funding and help address rising costs.
2. **Cost-Effective Strategies**: The DOT is exploring strategies like using recycled materials and maintenance paving to extend road life and manage costs.
3. **Gas Tax Allocation**: The 22.2-cent gas tax is distributed with 60% going to the DOT and 40% to other agencies. Specific allocations include debt service for I-93, state bridge aid, and block grant aid.

### **Innovative Infrastructure Projects**
1. **Rail Salvage and Trail Construction**: An amendment proposed salvaging rail materials from the Conway Branch rail corridor to fund trail construction. This pilot project aims to test the feasibility of using salvaged materials to offset costs.
2. **Snowmobile Trail Connectivity**: Efforts are ongoing to improve snowmobile trail connectivity, particularly in the Lakes Region and North Country, addressing safety concerns with rail crossings.

### **Public Involvement and Challenges**
1. **Public Input Process**: Public involvement varies by project type, with minimal input for paving projects but significant engagement for larger projects like bridge replacements. The process includes data collection, alternative analysis, public hearings, and environmental documentation.
2. **Challenges**: Changing public opinion and reaching consensus on preferred alternatives remain significant challenges in transportation projects.

### **Transit and Regional Projects**
1. **Boston Express Ridership**: Ridership dropped during COVID but is slowly recovering. Subsidies increased during the pandemic but are decreasing as ridership picks up, with the goal of returning to pre-pandemic levels.
2. **Capital Corridor Project**: The project received $5.4 million in federal funding, with $4.6 million spent. Remaining funds ($861,000) were redistributed to other transit systems. Completing the project would require additional funding due to inflation.
3. **Turnpike System Expansion**: Expanding the turnpike system was discussed, but it comes with significant costs and potential toll increases. Past expansions, like the purchase of a section of I-95, have been costly but necessary for infrastructure improvements.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of managing New Hampshire’s transportation infrastructure, balancing state and local responsibilities, and ensuring efficient use of funds. Key themes included the need for sustained investment to maintain road and bridge conditions, innovative funding strategies, and the importance of public involvement in decision-making. The committee emphasized the challenges posed by rising costs, expiring funding sources, and the need for strategic planning to address infrastructure needs over the next decade.
