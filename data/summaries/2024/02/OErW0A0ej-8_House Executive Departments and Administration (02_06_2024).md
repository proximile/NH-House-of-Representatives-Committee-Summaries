**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on February 6, 2024 – House Executive Departments and Administration Committee**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 6, 2024, focused on several bills aimed at addressing workforce shortages, streamlining licensing processes, and improving access to healthcare and professional services. The committee discussed multiple pieces of legislation, with key themes including workforce challenges, licensing reform, and equity in professional practice. Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and discussions:

---

### **Healthcare Workforce Bills**

1. **HB 1331: Licensing Pathway for Internationally Trained Dentists**  
   - **Purpose**: Address the state’s dental workforce shortage by creating a special licensing pathway for internationally trained dentists.  
   - **Details**: The bill proposed allowing these dentists to work under the supervision of a licensed NH dentist while addressing licensing barriers.  
   - **Concerns**: Ambiguity in the bill, redundancy with existing laws (RSA 310), and opposition from the New Hampshire Dental Society.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 15-0 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," suggesting further review in an interim study.

2. **HB 1222: Physician Assistant (PA) Collaboration Agreements**  
   - **Purpose**: Remove the requirement for PAs to have a signed collaboration agreement with a physician to practice independently.  
   - **Support**: PAs argued the requirement is outdated, creates inequity with nurse practitioners, and increases administrative burdens.  
   - **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about patient safety, malpractice risks, and the need for physician oversight.  
   - **Compromise**: Suggestions included a phased approach requiring collaboration agreements for new PAs for a set period (e.g., 2,000 hours).  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was sent to a subcommittee for further review due to unresolved issues.

3. **HB 1526: Conditional Veterinary Licenses for Foreign-Trained Veterinarians**  
   - **Purpose**: Address the state’s veterinarian shortage by issuing conditional licenses to foreign-trained veterinarians who have completed most steps of the Educational Commission for Foreign Veterinary Graduates (ECFVG) process, except the Clinical Proficiency Exam (CPE).  
   - **Details**: These veterinarians would work under the supervision of a NH-licensed veterinarian while awaiting the CPE.  
   - **Concerns**: Language around immigration status verification and potential due process issues.  
   - **Support**: Testimonies highlighted the urgent need for veterinarians, especially for large animals, and the inefficiency of the ECFVG process.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review.

### **Licensing Streamlining Bills**

1. **HB 1385: Veteran Licensing Acceleration Program**  
   - **Purpose**: Streamline occupational licensing for veterans by recognizing their military training and experience.  
   - **Details**: The bill designates a program administrator, requires the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to map military codes to civilian licenses, and mandates insurance carriers to issue licenses without additional requirements.  
   - **Concerns**: Challenges in mapping military experience to civilian licenses and the feasibility of a 10-day processing limit.  
   - **Support**: The Department of Military Affairs and Veterans Services endorsed the bill as a cost-effective solution to support veterans’ transitions into civilian careers.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was advanced as a streamlined, efficient measure.

2. **HB 1131: Conditional Licensing for Mental Health Professionals**  
   - **Purpose**: Allow mental health professionals with conditional licenses to work in outpatient private practices during the period between graduation and full licensure.  
   - **Details**: The bill ensures supervision continues during the conditional license period, addressing bottlenecks in mental health services.  
   - **Support**: Testimonies highlighted the challenges faced by new graduates, including long wait times for licensure and the loss of continuity for patients.  
   - **Outcome**: The bill was sent to subcommittee for further review, with potential amendments to clarify language and address overlaps with HB 1413.

- **Equity vs. Safety**: Debates around PA collaboration agreements highlighted tensions between equity in practice autonomy and concerns about patient safety.
