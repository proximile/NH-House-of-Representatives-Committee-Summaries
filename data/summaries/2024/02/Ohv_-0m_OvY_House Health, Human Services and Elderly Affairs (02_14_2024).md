**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives’ Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (02/14/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on February 14, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on several key bills addressing health care, mental health services, intellectual disabilities, privacy, and ethical considerations in medical practices. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Health Care Services and Legislative Alignment**
- **Bills Discussed**: The committee debated **HB 1593** and **HB 1604**, focusing on health care services, electronic medical records, and provider protections. Discussions centered on ensuring language in contracts aligns with state law and addressing potential conflicts with federal regulations. Concerns were raised about the impact of electronic medical records on private practices and patient care, prompting calls for further research and amendments.
- **Funding and Prioritization**: **HB 1593**, which initially proposed $1 million for recreational activities for developmentally disabled individuals, was amended to reduce the appropriation to $500,000 and remove the provision for a permanent fund. The committee emphasized the need to prioritize services in individualized budgets for those who previously received them.
- **Procedural Matters**: The committee scheduled additional executive sessions to continue discussions on pending bills, ensuring thorough consideration of amendments and stakeholder input.

### **2. Mental Health Services and Intellectual Disabilities**
- **HB 1028**: This bill sought to redefine mental illness to include individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDD), addressing systemic barriers that exclude them from mental health services. Testimonies from parents and advocates, including **Ann Sonic**, highlighted the discriminatory impact of current laws, which deny services to individuals with IDD even when they have co-occurring mental health conditions. Representatives discussed the need to remove discriminatory language in statutes and ensure equitable access to care.
- **Training and Education**: Concerns were raised about the lack of training among mental health professionals to address the needs of individuals with IDD. The **DM-ID-2** (Diagnostic Manual-Intellectual Disability) was highlighted as a critical tool for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
- **Support and Advocacy**: Organizations like the **Disability Rights Center** and **Able New Hampshire** strongly supported the bill, emphasizing the need for inclusivity and systemic reform to address mental health disparities.

### **3. Informed Consent and Medical Ethics**
- **HB 1706**: The committee discussed **informed consent for infant circumcision**, with Representative Emily Phillips proposing an amendment to streamline the bill and focus on parental education. Concerns were raised about the bill’s biased language and its potential impact on divorced parents and religious practices. The committee voted **11 to 9** for an **interim study** to further examine informed consent practices, with a focus on improving education rather than legislating specific procedures.
- **HB 1482**: This bill, which proposed allowing the sale of blood and organs, faced strong opposition from medical professionals, organ procurement organizations, and funeral directors. Critics argued that the bill could lead to exploitation, coercion, and ethical violations, particularly for vulnerable individuals. Opponents emphasized that the bill conflicts with federal laws, including the National Organ Transplant Act, which prohibits organ sales. Supporters, however, argued that compensating donors could address chronic shortages and save lives.

### **4. Privacy and Data Protection**
- **HB 1669**: The committee unanimously passed an amendment to this bill, which clarified terminology and ensured providers could extract information from the Department of Health and Human Services registry without restrictions.
- **HB 1615**: This bill proposed updates to the state’s autism registry, including improved privacy protections, an opt-out mechanism, and an age-out provision requiring the removal of individuals from the registry at age 18. Concerns were raised about the registry’s usefulness, privacy issues, and lack of parental consent for data sharing. Some representatives suggested repealing the registry entirely, while others advocated for amendments to enhance privacy and data accuracy.

### **5. Systemic Issues and Calls for Reform**
- **Mental Health System Challenges**: Testimonies highlighted systemic failures in New Hampshire’s mental health system, including bed shortages, overburdened community mental health centers, and the exclusion of individuals with IDD from services. Advocates called for legislative action to address these gaps and ensure equitable access to care.
- **Ethical and Legal Concerns**: Discussions on bills like **HB 1482** and **HB 1706** underscored the complexity of legislating medical ethics and informed consent. Representatives emphasized the need for balanced approaches that protect individual rights while addressing public health needs.

### **6. Next Steps**
- The committee planned further executive sessions to continue discussions on pending bills, ensuring thorough consideration of amendments and stakeholder input. Key areas of focus included improving health care access, addressing systemic barriers for individuals with intellectual disabilities, and aligning state legislation with federal laws.
