The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee meeting on February 5, 2024, focused on a series of bills related to taxation, economic incentives, and local funding, with significant discussions around aligning state tax policies with federal laws, supporting businesses, and addressing community needs. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Tax Code Alignment and Business Incentives**
1. **House Bill (HB) 1536**: The committee debated whether to align the stateâ€™s tax code with the **2018 federal tax law**, which includes inflation adjustments, or to maintain the current **Internal Revenue Code (IRC)**. The bill proposes increasing the tax deduction limit from $500,000 to $1 million, aiming to encourage business investment through accelerated depreciation. While the fiscal note estimated a **$4.7 million revenue impact**, it was noted this could be a **timing issue** rather than a permanent loss. The committee decided to **pass the bill as is** without amendments, opting for a fixed $1 million cap rather than tying it to the IRS code.
   
2. **HB 1531 and Depreciation Allowances**: Discussions around bonus depreciation for business profits tax purposes highlighted the potential for these changes to be revenue-neutral over time. There was a focus on the benefits of aligning state and federal tax codes for consistency and ease of compliance, though concerns were raised about potential complexities and clarity on provisions like Section 179 depreciation for real estate.

3. **Safe Harbor Compensation (HB 1533)**: The committee discussed increasing the safe harbor compensation amount for small businesses from $75,000 to $100,000, with annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. This change is intended to simplify recordkeeping for small businesses.

### **Meals and Rooms Tax**
1. **HB 1191**: This bill proposes eliminating the rooms and meals tax for participants in the Restaurant Voucher Program, part of Meals on Wheels, which provides meals to senior citizens. Supporters argued that removing the tax would not cost the state, as the program reimburses the state at a lower rate, and it benefits seniors by offering social interaction. Concerns were raised about the administrative burden on restaurants. A straw poll showed strong support for the bill.

2. **Revenue Sharing with Communities**: There were discussions about sharing more of the meals and rooms tax revenue with communities that experience high lodging visitor traffic, such as Salem, which also faces increased public safety costs. Concerns were raised about the potential reduction in revenue for the public education trust fund.

### **Local Public Safety Funding**
1. **HB 1254**: This bill would allow municipalities to impose a $2 per day per room occupancy fee to fund local public safety services, particularly in areas with high tourism, such as Conway and Portsmouth. Supporters argued that towns with seasonal tourism surges face increased public safety costs and need additional revenue. Critics raised concerns about creating a patchwork of taxation across the state.

### **Constitutional Amendment on Church Tax Exemptions**
1. **CACR 18**: The committee discussed a proposal to remove tax exemptions for churches. Opponents argued that churches provide significant social welfare services (e.g., helping the poor, indigent) and removing tax exemptions could force many churches to close, especially smaller ones. Concerns were also raised about the separation of church and state. A straw poll indicated unanimous opposition to the proposal, and it was suggested that the bill be "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate).

### **Overall Committee Consensus and Next Steps**
The committee conducted straw polls to gauge support for various bills, with discussions indicating a preference for maintaining or adjusting tax policies in a way that balances business incentives with state revenue needs. The meeting concluded with plans to move forward with an **executive session** the following day to address additional bills, including the possibility of expediting the process by executing as many bills as possible during the next session.

### **Key Themes**
- **Tax Simplification**: Members emphasized the importance of simplifying the tax code for constituents and businesses.
- **Economic Incentives**: Several bills aimed to encourage business investment and support small businesses through tax adjustments and depreciation allowances.
- **Community and Social Welfare**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance state revenue with funding for local public safety and support for social welfare programs like Meals on Wheels.
- **Alignment with Federal Laws**: There was significant debate about the benefits and challenges of aligning state tax codes with federal tax laws, particularly regarding inflation adjustments and depreciation rules.

The meeting reflected a careful consideration of how tax policies can support economic growth, simplify compliance, and address the needs of communities and vulnerable populations.
