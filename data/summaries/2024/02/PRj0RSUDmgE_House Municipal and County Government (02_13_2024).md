### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Municipal and County Government (02/13/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 13, 2024, focused on several bills and a constitutional amendment related to municipal governance, zoning, tax policies, and local control. The discussions emphasized transparency, accountability, and the importance of local decision-making. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 1187 - Lease Agreements and Bonding Process**:
   - This bill aims to close a loophole in the misuse of lease agreements for equipment by school districts and towns. It proposes limiting lease terms to 7 years and requiring a 3/5 supermajority vote for leases over $100,000.
   - The bill seeks to prevent long-term leases from being used to finance major facility improvements, which should be bonded. It also mandates detailed warrant articles for lease agreements to ensure transparency in tax impacts.
   - Concerns were raised about the practicality of leasing high-cost items like fire trucks and the potential for fraud in lease agreements. The Municipal Association opposed the bill as written but agreed with closing the loophole for permanent fixtures.

2. **HB 1317 - Municipal Filings by Charitable Organizations**:
   - This bill provides more flexibility to selectmen in handling tax exemptions and abatements for charitable organizations. It changes "shall" to "may" in RSA 7223C, allowing selectmen discretion in granting exemptions if organizations fail to provide required documentation within 30 days.
   - The bill also expands the definition of "good cause" for tax abatements to include reasons beyond errors, omissions, or inability to pay, addressing challenges faced by charitable organizations in meeting documentation requirements.

3. **HB 1459 - Policies Preempted from Enacting**:
   - This bill was introduced but quickly dismissed as the prime sponsor had resigned. The committee decided to close the hearing without further discussion.

4. **HB 1284 - Quasi-Judicial Authority of Planning Boards**:
   - This bill aims to codify best practices from the Municipal Association into law, ensuring planning boards operate impartially and judge public input in a quasi-judicial manner.
   - The discussion focused on clarifying the distinction between recusal (voluntary) and disqualification (mandatory) of board members, the bill’s impact on planning boards, and its alignment with existing statutes.

5. **HB 1708 - Local Records Retention**:
   - The committee deemed this bill **inexedient to legislate** (ITL) because its provisions were incorporated into a Judiciary Committee bill. The motion passed unanimously, and the bill was placed on the consent calendar.

6. **HB 1106 - Elderly Property Tax Exemption**:
   - This bill seeks to adjust net asset limits for elderly property tax exemptions, which haven’t been updated in 30 years. It proposes doubling income limits and excluding investment funds from asset calculations to help elderly residents stay in their homes.
   - Opposition testimony highlighted concerns about excluding investment funds from asset calculations, administrative challenges with the proposed $5,000-$10,000 relief range, and the potential impact on tax redistribution. Critics emphasized that communities already have the authority to adjust exemptions locally.

#### **Constitutional Amendment (CACR 16) - Local Control of Zoning and Land Use**

1. **Local Control and Stability**:
   - The amendment aims to restore local control over land use policies, emphasizing stability in zoning decisions. It argues that land use decisions should remain stable because buying a home is the most significant financial decision for most people, directly impacting their quality of life.

2. **Housing Appeals Board (HABB)**:
   - There is significant dissatisfaction with the Housing Appeals Board, which is seen as overriding local decisions. The board is criticized for ruling in favor of developers approximately 98% of the time, with no accountability to local voters since its members are appointed, not elected.

3. **Waivers and Variances**:
   - The amendment proposes that any developer seeking a waiver or variance from local zoning policies must have their request approved by voters at the next municipal election. This process includes a financial impact statement and ensures that local communities have the final say on significant changes to land use.

4. **Developer and Community Rights**:
   - The amendment is designed to balance the rights of developers and local communities. It allows municipalities to set their own policies, making it easier for communities that welcome development to attract developers while protecting those that wish to maintain their current character.

5. **Public Input and Approval**:
   - The amendment mandates that any changes to zoning ordinances or land use regulations must have prior approval from affected civic, veterans, fraternal, and not-for-profit organizations, ensuring that all stakeholders have a voice in the process.

6. **Impact on Affordable Housing**:
   - The amendment does not prevent the development of affordable housing but allows communities to set their own guidelines. It ensures that developers who meet these guidelines can proceed without unnecessary delays, while those seeking waivers must gain voter approval.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Many bills, such as HB 1187 and HB 1284, focused on enhancing transparency and accountability in municipal operations, including lease agreements and planning board decisions.

3. **Flexibility and Discretion**: Bills like HB 1317 sought to provide more flexibility to local officials in handling tax exemptions and abatements, recognizing the unique challenges faced by charitable organizations and other stakeholders.

4. **Public Input and Community Impact**: The discussions highlighted the importance of public input in local decision-making, particularly in zoning and land use policies. The proposed constitutional amendment emphasized the need for voter approval for significant changes to land use regulations.

#### **Next Steps**

The committee planned to continue deliberations on the proposed constitutional amendment and the various bills, with a focus on gathering more public input and refining the proposals to address concerns raised during the hearing.
