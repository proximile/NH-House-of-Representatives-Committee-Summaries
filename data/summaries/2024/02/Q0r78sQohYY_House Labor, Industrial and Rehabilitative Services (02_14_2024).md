The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee meeting on February 14, 2024, addressed a wide range of labor-related issues, focusing on unemployment benefits, wage claims, severance agreements, and policies concerning deceased employees’ wages. The discussions highlighted ongoing debates about balancing worker protections, employer responsibilities, and the financial stability of state trust funds. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **Unemployment Benefits and Trust Fund Impact**
The committee debated two major proposals to reform unemployment benefits: **House Bill 1522** and **Senate Bill 436**. Both bills aimed to increase the maximum weekly benefit amount and adjust wage replacement rates but differed in their approaches:

- **House Bill 1522**: Proposed a phased increase in benefits over three years, raising the maximum weekly benefit from $427 to $672. It also introduced 19 new benefit tiers while maintaining a 60% wage replacement rate for lower tiers and reducing it to 58% for higher tiers. The bill was estimated to reduce the unemployment trust fund by $41 million in a no-recession scenario and up to $72 million in a modest recession.
  
- **Senate Bill 436**: Suggested an immediate increase in benefits, raising the maximum weekly amount to $669 and adding 12 new tiers. The wage replacement rate would drop to 54% for higher tiers, with a projected 26% increase in costs. The trust fund impact was estimated at $29 million in a no-recession scenario and up to $51 million in a modest recession.

**Key Concerns**:  
- **Economic Impact**: Members discussed the potential disincentive for workers to return to employment if benefits were too high, particularly in non-recessionary periods.  
- **Employer Taxes**: Reductions in the trust fund balance could lead to higher tax rates for employers to replenish the fund during economic downturns.  
- **Historical Context**: The Great Recession (2008-2009) and the COVID-19 pandemic were cited as examples of significant trust fund depletion, underscoring the need for financial prudence.

**Outcome**: The committee voted to table **HB 1522** in favor of waiting for the Senate bill, with the option to amend it later. An interim study was also approved to analyze part-time earnings while on unemployment, aiming to gather more data on earnings disregards and their impact on the trust fund.

### **Wage Claims and Liquidated Damages**
The committee reviewed a bill addressing wage claims and liquidated damages, focusing on scenarios where employers withhold final paychecks. Key points included:

- **Liquidated Damages**: These apply when employers knowingly fail to pay wages despite having the means to do so. The Department of Labor emphasized that penalties are a last resort after compliance efforts fail.
- **Employer Protections**: Concerns were raised about the financial burden on employers for delayed payments, particularly in cases of administrative errors or disputes.

**Outcome**: The subcommittee recommended the bill "ought to pass" as originally filed, with further discussions planned to refine potential amendments.

---

### **Severance Agreements**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1375**, which addressed severance agreements. Members argued that the bill undermined the purpose of such agreements and was unnecessary.

**Outcome**: The committee voted to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), effectively opposing it.

### **Policies for Deceased Employees’ Wages**
Two bills focused on how employers handle wages owed to deceased employees and their descendants:

- **Current Law**: Employers can pay up to $300 to dependents without probate proceedings. Proposed amendments sought to increase this cap to $3,000 to better cover funeral expenses and provide immediate financial support.
- **Direct Deposit**: The rise of direct deposit complicates the process, as wages often go to the deceased employee’s account before dependents can claim them. Employers are protected from liability if payments follow standard payroll practices.
- **Probate Concerns**: The committee debated whether the bill should align with existing probate laws (RSA 561) to avoid conflicts over the order of distribution.

**Outcome**: The committee considered whether to amend, repeal, or leave the bill unchanged, with further legal review recommended to address concerns about enforcement and clarity.

### **Right to Work and Accrued Time Policies**
The committee also addressed broader labor rights issues:

- **House Bill 1377 (Right to Work)**: This bill would allow workers to opt out of union membership and fees. Opponents argued it would weaken unions and reduce workers’ rights, while supporters framed it as a matter of individual freedom. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," maintaining New Hampshire’s historical opposition to such measures.
- **House Bill 1178**: This bill aimed to require payouts for unused vacation time when employment ends under specific conditions (e.g., business closure, seasonal work). Concerns were raised about retroactive financial liabilities for businesses. The bill was ultimately voted down after a proposed amendment failed.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:  
1. **Worker Protections vs. Employer Burdens**: Many discussions centered on balancing the need to protect workers’ rights with the financial and administrative burdens on employers.  
2. **Union Support**: Representatives emphasized the importance of unions in advocating for workers, improving wages, and ensuring workplace safety.  
3. **Economic Stability**: The financial impact of proposed reforms on state trust funds and employer taxes was a significant concern, particularly in light of past economic crises.  
4. **Modernization and Clarity**: Several bills highlighted the need to update outdated laws to reflect modern payroll practices, such as direct deposit, while ensuring clarity and enforceability.

### **Final Outcomes**
- **House Bill 1522**: Tabled in favor of Senate Bill 436.  
- **House Bill 1377**: Recommended as "inexpedient to legislate."  
- **House Bill 1178**: Voted down.  
- **Wage Claims Bill**: Recommended to pass with further amendments.  
- **Severance Agreement Bill**: Recommended as "inexpedient to legislate."  
- **Deceased Employees’ Wages Bill**: Pending further legal review.

The meeting highlighted the complexity of labor legislation and the ongoing efforts to balance fairness, economic stability, and practicality in New Hampshire’s labor policies.
