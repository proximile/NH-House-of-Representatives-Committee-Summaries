**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting on February 14, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on February 14, 2024, to discuss a wide range of transportation and infrastructure issues, primarily centered around the state’s **10-Year Transportation Improvement Plan**. The meeting included presentations, public testimonies, and legislative actions, addressing critical topics such as funding, climate resilience, public transit, and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **1. 10-Year Transportation Improvement Plan**
The **10-Year Transportation Plan** was the focal point of the meeting, with detailed presentations from the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT). Key highlights included:
- **Funding Sources and Challenges**: The plan relies on federal funding from the **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (IIJA)**, state gas taxes, and turnpike tolls. However, the expiration of **SB 367** in 2025, which temporarily increased the gas tax, will significantly reduce funding for paving non-federally eligible roads, potentially cutting the paving program by 200 miles annually.
- **Project Prioritization**: Projects are prioritized through regional planning commissions, with a focus on highways, bridges, transit, and airports. The plan includes **56 municipal bridges** funded through unprecedented federal aid, addressing long-standing infrastructure needs.
- **Inflation and Rising Costs**: Inflation has impacted project costs, necessitating adjustments to funding timelines and priorities. Major turnpike projects in Nashua, Manchester, and Bedford were discussed, with funding reallocated to accommodate revenue fluctuations.

### **2. Climate Resilience and Coastal Infrastructure**
- **Sea Level Rise and Flooding**: Concerns about rising sea levels and severe weather were raised, particularly regarding coastal infrastructure. The **Newcastle Causeway** was a key focus, with NHDOT proposing to raise its elevation by three feet to mitigate future flooding. Engineering work is set to begin in 2025 or 2026.
- **Seacoast Infrastructure**: The deteriorating seawall along **Route 1A** from Hampton to Rye was highlighted, with a $75 million estimated cost for rebuilding. NHDOT is pursuing **FEMA funding** and federal grants to address these issues.
- **Coastal Risk and Hazards Committee**: The committee’s work on modeling flood risks and improving coastal resilience was discussed, with a focus on the effectiveness of seawalls and revetments.

### **3. Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure and Policy**
- **EV Charging Stations**: The exclusion of a $1 million municipal EV charging station project in Derry from the 10-year plan was criticized. NHDOT acknowledged a submission error and is working to address the issue. The **NEVI Program** (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) was discussed, aiming to create alternative fuel corridors across the state.
- **EV Commission Bill (HB 1510)**: The committee voted **12-6** to declare **HB 1510** (establishing an EV commission) **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)**, citing redundancy with existing commissions.
- **UNH Transit Fleet**: The University of New Hampshire (UNH) requested funding to replace aging buses, initially considering electric buses but now opting for compressed natural gas (CNG) due to reliability concerns. UNH plans to transition to electric buses powered by landfill gas in the future.

### **4. Public and Community Transportation**
- **Economic and Social Benefits**: Public transportation providers, such as **Coast**, emphasized the economic impact of their services, estimating a **4-to-1 return on investment**. They also highlighted challenges posed by inflation and shifting federal funding landscapes.
- **Regional Mobility**: Programs like the **Conquered-Lonia Connector** and the **Statewide Mobility Manager Network** were praised for improving regional transportation and connecting residents with essential services, particularly in rural areas.
- **Needs Assessment**: There was a call for a comprehensive **Statewide Needs Assessment** to identify transportation gaps and guide strategic investments, involving regional planning commissions and stakeholders.

### **5. Legislative Actions and Funding Mechanisms**
- **Municipal Bridge Funding**: Federal funds are now being used for municipal bridges, allowing communities to repair and replace bridges previously ineligible for federal aid.
- **Discretionary Grants**: The state is pursuing discretionary grants to defray costs and inflation, though these grants are not budgeted for in advance.
- **Governor’s Changes to the Plan**: The governor proposed reallocating funds from certain EV charging projects to other priorities, such as the **Hampton Branch Rail Trail**.

### **6. Public Engagement and Project Opposition**
- **Public Opposition**: Several members noted instances where well-planned projects faced opposition from small groups of residents, leading to delays or cancellations. Examples included roundabout projects in **Wolfeboro** and **Conway**, as well as intersection improvements in **Salem**.
- **Transparency and Communication**: The committee emphasized the need for better public communication and transparency in the planning process to ensure community buy-in.

### **7. Future Steps and Public Hearing**
The meeting concluded with a reminder about the upcoming **public hearing** on the 10-Year Transportation Improvement Plan, where further input from the public and stakeholders will be gathered. The committee plans to reconvene to finalize recommendations and address outstanding questions.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing competing transportation priorities, addressing climate resilience, and managing funding challenges. Key themes included:
- The need for **strategic investments** in infrastructure to leverage federal funding and address diverse transportation needs.
- The importance of **public engagement** and transparency in the planning process to ensure successful project implementation.
- The impact of **inflation** and **funding constraints** on the state’s ability to maintain and improve its transportation systems.
- The role of **public and community transportation** in driving economic and social benefits, particularly in rural areas.

Overall, the discussions highlighted the critical role of the 10-Year Transportation Plan in shaping New Hampshire’s infrastructure future, while addressing the challenges posed by climate change, funding limitations, and evolving transportation needs.
