### Key Legislative Actions and Debates

#### **Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**
1. **HB 1561**: This bill aimed to expand EFA eligibility to include students who feel unsafe or unsupported in public schools, particularly LGBTQ+ students. Supporters argued it provided choice and safety for marginalized students, while opponents criticized it as a costly, unaccountable universal voucher program. The OTP (Ought to Pass) motion failed, and the bill was ultimately tabled after reconsideration.
   
2. **HB 1634**: This bill sought to remove income eligibility requirements for the EFA program, making it universally accessible. Proponents argued it supported educational freedom, while opponents called it fiscally irresponsible and premature without an audit of the existing program. The OTP motion failed, and the bill was tabled.

3. **HB 1665**: This bill proposed increasing the income eligibility threshold for the EFA program. Supporters emphasized expanding educational options, while opponents highlighted the lack of accountability and potential financial burden. The OTP motion narrowly passed, and the bill was sent to the Finance Committee.

#### **Other Key Bills**
1. **HB 1002**: This bill was subject to multiple motions to reconsider, recommit, and table. Supporters argued for reconsideration due to unclear understanding and potential unintended consequences, while opponents emphasized the lack of new information and the importance of maintaining legislative precedent. The motion to reconsider passed, but subsequent motions to table and recommit the bill failed. The bill was ultimately recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.

2. **HB 1553-FN**: This bill proposed a pilot program for spelling-to-communicate services for students with autism and apraxia. Proponents highlighted the potential benefits, while opponents cited the lack of scientific evidence and the program's reliance on facilitated communication. The House voted to indefinitely postpone the bill.

3. **HB 1580**: This bill sought to prohibit the government procurement of electric vehicles containing components produced using forced labor. Critics argued it was too narrow, as similar components are used in many other devices. The committee recommended it as inexpedient to legislate, and the motion passed.

4. **HB 1116**: This bill aimed to expand the types of rifles allowed for hunting in certain areas, including semi-automatic rifles. Supporters argued it increased safety and accuracy, while opponents raised concerns about public safety and land access for hunters. The bill passed with amendments.

5. **HB 1662**: This bill sought to restrict simultaneous employment of Department of Health and Human Services staff with adoption agencies. It was debated extensively, with arguments about potential conflicts of interest and the need for guardrails to protect children. The bill ultimately failed to pass.

6. **HB 1396**: This bill prohibiting municipal inspections of owner-occupied housing units was deemed inexpedient to legislate after debate about housing safety and property rights.

7. **HB 1045**: This bill requiring powerboat operators to wear engine cut-off switches passed without significant opposition.

8. **HB 1049**: This bill addressing the prohibition of overnight mooring of houseboats on public waters was indefinitely postponed after debate about public trust and property rights.

9. **HB 1429-FN-A**: This bill, which established a procedure for transferring dam ownership, passed with an amendment.

10. **HB 1700-FN**: This controversial bill prohibiting geoengineering and intentional release of pollutants, including cloud seeding, was deemed inexpedient to legislate. Proponents argued it was necessary to protect public health, while opponents questioned its feasibility and lack of evidence.

11. **HB 1062**: This bill allowing the use of special cover plates on vehicles passed after debate about its necessity and potential confusion for law enforcement.

12. **HB 1138-FN**: This bill equalizing fines for operating off-highway recreational vehicles and snowmobiles with suspended licenses passed without significant opposition.

13. **HB 1228**: This bill establishing a committee to determine qualifications for fishing and game guides was deemed inexpedient to legislate. Some representatives suggested an interim study instead.
