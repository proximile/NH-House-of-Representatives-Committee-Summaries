The NH House of Representatives Finance Committee held an executive session on February 1, 2024, to discuss **House Bill 1560**, which proposes transferring unspent and unallocated surplus funds from the **Education Trust Fund (ETF)** into the **General Fund** at the end of each fiscal year. The bill does not eliminate the ETF but aims to make surplus funds available for other state needs.

### Key Points from the Discussion:
1. **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill seeks to address the issue of approximately **$222 million** in surplus funds sitting unused in the ETF, which could be redirected to the General Fund for flexibility in addressing other state priorities.
2. **Arguments in Favor**:
   - Proponents argued that the ETF surplus is tied up and unavailable for other state needs, such as potential overspending in areas like the **Sununu Youth Center**.
   - They emphasized that the General Fund can always backfill education needs if necessary and that the bill does not reduce education funding.
   - Flexibility in the General Fund is crucial for addressing unforeseen expenses, such as Medicaid or provider payments.

3. **Arguments Against**:
   - Opponents expressed concern that transferring funds from the ETF sends a damaging message about the state’s commitment to education, especially in light of recent court rulings that found the state underfunds education.
   - They argued that the bill should be deferred to a **special committee on education funding** for further discussion, as the process was rushed and lacked robust debate.
   - Critics also highlighted that the ETF is critical for addressing future education needs, including adequacy funding and potential funding lawsuits.

4. **Historical Context**: Some members noted that the ETF has historically been underfunded, and surplus funds should remain in the ETF to ensure education is adequately supported.

5. **Vote Outcome**: The committee voted **13-12 in favor** of the motion to pass the bill, with no immediate Minority Report filed.

### Key Concerns Raised:
- The bill’s potential impact on public perception of education funding.
- The need for flexibility in the General Fund versus the importance of maintaining a dedicated education fund.
- The rushed process and lack of thorough discussion on the bill’s implications.

The bill will now move forward for further consideration.
