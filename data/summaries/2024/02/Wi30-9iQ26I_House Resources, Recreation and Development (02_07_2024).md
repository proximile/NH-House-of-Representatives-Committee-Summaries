Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **PFAS Contamination and Accountability**

   - **Purpose**: Extend the end date of New Hampshire’s PFAS Commission, established to address PFAS contamination.
   - **Discussion**: Representative Nancy Murphy emphasized the ongoing health and environmental impacts of PFAS contamination, particularly from the Saint-Gobain facility in Merrimack, which has caused elevated cancer rates and contaminated water supplies. An amendment was introduced to include Hudson, a town affected by PFAS in its water supply, in the commission’s work.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously (19-0) to recommend the bill "ought to pass" (OTP) with the amendment.

2. **HB 1415 (PFAS Facility Cleanup)**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensure proper decontamination and decommissioning of facilities causing PFAS contamination.
   - **Discussion**: The bill aims to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs and reduce public exposure to PFAS.
