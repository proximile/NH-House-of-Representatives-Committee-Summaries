**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting on February 13, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 13, 2024, to discuss a range of education-related bills. The meeting highlighted debates on parental rights, student privacy, curriculum transparency, and education funding, reflecting tensions between ensuring transparency, protecting student rights, and avoiding unnecessary regulatory burdens on schools. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Parental Notification and Student Privacy (HB 1695)**
The committee focused extensively on **House Bill 1695**, which addresses **parental notification** regarding the release of **student identifiable information** to third parties under the **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to ensure parents are notified when their child’s personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, such as vendors or service providers, even if such sharing is allowed under FERPA exceptions.
- **FERPA Context**: Concerns were raised about the loosened restrictions on student data sharing under FERPA’s 2011 revisions, prompting calls for greater transparency.
- **Third-Party Concerns**: Examples included schools contracting with entities like the **Behavioral Institute at Keene State**, which may handle sensitive student data. The bill does not prohibit data sharing but ensures parents are informed.
- **Existing Regulations**: Some representatives noted that other laws, such as the **Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)**, **HIPAA**, and **New Hampshire State RSAs**, already regulate student data but may not fully cover third-party sharing under FERPA exceptions.
- **Debate**: Questions arose about whether the bill would restrict internal or state agency data sharing, which was clarified as not the intent. Concerns were also raised about potential duplication of existing regulations or undue burdens on schools.
- **Interim Study Motion**: Representative Miler moved to send the bill to **interim study**, citing the need for clarity on its scope and potential unintended consequences. The motion passed with a **10-10 vote**, pausing the bill for further review.
- **Opposition**: Representative McDonald argued against the interim study, emphasizing the bill’s importance in addressing constituent concerns about transparency.
