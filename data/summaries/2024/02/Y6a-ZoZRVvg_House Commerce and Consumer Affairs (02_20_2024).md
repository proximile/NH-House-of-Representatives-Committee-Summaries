**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (02/20/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 20, 2024, to address a range of issues related to healthcare, insurance, and consumer protections. The meeting featured in-depth discussions on several key topics, with a focus on balancing consumer needs, financial implications, and regulatory considerations. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### Healthcare and Insurance Topics

1. **High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs):**  
   The committee examined the definition and implications of HDHPs, which are federally designed for younger, healthier individuals who pay lower premiums but face higher out-of-pocket costs. Discussions centered on how these plans interact with preventative services, cost-sharing, and their potential impact on premiums. The committee also debated whether employers could offer HDHPs and how they differ from other high-deductible plans.

2. **Glucose Monitoring Devices:**  
   A bill mandating coverage for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for diabetics, including gestational diabetes, was reviewed. Concerns were raised about the potential financial impact of removing prior authorization and cost-sharing requirements. To address these concerns, the committee decided to conduct an interim study to assess the fiscal impact and medical efficacy of mandating coverage for these devices.

3. **Living Organ Donors and Life Insurance:**  
   The committee discussed a bill aimed at prohibiting life insurance companies from denying coverage or increasing premiums for living organ donors. The conversation emphasized the need for actuarial evidence to justify premium increases and the importance of aligning with other states’ laws to avoid becoming an outlier. Further discussion was rescheduled to allow for additional research and the development of consistent legislative language.

4. **Public Adjusters and Insurance Contracts:**  
   A bill addressing contracts between public adjusters and insured individuals was briefly reviewed. The insurance department recommended further examination, and the committee agreed to expedite the legislation for additional consideration.

5. **Amendment to Insurance Legislation:**  
   The committee passed an uncontested amendment clarifying that glass repair professionals should not be classified as insurance adjusters. The amendment was approved without further discussion.

### Ambulance Services and Insurance Billing

1. **Ambulance Billing and Insurance Payments:**  
   The committee engaged in significant debate over how insurance companies handle payments for ambulance services, particularly concerning balance billing—where patients are billed for the difference between the insurer’s payment and the service provider’s charges. Some insurers, like Anthem, cover balance billing, while others do not. The proposed legislation aims to clarify that insurance companies should reimburse ambulance services directly, regardless of whether the provider is in-network or out-of-network, without involving the patient in the payment process.

2. **Legislative Intent and Concerns:**  
   Legislators expressed concerns about the potential financial impact on small businesses and individuals if the legislation leads to increased insurance premiums. There was also a philosophical debate about whether the cost of emergency services should be covered by insurance companies, taxpayers, or the individuals who use the services.

3. **Direct Payment Proposal:**  
   A key proposal was to have insurance payments for ambulance services sent directly to the ambulance companies rather than to the patients. This aims to simplify the payment process and ensure that ambulance services are compensated more promptly and directly.

4. **Financial Implications and Fiscal Notes:**  
   The financial impact of the proposed legislation remains uncertain. Discussions highlighted the variability in how different insurance plans handle cost-sharing and the challenges of estimating the overall fiscal impact without a detailed study. Some legislators noted that similar legislation in other states has resulted in minimal cost increases.

5. **Federal Involvement:**  
   The committee discussed potential federal legislation addressing ground ambulance billing under the No Surprises Act, which currently excludes ground ambulance services. Legislators expressed a preference for a state-specific solution rather than waiting for federal action.

6. **Stakeholder Perspectives:**  
   Input from various stakeholders, including insurance department representatives and legislators, underscored the challenges faced by both commercial and municipal ambulance providers. There was consensus that the current system is unsustainable and in need of reform, though disagreement persisted on the best approach.

7. **Voting and Next Steps:**  
   The committee voted in favor of moving the bill forward, focusing on addressing direct payment issues without complicating existing balance billing practices. The bill is seen as a step toward broader reform but is not expected to resolve all underlying issues in the system.

### Overall Outcomes

The meeting highlighted the complexities of healthcare billing, insurance regulations, and consumer protections. The committee emphasized the need for thorough research and stakeholder input to craft legislation that balances the interests of providers, insurers, and patients. Several decisions, including those related to glucose monitoring devices, living organ donors, and ambulance billing, were deferred for further study and refinement. The committee’s approach reflects a commitment to addressing critical issues while mitigating unintended financial and regulatory consequences.
