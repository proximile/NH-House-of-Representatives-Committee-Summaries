The NH House of Representatives meeting on February 8, 2024, focused on **House Bill 1370**, which proposes the use of durable, tamperproof plastic containers for preserving ballots. The discussion centered on the necessity, practicality, and environmental impact of replacing the current cardboard ballot boxes with plastic ones.

Key points from the debate:
1. **Concerns about Necessity**: Representative HR questioned the need for plastic containers, noting that cardboard boxes are already secured with tamper-evident tape and seals signed by election officials. They also raised concerns about space, reusability, and the potential for plastic containers to become "ugly" over time.
2. **Support for Plastic Containers**: Representative B argued that plastic containers would be the same size as cardboard boxes, last longer, and use wire seals instead of tape, enhancing security and durability.
3. **Environmental Impact**: Representative Hamlet opposed the bill, citing environmental concerns, as cardboard is recyclable and plastic is not. They also argued that cardboard boxes are secure and have not been linked to ballot damage.
4. **Security and Chain of Custody**: Representative Howard and others emphasized the importance of protecting ballots from water damage and ensuring a secure chain of custody, which plastic containers could better provide. Representative Wood highlighted the need for containers that can withstand stacking and multiple openings during recounts or audits.
5. **Cost and Uniformity**: Some representatives noted that plastic containers could be reusable, cost-effective, and improve public perception of election security.

After discussion, the committee voted **15 to 4** in favor of the bill, with representatives tasked with drafting the majority and minority reports. The chair concluded the session, thanking participants for their input.
