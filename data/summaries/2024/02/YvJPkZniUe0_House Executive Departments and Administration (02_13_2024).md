**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (02/13/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on February 13, 2024, covering a wide range of legislative topics, including building energy codes, historical preservation, state flag redesign, and oaths of office. The discussions highlighted tensions between tradition and modernization, cost concerns versus long-term benefits, and the importance of inclusivity and practicality in legislative decisions.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **Building Energy Codes and State Building Code Updates**
1. **HB 1059 (Building Energy Codes)**:
   - The Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire (CPCN) opposed HB 1059, which would not adopt the most recent building energy code, arguing it would increase energy costs for consumers, particularly low-income households. CPCN supported an amendment by Representative Mick Williams to adopt updated codes for better energy efficiency and resilience.
   - The New Hampshire Home Builders Association opposed updating to the 2021 energy code, citing increased costs for homeowners and builders. Supporters, including the Sierra Club and Clean Energy New Hampshire, emphasized long-term savings and environmental benefits.
   - The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review, with stakeholders encouraged to provide additional data on costs and benefits.

2. **HB 1387 (State Building Code Revisions)**:
   - This bill focused on procedural and structural revisions to the Building Code Review Board (BCRB), including reassigning board members, clarifying cost impact assessments, and eliminating a two-year waiting period for certain code adoptions.
   - The bill also proposed updating seven of eight model codes to the 2021 edition, excluding the Energy Conservation Code, which remained at the 2018 edition due to cost concerns.
   - Testimony from BCRB Chair Philip Sherman supported the bill, while stakeholders like the New Hampshire Home Builders Association and Mechanical Licensing Board raised concerns about specific provisions.

#### **Historical Preservation and Pronunciation**
3. **HB 1433 (Historical Records and Donations)**:
   - This bill would allow the Secretary of State to accept and maintain historical records and objects through donations, with an amendment proposing two additional positions to support this effort. The State Archivist testified in favor, emphasizing the importance of preserving New Hampshireâ€™s history.

4. **HB 1095 (Pronunciation of New Hampshire and Concord)**:
   - Representative Gallagher introduced a bill to officially define the pronunciation of "New Hampshire" and "Concord" using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The goal was to standardize pronunciation for branding and to assist non-native speakers.

#### **State Flag Redesign and Oaths of Office**
5. **HB 1016 (State Flag Redesign)**:
   - Representative Dunn proposed an amendment to redesign the state flag, which currently features the state seal on a blue background. The new design included symbols like The Old Man of the Mountain, the state motto "Live Free or Die," and nine stars representing New Hampshire as the ninth state admitted to the Union.
   - The committee voted 12-2 to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate," rejecting the proposed redesign. Some members supported the idea but felt public input should guide such a decision.

6. **CACR 21 (Oath of Civil Officers)**:
   - The committee discussed an amendment to make the oath of office non-religious by default, promoting inclusivity. Representative Groda moved to retain the current system, which allows individuals to affirm rather than swear, and the committee voted unanimously (13-0) to support the motion.

#### **Sheriff Age Limit**
7. **CACR 11 (Sheriff Age Limit)**:
   - Representatives debated a bill to allow sheriffs to complete their terms even if they turn 70 during their tenure. Supporters argued it would ensure continuity in law enforcement, particularly in Rockingham County. The motion failed with 10 opposed and 4 in favor.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Energy Efficiency vs. Cost**: Discussions on building energy codes highlighted the tension between upfront costs and long-term benefits, with stakeholders urging careful consideration of housing affordability and environmental sustainability.
- **Tradition vs. Modernization**: Bills like the state flag redesign and oath of office amendments sparked debates about balancing historical tradition with the need for modernization and inclusivity.
- **Practicality and Symbolism**: Representatives weighed the practical implications of legislative changes (e.g., cost, implementation) against their symbolic significance, as seen in the discussions on the state flag and pronunciation bill.

### **Next Steps**
Several bills, including HB 1059 and HB 1387, were referred to subcommittees for further review. The meeting concluded with administrative matters, including scheduling future public hearings and executive sessions, ensuring that stakeholders have opportunities to provide additional input on these important legislative issues.
