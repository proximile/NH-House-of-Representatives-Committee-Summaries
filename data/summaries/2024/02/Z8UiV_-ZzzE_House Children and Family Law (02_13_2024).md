**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Children and Family Law (02/13/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 13, 2024, to address several key bills related to children and family law. The meeting focused on issues ranging from the use of restraints and seclusion in schools to parental rights, custody disputes, and children’s access to services. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

### **Restraints and Seclusion in Schools (House Bill 1269)**

The meeting began with a focus on **House Bill 1269**, which addresses the use of restraints and seclusion in schools, particularly for students with disabilities or Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Key points included:

- **Parental Concerns**: Parents and advocates shared emotional testimonies about children being injured, restrained, or secluded without proper communication or accountability from schools. Many emphasized the lack of transparency and systemic failures in the education system.
- **Proposed Solutions**: The bill aims to improve transparency by requiring audio and video recordings of restraints and seclusion incidents when included in a student’s IEP. Parents would have the right to request these recordings.
- **Training and Oversight**: Representatives stressed the need for better de-escalation training for staff and more comprehensive data on injuries and incidents related to these practices.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Questions were raised about how recordings involving multiple students would be handled under FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act).
- **Systemic Issues**: Testimonies highlighted delays in the court system, lack of enforcement of existing laws, and the disproportionate impact on students with disabilities.

The committee plans to revisit the bill on March 5th for further input and discussion.

### **Voluntary Services Under the CHINS Program (House Bill 1261)**

The discussion then shifted to **House Bill 1261**, which pertains to voluntary services under the CHINS (Child in Need of Services) program. Key points included:

- **Child Reluctance**: Experts noted that many children, especially teenagers, initially refuse services due to trauma or mistrust. The bill seeks to ensure that initial refusal does not disqualify them from receiving help.
- **Trauma-Informed Care**: The bill emphasizes trauma-informed care and wraparound services for the entire family, not just the child.
- **Legal Implications**: There was debate over whether the bill is necessary, as existing statutes already account for children changing their minds about voluntary services.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives raised concerns about forcing services on unwilling children and maintaining voluntary participation.

The committee will continue to review the bill and consult with experts before making a decision.

### **Parenting Time, Custody, and Access to Records (House Bill 1392 and Related Legislation)**

Several bills addressed parenting time, custody, and access to children’s records, including **House Bill 1392** and others. Key points included:

- **Equal Parenting Time**: There was debate about enforcing equal parenting time, with concerns that strict equality might not always be in the child’s best interest.
- **Enforcement Issues**: Representatives highlighted the lack of enforcement of court-ordered parenting plans and suggested greater involvement of local law enforcement.
- **False Allegations**: The bill addresses false reports of abuse or neglect, which can harm parent-child relationships and prolong investigations.
- **Children’s Rights**: Discussions centered on allowing mature children to testify in custody cases, with concerns about emotional trauma and potential manipulation by one parent.

The committee plans to vote on these bills on March 5th.

### **Parental Access to Library Records (House Bill 1308)**

**House Bill 1308** focused on parental access to children’s library records. Key points included:

- **Parental Rights**: Proponents argued that parents should have the right to monitor their children’s reading materials, especially given concerns about inappropriate content.
- **Opposing Views**: Opponents emphasized that libraries are public spaces and parents should supervise their children rather than relying on government oversight.
- **Amendment and Vote**: An amendment to clarify the bill’s language passed, but the bill itself was ultimately voted down.

### **Child Support During Pregnancy (House Bill 1027)**

**House Bill 1027** sought to include the period of pregnancy in child support calculations. Key points included:

- **Financial Responsibility**: Proponents argued that fathers should be financially responsible if a mother is forced to continue a pregnancy (e.g., in cases of sexual assault).
- **Paternity Concerns**: Concerns were raised about establishing paternity before birth, which complicates the bill’s implementation.
- **Abortion Rights**: Some representatives noted that the bill could conflict with existing abortion rights by introducing financial responsibility for fathers even if the mother did not want to continue the pregnancy.
- **Outcome**: The bill was ultimately voted down.

### **General Observations**

The meeting highlighted several recurring themes:
- **Transparency and Accountability**: There is a strong push for greater transparency and accountability in schools, particularly regarding the treatment of students with disabilities.
- **Children’s Rights**: Discussions emphasized the importance of protecting children’s rights while balancing parental rights and government oversight.
- **Trauma-Informed Care**: Many bills focused on trauma-informed approaches to ensure children receive necessary services without unnecessary harm.
- **Local vs. State Control**: There was tension between local control (e.g., library governance) and state-level legislation.
