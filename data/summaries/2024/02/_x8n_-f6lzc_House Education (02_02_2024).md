The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 2, 2024, centered on the critical issue of education funding, addressing both immediate needs and long-term structural reforms. The discussions spanned several key areas, including the adequacy formula, special education funding, fiscal capacity disparities, and the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT). Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **1. Adequacy Formula and Base Cost**
The committee focused on updating the base cost per pupil in the education funding formula, which has remained largely unchanged since 2008. The current base cost is approximately $4,182 per pupil, with a proposal to increase it to $4,400 to better reflect rising costs, such as teacher salaries, benefits, and operational expenses. This adjustment would address the growing financial pressures on school districts and ensure more adequate funding for essential services. The committee also debated the feasibility of this increase, given the projected $182 million balance in the Education Trust Fund at the end of FY 2024.

### **2. Special Education Funding**
Special education funding was a major point of discussion, with the committee considering weighted funding for different categories of special education needs (e.g., categories A, B, and C). This approach would provide more equitable support for students with varying levels of need. The superintendent of a local school district emphasized the real costs of special education services, including nursing and teacher ratios, and stressed the importance of updating the funding formula to reflect current realities. The committee also discussed separating special education funding into a separate bill (**HB 1656**) to address these specific needs.

### **3. Fiscal Capacity Disparity and Targeted Aid**
The committee explored fiscal capacity disparity aid, which aims to address inequities in property tax bases across districts. The proposed reinstatement of $39 million in aid would benefit low-property-value, high-poverty areas. However, there were concerns about the accuracy of median family income data and equalized property valuations, which have significant margins of error. The committee also reviewed historical funding formulas, such as the 2008 Esbrook study, and compared them to the current model, noting that the 2008 formula was more targeted in its approach.

### **4. Transportation Costs**
Transportation costs, particularly for rural districts, were highlighted as a significant inequity. Some districts spend substantially more per pupil on transportation, diverting funds from instructional resources. The committee acknowledged the need to address these disparities to ensure equitable funding across all districts.

### **5. SWEPT (Statewide Education Property Tax)**
The issue of excess SWEPT funds, which are currently retained by municipalities, was a contentious topic. Some members argued that retaining these funds is unconstitutional and violates the principle of equitable education funding. The committee debated whether excess SWEPT funds should be returned to the state treasury or remain with municipalities for educational purposes. **HB 1586**, which proposes redirecting all SWEPT revenue to the state education trust fund with a 3% processing fee for municipalities, was referred to an interim study for further review.

### **6. Immediate vs. Long-Term Solutions**
While the committee recognized the need for immediate adjustments to provide relief to school districts and taxpayers, there was also a strong emphasis on the importance of long-term solutions. The ongoing lawsuit regarding education funding adequacy served as a backdrop to these discussions, with members cautious about making changes that might conflict with legal rulings. The committee committed to further study and potential comprehensive reform of the funding formula during the interim period.

### **7. Legal and Constitutional Concerns**
Members expressed concerns about the constitutionality of certain funding practices, particularly the retention of excess SWEPT funds. The committee acknowledged that these issues may ultimately be resolved by the courts. There was also discussion about the need for a uniform tax rate to ensure equitable education funding across the state.

### **8. Committee Recommendations and Future Actions**
The committee voted to recommend moving forward with amendments to **HB 1656** (special education funding) and **HB 1583** (base cost and fiscal capacity disparity aid), with specific funding allocations and implementation dates. The committee also emphasized the need for continued work on education funding and policy, particularly during the interim period, to develop a more sustainable and equitable funding model.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of education funding in New Hampshire, with a focus on balancing immediate needs for increased funding with long-term structural reforms. The committee aimed to propose amendments to existing bills to address these issues while committing to further study and potential comprehensive reform in the future. The discussions highlighted the importance of equitable funding, the challenges of addressing fiscal disparities, and the need for sustainable solutions to ensure adequate education for all students in the state.
