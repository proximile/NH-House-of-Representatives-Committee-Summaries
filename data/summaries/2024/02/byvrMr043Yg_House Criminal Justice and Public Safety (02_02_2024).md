**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (February 2, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 2, 2024, to discuss several bills related to criminal justice, public safety, and firearm regulations. The meeting focused on key legislative proposals aimed at addressing mental health, suicide prevention, domestic violence, and firearm rights, sparking intense debate over the balance between public safety and individual liberties.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 1050 and House Bill 150: Voluntary "Do Not Sell" Firearms List**
Both bills propose the establishment of a voluntary system allowing individuals to place themselves on a "Do Not Sell" list for firearms, particularly during periods of mental health crisis.  
- **Supporters**, including mental health professionals and advocates, argued that limiting access to firearms during crises could significantly reduce suicide rates, which are notably high in New Hampshire. They likened the mechanism to an advanced directive, empowering individuals to make proactive decisions about their safety.  
- **Opponents**, including gun rights advocates, raised concerns about coercion, privacy violations, and potential misuse of the list. They questioned the billâ€™s effectiveness in acute crisis situations and warned of unintended consequences, such as errors in the list or liability issues.  
- The bills are modeled after similar laws in Utah, Virginia, and Washington, which have seen bipartisan support.  

#### **House Bill 1186: Prohibition of Firearm Purchase Tracking**
This bill seeks to ban the use of specific merchant category codes (MCCs) for firearm purchases, arguing that such tracking could lead to a quasi-firearm registry and violate privacy rights.  
- **Supporters**, including the National Rifle Association (NRA), emphasized the importance of protecting gun owners' privacy and preventing discrimination by financial institutions.  
- **Opponents**, including representatives from the New Hampshire Medical Society, argued that tracking firearm purchases is necessary for public safety and could help prevent gun violence.  

#### **House Bill 1337: Firearms and Expired Protective Orders**
This bill addresses the process of returning firearms to individuals after the expiration of domestic violence protective orders.  
- **Supporters** argued that the current process is overly bureaucratic and burdensome, infringing on property rights. The bill proposes shifting the burden of initiating a hearing to the plaintiff (the person who sought the protective order) rather than the defendant.  
- **Opponents**, including the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, expressed concerns that the bill could endanger victims by making it easier for abusers to regain access to firearms. They highlighted the lethal risks associated with firearms in domestic violence situations.  

#### **House Bill 1711: Mental Health Reporting and Firearm Rights Restoration**
This bill focuses on reporting individuals involuntarily committed for mental health reasons to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and establishing a process for restoring their firearm rights.  
- **Supporters**, including mental health professionals, emphasized the importance of preventing individuals deemed dangerous from accessing firearms while ensuring due process for those who recover.  
- **Opponents** criticized the bill for stigmatizing individuals with mental illness and argued that the restoration process is overly burdensome. Concerns were raised about privacy, due process, and the potential for lifelong firearm prohibitions without proper justification.  

#### **Other Bills**
- **House Bill 1701**: Proposed a relief from disabilities program for individuals to restore their gun rights after mental health treatment. Concerns about clarity and public safety led to opposition.  
- **House Bill 1260**: Addressed invasion of privacy, particularly concerning minors, and passed with amendments to increase penalties for repeat offenders.  
- **House Bill 1217**: Focused on protecting historic covered bridges through surveillance, with amendments ensuring public notice of cameras.  

### **Key Themes and Debates**
1. **Public Safety vs. Individual Rights**: The discussions highlighted the ongoing tension between measures aimed at reducing gun violence and suicide and concerns about infringing on Second Amendment rights and individual privacy.  
2. **Mental Health and Suicide Prevention**: Many bills, such as HB 1050, HB 150, and HB 1711, were framed as public health measures to address mental health crises and reduce suicide rates, particularly by limiting access to firearms.  
3. **Domestic Violence and Firearms**: Bills like HB 1337 underscored the complex interplay between domestic violence, protective orders, and firearm access, with strong concerns about victim safety.  
4. **Privacy and Due Process**: Privacy concerns were central to debates over firearm purchase tracking (HB 1186) and mental health reporting (HB 1711), with critics warning of potential abuses and stigmatization.  
5. **Implementation and Practicality**: Questions about the feasibility, enforcement, and potential errors in implementing these bills were recurring themes, particularly regarding background checks and mental health reporting.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected deep divisions over how to balance public safety, mental health, and constitutional rights in the context of firearm regulation. While supporters of the bills emphasized their potential to save lives and improve public safety, opponents raised valid concerns about privacy, due process, and unintended consequences. The discussions underscored the complexity of crafting legislation that addresses these issues effectively while respecting individual rights.
