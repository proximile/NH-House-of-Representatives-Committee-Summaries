### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 1050 and HB 150: Voluntary "Do Not Sell" List for Firearms**
These bills propose the creation of a voluntary "do not sell" list, allowing individuals at risk of self-harm to prevent themselves from purchasing firearms during mental health crises. Key points include:
- **Purpose**: Reduce firearm-related suicides by limiting access to lethal means during vulnerable periods.
- **Voluntary Nature**: Individuals can add or remove themselves from the list, with a 60-day waiting period and 21-day processing time. Privacy protections are included.
- **Support**: Advocates, including mental health professionals and families affected by suicide, emphasized the bill’s potential to save lives. They cited bipartisan support in other states and surveys showing 46% of at-risk individuals would use such a list.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about coercion, legal liabilities, Second Amendment rights, and the $354,000 fiscal note. Some questioned the effectiveness, arguing suicides often occur during sudden crises rather than premeditated decisions.
- **Federal Integration**: The list would integrate with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), though concerns were raised about federal compliance with removal requests.

#### **House Bill 1711: Firearms and Mental Health Commitments**
This bill addresses firearm access for individuals involuntarily committed for mental illness and deemed dangerous. Key points include:
- **Current Law**: Federal law prohibits firearm possession for such individuals, but New Hampshire’s reporting to NICS has been inconsistent.
- **Proposed Changes**: The bill clarifies reporting to NICS and establishes a process for restoring firearm rights, including mental health evaluations and court approval.
- **Support**: Advocates, including psychiatric and medical societies, highlighted its potential to reduce gun violence and suicide, especially in light of recent tragedies like the NH Hospital shooting.
- **Opposition**: Critics argued the bill stigmatizes mental illness, infringes on Second Amendment rights, and may unfairly impact individuals with temporary mental health crises. Concerns were also raised about the ATF’s reliability and the restoration process.
- **Amendments**: Proposed changes aimed to streamline the restoration process, protect privacy, and ensure due process.

#### **House Bill 1186: Prohibiting Firearms Merchant Category Codes**
This bill seeks to ban the use of specific merchant category codes (MCCs) for tracking firearm purchases, citing privacy concerns and fears of creating a quasi-gun registry. Key points include:
- **Support**: Advocates, including the NRA, argued MCCs could lead to privacy violations, data breaches, and discrimination against gun owners.
- **Opposition**: Some testified in favor of firearm registration for public safety, but others countered that it infringes on privacy and constitutional rights.

#### **House Bill 1336: Firearms in Employer Parking Lots**
This bill allows employees to store firearms in their locked vehicles on employer property, balancing Second Amendment rights with employer liability concerns. Key points include:
- **Support**: Proponents argued employees should not be forced to disarm while commuting, especially in unsafe areas.
- **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about stolen firearms and suggested requiring locked cases within vehicles.

#### **House Bill 1337: Returning Firearms After Protective Orders**
This bill proposes changes to the process of returning firearms to individuals after domestic violence protective orders expire. Key points include:
- **Current Process**: Firearms are seized during protective orders, and individuals must request a court hearing to reclaim them.
- **Proposed Changes**: The bill shifts the burden to the plaintiff to object to firearm returns and aims to streamline the process, reducing bureaucratic hurdles.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the current process is overly burdensome and redundant, especially if individuals can legally purchase new firearms.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including domestic violence advocates, argued the bill increases risks to victims and undermines public safety.

#### **House Bill 1701: Annulment of Involuntary Mental Health Commitments**
This bill allows individuals with nonviolent involuntary mental health commitments to petition for annulment, treating the commitment as if it never occurred. Key points include:
- **Support**: Advocates emphasized reducing stigma and restoring rights for individuals who have recovered.
- **Concerns**: Opponents worried about the impact on medical records and continuity of care for individuals who may relapse.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Public Safety vs. Individual Rights**: Discussions consistently highlighted the tension between measures aimed at reducing gun violence and suicide and concerns about infringing on Second Amendment rights and privacy.
2. **Mental Health Stigma**: Many speakers emphasized the need to reduce stigma and improve mental health care rather than focusing solely on firearm restrictions.
3. **Practical Implementation**: Concerns about bureaucratic hurdles, federal compliance, and the effectiveness of proposed measures were recurring themes.
4. **Bipartisan Collaboration**: Some bills, like HB 150, reflected bipartisan support for balancing mental health interventions with individual rights.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing gun violence, mental health, and public safety in a way that respects constitutional rights and practical realities.

The committee’s discussions and amendments aimed to address these issues as the bills moved through the legislative process.
