The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 21, 2024, convened by the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, focused on several key pieces of legislation addressing criminal justice reform, public safety, and property rights. The discussions highlighted ongoing debates around cannabis offenses, protective custody for intoxicated individuals, employment restrictions for registered sex offenders, and the Open Fields Doctrine. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Cannabis Offenses and Search and Seizure (HB 1539)**
Representative Wheeler introduced **House Bill 1539**, which aims to annul, resentence, or discontinue prosecution for certain cannabis offenses. The bill addresses the inconsistency of legalizing cannabis while individuals remain incarcerated for related offenses. It includes provisions for resentencing and annulment of records for those convicted solely of cannabis charges, provided the offense does not exceed the legal possession limit. Police Chief Kevin Walsh testified, arguing that current search and seizure practices already ensure proper handling and that the bill is unnecessary. Committee members raised concerns about the bill’s scope, potential costs, and its impact on other charges (e.g., obstruction of justice). Historical context was provided, referencing the annulment process post-alcohol prohibition. Technical details and potential amendments were discussed to clarify possession limits and ensure the bill does not inadvertently raise possession limits or apply to felony drug trafficking offenses.

### **Protective Custody and Medical Emergencies (HB 1270)**
**House Bill 1270** addresses issues related to protective custody for intoxicated or incapacitated individuals and the responsibilities of county jails. The current statute requires jails to provide immediate medical and substance abuse assessments, which many jails lack the resources to fulfill. The bill proposes removing this requirement, allowing law enforcement to determine if a medical emergency exists and requiring hospital clearance for life-threatening conditions before lodging individuals in jail. Superintendent Doug Yaz of Cheshire County supported the bill, citing the impracticality of current requirements. However, Sheriff Bill Wright opposed the bill, expressing concerns about increased burdens on law enforcement and operational inefficiencies. The debate highlighted the tension between legal requirements, resource limitations, and the need to protect public safety while treating individuals humanely.

### **Employment Restrictions for Registered Sex Offenders (HB 1038)**
**House Bill 1038** aims to close a loophole that allows registered sex offenders to directly supervise or employ minors. The bill’s prime sponsor, Representative Lynn, emphasized its goal of protecting minors and sex offenders from potential risks. The committee discussed concerns about the bill’s version, with Representative Manning clarifying that the amended version from the previous year should be used. Representatives from the Department of Corrections and law enforcement indicated their support for the amended version. The bill is expected to move forward with further review.

### **Open Fields Doctrine and Property Rights (HB 1204)**
**House Bill 1204** seeks to modify the **Open Fields Doctrine**, which allows government officials to conduct warrantless searches on private land beyond the immediate curtilage of a home. The bill would require officials to obtain a warrant or the landowner’s permission before entering private property marked with "no trespassing" signs or similar markings. The sponsor, Representative Stone, argued that this change would better protect property rights and privacy. Robert Fer, a senior attorney from the Institute for Justice, testified in support of the bill, noting that many states have rejected the Open Fields Doctrine. The committee discussed potential issues, including the use of drones and body cameras, with some members suggesting amendments to align the bill with existing laws.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
The meeting underscored the ongoing challenges of balancing justice, public safety, and resource constraints. Key themes included the need for fairness in addressing past cannabis convictions, the practical limitations of jails and law enforcement in handling intoxicated individuals, the importance of protecting minors from potential risks posed by registered sex offenders, and the necessity of safeguarding property rights and privacy. The discussions highlighted the complexities of legislative reform and the importance of careful consideration and potential amendments to ensure that new laws are effective, fair, and practical. The committee plans to further review and refine these bills during the executive session.
