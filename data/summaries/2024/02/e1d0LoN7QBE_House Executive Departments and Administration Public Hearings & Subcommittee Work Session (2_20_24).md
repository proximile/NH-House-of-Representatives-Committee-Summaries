### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration Public Hearings & Subcommittee Work Session (2/20/24)

On February 20, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives held public hearings and subcommittee work sessions to discuss several bills, including **HB 1188**, **HB 1190**, **HB 1222**, and **HB 1408**. The discussions focused on professional licensing compacts, workforce shortages, telehealth, state control, and regulatory reforms. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes:

---

#### **Public Hearings:**
1. **HB 1188**:
   - **Objective**: Remove the English language proficiency requirement for Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) to enter the workforce.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that the current requirement excludes qualified caregivers, particularly new Americans, despite their ability to pass state exams and demonstrate essential communication skills. Removing this barrier would expand the LNA workforce.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents raised questions about patient safety and communication, but supporters emphasized that other safeguards, such as state exams, would ensure competency.
   - **Outcome**: The committee expressed support for the bill, with proposed amendments to address technical issues.

2. **HB 1190**:
   - **Objective**: Adopt the Interstate Social Work Licensure Compact, allowing social workers licensed in one compact state to practice in others.
   - **Support**: Proponents highlighted benefits such as improved continuity of care for clients (e.g., military families, college students, and remote workers), reduced administrative burdens, and addressing workforce shortages in mental health.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents questioned the potential loss of state control over licensing standards and the ability to maintain quality assurance.
   - **Outcome**: The bill received strong support, with assurances that licensure requirements would remain stringent and that the compact would enhance public safety through shared investigative and disciplinary data.

#### **Subcommittee Work Sessions:**
1. **HB 1222**:
   - **Objective**: Remove the requirement for Physician Assistants (PAs) to have a formal collaboration agreement with a physician, aligning their practice more closely with Nurse Practitioners (NPs).
   - **Support**: Testimonies from the Society of New Hampshire Physician Assistants and individual PAs argued that the collaboration agreement is redundant and burdensome, as PAs already collaborate with physicians in practice and carry their own malpractice insurance.
   - **Concerns**: The New Hampshire Medical Society and the American Medical Association (AMA) opposed the bill, citing differences in training between PAs and physicians and emphasizing the importance of physician oversight for patient safety.
   - **Amendment**: The subcommittee approved **Amendment 0454H** to clarify the bill's intent.
   - **Outcome**: The subcommittee voted unanimously in favor of the bill with the amendment, recommending its passage.

2. **HB 1408**:
   - **Objective**: Restructure various boards, including merging mental health-related boards and altering membership requirements.
   - **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the complexity and potential unintended consequences of merging mental health boards without sufficient analysis.
   - **Outcome**: The subcommittee voted unanimously to recommend an **interim study** for HB 1408, allowing more time to evaluate and coordinate with related bills.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes:**
- **Workforce Mobility and Licensing Compacts**: Bills like HB 1190 and HB 1222 aim to improve workforce flexibility by reducing barriers to practice across state lines and eliminating outdated regulatory requirements. These measures are seen as critical to addressing workforce shortages, particularly in mental health and social work.
- **State Control and Public Safety**: While licensing compacts and regulatory reforms offer benefits, concerns were raised about maintaining state sovereignty, ensuring public safety, and balancing the roles of state and interstate regulations.
- **Telehealth and Continuity of Care**: Licensing compacts were highlighted as facilitators of telehealth services, allowing clients to maintain care with their providers even when traveling or relocating.
- **Costs and Fees**: Discussions included the nominal fees associated with licensing compacts, with assurances that these could be passed on to licensees if necessary.
- **Interim Study for Complex Reforms**: HB 1408 was deemed too complex for immediate action, leading to a recommendation for further study to ensure thoughtful and coordinated implementation.

#### **Conclusion:**
The meeting underscored the importance of modernizing licensing and regulatory frameworks to address workforce shortages, improve access to care, and reduce administrative burdens. While significant support was expressed for bills like HB 1188, HB 1190, and HB 1222, the discussions also highlighted the need for careful consideration of state control, public safety, and the practical implications of these reforms. The subcommitteeâ€™s decisions to advance HB 1222 and recommend further study for HB 1408 reflect a balanced approach to addressing these complex issues.
