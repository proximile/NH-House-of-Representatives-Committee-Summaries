**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/20/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 20, 2024, to discuss and vote on a range of bills addressing environmental, agricultural, and animal welfare issues. The meeting featured extensive debates, public testimony, and committee decisions on key legislative proposals. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **Environmental and Waste Management Issues**
1. **HB 1376**: This bill aimed to prohibit certain packaging from carrying the recycling logo if it did not meet specific recycling thresholds. Concerns about enforceability and potential impacts on recycling rates led the committee to recommend an "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) motion, effectively halting the bill.

2. **HB 1681**: Proposed regulations on products labeled as biodegradable or compostable, requiring third-party certification. Due to jurisdictional issues and the inability to amend the bill effectively, the committee voted ITL, suggesting the sponsor collaborate with the Commerce Committee.

3. **HB 1687**: An amendment clarified definitions of hazardous waste and materials in state contracts. The committee adopted the amendment and voted to recommend the bill with an "Ought to Pass with Amendment" (OTPA) motion.

4. **HB 1132**: This bill proposed a moratorium on new landfill permits until 2031, later amended to 2028. The committee discussed the need for a pause to allow for rule updates and environmental considerations, ultimately voting OTPA.

5. **HB 1221**: Aimed to include solid waste landfills in the definition of "development of regional impact," requiring broader notification and public involvement. Concerns about the 20-mile notification radius led to suggestions for refining the language.

6. **HB 1145**: Proposed prohibiting private ownership of landfills, advocating for state or public ownership to better control waste management. Supporters argued for enhanced transparency, while critics raised concerns about state overreach and costs.

7. **HB 1632**: Sought to limit the amount of out-of-state solid waste deposited in New Hampshire landfills. The bill was discussed alongside HB 1145, with representatives favoring strategies to reduce out-of-state waste.

8. **Landfill Ownership**: A proposal to mandate 50% public ownership of landfills sparked debate. Supporters highlighted the need for better waste management control, while critics questioned enforceability and economic impacts.

#### **Recycling Initiatives**
1. **HB 1504**: Focused on establishing a paint recycling program and stewardship organization, modeled after successful programs in states like Vermont and Maine. The committee discussed industry buy-in, pilot programs, and implementation challenges, agreeing to gather more stakeholder input.

2. **HB 1386**: Prohibited the disposal of lithium-ion batteries in landfills, composting facilities, or incinerators. The committee adopted an amendment clarifying liability for accidental disposal and expanded the definition of electronic waste, passing the bill unanimously.

#### **Animal Welfare and Wildlife Issues**
1. **HB 1351**: Proposed banning the sale and use of adhesive-based rodent traps (glue traps) due to their inhumane nature. Testimony highlighted the cruelty of glue traps and their impact on non-target wildlife. Alternatives like snap traps and live traps were discussed, with suggestions to restrict glue traps to enclosed areas.

2. **HB 1325**: Sought to allow private ownership of exotic animals (e.g., monkeys, raccoons, foxes) without permits. Opponents raised concerns about public health, animal welfare, and the potential for illegal trade, while proponents emphasized personal responsibility. The bill faced significant opposition.

3. **Animal Abuse Registry**: Two bills (HB 1505 and related proposals) aimed to create a public registry of individuals convicted of animal cruelty. Supporters argued it would help law enforcement and shelters identify abusers, while opponents raised concerns about costs, effectiveness, and potential misuse. The debate highlighted the need for better enforcement of existing animal cruelty laws.

4. **Glue Traps and Rodent Control**: Testimony from the Department of Agriculture emphasized the role of glue traps in integrated pest management programs, particularly in agriculture. However, concerns about unintended harm to wildlife led to discussions about restricting their use to enclosed areas.
