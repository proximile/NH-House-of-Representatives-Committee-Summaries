**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (February 6, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on February 6, 2024, to discuss a range of transportation-related bills. The meeting addressed issues spanning public safety, environmental compliance, local governance, and the preservation of historical infrastructure. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and debates:

---

### **1. Speed Limit Regulations**
The committee examined two bills related to speed limits:
- **House Bill 1063**: This bill proposed that driving within 10 MPH over the speed limit be considered "reasonable and prudent," creating a buffer zone before ticketing. Supporters, including Representative Hines, argued that strict enforcement of minor violations is impractical and could lead to pretextual stops. Opponents, including AAA Northern New England, the NH State Police, and the NH Department of Transportation (DOT), raised safety concerns, citing increased crash severity and fatalities at higher speeds. They also noted that the bill could undermine engineering-based speed limits and risk federal funding.
- **House Bill 1550**: This bill would allow municipalities to seasonally reduce speed limits to 20 MPH on certain roads for up to four months, particularly in congested areas like those near lakes. Representative Eel emphasized local control and safety benefits, with support from the NH Municipal Association. Concerns centered on the process for implementing these changes and ensuring public awareness.

### **2. Vehicle Inspections and Emissions**
The committee discussed two bills aimed at reforming vehicle inspection and emissions requirements:
- **House Bill 1403**: Proposed extending the waiver period for vehicle emissions inspections from 60 to 90 days. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) highlighted the need for federal approval and potential risks to Clean Air Act compliance.
- **House Bill 1637**: Sought to ease vehicle inspection requirements, including decoupling inspection stickers from birth months and addressing non-safety-related criteria like cosmetic rust and headlamp cracks. Sponsor Representative Leah Kushman emphasized the financial burden on low-income individuals, while the DES raised concerns about increased emissions from older vehicles. The NH Auto Dealers Association opposed the bill, arguing that the current system ensures safety. Proposed amendments included creating an appeals process and clarifying inspection guidelines.

### **3. Public Health and Safety**
Several bills focused on protecting public health, particularly for children:
- **House Bill 1244**: Aimed to prohibit smoking and vaping in vehicles with passengers under 16. Youth advocates from the Dover Youth Organization highlighted the health risks of secondhand and thirdhand smoke. The bill specifies enforcement as a secondary offense, meaning it would only be applied during other traffic stops.
- **House Bill 1467**: Proposed upgrading seat belt laws for children under 18, requiring rear-facing car seats for children under 2 and booster seats for older children. The bill also addressed older vehicles without seat belts.

### **4. Preservation of Historic Covered Bridges**
The committee addressed the ongoing issue of oversized vehicles damaging historic covered bridges, particularly the Cornish-Windsor Covered Bridge:
- **House Bill 1457**: Proposed increasing fines for vehicles damaging covered bridges by exceeding height, weight, or dimensional limits. The current fine of $62 was deemed insufficient, with suggestions to raise it to $1,000. Additional measures included installing video surveillance, placing warning signs further back, and narrowing intersections to prevent large vehicles from accessing bridges.
- **Companion Bill**: Proposed allowing video surveillance on bridges to identify vehicles causing damage, particularly in hit-and-run incidents. The NH Municipal Association and the National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges supported these efforts, emphasizing the widespread issue of bridge damage nationwide.

### **5. Military Recruitment Transparency**
**House Bill 1247** sparked significant debate:
- The bill would require driver's licensing locations and schools hosting military recruiters to display information about Selective Service registration and casualty statistics from recent conflicts.
- Military and veteran organizations, including the NH National Guard and the State Veterans Council, strongly opposed the bill, arguing it misrepresents military service and could deter recruits during a time of recruiting challenges.
- Sponsor Representative Tom Manion defended the bill as providing transparency, ensuring potential recruits have a full picture of military service risks and realities. Critics countered that the bill lacks balance and could harm national security.

### **6. Broader Themes and Concerns**
Throughout the meeting, recurring themes included:
- **Balancing Safety and Burden**: Discussions often centered on finding a balance between ensuring public safety and reducing financial and logistical burdens on residents.
- **Federal Compliance**: Many bills raised concerns about aligning state laws with federal regulations, particularly regarding emissions standards and military recruiting.
- **Local Control**: Several bills emphasized the importance of local governance, such as allowing municipalities to set seasonal speed limits.
- **Historical Preservation**: The protection of historic covered bridges emerged as a priority, with discussions on enforcement, fines, and preventive measures.
