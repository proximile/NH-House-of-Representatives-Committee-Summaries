### **House Bill 1283: Medical Aid in Dying**
**Overview**: The bill would allow mentally capable, terminally ill adults with a prognosis of six months or less to live to request and self-administer life-ending medication. It includes safeguards such as two independent medical opinions, mental health evaluations, and a waiting period.

#### **Support for the Bill**:
- **Compassion and Autonomy**: Supporters, including medical professionals like **Dr. William Palmer** and **Dr. Cynthia Barbarat**, emphasized the bill’s role in providing terminally ill patients with dignity, autonomy, and relief from unbearable suffering. They highlighted the strict eligibility criteria and voluntary participation for both patients and providers.
- **Personal Stories**: Many shared emotional testimonies, such as **Bonnie Leva**, who recounted her husband’s painful death from brain cancer, and **Betsy McConnell**, who spoke of her father’s struggle with ALS. These stories underscored the need for a compassionate end-of-life option.
- **Precedent in Other States**: Representatives from Vermont and Oregon, where similar laws exist, testified that these laws have been implemented without abuse and provide significant relief to patients and families.

#### **Opposition to the Bill**:
- **Ethical and Moral Concerns**: Opponents, including **Shannon McGinley** of Cornerstone Action and **Steve Wade** of the Brain Injury Association of New Hampshire, argued that the bill undermines the sanctity of life, risks normalizing suicide, and could disproportionately affect vulnerable populations like veterans and individuals with disabilities.
- **Slippery Slope**: Critics, including **Dr. John Edinger**, warned of a potential expansion of eligibility, citing examples from Canada and the Netherlands where MAID laws have broadened beyond terminal illness.
- **Palliative Care Alternatives**: Many opponents, such as **Paul Drager**, advocated for improving access to palliative and hospice care, arguing that these services can adequately address end-of-life suffering without resorting to assisted suicide.

#### **Key Themes**:
- The debate highlighted deep divisions between those prioritizing individual autonomy and compassion for terminally ill patients and those concerned about ethical, societal, and practical risks. The committee heard extensive testimony but did not reach a decision during the session.

### **House Bill 1020: Mental Health Competency and Insanity Laws**
**Overview**: The bill seeks to establish a commission to modernize New Hampshire’s outdated laws on insanity and competency, which date back to 1871.

#### **Key Points**:
- **Support**: **Representative Mark Pearson** and **Holly Stevens** from NAMI New Hampshire emphasized the urgent need to update these laws, particularly with the upcoming opening of a forensic hospital. They highlighted the lack of a formal restoration process for individuals deemed incompetent to stand trial.
- **Expert Testimony**: **Jim Bomersbach**, a forensic psychologist, advocated for including psychologists in the commission, noting their critical role in competency and insanity evaluations.
- **Debate**: Some committee members questioned the efficiency of a commission versus a legislative committee, but supporters argued that a commission would bring together necessary expertise.

### **House Bill 1082: Professional Limited Liability Company Assistant Manager Status**
**Overview**: The bill aims to allow single-member professional limited liability companies (PLLCs) to designate an assistant manager who is not required to be a licensed professional in the field.

#### **Key Points**:
- **Issue Addressed**: Currently, if the sole manager of a PLLC becomes incapacitated or dies, there is no one legally authorized to manage or dissolve the business unless they are a licensed professional.
- **Proposed Solution**: The bill would allow the designation of an assistant manager (e.g., a spouse or trusted individual) who can manage the business for up to one year in the event of the manager's incapacity or death.
- **Testimony**: **Roger Gown**, whose wife is a veterinarian, testified about the difficulties of managing a PLLC without a non-professional assistant manager.

### **House Bill 1089: Statute of Limitations on Civil Actions Involving PFAS**
**Overview**: The bill proposes removing the six-year statute of limitations for civil actions related to damages caused by PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).

#### **Key Points**:
- **Support**: Advocates, including students and residents from affected areas like **Merrimack** and **Londonderry**, argued that PFAS-related injuries often manifest years after exposure, making the current statute of limitations inadequate.
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including a representative from the **American Tort Reform Association**, argued that removing the statute of limitations would disrupt the civil justice system and make it difficult for defendants to mount a fair defense.
- **Broader Implications**: The bill would allow claims to be filed indefinitely, raising concerns about its impact on small businesses and insurers.

### **Conclusion**:
The meeting highlighted the complexity and emotional weight of the issues discussed, particularly the deeply polarizing debate over medical aid in dying. While supporters emphasized compassion and autonomy, opponents raised ethical, societal, and practical concerns. The committee also addressed the need for modernizing mental health laws, protecting small businesses, and ensuring accountability for PFAS contamination. Further deliberation and potential revisions are expected before any decisions are made.
