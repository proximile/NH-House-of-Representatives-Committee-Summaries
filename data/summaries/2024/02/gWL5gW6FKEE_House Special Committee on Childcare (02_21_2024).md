The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare met on February 21, 2024, to discuss several bills and amendments related to childcare policies. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and procedural remarks. Key discussions and actions included:

1. **House Bill 1407 – Childcare Staffing Ratios**:  
   - Representative Wallner introduced an amendment to create a waiver system allowing childcare facilities to add an extra child when two providers are present for infants and toddlers. The waiver would be open to all providers without limits or fees and would sunset on December 31, 2026.  
   - The committee discussed the amendment, with members supporting it as a pilot program to address childcare shortages while collecting data for future decisions.  
   - The amendment was adopted unanimously, and the amended bill was passed with a 9-0 vote.

2. **House Bill 1056 – Dyslexia-Related Amendment**:  
   - Representative Wallner introduced a non-germane amendment, and a public hearing was scheduled for two weeks later.

3. **House Bill 1405 – Publication of Childcare Violations**:  
   - The committee discussed a bill aimed at limiting the publication of childcare violations, which was brought forward due to concerns about insurance rate increases for facilities.  
   - The bill was deemed premature, and the committee voted 10-0 to recommend it as "inexpedient to legislate," placing it on the consent calendar.

4. **House Bill 1409 – Advisory Council Review of Childcare Violations**:  
   - This bill proposed an appeals process for childcare violations outside the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  
   - The committee debated whether to kill the bill or keep it alive as a "vehicle" for future work. It was ultimately recessed for further discussion, with plans to gather more information from DHHS and other agencies.

5. **House Bill 1584**:  
   - The committee recessed discussion on this bill to a future meeting.

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene in two weeks for a public hearing on the non-germane amendment to HB 1056 and to finalize other pending votes. The committee emphasized the need for further research and collaboration with DHHS and other stakeholders to address childcare concerns effectively.
