### **Key Topics and Discussions**

1. **Charitable Gaming**

   - The Lottery Commission provides a breakdown of charitable distributions, which can reach up to 133% depending on the game.

2. **Watercraft Safety Rules**  
   - The Department of Safety proposed revisions to address examination requirements for commercial boat operators with federal licenses.  
   - Non-rule language was removed, and definitions were clarified.  
   - The committee supported the revised objection but noted the need for legislative fixes, particularly regarding practical exams and replacement decal fees.  

3. **Agricultural Land Acquisition**  
   - A rule requiring landowners to submit construction or alteration requests to the commissioner was clarified.

4. **Food Production and Distribution**  
   - A legislative intent issue was identified concerning exemptions for retail food stores.  
   - HB 1565 was mentioned as a potential vehicle to address this oversight.  

5. **Visual Arts Teachers Interim Rule**  
   - The interim rule was filed to minimize the period of expiration following the lapse of the previous rule.

   - Concerns were raised about the clarity and legislative intent of the Department of Safety’s rules.  
   - Specific issues included the automatic revocation of non-resident licenses upon moving to New Hampshire and the timeline for appealing license suspensions or revocations.  

7. **Public Testimony and Concerns**  
   - Public testimony highlighted issues such as subjective language, unclear criteria for license suspensions, and the handling of non-resident licenses.  
   - Testimony also addressed concerns about the differentiation between Bingo and Lucky 7 consultants and the need for clearer guidelines.
