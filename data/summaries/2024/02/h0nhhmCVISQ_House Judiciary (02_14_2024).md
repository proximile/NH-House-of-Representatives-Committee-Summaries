### **Comprehensive Summary of NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting (February 14, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on February 14, 2024, to discuss several significant bills addressing education, housing, criminal justice, law enforcement accountability, and environmental regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and debates:

---

### **House Bill 1353: Subpoena Power for the Commissioner of Education**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to grant the Commissioner of Education subpoena power to investigate alleged violations of the Educator Code of Conduct.
- **Support**: Proponents, including the Department of Education (DOE), argued that subpoena power is necessary to compel cooperation from school districts, particularly in cases of serious misconduct. They emphasized it would be used as a "tool of last resort" in formal investigations.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including educators and unions, expressed concerns about due process, potential abuse of power, and the chilling effect on teachers. They argued that the DOE already has cooperative relationships with school districts and that subpoena power is unnecessary.
- **Key Concerns**: The bill’s broad language, lack of safeguards (e.g., attorney general oversight), and potential for unwarranted investigations were highlighted. Opponents suggested alternative approaches, such as transferring oversight to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).

### **House Bill 1115: Landlord-Tenant Lease Terms**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to allow landlords to evict tenants at the end of a lease without cause, overturning a NH Supreme Court decision that currently requires "good cause" for evictions.
- **Support**: Sponsors argued the bill would give landlords more flexibility to manage properties and address problematic tenants, potentially encouraging landlords to rent to higher-risk tenants.
- **Opposition**: Housing advocates, legal experts, and community members strongly opposed the bill, citing concerns about housing instability, homelessness, and discrimination. They highlighted New Hampshire’s severe housing shortage (6% rental vacancy rate) and rising homelessness (52% increase in 2023).
- **Key Concerns**: The bill was criticized for disproportionately harming vulnerable populations, including low-income families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. Opponents noted landlords already have tools to evict tenants for legitimate reasons.

---

### **House Bill 1368: Rent-Setting Software and Eviction Protections**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses concerns about landlords using proprietary rent-setting software (e.g., YieldStar) that may enable price-fixing. It would allow tenants to inspect software source code during eviction proceedings.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill would ensure transparency and prevent unjust evictions based on artificially inflated rents.
- **Key Concerns**: The bill aims to protect tenants from potential collusion among landlords while aligning with federal efforts to address similar issues.

---

### **House Bill 1497: Plea Bargain Sentencing Limits**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prevent the "trial penalty," where defendants who reject plea bargains and go to trial receive harsher sentences. It would limit judges to imposing sentences no more than 10% above the plea offer.
- **Support**: Sponsors argued the bill would protect defendants’ Sixth Amendment rights and reduce coercion in plea bargaining.
- **Key Concerns**: The bill aims to address systemic issues in the criminal justice system, ensuring fairness for defendants who choose to exercise their right to a trial.

---

### **House Bill 1640: Qualified Immunity for Government Employees**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to limit qualified immunity, holding government employees accountable for constitutional violations while shifting liability to the state or local government.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that qualified immunity often shields misconduct and that the bill would restore accountability. They emphasized it would protect employees from personal financial ruin by shifting liability to employers.
- **Opposition**: Law enforcement representatives, firefighters, and municipal associations strongly opposed the bill, citing concerns about increased litigation, a chilling effect on public safety decisions, and workforce retention challenges.
- **Key Concerns**: Opponents warned the bill could discourage proactive policing and exacerbate existing shortages in critical public service roles.

---

### **House Bill 1614: Judicial Review of DES Decisions**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes adopting a broader "arbitrary and capricious" standard for judicial review of Department of Environmental Services (DES) decisions, reducing deference to agency rulings.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill would ensure a fairer process for challenging DES decisions, particularly in cases involving complex scientific or economic data.
- **Opposition**: DES and DOJ representatives opposed the bill, citing concerns about increased litigation, confusion, and the potential to lower the bar for challenging decisions.
- **Key Concerns**: The bill’s inconsistency with existing laws and its potential impact on the appeals process were highlighted.

---

### **House Bill 1602: Housing Appeals Board Authority**
- **Purpose**: The bill would expand the Housing Appeals Board’s authority to review decisions by state agencies, including DES.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill would expedite housing projects by providing a streamlined appeals process.
- **Opposition**: DES representatives expressed concerns about federal compliance (e.g., Clean Water Act) and the Housing Appeals Board’s lack of expertise in complex environmental issues.
- **Key Concerns**: The bill’s potential to complicate the appeals process and disrupt federal programs was emphasized. Proposed amendments aim to clarify the board’s authority.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
1. **Education Accountability**: HB 1353 sparked debate over balancing accountability for educators with protecting due process and avoiding abuse of power.
2. **Housing Stability**: HB 1115 and HB 1368 highlighted tensions between landlord flexibility and tenant protections in the context of New Hampshire’s housing crisis.
3. **Criminal Justice Reform**: HB 1497 addressed systemic issues in plea bargaining, aiming to protect defendants’ constitutional rights.
4. **Law Enforcement Accountability**: HB 1640 centered on balancing accountability for government employees with protecting them from excessive liability.
5. **Environmental Regulation**: HB 1614 and HB 1602 focused on the fairness and efficiency of the appeals process for DES decisions, with concerns about federal compliance and expertise.

The committee concluded with plans for further discussion, potential amendments, and consideration of broader implications for public safety, housing, and environmental regulation.
