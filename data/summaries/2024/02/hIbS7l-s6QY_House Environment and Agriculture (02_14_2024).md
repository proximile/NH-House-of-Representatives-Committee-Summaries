**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/14/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee meeting on February 14, 2024, focused on a series of bills addressing solid waste management, landfill regulation, and environmental protection. The discussions highlighted the state’s efforts to tackle the influx of out-of-state waste, improve landfill permitting processes, and mitigate the environmental impacts of waste disposal. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

---

### **Key Issues and Themes**
1. **Out-of-State Waste Management**:
   - A significant portion (45-50%) of waste in New Hampshire landfills originates from out of state, raising concerns about environmental degradation, landfill lifespan, and the state’s carbon footprint.
   - Proposals to limit out-of-state waste included **House Bill 1632**, which would restrict newly permitted landfills from accepting more than 15% of waste from out of state, and **House Bill 1145**, which proposes state-owned landfills to control waste intake. Both bills aim to reduce New Hampshire’s reliance on out-of-state waste while addressing legal concerns under the Commerce Clause.

2. **Public Ownership of Landfills**:
   - **HB 1145** advocates for public ownership of new landfills, allowing the state to control waste management policies and strategically site landfills to reduce transportation costs. Private landfills would be grandfathered in, with private companies contracted to manage operations. The bill sparked debate over potential costs, liability, and the use of eminent domain.

3. **Community Impact and Transparency**:
   - **HB 1221** seeks to include landfills in the definition of "development of regional impact," requiring notifications to communities within a 20-mile radius and the same watershed as a proposed landfill. The bill aims to enhance public input and transparency in the landfill permitting process. Concerns were raised about the arbitrariness of the 20-mile radius and the lack of clear watershed definitions.
   - Testimony from Wayne Morrison of the North Country Alliance for Balanced Change emphasized the broader impact of landfills on surrounding communities, including noise, smell, and traffic, and the need for stronger community voices in decision-making.

4. **Environmental Concerns and "Forever Chemicals"**:
   - The committee discussed the long-term environmental impact of "forever chemicals" (PFAS) leaking from landfills and the need for solutions to mitigate their spread. A target date of 2028 was agreed upon for implementing changes to address these concerns.

5. **Legislative Cleanup and Clarifications**:
   - **HB 1490** proposed clarifications to the Solid Waste Management Act, including amending the definition of "abutter," clarifying "end-of-life motor vehicle," and providing the Department of Environmental Services (DES) with explicit authority to terminate permits for closed facilities. The bill was seen as a necessary cleanup of existing statutes.

6. **Interim Studies and Further Exploration**:
   - Several bills, including **HB 1170** (public benefit and community impact assessments for permits) and **HB 1620** (moratorium on new landfill permits until 2031), were suggested for interim study to allow for more thorough examination. The committee also discussed the potential for repurposing brownfield sites for productive uses like solar farms, with a suggestion for DES to provide a presentation on brownfield programs.

7. **Advanced Recycling and Waste Diversion**:
   - The committee debated the terminology and process of "advanced recycling," which involves converting waste into chemical products for new plastics and lubricants. There was also a call for increased investment in recycling, composting, and other waste diversion strategies to reduce reliance on landfills.

### **Key Bills and Proposals**
- **HB 1632**: Limits out-of-state waste in newly permitted landfills to 15%.
- **HB 1145**: Proposes state ownership of new landfills to control waste intake.
- **HB 1221**: Enhances public input and transparency in landfill permitting by requiring notifications to communities within a 20-mile radius and the same watershed.
- **HB 1490**: Clarifies definitions and cleanup language in the Solid Waste Management Act.
- **HB 1170**: Requires public benefit and community impact assessments for permits.
- **HB 1620**: Proposes a moratorium on new landfill permits until 2031.

### **Next Steps**
The committee concluded the hearing with plans for further work sessions to refine the bills and address concerns raised during the discussions. Amendments were proposed to clarify definitions, adjust notification requirements, and ensure the bills align with legal and practical considerations. The committee also considered a field trip to waste management facilities in Massachusetts to better understand operational challenges and solutions.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to balancing environmental protection, waste management, and community impacts. The discussions reflected a broader effort to address New Hampshire’s waste management challenges, particularly the influx of out-of-state waste, while ensuring transparency, public participation, and sustainable solutions.
