**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (February 13, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 13, 2024, to discuss and vote on several key energy-related bills and amendments. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and procedural announcements, followed by detailed discussions on amendments, energy policy, and nuclear technology. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the session:

### **Key Discussions and Votes**

1. **House Bill 1644 (Nuclear Energy)**  
   - **Amendment 0610 H**: The committee adopted this amendment, which allows newly built nuclear power facilities to qualify for Class I renewable energy credits under the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). While nuclear energy is not technically renewable, supporters argued it is a significant zero-emission energy source and signals New Hampshire’s openness to nuclear energy as part of its future energy mix. Critics raised concerns about classifying nuclear as renewable and its potential economic and environmental impacts. The amendment passed with a vote of 19-1, and the bill itself passed with a 17-3 vote.

2. **House Bill 1431 (Integrated Distribution Planning)**  
   - **Amendment 0663**: This amendment added natural gas to the bill and streamlined language related to energy policy and utility planning. It removed references to transmission lines (a federal responsibility) and emphasized cost-effective energy efficiency, competitive electricity suppliers, and gas utilities. The amendment also reduced the timeline for utilities to amend and resubmit plans from six to three months. Concerns were raised about removing language that would prevent utilities from changing distribution rates until plans were approved, but it was clarified that this could pose constitutional issues. The amendment passed unanimously (20-0), and the bill was also approved unanimously with the amendment.

3. **House Bill 1465 (Nuclear Energy Technologies)**  
   - The bill, relative to studies of nuclear energy technologies, was amended to streamline reporting responsibilities and create a Coordinator of Nuclear Development and Regulatory Activities. The amendment aimed to consolidate efforts and avoid redundancy. Concerns were raised about the potential costs and scope of the bill, but it was ultimately passed with a 17-3 vote.

### **Procedural Matters and Future Planning**

- **Amendment Voting Process**: The committee clarified that amendments require a vote, either by roll call, show of hands, or voice vote, with votes recorded for each member.
- **ISO New England Trip**: Representative Bernardi updated the committee on a planned trip to ISO New England, a regional grid operator, to discuss energy issues. Members discussed logistics and topics of interest, such as nuclear oversight and energy auctions.
- **Upcoming Meetings**: The committee scheduled its next meeting for February 20, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., with a full work session on three remaining bills and an executive session at 1:00 p.m.
- **Other Notes**: A poll was conducted to determine attendance for an ISO New England event on March 15. The meeting concluded with reminders for committee members to submit reports and prepare for the next session.

### **Themes and Takeaways**

The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on integrating new energy technologies, ensuring regulatory efficiency, and balancing environmental protection with the state’s energy future. Discussions emphasized the importance of long-term energy planning, cost-effectiveness, and diversifying energy resources to ensure reliability and affordability. The amendments and votes reflected a commitment to streamlining processes while addressing concerns about oversight and environmental impact.

Overall, the session underscored the complexities of energy policy and the committee’s efforts to navigate these challenges while promoting innovation and sustainability in New Hampshire’s energy landscape.
