The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 6, 2024, focused on a series of bills aimed at improving election laws, campaign finance transparency, voter accessibility, and election integrity. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and proposals:

---

### **Election Accessibility and Voter Integrity**
1. **House Bill 119**: This bill seeks to remove age-related restrictions for voting accessibility, emphasizing that weather-related challenges affect voters of all ages. It received support from city clerks and organizations like Open Democracy, which highlighted similar legislation (Senate Bill 535).

2. **House Bill 1074**: Addressing absentee voting during severe weather, this bill proposes modifying the absentee ballot application form to clarify that voters can request a ballot for safety concerns without needing to claim they are elderly, infirm, or disabled. It also allows town clerks to extend office hours during winter storm warnings. While supported by organizations like the League of Women Voters, opponents raised constitutional concerns and questioned the necessity given existing moderator authority to postpone elections.

3. **House Bill 1133**: This bill aims to allow military personnel and their families to email absentee ballots instead of mailing them. Supporters argued it would ease voting for those in challenging environments like submarines or hostile areas, though concerns about ballot security and privacy led to calls for further study.

4. **House Bill 1369**: This bill proposes reducing the mandatory voter checklist verification interval from every 10 years to every 4 years to ensure more accurate voter rolls. Proponents argued that the current interval leads to inflated rolls, while opponents warned it could disenfranchise infrequent voters. The Secretary of State suggested a 6-year interval as a compromise.

5. **House Bill 1146**: This bill establishes a process for voters to request their removal from the voter checklist, addressing a gap in current law. While supporters emphasized voter autonomy, opponents raised concerns about potential misuse to bypass party affiliation deadlines.

### **Campaign Finance Transparency**
1. **House Bill 1239**: This bill improves campaign finance transparency by requiring candidates to report even if they spend less than $1,000 or have no financial activity during a reporting period. It was supported for enhancing accountability.

2. **House Bill 1147**: This bill standardizes campaign contribution rules for labor unions and business organizations, requiring both to use segregated funds for political donations. It aligns with a 1999 court ruling (Kennedy v. Gardner) and aims to ensure equal treatment and transparency.

3. **House Bill 1074**: This bill closes a loophole allowing individuals to bypass campaign finance limits by donating through LLCs. It requires LLC contributions to be attributed to individual members based on ownership percentages, enhancing transparency.

### **Election Integrity and Security**
1. **House Bill 1442**: This bill proposes stricter accountability measures for election officials who violate election laws, aiming to reinforce electoral integrity. Supporters argued it would deter violations, while opponents warned it could discourage volunteers due to the complexity of election procedures.

2. **House Bill 1596**: This bill addresses the use of deceptive artificial intelligence (AI) in political advertising, requiring disclosure of manipulated media within 90 days of an election. It aims to combat deep fakes and other misleading content while exempting news broadcasts, satire, and parody.

3. **House Bill 1370**: This bill proposes the use of durable, tamper-proof containers for ballot storage to address deficiencies in current cardboard boxes. It aims to ensure secure handling and storage of ballots, with discussions focusing on sealing methods and implementation timelines.

4. **House Bill 1364**: This bill strengthens protections for election workers against intimidation and retaliation, including provisions against doxing and unauthorized access to voter registration systems. It addresses the nationwide trend of election workers leaving their roles due to increased threats.

### **Redistricting and Transparency**
1. **Redistricting Debate**: The House debated a redistricting bill, with some representatives advocating for transparency and fairness through independent processes, while others argued that redistricting is inherently political and should remain under legislative control. A motion to pass the bill as amended failed, and the bill was reported out of committee with no recommendation.

- **Voter Accessibility**: Efforts were made to improve voter access, particularly for military personnel, those affected by severe weather, and individuals seeking to remove themselves from voter rolls.

- **Balancing Interests**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance election integrity with voter access and the practical challenges faced by election officials.
