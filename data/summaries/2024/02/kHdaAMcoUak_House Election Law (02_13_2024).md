The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a comprehensive meeting on February 13, 2024, focusing on various election law-related bills. The session, led by the House Election Law Committee, included public hearings, discussions, and votes on multiple legislative proposals aimed at enhancing election integrity, voter registration, political advertising, and partisan elections. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Election Integrity and Ballot Reconciliation**
- **Ballot Reconciliation and Security**: The committee emphasized the importance of reconciling ballots to ensure election integrity. Concerns were raised about the uncertainty caused by the inability to fully reconcile printed ballots, which could undermine confidence in the election process. The Secretary of State, David Scanlan, explained the ballot production process, including tracking the number of ballots printed, used, and disposed of, as well as handling overrun and spoiled ballots.
- **Inventory Control of Ballots**: A bill proposing a comprehensive inventory control system for paper ballots, from printing to reconciliation, was discussed. Proponents argued this would enhance transparency, though some questioned its necessity given existing tracking systems at polling places.

### **2. Voter Registration and Eligibility**
- **Voter Roll Maintenance**: The committee debated the frequency of purging voter rolls, with some representatives advocating for a four-year cycle instead of the current ten-year cycle. Concerns were raised about potential disenfranchisement, and a bill proposing interim study on the matter was discussed.
- **House Bill 1149**: This bill seeks to undo previous legislation that restricted voting rights, particularly affecting college students and other transient populations, ensuring all residents have the right to vote regardless of how long they’ve lived in a community.

---

### **3. Political Advertising and Campaign Finance**
- **House Bill 1092**: This bill creates a period for placing and removing political advertising on public property. The discussion centered on clarifying rules for political signage in public spaces, with debates about First Amendment rights and the definition of public versus private property.
- **House Bill 1091**: Aimed at streamlining and clarifying New Hampshire’s campaign finance laws, this bill seeks to improve transparency, reduce inconsistencies, and clarify definitions. A subcommittee worked on it over the summer, and further amendments are expected.

---

### **4. Partisan Elections for School Districts**
- **House Bill 1099**: This bill allows for partisan school district elections, mirroring existing laws for partisan town elections. Proponents argued it would increase voter engagement and provide clarity on candidates' affiliations, while opponents, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association, expressed concerns about politicizing school board roles and reducing the pool of candidates.

---

### **5. Training for Election Officials**
- **House Bill 1381**: This bill mandates training for election officials to ensure proper administration of elections. The Secretary of State already offers training, but attendance is often low. The bill seeks to codify training requirements and document participation, though enforcement mechanisms remain unclear.

---

### **6. Specific Bills and Amendments**
- **House Bill 1074**: An amendment correcting a Roman numeral error was adopted, but the bill failed to pass and was reported out without recommendation.
- **House Bill 1348**: This bill proposes to negate election results if the total number of ballots cast exceeds the number of registered voters. Opponents argued it could disenfranchise voters due to clerical errors, and the Deputy Secretary of State raised concerns about its clarity and practicality.
- **House Bill 1369**: This bill, which deals with voter roll purges, was discussed extensively. A motion for interim study was proposed, with some representatives advocating for a four-year purge cycle.

### **7. Public Testimony and Committee Discussions**
- **Public Input**: Stakeholders, including representatives from America Votes, Open Democracy, and the New Hampshire School Boards Association, provided testimony on various bills. Concerns about voter disenfranchisement, the politicization of school board elections, and the need for clarity in bill language were recurring themes.
- **Committee Questions**: Committee members raised questions about the practicality, implications, and potential unintended consequences of the bills, particularly regarding enforcement, voter confidence, and the accuracy of voter rolls.

### **8. Outcomes and Next Steps**
- **Votes and Recommendations**: Several bills were reported out of committee without recommendation, including House Bill 1074, House Bill 1147, and House Bill 1577. Others, like House Bill 1381, were moved to the consent calendar.
- **Amendments and Refinements**: The committee discussed the need for technical adjustments and further amendments to clarify language and address concerns raised during the hearings.
