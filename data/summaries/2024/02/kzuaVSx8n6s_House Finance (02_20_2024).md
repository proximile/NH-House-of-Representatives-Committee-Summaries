The New Hampshire House Finance Committee meeting on February 20, 2024, began with a moment of silence in honor of Sharon Nordgren, the committee's longest-serving member, who had recently passed away. Representative Walner shared memories of Nordgren, expressing the committee's deep loss.

The primary agenda item was **Senate Bill 395**, which seeks to establish the position of Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Foods. **Senator Sharon Carson**, the bill's sponsor, explained that the position is urgently needed due to a statutory oversight during the budget process. While funds for the position were already allocated in the budget, the necessary legal language for hiring was omitted from **House Bill 2**. Carson emphasized that the bill follows standard procedures and uses language from existing statutes. The goal is to fast-track the bill to the governor’s desk.

**Commissioner Shawn Jasper** of the Department of Agriculture testified in support of the bill, acknowledging the oversight and apologizing for the error. He highlighted the department’s workload and the need for an assistant commissioner to manage responsibilities, including potential future oversight of food safety, which is currently split between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

Jasper also noted that he has an internal candidate in mind for the position but stressed that the hiring process will be open. He clarified that the position is fully funded within the existing budget, with salaries of $123,000 for fiscal year 2024 and $131,000 for fiscal year 2025.

Committee members raised questions about the justification for the position, its funding, and the potential transfer of food safety responsibilities from DHHS to the Department of Agriculture. Jasper confirmed that he had discussed the transfer with the DHHS commissioner, who was amenable to further conversations.

After discussion, the committee voted **20-2** in favor of the bill, with Representatives **Hile** and **Camire** opposing. The bill will move to the full House without the need for a committee of conference, as no amendments were made. The committee also discussed scheduling for upcoming bills and the need for fiscal oversight, given the state’s budgetary constraints.

The meeting concluded with reminders about writing committee reports before leaving and scheduling a busy session in early March to address pending bills.
