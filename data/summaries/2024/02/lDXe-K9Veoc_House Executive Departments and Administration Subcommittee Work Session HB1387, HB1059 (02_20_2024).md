The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Subcommittee held a work session on February 20, 2024, to discuss House Bills 1387 and 1059, both related to revisions to the State Building Code.

**HB 1387:**
- The bill proposes minor updates to the process for the building code, not the code itself.
- The sponsor clarified that the bill primarily removes redundant language, as certain provisions (e.g., biomass boilers) have already been incorporated into the building code.
- The only opposition came from a member of the mechanical licensing board who misunderstood Section 6, which merely adds the words "mechanical licensing."
- The subcommittee agreed to a minor amendment changing the model code publication requirement from two years to one year before adoption, allowing more time for review.
- The subcommittee voted in favor of the amendment and closed the discussion on HB 1387.

**HB 1059:**
- This bill updates the State Building Code, particularly the energy code, to the 2021 standards.
- The Building Code Review Board recommended the bill but did not unanimously support updating the energy code due to concerns about increased costs for commercial and residential buildings.
- The sponsor highlighted that the energy code update would reduce energy use but increase construction costs.
- A proposed amendment updated the ratification dates for amendments, which the subcommittee adopted unanimously.
- The main contention was the adoption of the 2021 energy code, which was rejected by the Building Code Review Board in a 9-4 vote. Concerns included upfront costs versus long-term societal benefits and payback.
- Testimony from Paul Beamus, representing the energy efficiency perspective, emphasized the importance of insulation and vapor barriers in the 2021 code for transitioning to electrification and improving energy efficiency, human comfort, and health.
- The subcommittee discussed separating residential and commercial energy code updates but did not reach a final decision.
- The subcommittee voted to pass the bill with the adopted amendment, focusing on updating the building code while leaving the energy code issue unresolved.

The meeting concluded with the subcommittee closing the session after finalizing their recommendations on both bills.
