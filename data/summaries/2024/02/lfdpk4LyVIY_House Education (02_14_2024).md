**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (February 14, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 14, 2024, to discuss and vote on several key education-related bills. The meeting focused on issues ranging from due process in disciplinary proceedings to education funding and property taxes. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Due Process in Disciplinary Proceedings**

1. **HB 1288 - Due Process Rights for Students and Faculty**:
   - The bill aimed to establish minimum due process protections for students, student organizations, and faculty facing disciplinary actions in state institutions, particularly in cases of sexual assault allegations.
   - An amendment was proposed to refine the bill, including removing reprimand from the definition of disciplinary proceedings and clarifying the handling of criminal allegations.
   - Supporters emphasized the importance of fundamental due process protections, such as cross-examination and procedural fairness, while opponents expressed concerns about the potential impact on campus disciplinary procedures, especially for survivors of sexual assault.
   - The bill sparked debate, with some representatives arguing that New Hampshire’s higher education institutions already have effective due process systems in place, while others highlighted the financial and logistical burden of implementing new policies.
   - A survivor of assault opposed the bill, stating that current systems are more respectful and effective for both victims and the accused.
   - The motion to pass the bill (OTP) narrowly tied with a 10-10 vote, but a subsequent motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) also tied 10-10, effectively halting its progress.

2. **Biblical References and Due Process**:
   - One representative referenced Proverbs 18:17 to support the principle of cross-examination in due process, sparking a brief debate about the appropriateness of using religious texts in legislative discussions.

### **Education Funding and Property Taxes**

1. **HB 1517 - Statewide Education Property Tax and Excess Revenue from Games of Chance**:
   - The bill proposed using excess revenue from gambling to directly reduce property taxes for residents.
   - Debate centered on whether the excess funds should be moved from the education trust fund to the general fund or used for tax relief.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential impact on local school funding and the lack of sufficient data on gambling revenue.
   - The motion to recommend the bill as "Ought to Pass" (OTP) failed with a 10-10 vote, and a subsequent motion to send the bill to interim study also failed.

2. **HB 1686 - Remitting Excess Revenue to the Education Trust Fund**:
   - The bill aimed to require excess revenue from the statewide education property tax to be remitted to the education trust fund and prohibit negative local and county tax rates.
   - Discussion highlighted the complexity of the tax structure and the need for further review by the Ways and Means Committee.
   - The motion to recommend the bill as OTP failed, and the bill will proceed with no recommendation.
