The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on February 13, 2024, covered a wide range of topics related to transportation, vehicle regulations, and driver's licenses. The discussions were divided into three segments, each addressing specific bills, amendments, and procedural matters. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the entire meeting:

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

#### **Driver's Licenses and Identity Verification**
1. **Driver's Licenses and Real IDs**: The committee extensively discussed the issuance of driver's licenses and Real IDs, particularly focusing on identity verification and immigration status. Concerns were raised about the federal government's vetting process for asylum seekers, which can take over a year, and the reliance on federal databases to confirm identity. Reports of thousands of IDs left at the border further questioned the accuracy of this process.

2. **Work Authorization and Licenses**: The committee highlighted the challenges in determining immigration status from work authorization cards, which do not specify whether the holder is an asylum seeker, student, or general worker. This complicates the issuance of driver's licenses to certain individuals.

3. **Amendment 06378**: The committee debated an amendment to subtly mark driver's licenses for non-resident aliens without causing discrimination. The amendment narrowly passed with a vote of 10 to 9.

4. **Opposition to Discriminatory Marking**: Some members opposed marking licenses with a "non-resident alien" designation, citing concerns about potential discrimination or violence. They referenced past bipartisan rejections of similar proposals.

#### **Bills and Amendments**
1. **House Bill 1550**: This bill allows municipalities to reduce speed limits seasonally. An amendment permitting municipalities to specify reduced speed limits by time of day was adopted unanimously (19-0), and the bill passed as amended.

2. **House Bill 1332**: This bill aimed to prohibit electric vehicles from parking in parking garages. After debate, the motion for "inexpedient to legislate" failed (9-10), and a subsequent motion to "not pass" the bill succeeded (10-9).

3. **House Bill 1354**: This bill allows surviving spouses of veterans to retain special license plates indefinitely. It passed unanimously (19-0).

4. **House Bill 1329**: This bill creates special number plates for fire vehicles. Despite concerns about fiscal implications, it passed (11-8).

5. **House Bill 1123**: This bill addresses the registration of title-exempt vehicles without disclosing personal information beyond name and address. The motion for "inexpedient to legislate" passed unanimously (19-0).

6. **House Bill 1118**: This bill concerns driver's licenses for non-resident aliens. An amendment clarified that these licenses are not valid for voting purposes. The bill and amendment were set for further discussion.

7. **House Bill 1063**: The committee recommended "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) due to safety concerns about allowing drivers to exceed speed limits by up to 10 mph.

8. **House Bill 1403**: An amendment extended the time frame for vehicle emission control repairs from 60 to 120 days, especially during winter months. The bill was recommended for passage as amended.

9. **House Bill 1247**: The committee recommended ITL, deeming the bill on selective service registration information unnecessary for public spaces.

10. **House Bill 1244**: The committee recommended ITL after debates on civil liberties versus child protection regarding smoking in vehicles with children.

11. **House Bill 1467**: The committee unanimously recommended ITL, finding the bill on child passenger protection too broad and unnecessary.

12. **House Bill 1457**: The committee recessed the bill on increasing fines for damaging historical wooden bridges due to a technical issue with statute references.

13. **House Bill 1416**: The committee narrowly recommended ITL (10-9) after debates on prohibiting non-electric vehicles from parking in EV charging spaces. Supporters argued it protected businesses and EV drivers, while opponents saw it as legislating common courtesy.

#### **Other Discussions**
1. **Marine Patrol Incident**: A brief discussion occurred regarding a Marine Patrol incident involving a young boy and statutory restrictions on lake activities. The chair indicated further conversation with relevant authorities would take place.

2. **Procedural Matters**: The committee emphasized handling amendments, scheduling further discussions for recessed bills, and balancing public safety, property rights, and practicality in their decisions.

### Conclusion:
The meeting highlighted the committee's focus on balancing identity verification, immigration status, and non-discriminatory practices in driver's license issuance, alongside addressing broader transportation and vehicle regulation issues. The discussions underscored the challenges of reconciling public safety, civil liberties, and practicality in legislative decision-making.
