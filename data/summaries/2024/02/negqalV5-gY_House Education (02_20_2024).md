### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 1162 (Teaching Discrimination in Public Schools and Workplaces)**:
   - The bill sought to repeal a 2021 law prohibiting discrimination in public school instruction. Supporters argued the law stifled teachers’ ability to address sensitive topics, while opponents believed it was necessary to prevent harmful or discriminatory instruction.
   - A motion to OTP (Ought to Pass) the bill was made and seconded, but a roll call vote showed mixed support. Ultimately, the motion to ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) passed, preserving the anti-discrimination law.

2. **HB 1671 (School Officials’ Right of Action for False Accusations)**:
   - An amendment to the bill was ruled non-germane by the speaker, preventing it from being considered. There was debate over procedural protocols and whether the amendment sponsor was properly notified of its status.
   - The committee decided to hold the bill to allow time for further clarification and potential adjustments.

3. **HB 1382 (Military Compact and Special Education Students)**:
   - The bill addressed the 30-day timeline for evaluations of military families’ special education needs, with concerns raised about challenges during the summer when schools may not be in session.
   - Representatives debated whether the Department of Education should assist smaller school districts and agreed to seek best practices from other states to refine the bill.

4. **HB 1311 (Collection and Reconsideration Policies for School Collections)**:
   - The bill required school districts to develop policies for the selection and reconsideration of library materials, aiming to ensure materials are not excluded based on the identity of the author or characters.
   - Concerns were raised about fiscal implications and whether the bill constituted an unfunded mandate. The committee ultimately recommended an interim study to further explore the issue.

5. **HB 1594 (Annual Review for EFA Eligibility)**:
   - The bill proposed means testing for EFA recipients after the initial qualifying period. Supporters argued it would ensure accountability for taxpayer dollars, while opponents claimed it would disincentivize parents from advancing economically and disrupt students’ educational stability.
   - The motion to ITL passed, effectively killing the bill.

6. **HB 1512 (Limiting EFA Funding to Budgeted Amounts)**:
   - The bill aimed to cap the total budget for the EFA program, limiting participation even if families met income eligibility criteria. Opponents argued it would trap students in unsuitable educational environments, while supporters emphasized fiscal responsibility.
   - The motion to ITL passed, rejecting the bill.

7. **HB 1176 and HB 1509 (Special Education Funding)**:
   - The committee discussed the creation of a commission to study current funding for special education, particularly catastrophic aid. Representative Cordelli highlighted the need for a more equitable funding formula.
   - Both bills were recommended for interim studies to address the complexities of special education funding.

8. **HB 1305 (Free Speech on College Campuses)**:
   - The bill aimed to establish baseline protections for free speech and association on college campuses. It was amended to address concerns from the Attorney General’s office regarding the enforcement of criminal harassment laws.
   - Supporters viewed it as necessary to ensure viewpoint neutrality, while opponents argued it could protect extremist groups and impose financial burdens on institutions. The bill passed with a vote of 13-6.

- **Support for Military Families**: The committee emphasized the importance of supporting military families with special education needs, including reimbursing parents for fees incurred during due process hearings. They agreed to seek further guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Defense to refine related bills.

- **Fiscal Responsibility vs. Educational Freedom**: Throughout the meeting, representatives debated the balance between fiscal responsibility, educational freedom, and accountability. Discussions highlighted concerns about unfunded mandates, the impact of policy changes on students and families, and the need for guardrails in education programs.

- **Local Control and Community Standards**: Several bills, such as HB 1311, sparked debates about the role of local control and community standards in education policy, particularly in the selection of library materials and the implementation of EFA programs.
