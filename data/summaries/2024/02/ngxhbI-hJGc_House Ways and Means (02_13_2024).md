**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (02/13/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on February 13, 2024, to address a wide range of legislative issues, with a focus on housing, taxation, fiscal responsibility, gaming, and environmental funding. The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing these critical areas through legislative action, with extensive debates, proposed amendments, and calls for further study. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Housing and Tax Credits**
The committee dedicated significant time to housing affordability and production, particularly in the context of workforce and low-income housing. Key points included:
- **Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Study**: A bill proposing a study committee to explore the feasibility of state tax credits aligned with federal programs was debated. The New Hampshire Housing Authority expressed readiness to assist. Discussions centered on expanding the scope to include workforce housing and other incentives to address housing shortages.
- **Workforce Housing**: Representatives emphasized the need for workforce housing, especially in northern NH, where businesses face hiring challenges due to housing shortages. The committee explored defining workforce housing and supporting development through tax credits and repurposing unused federal and state properties, such as the McIntyre building in Portsmouth.
- **Amendments and Committee Structure**: Proposals included changes to the language of tax incentives and the composition of the study committee, with some advocating for a larger committee to ensure diverse perspectives and effective organization.

### **Environmental Funding**
A bill to establish a trust fund for money from soil and water contamination settlements was discussed. While some saw it as a straightforward solution for environmental cleanup, others raised concerns about practicality and timelines, suggesting further study and amendments.

---

### **Fiscal Responsibility and Taxation**
The committee addressed several fiscal and taxation issues, emphasizing the need for balanced budgets and responsible spending:
- **Balanced Budget and Spending**: Discussions highlighted the state’s current balanced budget but noted concerns about past overspending and deficits, particularly under Republican governors. The impact of federal funds and the need for fiscal responsibility were key themes.
- **Education Funding and Tax Cuts**: Representatives debated the potential consequences of tax cuts on state revenue and services, warning of increased property taxes and the need for careful consideration of further reductions.
- **License Fees**: A historical review of unadjusted license fees, such as those for snowmobiles, underscored the need for fee increases to account for inflation and ensure adequate services, despite political challenges.

### **State Programs and Initiatives**
Several state programs and initiatives were examined:
- **Northern Border Alliance Program**: The committee discussed the program’s funding and effectiveness in securing the northern border. Some suggested reallocating unused funds to the general budget for greater flexibility.
- **Child Care Tax Credit Program**: A proposed bill aimed to establish a child care tax credit for middle-income families who narrowly miss eligibility for existing scholarship programs. Concerns were raised about integration complexity and potential costs.
- **Candidate Filing Fees**: A bill to eliminate the $2 filing fee for state representative candidates was debated, with supporters arguing it could encourage more candidates and opponents citing administrative and symbolic concerns.

### **Gaming and Charitable Impact**
The committee reviewed several bills related to the gaming industry and its impact on charities:
- **HB 1203**: This bill, seen as a “no-brainer,” would remove certain rents no longer needed by the gaming industry, benefiting charities. Concerns about language clarity led to a proposed amendment.
- **HB 1255**: The committee debated extending a moratorium on historic horse racing, with some members leaning towards voting “inexpedient to legislate.”
- **HB 1389**: A bill allowing lottery winners to remain anonymous was discussed. Concerns about conflicts with the Tri-State Lotto Compact led to suggestions for a study committee.
- **HB 1525**: A drafting error in a bill related to historic horse racing game operator employers was identified, and an amendment was proposed. The bill includes a permanent moratorium on new facilities, though future legislatures could change this.
- **HB 1549**: This bill would cap the “rake” from poker games at $250, potentially encouraging larger tournaments without harming charities.

### **Constitutional Amendment**
The committee discussed **CACR 15**, a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds majority to pass legislation imposing new or increased taxes. Concerns were raised about its potential to hinder the state’s ability to fund essential services and increase property taxes. Some members suggested a 60% threshold as an alternative.

### **Scheduling and Future Meetings**
The committee outlined plans for upcoming sessions, including public hearings and work sessions, to finalize amendments and advance bills.
