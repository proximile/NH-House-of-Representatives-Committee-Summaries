**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare Meeting (02/07/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare convened on February 7, 2024, to address critical issues surrounding childcare accessibility, affordability, and workforce retention. The meeting focused on several proposed bills aimed at reforming childcare regulations, funding, and licensing processes, with discussions highlighting the complexities of balancing safety, affordability, and regulatory compliance. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Childcare Scholarship Program (House Bill 1056)**
Representative Deb D’Simone introduced HB 1056, which seeks to prioritize childcare employees in the administration of the childcare scholarship program. The bill aims to ensure that childcare workers have access to scholarships, addressing workforce retention challenges. However, Jesse Davis from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) raised concerns that this prioritization could violate federal anti-discrimination regulations governing scholarship eligibility.

---

### **Publication of Childcare Violations (House Bill 1405)**
Representative Ross Barry proposed HB 1405, which would limit the publication of childcare violations that are not material to child safety or well-being. The bill was prompted by a childcare provider whose insurance rates doubled due to the publication of non-material violations. DHHS representatives, Melissa Clement and Jesse Davis, cautioned that this change could conflict with federal requirements to publish both compliance and non-compliance findings.

---

### **Teacher-to-Staff Ratios (House Bill 1407)**
HB 1407, introduced by Representative Barry, proposes modifying teacher-to-staff ratios in childcare centers to increase access and affordability, particularly for infant care. The bill suggests increasing the ratio from 2:8 to 2:9 in rooms with two teachers, arguing that this would provide immediate relief to the childcare crisis. Barry emphasized that the change would not override fire safety codes and that providers could opt out if they lacked the capacity. However, concerns were raised about the potential impact on childcare quality, prompting a broader discussion about the trade-offs between affordability and safety.

---

### **Appeals Process for Violations (House Bill 1409)**
Representative Barry also introduced HB 1409, which aims to involve the Childcare Advisory Committee in the appeals process for licensing violations. The bill seeks to ensure fairness by providing third-party review, as current appeals are handled internally by DHHS. This proposal received support from childcare professionals, who highlighted the need for a more transparent and equitable process.

---

### **Zoning and Childcare Facilities (House Bill 1567)**
Representative Grassy presented HB 1567, which seeks to exempt small family and group childcare facilities from site review requirements. The bill aims to reduce the regulatory burden on providers, particularly in residential areas, by eliminating costly and time-consuming zoning and site review processes. The committee voted 8-0 to recommend the bill for passage, emphasizing the economic impact of the childcare gap, estimated at $262 million annually in New Hampshire.

### **Childcare Workforce Retention Fund (House Bill 1611)**
HB 1611 proposes establishing a fund to support the recruitment and retention of childcare workers through grants for benefits such as student loan repayment, paid time off (PTO), and other incentives. Key points of discussion included:
- **Agency Oversight**: Concerns were raised about the Department of Labor’s (DOL) suitability to administer the program, given its lack of experience with grant programs. Alternatives, such as DHHS, were suggested.
- **Funding and Administration**: The bill lacks a specified funding mechanism, and there were concerns about the DOL’s capacity to oversee the program effectively.
- **Direct vs. Employer Reimbursement**: There was debate over whether funds should flow directly to employees or through employers, with some members advocating for employer reimbursement to avoid creating quasi-state employees.
- **Equity and Tax Implications**: The committee emphasized the need for equitable treatment of all childcare providers and discussed the potential tax liabilities for employees receiving direct benefits.

The committee voted 10-0 to recommend the bill for passage as amended, with a focus on restructuring the program to address these concerns.

### **Expanding Home-Based Childcare (House Bill 1584)**
HB 1584 proposes increasing the number of children that can be cared for in a private home from three to four, aiming to expand childcare access without taxpayer funding. While the bill received support for its potential to increase availability, concerns were raised about fire code compliance and safety regulations for license-exempt providers.

### **Fire Code and Safety Concerns**
Throughout the meeting, committee members and stakeholders emphasized the importance of maintaining safety standards in childcare facilities. Representatives clarified that none of the proposed bills intend to override fire codes, underscoring the priority of child safety.

### **Testimonies and Broader Context**
Childcare professionals and advocates provided testimonies highlighting the critical need for accessible and affordable childcare. They emphasized the childcare crisis in New Hampshire, particularly in rural areas, and the importance of family and group childcare providers in addressing the shortage. Data presented during the meeting showed significant childcare gaps, with 22,000 licensed childcare spaces needed and 46% of children living in "childcare deserts."

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Regulatory Reform**: The committee focused on reducing regulatory barriers to increase the availability of licensed childcare, particularly in residential areas, while maintaining safety and quality standards.
2. **Workforce Retention**: Addressing the childcare workforce crisis was a central theme, with discussions centered on improving compensation, benefits, and retention strategies.
3. **Equity and Accessibility**: Ensuring equitable access to childcare and fair treatment of providers was a recurring concern, particularly in the context of scholarship programs and funding mechanisms.
4. **Collaborative Approach**: The committee worked collaboratively to refine proposed bills, with a focus on balancing affordability, safety, and regulatory compliance.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing New Hampshire’s childcare crisis while navigating federal regulations, safety concerns, and workforce challenges.
