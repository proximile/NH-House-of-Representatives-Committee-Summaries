**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Meeting (02/12/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 12, 2024, to discuss several key education-related bills. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs), evidence-based educational practices, due process rights in higher education, freedom of speech and association on college campuses, and fiscal oversight of educational funding programs. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs) and Fiscal Oversight**
- **HB 1594 - EFA Annual Review**: Representative Mel Miler introduced HB 1594, which proposes an annual review of eligibility for the Education Freedom Accounts program. Currently, families remain eligible for life once qualified, regardless of income changes. The bill seeks to ensure that families exceeding the income threshold (350% of the poverty level) are no longer eligible, aligning EFA requirements with other state poverty programs. Concerns were raised about the financial impact on school districts, the potential phase-out period for current participants, and the redistribution of unused funds back to the education trust fund.
- **HB 1512 - Limiting EFA Funding**: This bill aims to cap EFA funding to budgeted amounts, addressing overspending concerns. The EFA program, described as discretionary, has exceeded its budget in recent years. The bill seeks to enforce fiscal responsibility similar to other state programs, such as special education funding, which is prorated when budgets are exceeded.

### **2. Evidence-Based Education Methods**
- **HB 1287 - Evidence-Based Practices**: Representative Beller presented HB 1287, which mandates the use of scientifically validated, evidence-based methods in public education. The bill emphasizes reliance on objective, peer-reviewed studies rather than subjective or unproven approaches. Testimony from organizations like New Futures and New Hampshire Children’s Trust opposed the bill, arguing it could exclude effective practices, particularly in Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and Multi-Tiered Support Systems (MTSS). Concerns were raised about the potential harm to students, especially in addressing mental health and behavioral needs.

### **3. Due Process Rights in Higher Education**
- **HB 1288 - Due Process Protections**: This bill establishes due process rights for students, student organizations, and faculty facing disciplinary actions at state institutions of higher education. Amendments removed the term "reprimand" to focus on serious actions like suspension and added provisions to halt disciplinary proceedings until criminal cases are resolved. University representatives, including those from UNH and the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH), expressed concerns that the bill’s adversarial process could disrupt existing informal, collaborative systems. They argued that current policies already provide robust due process protections. Critics also raised concerns about the potential retraumatization of complainants, particularly in sexual assault cases, and the bill’s impact on dual-enrollment high school students.
- **HB 1305 - Freedom of Speech and Association**: This bill addresses allegations of viewpoint-based discrimination in event approvals at public universities. A representative cited a 2023 permit database at UNH, claiming conservative and Christian organizations faced discrimination in amplification requests. University representatives defended their policies, stating that time, place, and manner restrictions apply equally to all groups and that UNH upholds First Amendment rights.

### **4. Student Loan Crisis and Higher Education Accountability**
- **HB 1108 - Student Loan Crisis Study**: This bill proposes a committee to study the role of colleges and universities in the student loan crisis. Representative Beler highlighted the crisis’s impact on young Americans’ ability to buy homes and start families, arguing that taxpayers should not bear the burden. Representative Cordelli questioned the need for a new committee, citing existing research on the issue.

---

### **5. Degree-Granting Authority and Nonprofit Standards**
- **HB 1453 - Degree-Granting Authority**: This bill sets minimum standards for institutions seeking degree-granting authority, including compliance with anti-discrimination laws, adherence to the Higher Education Act of 1965, and nonprofit status (501(c)(3)). The bill aims to prevent issues seen in for-profit colleges, such as high student debt and low graduation rates, while supporting nonprofit institutions that prioritize student needs.

---

### **Key Themes and Concerns**
1. **Fairness and Accountability**: Discussions emphasized the need for fairness in eligibility criteria for programs like EFAs and accountability in higher education practices, including due process and fiscal oversight.
2. **Balancing Rights and Protections**: Legislators grappled with balancing the rights of students and faculty with the need to protect complainants, particularly in sensitive cases like sexual assault.
3. **Evidence-Based Education**: The debate over evidence-based practices highlighted the tension between objective data and the importance of SEL and other holistic approaches to student well-being.
4. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Oversight of educational funding, particularly for discretionary programs like EFAs, was a recurring theme, with calls for alignment with state budget priorities.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned further discussions and work sessions on several bills, including HB 1288 (due process) and HB 1305 (freedom of speech and association), to address the concerns raised and refine the proposed legislation.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexities of addressing educational equity, accountability, and fiscal responsibility while balancing the diverse needs of students, families, and institutions.
