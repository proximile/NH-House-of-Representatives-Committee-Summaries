The transcript is from a meeting of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy held on February 9, 2024. The committee, which is bipartisan and tasked with evaluating the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, discussed its mission, structure, and approach to conducting its review.

Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Mission and Focus**: The committee aims to conduct a science-based, fact-finding review of the state's COVID-19 response, focusing on areas such as federal guidance, funding, vaccination efforts, and the impact on New Hampshire. A report outlining the findings is expected by November 1, 2024.

2. **Meeting Schedule**: The committee agreed to meet on Friday mornings at 9:00 a.m., starting on February 23, 2024. They will consider meeting during the session break if necessary.

3. **Approach to Review**: There was a discussion on whether to proceed chronologically or topically. The committee leaned toward a topical approach, focusing on specific areas like treatment protocols, vaccines, and financial management, while still considering the chronological context of events.

4. **Public Involvement**: The committee emphasized the importance of public input and transparency. Meetings will be live-streamed and archived for public access. The committee also discussed inviting experts and state officials, such as the Director of Homeland Security, to provide insights.

5. **After-Action Report**: Patricia Tilly, Associate Commissioner at the Department of Health and Human Services, provided an update on the state's after-action report, which is expected to be completed in June 2024. The report will cover various aspects of the pandemic response, including financial management, health and medical components, and public-private partnerships.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to invite Director Buckton from Homeland Security to the next meeting on February 23, 2024, to provide an overview of the state's COVID-19 response. Members will also gather input from constituents and stakeholders to guide their inquiry.

The meeting concluded with the committee agreeing to reconvene on February 23, 2024, to continue their work.
