### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (02/05/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on February 5, 2024, to discuss several education-related bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 1473 (HB 1473)**, which proposes restrictions on **social-emotional learning (SEL)** in public schools. The meeting also addressed other significant bills, including **House Bill 1185 (HB 1185)** on sexual education, **HB 1625** on school nurse certification, **HB 1298** on part-time teachers, **HB 1458** on English Language Learner (ELL) programs, and proposals related to graduation requirements and digital assessments. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. House Bill 1473: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)**
The debate over HB 1473 dominated the meeting, with strong arguments from both supporters and opponents of the bill.

#### **Opposition to HB 1473:**
- **Importance of SEL:** Educators, mental health professionals, parents, and students testified that SEL is essential for student wellness, mental health, and academic success. Programs like **Choose Love** and **Second Step** teach skills such as courage, gratitude, forgiveness, and emotional regulation, which help students process emotions, build resilience, and improve academic performance.
- **Impact on Vulnerable Students:** SEL is particularly beneficial for at-risk students, including those with disabilities, from difficult backgrounds, or in the juvenile justice system. Removing SEL could exacerbate mental health issues, substance abuse, and incarceration rates.
- **Parental and Community Support:** Surveys show that 86% of New Hampshire families believe SEL is important. Many parents view SEL as a partnership between schools and families.
- **Legal and Educational Concerns:** Opponents argued that HB 1473 could violate federal laws like **IDEA** and state laws like **RSA 193-F** (pupil safety) and **RSA 135-C** (mental health). SEL is deeply embedded in school culture, and removing it could disrupt educational practices and student well-being.

#### **Support for HB 1473:**
- **Concerns About Overreach:** Supporters argued that SEL programs are invasive, collecting sensitive student data without proper parental consent. They expressed mistrust in how SEL is implemented, suggesting it promotes ideological agendas.
- **Focus on Academics:** Some argued that schools should prioritize core academic subjects like math and science, especially given low proficiency rates in these areas.
- **Parental Rights:** Advocates emphasized the need for parental consent and transparency in SEL programs, proposing an **opt-out** provision rather than an outright ban.

#### **Amendment Discussion:**
- An amendment to allow parents to opt out of SEL programs was proposed but faced opposition. Critics argued that existing laws already provide opt-out options and that the amendment would still undermine SEL’s effectiveness.

### **2. House Bill 1185: Sexual Education**
The committee also debated **HB 1185**, which seeks to limit sexual education instruction in schools.

#### **Bill Overview:**
- HB 1185 emphasizes age-appropriate content and excludes topics like gender identity, sexual orientation, and LGBTQ+ issues. It aims to return control of sexual education to parents, focusing on biological and medical facts.

#### **Opposition to the Bill:**
- Critics, including health educators and LGBTQ+ advocates, argued that comprehensive sexual education reduces teen pregnancy, dating violence, and child sexual abuse. They warned that excluding LGBTQ+ issues would stigmatize marginalized students and create unsafe school environments.
- Legal experts raised concerns about the bill’s vagueness and potential violation of existing protections, such as New Hampshire’s harmful-to-minors statute and opt-out policies.

#### **Support for the Bill:**
- Supporters, including parents and conservative legislators, emphasized parental rights and the need to protect children from inappropriate content. They argued that sexual education should focus on biology and physiology rather than diverse sexual lifestyles.

### **3. Other Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 1625: School Nurse Certification**
- The bill proposes removing the requirement for school nurses to be certified by the Department of Education, transferring responsibility to the State Board of Nursing.
- **Supporters** believe this would address the shortage of school nurses by reducing hiring barriers.
- **Opponents**, including the New Hampshire Nurses Association, argue that certification ensures nurses are qualified to handle students’ complex health needs.

#### **HB 1298: Part-Time Teachers**
- The bill allows individuals with subject-area expertise but without teaching credentials to teach part-time under the supervision of a certified teacher.
- **Supporters** believe this could address teacher shortages in specialized areas.
- **Opponents**, including teacher unions, argue that uncertified teachers could negatively impact students and overburden existing staff.

#### **HB 1458: English Language Learner (ELL) Program**
- The bill would allow parents to remove their children from the ELL program if they are performing at grade level in reading and writing.
- **Supporters** shared stories of students mistakenly placed in ELL programs due to administrative errors.
- **Opponents** expressed concerns about ensuring that students who need ELL services receive them.

#### **Graduation Requirements and Digital Assessments**
- A bill proposed establishing minimum graduation requirements, including a 25th percentile score on statewide assessments, with remedial plans for students who do not meet the requirements.
- Another bill addressed the civics competency assessment, proposing a digitized version of the test for consistency across school districts. The test, based on the U.S. naturalization exam, includes 128 questions and provides accommodations for students with disabilities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted deep divisions over the role of SEL, sexual education, and other educational policies in New Hampshire. Opponents of HB 1473 and HB 1185 emphasized the importance of addressing students’ emotional, social, and health needs, while supporters argued for parental rights and a focus on core academics. The committee considered amendments and debated the potential impacts of these bills on students, educators, and the education system. No final decisions were made, and further discussions are expected as the bills move through the legislative process.
