The New Hampshire House Education Committee convened on February 6, 2024, to discuss several education-related bills, focusing on issues such as parental rights, LGBTQ+ student protections, curriculum transparency, Medicaid billing, and student representation on school boards.

Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Parental Rights and Student Privacy (HB 1312 and HB 1356)**
- **HB 1312: Parental Notification of Student Health and Curriculum**  
  - **Purpose**: Expands parental notification requirements regarding student well-being and curriculum, particularly in discussions of human sexuality, gender identity, and related topics outside of health and sex education.  
  - **Support**: Sponsors, including Rep. Christine Perez, argued the bill ensures parents are informed about sensitive topics and prevents schools from adopting policies that block staff from notifying parents about a student’s mental, emotional, or physical health.  
  - **Opposition**: The ACLU of NH, parents, and students testified that the bill targets LGBTQ+ students, stigmatizes their identities, and could chill discussions of gender and sexual orientation in subjects like history and literature.  

- **HB 1356: Use of Children’s Names and Pronouns by Public School Employees**  
  - **Purpose**: Requires schools to obtain written parental consent before using a name or pronouns that differ from a student’s birth certificate.  
  - **Support**: Sponsors, including Rep. Mike Moffett, framed the bill as protecting parental rights and educators’ religious beliefs.  
  - **Opposition**: Students, parents, and advocacy groups argued the bill would harm transgender and nonbinary students, increase mental health risks, and undermine trust between students and educators.  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Parental Rights vs. Student Privacy**: Supporters emphasized parents’ right to know about their child’s identity and school discussions, while opponents highlighted the potential harm to LGBTQ+ students, particularly those in unsupportive households.  
- **Mental Health Impact**: Opponents stressed that affirming students’ identities reduces depression and suicidal ideation, while supporters expressed concerns about premature medicalization of gender identity.  
- **Educator Burden**: Critics argued the bills would create confusion and burden teachers, particularly in subjects like literature and history.

#### **2. Repeal of the "Divisive Concepts" Law (HB 1162)**
- **Purpose**: Seeks to repeal RSA 193:40, a 2021 law restricting the teaching of certain topics related to race, gender, and other identities in public schools.  
- **Support**: Educators and advocates argued the law has created fear among teachers, stifling open discussions on racism, slavery, and historical injustices. A lawsuit challenging the law is ongoing, citing its vagueness and chilling effect on academic freedom.  
- **Opposition**: Opponents claimed the law prevents divisive teachings and protects students from feeling guilty for historical injustices.  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Academic Freedom**: Supporters emphasized the need for diverse and inclusive education to prepare students for a global society.  
- **Vagueness and Fear**: Critics highlighted the law’s ambiguous language and its impact on topics beyond race and gender, such as disability rights and body image.

#### **3. Curriculum Transparency (HB 1643)**
- **Purpose**: Requires school districts to post curriculum and instructional materials on their websites to promote transparency.  
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill would improve communication between parents and teachers.  
- **Opposition**: Educators and administrators expressed concerns about the administrative burden, confidentiality issues, technology costs, and redundancy with existing laws.  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Transparency vs. Practicality**: Supporters emphasized parental involvement, while opponents highlighted the impracticality of uploading extensive materials and potential distractions from teaching.

#### **4. Medicaid Billing and Parental Consent**
- **Purpose**: Addresses concerns about parental consent for Medicaid-funded services provided in schools, particularly for special education.  
- **Support**: Advocates argued parents should have detailed explanations of services billed to Medicaid and be informed of each new service.  
- **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about the bill’s punitive measures, its potential impact beyond special education, and conflicts with federal Medicaid guidelines.  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Parental Oversight**: Supporters emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in Medicaid billing.  
- **Practical Challenges**: Critics highlighted the potential burden on educators and the need for clearer language to avoid unintended consequences.

#### **5. Student Representation on School Boards**
- **Purpose**: Addresses challenges in small schools by allowing up to three student representatives and reducing attendance requirements.  
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill would increase student voice in decision-making.  
- **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about practical implementation, particularly in districts with multiple high schools or cooperative districts.  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Student Voice**: Supporters emphasized the importance of student involvement in governance.
