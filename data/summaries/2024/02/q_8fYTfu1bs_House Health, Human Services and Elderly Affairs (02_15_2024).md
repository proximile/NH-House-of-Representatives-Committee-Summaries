**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Meeting (02/15/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on February 15, 2024, to discuss several healthcare-related bills. The meeting focused on a range of issues, including electronic medical records, Medicaid coverage for gender reassignment surgeries, pharmacy quality improvement programs, and the state’s primary care workforce shortage. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **House Bill 1604: Electronic Medical Records**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to restrict health carriers from requiring electronic medical records (EMRs), allowing healthcare providers to continue using paper records if they choose.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - The committee considered an amendment to limit the bill’s provisions to health carriers operating in New Hampshire, excluding federal insurers like Medicare and Medicaid.
  - Supporters argued the bill empowers doctors who prefer paper records, while opponents expressed concerns about adding unnecessary regulations.
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed unanimously (20-0), and the bill, as amended, was recommended for passage with a vote of 19-1.

### **House Bill 1660: Medicaid Coverage for Gender Reassignment Surgeries for Minors**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prohibit Medicaid coverage for gender reassignment surgeries for individuals under 18.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - Supporters argued these surgeries are elective, medically unnecessary, and should not be funded by taxpayers. They also emphasized protecting minors from irreversible procedures.
  - Opponents countered that such surgeries are rare, life-saving, and that the bill discriminates against transgender individuals by creating a two-tiered healthcare system.
  - Concerns were raised about misinformation and the lack of evidence that such surgeries are performed on minors in New Hampshire.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 10-10 on both the "ought to pass" and "inexpedient to legislate" motions, leaving the bill without a committee recommendation.

### **House Bill 1042: Pharmacy Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) Program**
- **Sponsor**: Representative David Roord, a pharmacist and president of the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy.
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to repeal or amend the state-mandated CQI program for pharmacies, arguing that the current law is outdated and overly prescriptive.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - The CQI program, implemented in 2019, requires pharmacies to follow a rigid, step-by-step process for quality improvement, which Roord argued is impractical in today’s diverse pharmacy landscape.
  - Supporters, including the New Hampshire Hospital Association, testified that hospital pharmacies already integrate CQI into broader quality programs, making the current law redundant.
  - Concerns were raised about oversight and confidentiality, but Roord assured that other regulations and accrediting bodies (e.g., CMS, Joint Commission) already enforce these standards.
- **Outcome**: The committee closed the public hearing on HB 1042, with discussions highlighting the need for flexibility in pharmacy quality improvement programs.

### **House Bill 1609: Commission on Primary Care Workforce**
- **Sponsor**: Representative Jim Murphy.
- **Purpose**: The bill extends the work of the Commission on Primary Care Workforce and the State Office of Rural Health until 2029 to address the state’s primary care provider shortage.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - The commission’s work includes collecting data on the primary care workforce, identifying gaps, and developing strategies for recruitment and retention, particularly in rural and underserved areas.
  - Representative Murphy emphasized the importance of primary care for preventative care, chronic disease management, and reducing reliance on emergency care.
  - Questions were raised about the commission’s effectiveness, but Murphy stressed the importance of data-driven decision-making and initiatives like residency programs to retain providers.
- **Outcome**: The committee opened the public hearing on HB 1609, with discussions underscoring the urgency of addressing the primary care workforce shortage.

---

### **Additional Discussions**:
- The committee explored the role of **direct primary care** models in filling gaps in care for uninsured or underinsured patients.
- **Residency programs**, such as the new Family Medicine Residency at Cheshire Medical Center, were highlighted as potential solutions to retain providers in rural areas.
- Due to time constraints, discussions on **HB 1683** and **HB 1568** were postponed to the following week.

### **Conclusion**:
The meeting concluded with plans to address remaining bills in the next session. Key themes included balancing regulatory flexibility with oversight, ensuring equitable healthcare access, and addressing workforce challenges in New Hampshire’s healthcare system.
