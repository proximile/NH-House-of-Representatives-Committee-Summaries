The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) held its organizational meeting on February 23, 2024, chaired by Representative Leah Cushman. The committee was formed to address concerns about due process and constitutional issues in DCYF proceedings, particularly in child protection cases. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and the appointment of Representative Sandra Panek as the committee clerk.

Representative Cushman outlined the committee's mission, emphasizing the importance of ensuring due process and protecting the rights of families and children involved in DCYF cases. She shared that the committee was formed in response to constituent complaints about perceived deficiencies in due process and constitutional violations in DCYF practices. The committee's goal is to investigate these issues, identify areas for reform, and recommend improvements to DCYF processes.

The committee members introduced themselves, highlighting their backgrounds and relevant experience. Public testimony was provided by Skip Murphy, who shared his personal experiences with DCYF, including issues with due process and procedural irregularities. He emphasized the need for better training and awareness of rights for families interacting with DCYF.

The committee discussed next steps, including scheduling future meetings, inviting relevant stakeholders (such as DCYF representatives, the Office of the Child Advocate, and family court representatives), and conducting research on constitutional due process and past commissions that have examined DCYF issues. The committee aims to create a structured approach to addressing common concerns and improving DCYF practices while balancing the dual priorities of family integrity and child safety.

The meeting concluded with plans to hold the next session on March 4, 2024, and a commitment to gather written testimony and additional information to guide the committee's work.
