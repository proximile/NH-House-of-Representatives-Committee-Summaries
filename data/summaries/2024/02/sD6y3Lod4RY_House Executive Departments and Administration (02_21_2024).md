**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting – Executive Departments and Administration (02/21/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives, Executive Departments and Administration Committee, convened on February 21, 2024, to discuss several key bills and issues. The meeting focused on topics ranging from **recordkeeping and licensing rules** to **plumbing apprenticeship regulations**, **Native American recognition**, **public safety provider protections**, and the **cultural significance of Columbus Day**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Recordkeeping and Licensing Rules**
   - **Record Retention**: The committee discussed modernizing recordkeeping processes, emphasizing the digitization of records for better accessibility and retention. Records are currently stored physically and archived through the Secretary of State.
   - **Licensing and Rule Cleanup**: Concerns were raised about conflicting language in licensing and disciplinary rules. A contractor is being brought in to revise and streamline rules for all boards under the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).
   - **Fees and Fines**: Debate centered on the implications of fees and fines collected under expired rules. If fees were improperly collected, the state might be required to refund them, potentially incurring financial penalties and attorney fees.
   - **Public Safety**: The importance of maintaining disciplinary rules to protect public safety was emphasized, with concerns about agencies failing to enforce rules and allowing bad actors to go unpunished.

### **2. Plumbing Apprenticeship Regulations**
   - **Current Rule**: The OPLC currently allows only one apprentice per licensed plumber. Representative Seth King introduced a bill to increase this to three apprentices, arguing that the current rule exacerbates workforce shortages, especially in rural areas.
   - **Opposition**: Licensed plumbers and inspectors opposed the bill, citing the need for one-on-one training to ensure safety and quality. They argued that the shortage stems from a lack of interest in the trade, not a lack of apprenticeship opportunities.
   - **Federal vs. State Control**: New Hampshire’s plumbing apprenticeship program is federally regulated, and any changes to the apprentice-to-plumber ratio would require a federal waiver from the Department of Labor.
   - **Alternative Solutions**: Opponents suggested investing in trade schools and promoting trades in high schools as better ways to address workforce shortages.

### **3. Native American Recognition and Arts & Crafts Act**
   - **House Bill 1252**: This bill proposed establishing a committee to study state recognition for the Abenaki tribe. Supporters argued that recognition would enable access to federal benefits, including the ability to sell traditional crafts without penalties under the Arts and Crafts Act.
   - **Cultural Preservation**: Testifiers emphasized the importance of state recognition for preserving Native American culture and accessing grants for cultural programs.
   - **Opposition**: Some Native American leaders opposed the bill, arguing that the New Hampshire Commission on Native American Affairs is already addressing these issues and that creating a new committee would be redundant and costly.
   - **House Bill 1474**: This bill sought to restructure the Commission on Native American Affairs, including reducing quorum requirements and adding UNH representation. It was deferred for further review alongside HB 1252.

### **4. Public Safety and Administrative Rulemaking**
   - **House Bill 1328**: This bill defines first responders (firefighters, law enforcement, EMS, etc.) as essential service providers, ensuring they receive the same protections as other essential workers during emergencies. It passed unanimously (16-0).
   - **House Bill 1622**: This bill addresses administrative rulemaking processes, including record retention, rule certification, and interim rules. Key provisions include:
     - Requiring boards under the OPLC to specify record retention periods.
     - Speeding up the publication of new rules and making them available online immediately.
     - Allowing conditional approvals for rule changes and clarifying the process for interim rules.
     - Requiring agencies to refund fines or fees collected under expired rules.
   - **Germane Amendment**: An amendment adjusted timelines for rule submissions and conditional approvals, giving the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) more time to review proposals.

### **5. Columbus Day and Italian American Heritage**
   - **House Bill 1335**: This bill proposed eliminating Columbus Day as a state holiday. The discussion centered on the cultural and historical significance of the holiday for Italian Americans.
   - **Opposition**: Strong opposition came from Italian American community members, including Senator Lou D’Allesandro, who argued that Columbus Day celebrates Italian American heritage and contributions. Speakers highlighted the struggles of Italian immigrants and the holiday’s role in combating anti-Italian discrimination.
   - **Historical Context**: Testifiers noted that Columbus Day was established in response to the 1891 lynching of Italian immigrants in New Orleans and serves as a symbol of unity and the American dream.
   - **Committee Decision**: The committee voted 14-1 to recommend the bill as “inexpedient to legislate,” effectively rejecting it. One member objected to placing the bill on the consent calendar, arguing that the full House should vote against it to make a clear statement.

### **Key Takeaways**
   - **Recordkeeping and Licensing**: Efforts are underway to modernize record retention and clarify licensing rules, with a focus on public safety and accountability.
   - **Plumbing Apprenticeships**: While workforce shortages are a concern, changes to apprenticeship regulations are complicated by federal oversight. Alternative solutions like trade school investments were proposed.
   - **Native American Recognition**: Support for state recognition of the Abenaki tribe was strong, but concerns about redundancy and costs led to further study of the issue.
   - **Public Safety Protections**: First responders were officially recognized as essential service providers, ensuring they receive necessary protections during emergencies.
   - **Columbus Day**: The committee rejected the bill to eliminate Columbus Day, emphasizing its cultural and historical significance to Italian Americans.

The meeting highlighted the importance of balancing administrative efficiency, public safety, cultural preservation, and workforce development in legislative decision-making.
