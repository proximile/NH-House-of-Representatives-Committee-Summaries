The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 7, 2024, focused on labor and wage-related legislation, with significant attention given to **House Bill 1377** ("Right to Work") and **House Bill 1322** (minimum wage). The discussions highlighted deep divisions on issues of worker rights, economic fairness, and the role of government in regulating labor practices.

### **Key Discussions and Debates:**

#### **1. Right to Work (HB 1377):**
The debate over "Right to Work" legislation centered on whether workers should be required to join or financially support a union as a condition of employment.

- **Supporters** argued that the bill protects individual freedom by allowing workers to choose whether to join or financially support a union. They emphasized that mandatory union dues infringe on workers' rights and claimed that "Right to Work" states experience higher employment growth and attract more businesses. Supporters also argued that unions would become more accountable to their members if dues were not mandatory.
  
- **Opponents** countered that the bill would weaken unions, reduce worker protections, and lead to lower wages and poorer working conditions. They highlighted the historical role of unions in securing benefits like fair wages, safety standards, and retirement plans. Opponents also pointed to the racist origins of "Right to Work" laws in the Jim Crow South, designed to divide workers and weaken unions. Union members shared personal stories of how union membership provided stable careers and benefits, and clergy members testified that the bill is morally wrong and goes against principles of economic justice.

#### **2. Minimum Wage (HB 1322):**
The discussion on the minimum wage bill focused on whether New Hampshire should raise its minimum wage to $17 by 2025.

- **Supporters** argued that the high cost of living in New Hampshire necessitates a higher minimum wage to provide economic security for low-wage workers. They cited studies showing that states with higher minimum wages experienced faster employment growth and argued that raising wages would reduce poverty, improve worker morale, and help address the state’s labor shortage. Supporters also noted that neighboring states like Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine have higher minimum wages, driving workers out of New Hampshire.
  
- **Opponents** moved to **indefinitely postpone (ITL)** the bill, arguing that wages should be determined by the market rather than government intervention. They expressed concerns about potential job losses and increased costs for businesses, with some sharing anecdotes of individuals earning above the minimum wage without government mandates.

#### **3. Other Labor-Related Bills:**
- **4-Day Work Week Bill:** A bill proposing a 4-day work week was discussed but ultimately deemed inexpedient due to concerns about reducing billable hours and hiring challenges in a tight labor market.
  
- **Veterans' PTSD Resources:** A bill requiring employers to notify veterans of PTSD resources was moved to interim study after the sponsor requested it be tabled, with the committee agreeing it needed further refinement.
  
- **Polygraph Testing Bill:** A bill prohibiting employers from using polygraph tests was deemed inexpedient, as there was no evidence of such tests being used outside of law enforcement.
  
- **Freelance Employee Protections:** A bill addressing protections for freelance employees was moved to interim study, with representatives agreeing the issue needed more work and suggesting potential solutions from unions like the Screen Actors Guild or Writers Guild.

#### **4. General Themes:**
- **Worker Rights vs. Employer Flexibility:** The debates centered on balancing workers' rights to fair wages and benefits with employers' ability to manage their businesses without excessive regulation.
  
- **Economic Competitiveness:** Both sides discussed the impact of these policies on New Hampshire’s ability to attract and retain workers and businesses compared to neighboring states.
  
- **Moral and Ethical Considerations:** Some representatives framed the issues in moral terms, arguing that no one should work full-time and still live in poverty, emphasizing the importance of economic justice and fair labor practices.

### **Outcome:**
The meeting concluded with procedural motions, including an ITL motion for the minimum wage bill, which was supported by some members but opposed by others advocating for a higher wage floor. Several other bills were tabled or moved to interim study due to unresolved issues or lack of consensus. The discussions reflected broader national debates about labor rights, economic fairness, and the role of government in regulating wages and workplace conditions. The committee will continue to review and refine these bills before making final decisions.
