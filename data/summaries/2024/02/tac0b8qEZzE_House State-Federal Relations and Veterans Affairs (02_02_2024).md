### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on February 2, 2024

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 2, 2024, to address a wide range of legislative and policy issues, with a particular focus on public health, state sovereignty, historical injustices, and campaign finance reform. The meeting featured extensive debates, testimonies, and votes on several key bills and resolutions, reflecting deep divisions on many issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. House Bill 1156 (HB 1156): Limiting CDC and WHO Influence**
The most contentious topic of the meeting was **House Bill 1156**, which seeks to prevent New Hampshire and its municipalities from enforcing mandates, recommendations, or guidance from the **CDC (Centers for Disease Control)** or the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. The bill is framed as a **nullification measure** under the **10th Amendment**, aiming to protect state sovereignty and individual freedoms.

**Key Points:**
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the **New Hampshire Nurses Association** and medical professionals like **Carol Townsen**, argued that the bill would hinder access to critical public health resources and federal funding. They emphasized the CDC’s role in providing evidence-based guidance, particularly during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Support**: Proponents, including **Representative Mike Beler** and **Dr. Karina Lindley**, criticized the CDC and WHO for overreach, politicization, and alleged collusion with foreign governments. They warned of future pandemics being exploited to impose draconian measures, such as lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and censorship.
- **Debate**: The discussion highlighted a divide between those who view the CDC and WHO as essential public health authorities and those who see them as threats to state autonomy and individual freedoms. Concerns were raised about the potential for inconsistent public health policies across municipalities if the bill passes.

#### **2. COVID-19 Response and Vaccine Concerns**
Several discussions focused on the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with widespread criticism of the CDC and WHO’s handling of the crisis. Key points included:
- **Criticism of CDC and WHO**: Representatives and speakers cited inconsistencies in guidance, lack of transparency, and perceived failures, such as shifting mask mandates and vaccine recommendations.
- **Impact of Mandates**: Testimonies highlighted the negative consequences of COVID-19 mandates, including job losses, mental health issues, and disruptions to education.
- **Vaccine Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, with allegations of severe side effects and criticisms of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) process.
- **Local Control**: Many emphasized the importance of New Hampshire maintaining autonomy over public health decisions, rather than adhering to federal or international directives.

#### **3. HCR1: Condemning Restrictions on Medication Abortion**
The committee debated **HCR1**, a resolution condemning medically unnecessary restrictions on medication abortion. The motion to pass the resolution resulted in a 10-10 tie, failing to advance.

**Key Points:**
- **Support**: Supporters highlighted the importance of medical providers’ expertise and New Hampshire’s historical bipartisan support for reproductive rights. They emphasized the safety and efficacy of medication abortion, which has been used for 20 years.
- **Opposition**: Opponents expressed concerns about the resolution’s alignment with ongoing Supreme Court litigation regarding the FDA’s authority. Some argued the resolution was unnecessary or premature given the legal context.

#### **4. 13th Amendment and Involuntary Servitude**
**Representative Amanda Balden** presented a resolution urging Congress to close the loophole in the **13th Amendment** that allows involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime. The resolution highlighted the historical context of Black Codes and convict leasing, as well as the ongoing impact of this loophole, particularly in Southern states where prisoners are forced to work without compensation.

#### **5. Veteran Suicide and USS Liberty Incident**
The committee discussed the issue of veteran suicide, with guest speakers scheduled to address the topic in a future session. Additionally, **HB 1041**, which calls for an investigation into the 1967 attack on the USS Liberty, was addressed. Survivors of the attack were present, and the committee voted unanimously to recommend an interim study to seek justice for the survivors.

#### **6. Article 5 Conventions and Campaign Finance Reform**
The committee debated resolutions related to **Article 5 conventions** and campaign finance reform:
- **HCR8**: A resolution supporting an Article 5 convention focused on campaign finance reform passed 15-5.
- **HCR9**: A resolution to rescind a previous application for an Article 5 convention related to a balanced budget amendment failed 15-5, with the committee voting to indefinitely postpone the resolution.
- **Campaign Finance Reform**: Testimonies highlighted bipartisan support for addressing the influence of money in politics through an Article 5 convention.

---

#### **7. Jones Act Repeal (HR19)**
The committee debated **HR19**, a resolution calling for the repeal of the **Jones Act**, a century-old law regulating maritime commerce. Proponents argued the act increases costs and harms national security, while opponents emphasized its role in protecting American jobs and industries. The motion to pass the resolution ended in a 10-10 tie, meaning it did not pass.

#### **8. Environmental Remediation in Maram**
**Representative Sebert** proposed an amendment to **HR 28**, ensuring that responsible parties, not New Hampshire taxpayers, bear the costs of environmental cleanup in the Maram area. The amendment was unanimously supported.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored deep divisions on issues ranging from public health and state sovereignty to historical injustices and campaign finance reform. While some measures, like HCR8, advanced with bipartisan support, others, such as HB 1156 and HCR1, highlighted the challenges of balancing public health needs, individual freedoms, and state autonomy. The committee plans to reconvene to address additional measures and continue its work on these critical issues.
