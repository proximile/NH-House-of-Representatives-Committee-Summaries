**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/06/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 6, 2024, to discuss and debate a wide range of bills addressing environmental sustainability, agricultural practices, and consumer protection. The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing economic, environmental, and regulatory considerations while addressing pressing issues such as food safety, waste management, and animal welfare. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Food Production and Safety**
- **HB 1565 (Homestead Food Sales)**: This bill, which facilitates the sale of homestead food to consumers, was amended to exclude processed acidified foods from the hazardous food definition, benefiting local producers. The amendment was adopted unanimously, and the bill moved forward.
- **HB 1685 (Artisan Foods)**: This bill redefines homestead foods as artisan foods and allows the production and sale of refrigerated artisan food products. The committee referred the bill to interim study to explore food safety and regulatory measures for expanding local food offerings.
- **HB 1327 (Farmers Markets Definition)**: The sponsor requested the bill be indefinitely postponed (ITL) due to a misunderstanding of its implications, and the committee agreed.

### **2. Waste Management and Recycling**
- **HB 1386 (Lithium-Ion Battery Disposal)**: This bill prohibits the disposal of lithium-ion batteries in landfills, composting facilities, or incinerators. It includes an amendment updating electronic waste definitions and mandates educational materials on safe battery handling. The bill received strong support due to the fire hazards and environmental risks posed by improper disposal.
- **HB 1376 (Recycling Labeling)**: The bill seeks to ban the use of recycling logos on plastic containers unless the material has a 75% statewide recycling rate. While intended to reduce misleading claims, the NH Department of Environmental Services (DES) opposed it due to enforcement challenges. The committee emphasized the need for better public education on recycling.
- **HB 1504 (Architectural Paint Recycling)**: This bill proposes a system for recycling architectural paint, modeled after successful programs in other states. It was seen as a necessary step to address inconsistent recycling options across New Hampshire, though concerns about financial and logistical challenges were raised.
- **HB 1681 (Biodegradable/Compostable Labeling)**: This bill regulates the labeling of products as "biodegradable" or "compostable" to prevent misleading claims. It requires certification for compostable products and aligns with similar legislation in other states. The committee supported the bill as a measure against greenwashing.

### **3. Organic Certification and Agriculture**
- **HB 1184 (Organic Certification Funding)**: The committee debated funding for the state’s organic certification program. While some argued the program was unsustainable, others emphasized its importance to organic farmers. The bill was recommended for further study.
- **HB 1618 (Cooperative Agreement with USDA)**: This bill, which would have required a cooperative agreement with the USDA for organic certification, was ITL due to concerns about financial sustainability and taxpayer costs.

---

### **4. Animal Welfare**
- **HB 1182 (Equine Practices and Animal Cruelty)**: This bill sought to prohibit specific equine practices deemed cruel. The committee voted to ITL, arguing that existing animal cruelty statutes already cover these practices.
- **HB 1680 (Retail Pet Shop Sales)**: This bill aimed to ban the sale of dogs and cats in retail pet shops to combat puppy mills. It was ITL due to concerns about its effectiveness and potential harm to legitimate businesses.

### **5. Environmental Protection and Regulation**
- **HB 1293 (Fertilizer Regulation)**: The committee adopted an amendment reorganizing the bill to regulate certain fertilizers and reduce nutrient runoff into water bodies. The bill passed as amended.
- **HB 1294 (EPA Permits Study)**: This bill was amended to establish a study committee on the financial impact of EPA permits on New Hampshire communities. It passed as amended.
- **CACR 14 (Environmental Rights Amendment)**: This constitutional amendment would enshrine the right to a clean and healthy environment. While some members supported it, others found the language too vague. The committee recommended it as ITL, though a minority report was planned.
- **HB 1630 (Extended Producer Responsibility)**: This bill, addressing extended producer responsibility for waste management, was deemed too broad and complex. The committee voted to ITL but agreed to form an ad hoc committee to study the issue for future legislation.

---

### **6. Emerging Technologies and Food Labeling**
- **HB 1572 (mRNA Technology in Food)**: This bill sought to regulate the use of mRNA technology in food and require labeling for lab-grown meat and insect-based foods. It was ITL due to its broad scope and unworkable provisions. The committee discussed drafting a letter to the federal delegation to address labeling concerns at the national level.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Public Education and Awareness**: Multiple bills emphasized the need for better public education on issues like recycling, battery disposal, and food labeling.
- **Regulatory Balance**: The committee often opted for further study or interim measures to ensure regulations are practical and sustainable.
- **Environmental and Safety Concerns**: Fire hazards from lithium-ion batteries, nutrient runoff from fertilizers, and the environmental impact of waste were recurring topics.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Testimonies from stakeholders, including municipalities, industry representatives, and advocacy groups, played a significant role in shaping discussions and outcomes.

The meeting concluded with the committee advancing several bills, recommending further study on complex issues, and emphasizing the importance of collaborative and informed decision-making to address New Hampshire’s environmental and agricultural challenges.
