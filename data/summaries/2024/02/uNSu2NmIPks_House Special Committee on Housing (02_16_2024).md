The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing convened on February 16, 2024, to address several critical housing-related bills, reflecting the state’s ongoing housing crisis. The meeting highlighted the urgent need for affordable, accessible, and diverse housing solutions, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations, regulatory barriers, and innovative housing models. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Themes and Issues:**

1. **Housing for People with Disabilities (HB 1168):**
   - **Purpose:** HB 1168 proposes the creation of a special committee to study the impact of the housing crisis on individuals with disabilities. The committee would identify challenges, gather data, and recommend solutions by November 2024.
   - **Challenges:** Testimonies from parents, advocates, and individuals with disabilities highlighted the severe shortage of affordable, accessible housing. Specific needs include ground-floor units, elevators, and supportive housing with services. Many adults with disabilities live with aging parents due to a lack of alternatives.
   - **Barriers:** Long waitlists for Section 8 vouchers, zoning restrictions, and high costs were cited as major obstacles. Licensing requirements for group homes were also criticized as overly burdensome.
   - **Support:** Organizations like AEL New Hampshire and the New Hampshire Council on Developmental Disabilities endorsed the bill, emphasizing the need for a dedicated committee to address these complex issues.

2. **Fire Sprinkler Requirements (HB 1065):**
   - **Overview:** HB 1065 seeks to eliminate sprinkler requirements in existing residential buildings with up to four units, aiming to reduce renovation costs and increase housing supply.
   - **Debate:** The discussion centered on balancing fire safety with affordability. The State Fire Marshal noted that most fire fatalities occur in one- and two-family homes, but installing sprinklers in older buildings is costly and impractical.
   - **Local Control vs. State Mandates:** Some argued for local flexibility, while others favored statewide consistency to avoid regulatory inconsistencies.

3. **Manufactured Housing (HB 1361 and HB 1399):**
   - **Purpose:** These bills aim to clarify and expand opportunities for manufactured housing, a key solution to the affordable housing crisis.
   - **Support:** Advocates emphasized the affordability, energy efficiency, and modern quality of manufactured homes. Cooperative ownership models were suggested to prevent issues like rising lot rents.
   - **Challenges:** Zoning barriers, such as large lot size requirements, were criticized for effectively blocking manufactured housing. Some called for stronger language to ensure municipalities cannot circumvent the intent of the law.
   - **Amendment to HB 1399:** An amendment proposed allowing the conversion of single-family homes into duplexes, with protections for affordable housing, historic districts, and environmental concerns.

4. **Parking Minimums (HB 400):**
   - **Purpose:** HB 400 seeks to limit residential parking requirements to one space per unit to reduce housing costs and encourage development.
   - **Support:** Developers and housing advocates argued that parking mandates increase costs, reduce housing density, and contribute to environmental issues like stormwater runoff.
   - **Opposition:** Concerns were raised about potential overcrowding and illegal parking, with some advocating for local control over parking policies.

5. **Developer Protections (HB 1215):**
   - **Purpose:** HB 1215 aims to protect developers from retroactive changes to building codes or zoning ordinances once a building permit is issued, ensuring cost predictability.
   - **Debate:** While developers supported the bill, concerns were raised about safety and outdated codes if projects are delayed. Suggestions included extending timelines for project completion to balance developer needs with public safety.

### **Testimonies and Personal Stories:**
- **Disability Housing:** Parents shared emotional stories about their adult children with disabilities, emphasizing the urgent need for safe, supportive housing.
- **Affordability:** Young professionals, students, and low-income residents testified about their struggles to find affordable housing, urging support for bills that increase housing options.
- **Manufactured Housing:** Stakeholders highlighted the role of manufactured homes in providing affordable homeownership opportunities, especially for low- and moderate-income families.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Comprehensive Approach:** The meeting underscored the need for a multifaceted approach to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis, including regulatory reforms, increased funding, and innovative housing models.
- **Balancing Act:** Discussions highlighted the tension between local control, safety, affordability, and the need for statewide solutions.
- **Next Steps:** The committee plans to refine the bills, address concerns, and finalize recommendations to move forward with actionable solutions.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting reflected a shared recognition of the severity of New Hampshire’s housing crisis and the need for urgent legislative action. By addressing the unique needs of vulnerable populations, reducing regulatory barriers, and promoting diverse housing solutions, the committee aims to create a more inclusive, affordable, and sustainable housing market for all residents.
