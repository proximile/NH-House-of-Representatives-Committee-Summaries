### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 1420: Public Comment and Agency Responses**
- **Background**: Representative Brown shared a constituent’s struggle to update business information on the state’s economic development website, highlighting inefficiencies in state agencies’ responsiveness.
- **Proposal**: The bill seeks to improve transparency by requiring state agencies to respond to public comments on proposed rules within a specific timeframe and provide detailed explanations for their decisions.
- **Concerns**: Committee members raised feasibility issues, particularly regarding staffing and the potential to prolong the rulemaking process. Agencies like Health and Human Services noted they receive thousands of calls weekly and would need additional resources.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 15-1 in favor of an **interim study** to further examine the issue and refine the proposal without overburdening agencies.

#### **House Bill 16006: State Agency Website Accessibility**
- **Background**: Representative Brown identified inconsistencies in how contact information is displayed on state agency websites, making it difficult for the public to reach agencies.
- **Proposal**: The bill aims to standardize website design to ensure contact information is prominently displayed at the top of each page.
- **Amendment**: An amendment clarified the definition of a “button” and provided a 365-day implementation timeline.
- **Agency Feedback**: The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) indicated they are working on standardizing website designs under the governor’s office’s direction but noted that funding might be needed for faster implementation.
- **Outcome**: The committee supported the bill’s intent but emphasized the need for collaboration with DoIT and the governor’s office to ensure feasibility.

#### **House Bill 1688: Regulation of Artificial Intelligence**
- **Proposal**: Introduced by Representative Tom Corman, the bill seeks to regulate the use of AI by state agencies, prohibiting practices like cognitive behavioral manipulation, unlawful discrimination, and real-time biometric identification for public surveillance. It mandates human oversight for critical decisions and requires disclosure of AI-generated content.
- **Testimony in Favor**: Corman emphasized the need to protect citizens’ rights from biased algorithms and misuse of AI.
- **Concerns**: DoIT Commissioner Dennis Goule opposed the bill, arguing that existing policies can adapt quickly to AI developments. He expressed concerns about compliance feasibility and the bill’s lack of provisions for protecting citizen data.
- **Discussion**: Representatives debated the need for a holistic approach to AI regulation, with suggestions to establish a study committee or commission.
- **Outcome**: The bill remains under review, with potential amendments to address specific concerns.

#### **House Bill 1545: Affordable Housing and Surplus Property**
- **Proposal**: The bill would allow the governor and council to sell or lease state surplus property at less than fair market value to nonprofit organizations for affordable housing development.
- **Support**: The sponsor emphasized that the bill would not directly cost the state money and could help address the housing crisis.

- **Outcome**: The bill was discussed favorably but will undergo further review to address implementation details.

#### **House Bill 1271 and Amendment to House Bill 1095**
- **House Bill 1271**: Focused on manufactured housing and midwifery.

- **Amendment to House Bill 1095**: A 112-page amendment addressing statutory conflicts between the Office of Professional Licensing (OPLC) and various boards.
