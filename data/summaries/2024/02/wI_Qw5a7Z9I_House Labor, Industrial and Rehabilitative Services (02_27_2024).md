The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee meeting on February 27, 2024, centered on a proposed bill regarding wage payment methods, particularly the use of payroll cards as an alternative to direct deposit or paper checks. The discussion highlighted significant concerns and considerations from both employee and employer perspectives, ultimately leading to skepticism about the necessity and potential impact of the legislation.

### Key Points of the Discussion:

1. **Payroll Cards as Default Payment Method**:
   - The bill proposed making payroll cards the default payment method for employees who do not provide banking information for direct deposit or request a paper check. This raised concerns about forcing smaller payroll companies, which may not offer payroll cards, into non-compliance or into contracts with card providers.
   - Critics argued that this approach could limit employee choice and flexibility, as the bill’s language was seen as unclear and potentially coercive in pushing payroll cards on employees who prefer other methods.

2. **Employer Responsibilities and Enforcement**:
   - Employers would be required to ensure employees receive their wages without fees, regardless of the payment method. However, concerns were raised about potential enforcement challenges if employers or payroll companies fail to comply.
   - The bill also included provisions holding employers accountable for technical issues with payroll cards, such as glitches or lost cards, requiring them to provide immediate access to wages through alternative means (e.g., replacement cards, checks, or cash).

3. **Fees and Accessibility**:
   - Representatives expressed concerns about fees associated with payroll cards, such as maintenance fees, ATM withdrawal fees, and replacement card fees, which could disproportionately affect lower-income employees.
   - While the current law mandates that employees access their wages without fees, there was debate over whether additional language was needed to ensure payroll card users could withdraw funds fee-free, as this is already covered in cardholder agreements.

4. **Employee Consent and Protections**:
   - The bill’s potential removal of the requirement for written authorization for direct deposit was opposed by some representatives, who argued that written consent is necessary to protect employees.
   - The discussion emphasized the importance of protecting employees from being forced into payroll card systems while ensuring they have access to their full wages without incurring fees.

5. **Impact on Small Businesses**:
   - The bill could impose additional administrative burdens on small businesses, particularly those without access to payroll card systems. This raised concerns about compliance challenges and the potential for small businesses to be disproportionately affected.

6. **Legislative Intent and Skepticism**:
   - Some committee members questioned whether the bill addressed a genuine problem in the state or if it was driven by companies profiting from payroll card fees. The majority agreed that the current system, which primarily relies on direct deposit, works well and does not require legislative intervention.
   - After extensive debate, a motion was made and seconded to kill the bill, reflecting the committee’s consensus that the existing wage payment system is effective and that the proposed changes could lead to unintended consequences for both employees and employers.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the complexities of introducing payroll cards as a wage payment option, balancing the need to protect employees’ rights with the practical implications for employers, particularly small businesses. The committee ultimately concluded that the current system is effective and that the proposed bill could create unnecessary challenges and risks. The motion to kill the bill reflected their skepticism about its necessity and their commitment to maintaining employee choice and flexibility in wage payment methods.
