The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on February 16, 2024, addressed a wide range of financial, operational, and policy issues impacting the state. The meeting highlighted the successful audit of the state’s 529 college savings plan, debated funding requests for border security and agricultural support, and discussed updates on healthcare, education, and corrections programs.

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

1. **529 College Savings Plan Audit and Performance**:
   - The audit of the state’s 529 college savings plan, conducted in collaboration with Fidelity, was highly successful, with no material weaknesses, errors, or compliance issues identified. Clean audit opinions were released in December 2023.
   - The plan, one of the largest in the country, manages over $24 billion in assets across approximately 950,000 participant accounts. It grew by 14% in 2023, rebounding from a challenging 2022.
   - The plan generated $18.2 million in administrative revenue in FY23, funding around 9,000 scholarships for low-income New Hampshire students. The state aims to expand scholarship opportunities as the plan continues to grow.

2. **Border Security Funding Request**:
   - The governor requested $850,000 to deploy 15 National Guard members to Texas to assist with border security efforts. The request was framed as a response to the ongoing crisis at the southern U.S. border, which impacts New Hampshire through drug trafficking (particularly fentanyl), human trafficking, and potential terrorism threats.
   - The committee debated the request, with some questioning its effectiveness and suggesting that funds might be better spent on in-state drug prevention and enforcement. Others supported the initiative as part of a broader national effort to combat the fentanyl epidemic. The motion to approve the funding passed with a 6-4 vote.

3. **Staffing Challenges at the Veterans Home**:
   - The New Hampshire Veterans Home faces a 44% nursing vacancy rate. Recruitment efforts include job fairs, press releases, and a licensed nursing assistant program. To maintain quality care, the facility has capped its resident census.

4. **Mobile Integrated Health Program**:
   - This program, led by local fire and EMS agencies, focuses on proactive healthcare initiatives to reduce emergency calls and hospital visits. Activities include community outreach, education, and home safety assessments.

5. **Behavioral Health and Crisis Intervention**:
   - A federal grant will support behavioral health initiatives within the criminal justice system, funding positions such as a Behavioral Health Initiatives Coordinator and a Statewide Treatment Courts Coordinator. The goal is to standardize treatment and improve crisis intervention.

6. **Agricultural and Highland Games Funding**:
   - A request for ARPA funds to support farmers affected by extreme losses was discussed, with funds expected to be distributed starting April 1st.
   - Another ARPA funding request was made to reimburse the Highland Games for weather-related losses. The event significantly contributes to local tourism and the economy.

7. **Education and Corrections Updates**:
   - A $6 billion construction project for an educational facility is on track for completion by June 2025, with $3 billion of the budget remaining.
   - The Corrections Department discussed rising medication costs, particularly for long-acting antipsychotic injections, and efforts to manage expenses through programs and negotiations with manufacturers.

### Closing Remarks and Future Meetings:
The committee praised the audit team for their work on the 529 plan and highlighted its positive impact on New Hampshire families. The meeting concluded with a unanimous motion to adjourn. The next fiscal committee meeting was scheduled for March 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM, with potential additional meetings in early April.

Overall, the meeting emphasized transparency, accountability, and the effective use of state and federal funds to address critical issues ranging from education and healthcare to border security and economic support.
