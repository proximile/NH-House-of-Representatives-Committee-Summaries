The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 20, 2024, addressed a range of criminal justice and public safety issues, focusing on several key bills. The discussions highlighted debates over mandatory minimum sentencing, bail reform, firearm licensing, and the role of treatment versus incarceration in addressing drug offenses. Here is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1713 (HB 1713)**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill seeks to make it a felony for individuals charged with a Class A felony or greater to fail to appear for trial or sentencing.  
   - **Background**: The bill was introduced by Representative Steve Schliff in response to the case of Adam Montgomery, who refused to attend his trial or sentencing for the murder of his 5-year-old daughter.  
   - **Debate**: Concerns were raised about balancing defendants' Sixth Amendment rights with the trauma experienced by victims, particularly in sexual assault cases. The bill includes exceptions for valid absences (e.g., family emergencies) and passed unanimously in committee, with potential amendments to address concerns about consecutive sentencing.

2. **Senate Bill 482 (SB 482)**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill grants the New Hampshire National Guard’s Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps access to criminal records of Guard members to maintain discipline and security clearances.  
   - **Support**: Major General David Mikolaities and Captain Ryan Allis testified that the lack of access to criminal records hinders the Guard’s ability to address issues like domestic violence. The bill was supported by the State Veterans Advisory Committee.

3. **Senate Bill 376 (SB 376)**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill establishes a Corrections Education and Vocational Planning Group to improve educational and vocational programs for incarcerated individuals, aiming to reduce recidivism and enhance workforce development.  
   - **Testimony**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Department of Corrections and the Community College System highlighted the success of prison education programs in improving self-efficacy and post-release employment opportunities.

4. **Senate Bill 322 (SB 322)**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill requires licensing authorities to sign and include their name, title, and signature on licenses to carry a loaded pistol or revolver, addressing issues arising from constitutional carry laws.  
   - **Constituent Testimony**: Cheryl Dean shared her experience with a police chief’s refusal to sign her concealed carry permit, leading to a court case and the proposed legislation.

5. **Senate Bill 248 (SB 248)**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill addresses gaps in the bail system, ensuring individuals charged with serious offenses (e.g., violent crimes, sex crimes against children) are held until they can appear before a judge.  
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers argued that the current bail system already considers the nature of offenses, and segregating certain crimes for differential treatment is unnecessary.

6. **Senate Bill 415 (SB 415)**  
   - **Purpose**: This bill imposes mandatory minimum sentences for distributing fentanyl that results in death, targeting drug dealers rather than individuals sharing drugs in isolated scenarios.  
   - **Debate**: Supporters argued that mandatory minimums are necessary to deter drug trafficking, while opponents emphasized their ineffectiveness, high cost, and potential to increase recidivism. Critics also highlighted the importance of judicial discretion and the need for treatment-focused approaches.

### **Key Themes and Debates**

1. **Mandatory Minimum Sentencing**  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, particularly involving fentanyl, are necessary to deter distribution and hold individuals accountable.  
   - **Opposition**: Critics, including the ACLU and New Hampshire Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, argued that mandatory minimums are ineffective, costly, and disproportionately affect low-level offenders and individuals struggling with addiction. They advocated for treatment and harm reduction strategies instead.

2. **Treatment vs. Incarceration**  
   - **Advocacy for Treatment**: Several speakers emphasized the need to address addiction as a public health issue, investing in evidence-based treatment and recovery programs rather than punitive measures.  
   - **Impact of Punitive Measures**: Concerns were raised that mandatory minimums could deter individuals from seeking help during overdoses, potentially increasing fatalities.

3. **Judicial Discretion**  
   - **Concerns**: Opponents of mandatory minimums argued that these laws remove judicial discretion, leading to potential injustices and disproportionate sentencing for less culpable individuals.  
   - **Proposals**: Some suggested amendments to include the word "knowingly" in statutes to ensure culpability and protect individuals unknowingly transporting drugs.

4. **Bail Reform**  
   - **Proposals**: SB 248 aimed to address gaps in the bail system, ensuring individuals charged with serious offenses are held until they can appear before a judge.  
   - **Compromise**: Professor Albert Scher discussed a compromise package of bills developed after extensive hearings, emphasizing the need for careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted deep divisions over the effectiveness and fairness of mandatory minimum sentencing, with a strong emphasis on balancing public safety with the rights of individuals. The discussions underscored the need for comprehensive approaches to criminal justice reform, incorporating treatment, harm reduction, and judicial discretion. The committee voted unanimously in favor of several bills, with ongoing discussions about potential amendments to refine their implementation.
