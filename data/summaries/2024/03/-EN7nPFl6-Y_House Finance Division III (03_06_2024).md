**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives House Finance Division III Meeting (March 6, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 6, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative topics, focusing on child welfare, disability services, child support, privacy protections, and IT system updates. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and legislative proposals:

---

### **1. Oversight of Child Welfare Facilities**
- **Concerns and Proposals**: Representatives highlighted systemic issues in the oversight of child welfare facilities, particularly **Bledsoe Academy**, which was certified and recertified without proper in-person inspections. The **Office of the Child Advocate (OCA)** emphasized the lack of required visits before placing children in these facilities.
- **Legislative Response**: A proposal to form a subcommittee was introduced to investigate these issues further, given their potential financial impact on the state.
- **HB 1573**: This bill, prompted by the Bledsoe Academy scandal, aims to improve oversight by requiring **monthly visits by case workers** and **judicial reviews every 60 days** (or 30 days if there’s a dispute). Amendments focus on **trauma-informed language** and ensuring children are not placed in residential facilities due to a lack of foster homes. The fiscal impact is unclear, but concerns were raised about the need for **additional judges and staff** to handle the increased workload.

---

### **2. Disability Waiver Services (Bill 1593)**
- **Issue**: Federal guidelines led to the removal of recreational activities (e.g., dance lessons, horseback riding) from the disability waiver program.
- **Proposal**: The bill seeks to create a **temporary state-funded program** to continue these services for one year, with an estimated cost of **$500,000 to $1.2 million**.
- **Debate**: Discussions centered on the fairness of using taxpayer money for recreational activities versus their **social integration and quality of life benefits** for individuals with disabilities. Technical issues with the bill’s language, such as appropriation and lapse dates, were also addressed.

---

### **3. Child Support Bills**
- **HB 1282**: Proposes that child support ends at **age 18** unless the child is in high school (up to **age 19**) or has special needs (up to **age 21**). Fiscal concerns include the cost of updating the IT system to track emancipation dates.
- **HB 1595**: Introduces a formula for child support calculations in shared parenting situations, aiming to reduce litigation and align with federal guidelines.
- **HB 1564**: Discusses adjusting child support based on poverty levels and parental agreements.
- **Fiscal and IT Considerations**: The committee emphasized the need to merge related bills to streamline IT updates and reduce costs.

---

### **4. Privacy Protections (HB 1669)**
- **Proposal**: Ensures that the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services complies with state privacy laws when sharing immunization information with external parties.
- **Debate**: Discussions focused on balancing privacy protections with the potential benefits of sharing immunization data, as well as mitigating risks of data breaches.

---

### **5. IT System Updates**
- A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to the **IT system upgrades** required by several bills. **David Weeders**, the Information Services Director for DHHS, explained the need for research, testing, and system updates, particularly for bills requiring immediate action. The timeline and costs of these updates were a major concern.

---

### **6. HB 1598 - Social Security and Veterans Benefits for Foster Children**
- **Proposal**: Stops the state from taking Social Security and veterans benefits from children in foster care and sets up specialized accounts for them.
- **Fiscal Impact**: Estimated at **$2.1 million annually**, with concerns about the complexity of managing these accounts and the need for additional staffing and legal oversight.
- **Challenges**: Estimating the number of children eligible for these accounts is difficult, with **1,500 children entering the system quarterly** (some may be duplicates).

---

### **Key Concerns and Next Steps**
1. **Fiscal Impact**: Several bills involve significant financial obligations, including HB 1598 (**$2.1 million annually**) and HB 1573 (potential need for additional judges and staff).
2. **Operational Burden**: Increased oversight requirements, such as monthly visits and judicial reviews, could strain existing resources.
3. **Policy vs. Practicality**: Debates centered on the balance between comprehensive oversight (100% inspection) and targeted oversight (audit and escalation based on issues).
4. **Need for Clean Amendments**: The committee requested clearer and more accurate amendments for review.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene for further discussions, focusing on fiscal details, IT system updates, and potential amendments. The committee emphasized the need to balance policy goals with financial and operational realities while ensuring the well-being of children and individuals with disabilities.
