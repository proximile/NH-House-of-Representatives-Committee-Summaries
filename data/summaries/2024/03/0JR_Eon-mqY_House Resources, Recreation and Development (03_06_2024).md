**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on House Bills 1562 and 1390 (March 6, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 6, 2024, centered on two key pieces of legislation—**House Bill 1562** and **House Bill 1390**—both aimed at regulating recreational watercraft to address environmental, safety, and economic concerns. The discussions highlighted the tension between preserving New Hampshire’s natural resources and maintaining access to recreational activities that contribute to the state’s economy and quality of life.

### **House Bill 1562: Regulation of Personal Watercraft (PWC)**

**Purpose and Key Provisions**:  
HB 1562 seeks to update the definition of **personal watercraft (PWC)** in state law to include **two- and three-seater models**, closing regulatory gaps that exclude larger watercraft from existing bans. The bill does not impose new bans but ensures that existing bans on single-seater PWCs apply to larger models. It also allows communities to petition the Department of Safety to restrict or ban PWCs on specific lakes through a public hearing process.

**Support for the Bill**:  
Proponents argue that PWCs can damage shorelines, disturb wildlife, and pose safety risks, particularly on smaller lakes and narrow waterways. The bill aims to address these concerns by enabling targeted regulations based on local needs.

**Opposition to the Bill**:  
Opponents, including the **New Hampshire Marine Trades Association**, contend that the bill unfairly targets PWCs and could lead to widespread bans on lakes under 75 acres and other water bodies. Critics argue that the bill may retroactively apply bans to watercraft previously regulated as boats, creating confusion and impacting law-abiding users. They also highlight the financial and logistical burden on the Department of Safety to handle additional hearings.

**Economic and Recreational Impact**:  
Opponents emphasize that PWCs are vital to New Hampshire’s tourism economy, contributing $1.4 billion annually and supporting over 6,000 jobs. They argue that modern PWCs are quieter, cleaner, and safer than older models and that restrictions would disproportionately affect middle-class families and limit recreational opportunities.

**Compromise and Amendments**:  
The bill’s sponsor, Representative Rung, expressed openness to amendments to clarify that the bill is not retroactive and to address other concerns raised by opponents.

### **House Bill 1390: Regulation of Wake Boats and Wake Surfing**

**Purpose and Key Provisions**:  
HB 1390 proposes regulations on **wake boats** and **wake surfing** to mitigate their environmental and safety impacts. The bill includes **minimum requirements**:  
- Lakes must be **50+ acres**.  
- Wake surfing must occur in **20+ feet of water**.  
- A **500-foot setback** from shorelines and structures.  

**Support for the Bill**:  
Proponents, including **Representative Linda Tanner** and environmental advocates, argue that wake sports cause significant shoreline erosion, disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and pose safety risks to kayakers and swimmers. Studies cited by supporters show that wake boats generate waves with significantly higher energy, which can stir up sediment, promote harmful algae blooms, and damage wildlife habitats.  

**Economic and Public Health Concerns**:  
Supporters emphasize that degraded water quality could harm property values, tourism, and local economies. Examples of increased cyanobacteria blooms and shoreline erosion were provided as evidence of the need for regulation.

**Opposition to the Bill**:  
Opponents, including the **New Hampshire Marine Trades Association** and tourism representatives, argue that the bill unfairly targets wake sports and could harm the state’s $1.4 billion boating industry. They contend that natural factors like storms and high water levels are the primary causes of shoreline erosion and that the bill’s 500-foot setback and 20-foot depth requirements are unenforceable and could create confusion.  

**Compromise Suggestions**:  
Some opponents support **Senate Bill 431**, which proposes a **200-foot setback** for wake surfing, arguing it strikes a better balance between environmental protection and recreational freedom.

### **Key Themes and Debates**

1. **Environmental vs. Recreational Priorities**:  
   The debate highlighted the challenge of balancing environmental protection with recreational access. Supporters of both bills emphasized the need to safeguard New Hampshire’s lakes and shorelines, while opponents stressed the economic and recreational benefits of watercraft activities.

2. **Economic Impact**:  
   Both bills sparked concerns about their potential impact on New Hampshire’s tourism economy, which relies heavily on recreational boating and water sports. Opponents argued that the bills could harm local businesses, reduce property values, and limit access to public waters.

3. **Scientific and Regulatory Disputes**:  
   There was significant debate over the scientific validity of studies supporting the proposed regulations. Critics questioned the evidence linking wake sports and PWCs to environmental harm, while proponents cited peer-reviewed research and regulatory precedents from other states.

4. **Compromise and Education**:  
   Many speakers, including opponents of the bills, emphasized the importance of education and enforcement of existing laws rather than imposing new restrictions. Some suggested starting with less restrictive measures and revisiting the issue later.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the complexity of managing New Hampshire’s waterways in a way that balances environmental preservation, public safety, and recreational access. While supporters of HB 1562 and HB 1390 argue that stricter regulations are necessary to protect the state’s lakes and shorelines, opponents believe the bills unfairly target specific watercraft activities and could harm the state’s economy and boating culture. The discussions highlighted the need for balanced policies based on sound science, economic analysis, and stakeholder input to ensure the long-term health and accessibility of New Hampshire’s public waters.
