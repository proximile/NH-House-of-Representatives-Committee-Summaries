The New Hampshire House State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee met on March 15, 2024, to discuss House Resolution 31 (HR 31), which supports the Design Patent Term Extension Act. The session began with procedural delays due to a late-arriving member. The committee focused on an amendment to HR 31, which replaced references to the "Dignity Through Prosperity Act" with the "Design Patent Term Extension Act," clarifying the resolution's intent.

Key discussions included:

1. **Amendment to HR 31**: Representative Manion introduced the amendment, which was seconded by Representative Gagy. The amendment aimed to align the resolution with the correct federal act. The committee unanimously approved the amendment.

2. **Purpose of HR 31**: The resolution seeks to extend the terms of design patents, particularly for individuals with permanent health conditions (e.g., disabilities), to promote financial independence. Representative Manion explained that the resolution supports fair treatment for those in the disability community who innovate but face challenges with patent protections.

3. **Concerns and Questions**: Several members expressed confusion about the resolution's intent and the federal act it references. Representative Shurtleff raised concerns about supporting a federal bill without fully understanding its contents, while Representative Lane noted difficulty finding information on the Design Patent Term Extension Act.

4. **Motion for Interim Study**: Due to unresolved questions, Representative Shurtleff moved to recommend HR 31 for interim study, which would allow further examination and clarification. The motion was seconded by Representative Lloyd and passed unanimously.

5. **Next Steps**: The committee agreed that the prime sponsor, Representative Sweeney, should address outstanding questions before the resolution proceeds to the full House. If concerns are resolved, the committee could recommend removing the resolution from interim study and advancing it.

The meeting concluded with the appointment of a subcommittee, including Representatives Manion, Gagy, Shurtleff, and Lloyd, to further study HR 31. The session adjourned after addressing procedural matters and ensuring due diligence on the resolution.
