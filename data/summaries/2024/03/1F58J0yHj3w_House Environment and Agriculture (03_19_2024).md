**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting on March 19, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on March 19, 2024, to discuss and vote on several key bills addressing environmental, agricultural, and waste management issues. The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on legislative solutions to pressing concerns, including waste management, pesticide regulation, recycling, and public health. Below is a detailed overview of the session:

---

### **Waste Management and Environmental Protection**
1. **HB 1145**: This bill proposed a public-private partnership to address the state’s trash problem, emphasizing local control over waste management. Despite compelling testimony from 311 supporters, the motion for the bill failed with a vote of 9 to 11. Later in the meeting, the committee revisited the bill in the context of prohibiting private ownership of landfills. Supporters argued that public ownership would enhance control over out-of-state waste and protect public health, while opponents raised concerns about limiting private business opportunities and taxpayer burdens. The committee ultimately recommended killing the bill.

2. **HB 1632**: Aimed at restricting out-of-state waste, this bill was discussed extensively. The committee heard testimony from the Attorney General’s office regarding the potential challenges of enforcing the bill under the interstate commerce clause. The motion for OTP (Ought to Pass) passed unanimously with a vote of 20 to 0.

3. **HB 154**: An amendment (2024 d1210) was proposed and adopted unanimously. The amendment was praised for aligning with waste hierarchy goals and addressing key concerns. The motion for OTP with the amendment also passed unanimously with a vote of 20 to 0.

### **Agricultural and Public Health Issues**
1. **HB 1698**: This bill addressed the use of drones for aerial pesticide application. An amendment was proposed to adjust the height limit for spraying to 20 feet above ground level and align the bill with federal and state definitions of unmanned aircraft. The committee supported the amendment, citing its benefits for reducing pesticide drift and improving agricultural efficiency. The bill was recommended for passage with the amendment.

2. **HB 1574**: This bill sought to remove regulations on the direct sale of raw milk to consumers. After debate, the committee voted to recommend killing the bill (**ITL**), citing public health risks, particularly the potential spread of chronic wasting disease.

3. **HB 1703**: The committee discussed a bill proposing the sale of kangaroo and caribou meat. Concerns about introducing diseases like chronic wasting disease led to a recommendation to kill the bill.

### **Recycling and Environmental Stewardship**
1. **HB 1504**: This bill focused on architectural paint recycling. Representative Murray presented an amendment addressing concerns raised during earlier discussions, including fee structures and the establishment of a stewardship program.
