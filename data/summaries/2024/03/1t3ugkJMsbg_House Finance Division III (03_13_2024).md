### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Finance Division III Meeting (March 13, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 13, 2024, focused on **House Bill 1573**, which seeks to improve oversight and safety for children in residential placements. The discussions centered on balancing robust child protection measures with the practical constraints of judicial, administrative, and fiscal resources. Key themes included judicial workload, facility oversight, fiscal implications, and collaboration among stakeholders. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

### **1. Judicial Oversight and Workload**
The bill proposes significant changes to judicial oversight of residential placements for children, including:
- **Increased Frequency of Hearings**: Shifting from 90-day to 30-day review hearings could triple the number of hearings annually, from 1,200 to 3,600. Aaron Krian, General Counsel for the Judicial Branch, warned of the increased workload and suggested modifying the bill’s language to limit 30-day hearings to cases with specific objections to placements. This would reduce the burden while maintaining oversight.
- **Emergency Provisions**: The bill includes exceptions for immediate placements, allowing courts to make necessary findings after the fact to address urgent situations.
- **Court-Ordered Placements**: Amendments focus on court-ordered placements rather than voluntary ones, aiming to streamline oversight and reduce costs.

### **2. Facility Oversight and Certification**
The bill introduces measures to enhance oversight of residential treatment programs:
- **Facility Visits**: The original bill required four annual visits to residential facilities, but amendments reduce this to at least two visits (one unannounced) to lower fiscal impacts. There was debate about including aspirational language to encourage more frequent visits without mandating them.
- **Certification Team**: A new certification team will ensure facilities meet state standards. Concerns were raised about the number of positions needed and potential litigation if the state fails to comply with the law.
- **Placement Restrictions**: Children cannot be placed outside New England without approval from the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) director, aiming to keep children closer to their families and reduce reliance on out-of-state facilities.
- **Case Worker Visits**: Amendments allow flexibility for case workers to conduct virtual visits (e.g., via video conferencing) instead of requiring all in-person visits, reducing costs while ensuring comprehensive assessments.

### **3. Fiscal Implications**
The fiscal impact of the bill was a major point of discussion:
- **Judicial Costs**: Increased hearings and oversight could require additional judicial positions, significantly raising costs.
- **IT System**: Developing a certification system for residential treatment programs was initially estimated at $500,000 but is now projected to cost $1 million due to its complexity.
- **Cost Reductions**: Amendments aimed to reduce costs by limiting the scope of mandatory hearings, allowing virtual visits, and focusing on court-ordered placements.
- **Federal Compliance**: The bill ensures compliance with federal standards, such as the Family First Prevention Services Act, which ties federal funding to the appropriate use of residential care.

---

### **4. Amendments and Policy Objectives**
The meeting focused on refining the bill to achieve its policy objectives while addressing practical challenges:
- **Technical Changes**: Amendments include clarifications and adjustments to align the bill’s language with its intent, such as removing a detailed checklist from statutory language and developing it in consultation with the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA).
- **Reporting Requirements**: DCYF will issue an annual report on the bill’s implementation, shared with relevant policy committees and the Children's Oversight Committee.
- **Collaboration**: Stakeholders emphasized the need for collaboration between DCYF, OCA, judges, and other parties to ensure effective implementation and address concerns.

### **5. Legislative Process and Deadlines**
The committee worked on drafting an official amendment by Monday to ensure the bill could be voted on by Friday. The amendment aimed to address fiscal implications, judicial workload, and facility oversight while maintaining the bill’s core objectives.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of implementing policy changes that require significant judicial, administrative, and fiscal resources. The discussions aimed to refine **House Bill 1573** to enhance oversight and safety for children in residential placements while balancing practical constraints. Key outcomes included amendments to reduce fiscal impacts, improve facility oversight, and ensure judicial oversight remains manageable. The bill’s success will depend on effective collaboration among stakeholders and careful consideration of its fiscal and operational implications.
