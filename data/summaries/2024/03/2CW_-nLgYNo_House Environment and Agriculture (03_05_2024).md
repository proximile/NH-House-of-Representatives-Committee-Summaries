### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Environment and Agriculture (March 5, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on March 5, 2024, to discuss several bills, with **House Bill 1102 (HB 1102)** taking center stage. This bill, which seeks to regulate the breeding and sale of **brachycephalic animals** (short-faced breeds like French Bulldogs, Pugs, and Persian cats), sparked extensive debate over animal welfare, breeding ethics, and legislative enforcement. The meeting also addressed other bills related to animal welfare and environmental issues, including paint recycling, exotic animal ownership, and rodent traps.

### **Key Focus: House Bill 1102**

#### **Purpose of the Bill**
HB 1102 aims to **prohibit the intentional breeding or selling of animals with deformities that cause suffering**, specifically targeting brachycephalic breeds. The bill does not ban specific breeds but seeks to prevent the breeding of individuals with deformities that lead to chronic health issues such as **Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS)**, spinal malformations, and reduced lifespans. The sponsor, Representative Reed, emphasized that the bill targets unethical breeding practices rather than the breeds themselves.

#### **Health Concerns in Brachycephalic Breeds**
- **Health Issues**: Brachycephalic breeds often suffer from severe health problems due to selective breeding for extreme physical traits. These include **breathing difficulties (BOAS)**, dental issues, heat intolerance, brain compression, and shorter lifespans. Veterinarians testified that these conditions result in chronic suffering and high medical costs.
- **Insurance and Costs**: Brachycephalic breeds are **four times more expensive to insure** due to their health issues, with pet insurance companies increasingly reluctant to cover them.
- **International Precedents**: Supporters cited countries like **Norway, Germany, and Austria**, which have banned or restricted the breeding of brachycephalic breeds, labeling it "torture breeding."

#### **Support for the Bill**
- **Animal Welfare Advocates**: Organizations like **PETA** and individual pet owners testified in support, sharing personal stories of the financial and emotional toll of caring for brachycephalic animals. They argued that intentional breeding of animals with known deformities constitutes **animal cruelty**.
- **Scientific Evidence**: Supporters highlighted research showing shorter life expectancies and higher rates of health problems in brachycephalic breeds.
- **Legislative Need**: Advocates stressed that **education alone has not been effective** in curbing unethical breeding practices, necessitating legislative action.

#### **Opposition to the Bill**
- **Breeders and Enthusiasts**: Breeders, particularly those of brachycephalic breeds, argued that the bill is **overly broad, vague, and unenforceable**. They contended that **responsible breeders** prioritize the health and welfare of their animals and that brachycephalic traits are not inherently cruel.
- **Constitutional and Practical Concerns**: Opponents raised concerns about the bill's **constitutionality**, potential for **overreach**, and the difficulty of enforcing it. They warned that the bill could **criminalize responsible breeding practices** and limit consumer choice.
- **Genetic Diversity**: Critics argued that the bill could inadvertently reduce **genetic diversity** within certain breeds, further exacerbating health issues.

#### **Proposed Amendments and Solutions**
- **Clarifying Language**: Suggestions were made to clarify the bill's language, focusing on breeding practices that **knowingly cause suffering** rather than targeting all brachycephalic breeds.
- **Educational Approach**: Opponents advocated for **education and voluntary reform** rather than legislation, emphasizing the importance of informing the public about responsible breeding practices.
- **Revising Breed Standards**: Some proposed revising **breed standards** set by organizations like the **American Kennel Club (AKC)** to prioritize health over appearance.

#### **Enforcement Challenges**
- **Defining Suffering**: There was debate over how to define and measure suffering in animals, with some suggesting that veterinarians should assess it.
- **Impact on Shelters**: Concerns were raised that the bill could **prohibit shelters** from adopting out brachycephalic animals, even if they are healthy, potentially leading to **euthanasia** or overcrowding.

### **Other Key Bills Discussed**

1. **HB 155 (Animal Abuse Offender Registry)**:
   - The committee voted to **recommend killing the bill**, citing due process concerns and its inability to achieve intended goals.

2. **HB 1325 (Private Ownership of Exotic Animals)**:
   - The committee voted to **recommend killing the bill**, arguing that wild animals like kangaroos, raccoons, and monkeys are unsuitable for private ownership and could burden shelters.

3. **HB 1351 (Prohibition of Adhesive-Based Rodent Traps)**:
   - The committee debated the bill, expressing concerns about the inhumane nature of glue traps and potential for bycatch. They voted to **recommend an interim study** to explore alternatives.

4. **HB 1316 (Co-Ownership of Dogs)**:
   - The committee concluded the issue was more related to **local zoning and fraud** rather than requiring statutory changes.

5. **HB 1173 (Disposition of Vicious Dogs)**:
   - The committee expressed concerns about the bill's **mandatory euthanasia provisions**, preferring to maintain discretion for law enforcement and judges under existing statutes.

6. **HB 501 (Repealing Annual Dog Registration)**:
   - The committee **opposed repealing annual dog registration**, emphasizing its importance for **rabies vaccination tracking** and animal control.

7. **HB 1556 (Exemptions from Rabies Vaccination)**:
   - The committee reviewed feedback from the state veterinarian and expressed **skepticism about expanding exemptions**, noting the success of current rabies vaccination programs.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the **complexity of addressing animal welfare in the context of selective breeding**, particularly for brachycephalic breeds. While HB 1102 seeks to protect animals from suffering caused by unethical breeding practices, it faces significant opposition from breeders and enthusiasts who argue for **education and voluntary reform** rather than legislative action. The committee also addressed other bills related to animal welfare and environmental issues, emphasizing the importance of **balanced, enforceable policies** that prioritize both animal health and public safety. The debate underscored the need for **ongoing collaboration** among breeders, veterinarians, and animal welfare advocates to address these challenges effectively.
