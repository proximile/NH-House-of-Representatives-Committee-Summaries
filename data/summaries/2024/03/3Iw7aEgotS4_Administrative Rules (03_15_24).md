The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 15, 2024, primarily focused on administrative rules and emergency rule proposals. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Quorum and Minutes**: The meeting began with establishing a quorum and adopting the minutes from the previous meeting. The absence of a transcriptionist was noted, emphasizing the need for clear motions and the use of pink cards for audience members.

2. **Real Estate Appraiser Board Proposal**: The committee discussed a proposal from the Real Estate Appraiser Board, which had several issues, including expired sections, unclear language, and discrepancies between rule text and forms. The committee considered a preliminary objection to allow the board to address these issues.

3. **Soil Scientists Certification**: The committee reviewed rules for soil and wetland scientists' certification. Issues included a non-functional web link, expired rules, and fee collection during a period of unenforceability. The committee moved for conditional approval with specific edits.

4. **Engineers Licensing**: The committee discussed rules for the licensing of engineers, including expired fee rules and the need for clarity in statutory language regarding third-party testing. The committee accepted a late-filed amended conditional approval request and moved to approve the proposal with considerations for future rule cleanup.

5. **Opioid Abatement Commission Emergency Rule**: The committee heard from the Department of Corrections commissioner about an emergency rule aimed at expediting the use of opioid trust fund dollars. The committee acknowledged the basis for the emergency rule but noted that several questions raised would be addressed during the regular rulemaking process.

6. **Postponement of Items**: Several items were postponed to the April meeting, including watercraft safety rules and a proposal related to the Board of Accountancy.

7. **Nurse Registration Fees**: The committee discussed an issue where a fee was stated in the rules but not listed in the PLC 10002, leading to a situation where no fee could be charged until it was added. The committee moved to approve the proposal with the understanding that no fee would be charged until it was properly listed.

8. **Expedited Revision to Educator Forms**: The committee considered an expedited revision to educator forms, which included issues with titles, school year references, and requirements not in the rule. A preliminary objection was moved to allow the agency to make necessary revisions.

9. **Cancellation of Continued Meeting**: The committee agreed to cancel a continued meeting and plan to meet at the next regularly scheduled meeting on April 19th.

Throughout the meeting, the committee addressed various administrative rules, focusing on clarity, consistency, and the proper enforcement of rules, especially concerning fees and the certification of professionals. The committee also dealt with the process of handling emergency rules and the importance of addressing issues during the regular rulemaking process.
