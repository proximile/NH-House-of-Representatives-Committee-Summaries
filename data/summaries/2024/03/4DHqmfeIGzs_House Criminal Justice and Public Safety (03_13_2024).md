The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 13, 2024, to discuss and vote on several bills related to criminal justice and public safety.

Below is a detailed summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

1. **Red Flag Laws and Mental Health (HB 1711)**  
   Representatives engaged in a detailed debate on red flag laws versus existing mental health-related firearm seizure laws. Red flag laws allow close individuals to report concerns about someone’s mental health to law enforcement, potentially leading to the temporary confiscation of firearms. In contrast, existing laws require the state to prove an individual is dangerously mentally ill before firearms can be seized. The discussion emphasized the importance of due process and protecting individuals’ rights.  

   The Disability Rights Center proposed an amendment to HB 1711, which:  
   - Requires judges to inform individuals under adjudication of potential firearm seizures and their right to a hearing.  
   - Reduces the time frame for returning firearms from six months to 60 days after proving no danger.  
   - Restricts the sharing of personal information to only what is necessary for identification.  

   The committee voted 18-2 in favor of the amendment and 18-2 to pass HB 1711 with the amendment. The bill also addresses a gap in federal law by providing a process for restoring firearm rights to individuals who are no longer deemed a threat.  

2. **House Bill 1046 - Boating Accident Reporting**  
   This bill requires boat owners to notify law enforcement and file an accident report if their boat is involved in an accident causing over $2,000 in damage, even if they were not the operator. The bill aims to hold boat owners accountable if the operator fails to report the incident, mirroring motor vehicle accident reporting laws.  

   Testimony highlighted cases of property damage and bodily injury caused by boating accidents, underscoring the need for accountability. Concerns about rental boat companies were addressed, with clarification that they would inspect boats after use and report damages exceeding $2,000. The bill passed unanimously (20-0).  

3. **House Bill 1539 - Cannabis Conviction Annulments**  
   This bill allows individuals with past cannabis-related convictions, particularly for minor offenses involving small amounts of cannabis, to petition for annulments. Supporters argued that the bill would rectify past harms caused by cannabis criminalization and help individuals reintegrate into society by clearing their records for offenses that are no longer considered serious.  

   Opponents questioned the need for a separate annulment process, given that one already exists. However, supporters countered that the current process is cumbersome and underutilized. The bill passed with a majority vote, reflecting New Hampshire’s shift toward cannabis legalization and justice reform.  

4. **Procedural Issues and Future Plans**  
   The meeting faced some confusion and procedural delays, particularly regarding amendments and voting on bills. The committee worked to clarify and resolve these issues to ensure accurate record-keeping and compliance with legislative processes.  

   The session concluded with plans to address Senate bills in future meetings and ensure proper handling of amendments and procedural matters.

Overall, the session demonstrated the House’s commitment to addressing critical public safety issues, protecting individual rights, and advancing justice reform in New Hampshire.
