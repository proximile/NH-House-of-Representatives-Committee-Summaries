The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on March 26, 2024, addressed a range of critical education-related topics, including student transportation safety, career and technical education (CTE) funding, teacher shortages, school accountability, and classroom temperature control. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and bills covered during the meeting:

---

### **Senate Bill 443: Student Transportation Safety and Flexibility**
The committee extensively discussed **Senate Bill 443**, which aims to provide school districts with alternative transportation options for students, particularly those in special education, homeless, or foster care. Key points included:
- **Safety Standards**: The bill ensures that vehicles used for student transportation, such as vans or SUVs, meet school bus safety standards, including background checks, vehicle inspections, and driver training. Companies like **EverDriven** already implement additional safety measures, such as drug testing, though this is not explicitly mandated by the bill.
- **Flexibility and Cost Savings**: The bill offers school districts a **supplemental and optional** model to traditional yellow school buses, allowing for cost-effective and timely transportation, especially in rural areas. It focuses on **business vehicles**, not private ones, and aligns with state regulations.
- **Enabling Legislation**: The bill provides a framework for districts to contract with transportation companies but does not mandate its use, leaving decision-making authority with districts and parents.
- **Potential Amendments**: Questions arose about explicitly requiring **drug testing** for drivers and clarifying how the bill differs from existing multi-purpose vehicle regulations.

### **Senate Bill 441: Funding for Career and Technical Education (CTE)**
The committee considered **Senate Bill 441**, which proposes the establishment of an advisory group to explore funding solutions for CTE construction and renovation. Key discussions included:
- **Funding Challenges**: With the state nearing the end of a 20-year CTE funding cycle, the bill seeks innovative funding mechanisms, including partnerships with community colleges and private industries.
- **Student Demand**: CTE centers are struggling to meet increasing student demand, with some turning away applicants due to lack of space. The bill aims to address these capacity issues and support students pursuing vocational careers.

### **Senate Bill 374: Addressing Teacher Shortages**
**Senate Bill 374** proposes allowing school districts to hire part-time teachers without state board of education credentials, provided they work fewer than 30 hours per week, pass background checks, and adhere to ethical standards. Key points included:
- **Concerns About Quality**: Opponents, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association, argued that existing emergency certification and alternative pathways already address shortages without compromising educational standards. Questions were raised about the impact on specialized areas like special education.
- **Federal Compliance**: The committee discussed whether the bill aligns with federal requirements like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

### **Senate Bill 378: Performance-Based Accountability System (PBAS)**
The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 378**, which reestablishes a task force to improve the state’s PBAS. Key discussions included:
- **Refining Metrics**: The task force will evaluate current metrics (e.g., graduation rates, test scores) and consider additional data points, such as postsecondary remediation rates.
- **State vs. Federal Accountability**: The Department of Education emphasized the need for a **state-specific accountability system** separate from federal requirements, which do not fully align with New Hampshire’s educational goals.

---

### **Senate Bill 339: FAFSA Requirement Repeal**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 339**, which seeks to repeal the requirement that parents complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for their child to receive a high school diploma. Key points included:
- **Intrusiveness**: Senator Murphy, the bill’s sponsor, argued that the requirement is unnecessary for students entering trade schools or the workforce directly.
- **House Version**: The House has already passed a similar bill, and Senator Murphy expressed support for the House’s approach.

---

### **Senate Bill 526: Classroom Temperature Control**
The committee examined **Senate Bill 526**, which requires school districts to develop temperature control plans to ensure classrooms remain between 60°F and 88°F. Key points included:
- **Impact on Learning**: Supporters, including the NEA-NH, highlighted the negative effects of extreme temperatures on student performance and teacher effectiveness.
- **Local Control**: Opponents, such as the NH School Boards Association, argued that the bill legislates common sense and that districts already manage temperature issues without state mandates.

### **Additional Notes**
- The committee held a moment of silence in memory of former member Art Ellison.
- Administrative updates included upcoming meetings on April 3 and April 9, with a focus on an audit report related to due process in education.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to address pressing educational challenges, including transportation safety, CTE funding, teacher shortages, school accountability, and classroom conditions. The discussions emphasized balancing **safety, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness** with **educational quality and state-specific needs**. Potential amendments and further testimony will shape the final versions of the bills before voting.
