The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on March 26, 2024, to discuss several key education-related bills, addressing issues ranging from Career and Technical Education (CTE) funding to student transportation, teacher certification, and school accountability systems. The meeting began with a moment of silence in honor of Art Ellison, a former committee member and advocate for adult education, whose legacy includes the famous quote, "Feed the damn kids," emphasizing the importance of supporting children.

### **1. Career and Technical Education (CTE) Funding (Senate Bill 441):**
Senator David Waters introduced **SB 441**, which proposes establishing an advisory group to examine funding sources for CTE construction and renovation. The bill aims to address the upcoming end of the 20-year funding cycle for CTE centers and explores innovative funding models, including partnerships with community colleges and private industry. Dr. Jeff Beard, the state director for CTE, and Yan Fowler, principal of ConVal Regional Technical Center, highlighted the high demand for CTE programs and the need for creative solutions to expand capacity, particularly in health sciences and other popular fields.

### **2. Student Transportation Flexibility (Senate Bill 443):**
**SB 443**, introduced by Senator Sue Prentis, focuses on providing school districts with more flexible transportation options for students with unique needs, such as special education students, homeless students, and foster children. The bill allows districts to contract with companies offering small-capacity, customized transportation services, ensuring these vehicles meet the same safety standards as traditional school buses. Stakeholders, including the School Administrators Association and EverDriven, supported the bill, emphasizing its potential for cost savings and efficiency. The bill is not intended to replace traditional school buses but to supplement them for niche transportation needs.

### **3. University System of New Hampshire (USNH) Trustees and Part-Time Teacher Licensing:**
The committee discussed a bill addressing student trustees in the USNH, proposing to have three student trustees (from UNH, Keene State, and Plymouth State) with voting rights, increasing from the current two. Senator Gray opposed the increase, citing concerns about representation imbalance. Another bill, **SB 374**, aimed to address teacher shortages by allowing districts to hire part-time teachers (working less than 30 hours per week) without state certification, provided they pass background checks and adhere to codes of conduct. The New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA) and the National Education Association (NEA) opposed the bill, arguing that teaching requires pedagogical training and accountability. The Department of Education clarified that New Hampshire uses partial reciprocity for out-of-state teacher licenses, requiring additional testing or coursework to meet state standards.

### **4. Proficiency, Accountability, and School Infrastructure:**
The committee debated how student proficiency is measured and reported, emphasizing the importance of growth metrics alongside proficiency levels. There was a push for a state-specific accountability system tailored to New Hampshire’s needs, rather than relying solely on federal standards. **Senate Bill 526** addressed extreme temperatures in schools, requiring districts to maintain safe classroom temperatures (minimum 60°F, maximum 88°F). Supporters argued that extreme temperatures negatively impact learning and health, while opponents viewed the bill as unnecessary. **Senate Bill 339** sought to repeal the requirement for students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to graduate, with supporters arguing it was intrusive for students not pursuing higher education.

### **5. Performance-Based School Accountability System (Senate Bill 378):**
**SB 378** proposed establishing a task force to develop a performance-based school accountability system aligned with New Hampshire’s definition of an adequate education. The task force would evaluate data and indicators used in the current federal accountability system and consider additional state-specific metrics, such as civics education and career readiness. The committee emphasized the need for clear proficiency levels and performance benchmarks, with some legislators advocating for including career and technical education (CTE) outcomes as a separate indicator. The task force would include educators, parents, public interest groups, and experts to ensure a broad range of perspectives.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on addressing funding and capacity challenges in CTE programs, providing flexible transportation solutions for students with unique needs, balancing teacher certification requirements with workforce shortages, and developing a state-specific accountability system that reflects New Hampshire’s educational priorities. The discussions underscored the importance of innovation, collaboration, and clear communication in advancing education policy across the state.
