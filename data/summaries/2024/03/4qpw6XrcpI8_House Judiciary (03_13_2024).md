### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting (03/13/2024)

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on March 13, 2024, to discuss a wide range of legislative and policy issues, including bill assignments, hearings, and substantive debates on key topics. The meeting also featured a special session with international visitors participating in the International Visitor Leadership Program. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions across all segments:

---

#### **Legislative Business: Bill Assignments and Scheduling**
1. **Senate Bills**:
   - The committee reviewed two Senate bills, with concerns raised that one might have been mistakenly assigned to the Judiciary Committee instead of the Health and Human Services Committee. A member agreed to verify the assignment with the appropriate authorities.
   - Six additional Senate bills were noted as having been sent to the committee, increasing the likelihood of a hearing scheduled for the following Wednesday at 10:00 AM. The hearing would proceed if multiple bills required attention but might be canceled if only one remained.

2. **Senate Bill 255**:
   - The committee revisited **Senate Bill 255**, which had previously been passed with changes involving the Secretary of State in certain processes. The Secretary of State proposed further amendments to remove their role in overseeing corporate privacy obligations.
   - While some members supported the substance of the changes, others expressed concerns about the lack of external oversight, likening it to "putting the fox in charge of the henhouse." Suggestions were made to implement the changes as regulations rather than removing the Secretary of State’s oversight entirely.
   - The committee agreed to continue discussions and prepare for a potential meeting the following Wednesday.

#### **Key Bills Discussed and Voted On**
1. **House Bill 1082**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill addresses the issue of single-member professional limited liability companies (PLLCs) and the appointment of an unqualified assistant manager to handle business closure or transition if the sole professional member becomes incapacitated or dies.
   - **Amendments**: Amendment 1060 clarified that the assistant manager cannot exercise professional judgment or render professional services while in that role and ensured the bill does not override existing professional guidance.
   - **Debate**: Concerns were raised about ethical implications, particularly in legal practices, with suggestions for further input from the bar association and legal experts in the Senate.
   - **Vote**: The committee voted **16-4** in favor of the bill, with no minority report filed.

2. **House Bill 1432**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill criminalizes the use of **deep fakes** (AI-generated manipulated media) to cause harm, such as embarrassment, harassment, defamation, extortion, or financial/reputational damage. It includes exceptions for parody, satire, and certain media activities.
   - **Amendments**: Amendment 1100 refined definitions of "artificial intelligence" and "deep fake" and clarified exceptions, such as for paid political advertisements, parody, and satire, which are protected under federal law.
   - **Debate**: Discussions centered on balancing regulation of harmful deep fakes with First Amendment protections. Concerns were raised about potential misuse in political campaigns, but the committee acknowledged federal law limitations.
   - **Vote**: The amendment was unanimously adopted, and the bill passed **20-0** with consent.

3. **AI Legislation**:
   - The committee highlighted collaborative efforts across multiple committees to ensure consistent definitions of artificial intelligence and deep fakes in related bills.

   - Committee members, including Chair Representative and Vice Chair Scott Wallace, introduced themselves and discussed their responsibilities and backgrounds.

2. **Challenging Issues in New Hampshire**:
   - The committee highlighted contentious topics such as education funding and transparency in governance. The **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)** program, which diverts public funds to alternative education options, was discussed, with differing perspectives on its merits.
   - Judicial selection processes were compared between the U.S. (where judges are often appointed or elected) and European models (where judicial councils oversee appointments). The visitors emphasized judicial independence and self-regulation in their countries.

3. **Abolition of the Death Penalty**:
   - The committee discussed New Hampshire’s abolition of the death penalty and the ethical and legal implications of a person remaining on death row due to the law’s non-retroactive application.

4. **Role of Government in Defining Rights**:
   - Broader discussions touched on the role of government in defining and protecting rights, including landlord-tenant issues and the balance between individual rights and government oversight. Committee members emphasized their collaborative approach to addressing complex and divisive issues.
