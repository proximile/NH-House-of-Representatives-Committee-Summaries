The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on March 11, 2024, covered a wide range of critical issues related to education policy, focusing on cooperative school districts, literacy intervention programs, and various legislative proposals. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### Cooperative School Districts (Co-ops)
The committee extensively discussed the governance, funding, and challenges of cooperative school districts (co-ops), which are agreements between multiple towns to share educational resources. Key points included:
- **Governance and Apportionment**: Issues arose around voting and funding disparities, with smaller towns often feeling disadvantaged by larger towns in decision-making processes.
- **Withdrawal Challenges**: The complexity of withdrawing from co-ops was highlighted, with examples like Carol’s repeated unsuccessful attempts to leave the White Mountain Regional School District.
- **Funding Inequities**: Significant disparities in per-student funding were noted, prompting calls for reform to address inequities.
- **Historical Context**: Many co-ops were established in the 1960s using standardized templates that may no longer align with current demographic and economic realities. Periodic reviews and updates were suggested.
- **Legislative Proposals**: Bills like HB 1195, which would allow different apportionment methods for School Administrative Units (SAUs), were discussed, though concerns were raised about exacerbating inequities.
- **Systemic Reform Needed**: Representatives emphasized the need for a comprehensive review of co-ops, addressing governance, funding, and demographic changes, rather than piecemeal solutions.
- **Consolidation vs. Fragmentation**: While some advocated for consolidation to address declining enrollments, others pointed to the challenges of breaking up co-ops and the potential loss of local control.

### Legislative Proposals and Votes
The committee also reviewed and voted on several education-related bills:
- **Cooperative School Board Districts (Bill 1383)**: Discussions centered on whether school board members should be elected at large or proportionally by town, with concerns about disproportionate representation and conflicts with election laws.
- **Media Literacy Commission (Bill 1087)**: A debate ensued over the creation of a media literacy commission, with concerns about potential political bias. An amendment removed references to a specific organization, but the bill ultimately received a no recommendation after a tied vote.
- **Definition of "Evidence-Based" in Public Education (Bill 1287)**: The bill aimed to define "evidence-based" methods in education. While it initially passed with a recommendation to pass, a subsequent motion to kill the bill also passed, leading to confusion.
- **Degree-Granting Authority (Bill 1453)**: The committee debated restricting degree-granting authority to nonprofit institutions, citing concerns about for-profit schools. The bill received a recommendation to pass after a close vote.

### Literacy Intervention Programs (House Bill 1015)
A significant portion of the meeting focused on **House Bill 1015**, which addresses literacy skill development in elementary grades. A non-germane amendment proposed by Representative Glenn Cordelli introduced a comprehensive approach to improving reading proficiency. Key points included:
- **Amendment Provisions**: Mandatory universal screening for reading and dyslexia, individual reading plans for struggling students, parental involvement, professional development for teachers, and reading improvement grants for underperforming districts.
- **Support for the Amendment**: Proponents argued that the amendment ensures a consistent, statewide approach to literacy improvement, addressing the state’s 52% ELA proficiency rate.
- **Concerns and Opposition**: Critics, including Representative Linda Tanner and Patricia Lovejoy, raised concerns about the fiscal impact, potential overburdening of teachers, and conflicts with existing programs. Deborah Howes of the American Federation of Teachers New Hampshire and Tom Newkirk also opposed the amendment, citing redundancy with recent legislation (RSA 259) and logistical challenges.
- **Tensions Between State Mandates and Local Control**: The discussion highlighted the tension between state-level mandates and local autonomy, with some arguing that districts are already implementing evidence-based literacy programs without additional legislation.

### Implementation Challenges and Broader Issues
The committee also addressed broader implementation challenges related to HB 1015:
- **Resource Allocation**: Concerns were raised about the feasibility of implementing the bill, particularly in resource-strapped districts like Manchester, where 49% of students in grades 3-8 are at the lowest reading level.
- **Impact on Teachers**: The bill’s requirements could add stress to already overburdened teachers, necessitating additional resources and support.
- **Socioeconomic Disparities**: Lower-income districts may struggle to meet the bill’s requirements, exacerbating existing inequities.
- **Funding and Grants**: While the bill proposes $75,000 grants to districts, skepticism remains about whether this amount is sufficient to cover implementation costs, particularly for personnel.
- **Implementation Timeline**: The bill’s July 2024 effective date poses challenges for districts that have already set their budgets, prompting suggestions to delay implementation.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing educational challenges in New Hampshire, from reforming cooperative school districts to improving literacy outcomes. While there was broad agreement on the importance of these goals, significant concerns were raised about the practicality of implementation, resource allocation, and the balance between state mandates and local control. The committee’s discussions highlighted the need for thoughtful, comprehensive approaches to ensure equitable and effective education policies across the state.
