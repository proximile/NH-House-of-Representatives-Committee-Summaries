### **Key Discussions and Concerns**

1. **Amendments to HB 1583**:  
   - The committee debated and passed an amendment to HB 1583, which includes:  
     - Changing the effective date to **July 1, 2025** (initially proposed as July 1, 2024).  
     - Adding language to allow tax collection in anticipation of the implementation date.  
   - The amendment aims to address the complexities of school funding and reduce reliance on property taxes.

2. **School Funding Challenges**:  
   - **Paul Desan (Newington)**: Highlighted the issues with relying on property taxes for school funding, including cash flow management problems for towns and increased tax burdens on property owners.  
   - **Excess SWEP Concerns**: Desan noted that Newington would face significant financial obligations due to excess SWEP, which would lead to higher local tax rates. He also pointed out that incremental funds from the **Rand decision** would not offset the substantial increase in SWEP amounts.

3. **Equity and Local Control**:  
   - Representatives expressed concerns about the shift of authority from local school districts to the state in setting budgets, raising questions about the loss of local control.  
   - They emphasized the importance of ensuring equity in education funding across the state.

4. **Revenue Sources**:  
   - There was a call to explore diverse revenue sources beyond property taxes, such as business profit taxes, liquor commission profits, and gaming commission revenues, to fund education more equitably.

5. **Department of Revenue Administration (Dr) Position**:  
   - The Dr clarified it is neutral on the bill and amendment but raised concerns about:  
     - **Administrative Challenges**: Unclear language and potential roadblocks in implementing the amendment.  
     - **Cash Flow Issues**: The effective date of July 1, 2024, could cause lopsided billing for municipalities, as tax bills for the new fiscal year would not reflect the changes until December.  
     - **Excess SWEP Collection**: No clarity on how shortfalls or excess collections would be handled, potentially leaving municipalities liable for uncollected amounts.  
     - **Administrative Burden**: Significant effort would be required to calculate appropriation caps and gather data, likely falling on municipalities.

6. **Municipal Perspectives**:  
   - **Mark Takoto (Waterville Valley Town Manager)**: Highlighted the immediate financial burden on donor towns, which would face significant tax increases in December 2024. He suggested delaying the effective date to July 1, 2025, to allow for better planning.  
   - **New Hampshire Municipal Association**: While neutral on the bill, they emphasized the complexity of the issue and the need to consider unintended consequences, particularly on local control and municipal budgets.

7. **Policy and Legal Concerns**:  
   - **Constitutional Compliance**: Questions were raised about whether the amendment fully addresses the **ConVal ruling**, which calls for increased state funding for education. The amendment’s spending cap might limit schools’ ability to use additional funds effectively.  
   - **Funding Source**: Concerns were raised about relying on property taxes to fund education, with calls for alternative revenue sources.

### **Proposed Solutions**

1. **Delayed Effective Date**: Shifting the implementation to July 1, 2025, to allow municipalities time to adjust.  
2. **Clarifying Language**: Addressing ambiguities in the amendment to ensure smooth administration.  
3. **Subcommittee Review**: Some members suggested referring the amendment to a subcommittee for further study, but the motion failed.

### **Committee Recommendations and Next Steps**

- The committee voted to recommend HB 1583, as amended, to the full Finance Committee with a **5-4 vote**.  
- They also discussed and passed an amendment to **House Bill 1656**, adjusting the special education aid amount to **$17.7 million** based on subcommittee agreements.  
- Representatives acknowledged that the proposed amendments might face challenges in the full Finance Committee and the House floor, especially in an election year.  
- The committee planned to finalize the amendment and vote on HB 1583 (as amended) before sending it to the full Finance Committee.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing school funding and property tax issues in New Hampshire. While the proposed amendments to HB 1583 aim to provide a more sustainable solution, concerns about timing, administrative burden, and compliance with the ConVal ruling dominated the discussion. Representatives stressed the need for a comprehensive and equitable approach to school funding, including exploring alternative revenue sources and preserving local control. Further deliberation and adjustments are expected as the bill progresses through the legislative process.
