### **Key Focus Areas and Bills Discussed**

#### **1. House Bill 1291 (Accessory Dwelling Units - ADUs)**
   - **Objective**: The bill aims to reduce barriers to ADU construction by allowing homeowners to build **one detached ADU by right** and potentially a second attached ADU, subject to certain restrictions (e.g., size, parking, and aesthetic requirements).
   - **Support**: The bill received strong support from housing advocates, real estate professionals, and nonprofit leaders. Testimonies highlighted ADUs as a cost-effective, high-quality solution to the housing crisis, providing affordable housing options, supporting aging in place, and addressing workforce needs.
   - **Testimonies**:
     - **Alexa Carpenter**, a young professional, shared her struggle to find affordable housing in her hometown and supported ADUs as a way to increase housing options.
     - **Will Walker** emphasized the importance of ADUs for providing long-term housing solutions for his adult son with autism.
     - **Vanessa Blaze** (NH Council on Developmental Disabilities) highlighted the potential of ADUs to offer independent living options for individuals with disabilities.
     - **Bryce Kao** (Manchester Planning Board Chair) stressed the severity of the housing crisis and the need for bold actions to accelerate ADU development.
   - **Opposition**: The Municipal Association opposed the bill, citing concerns about statewide land use mandates and the economic feasibility of ADUs in rural areas. They argued that municipalities are already responding to housing demands effectively.
   - **Amendments**: An amendment proposed by Representative Ellen Reed (Prime Sponsor) clarified parking requirements, limiting them to one space per ADU unit rather than per bedroom. This was seen as a way to reduce unnecessary barriers to ADU construction.

#### **2. Manufactured Housing**
   - **Objective**: The committee discussed an amendment to clarify existing laws, ensuring that municipalities must allow manufactured housing in individual lots, parks, or subdivisions.
   - **Support**: The amendment was viewed as a step toward addressing the housing crisis, with an emphasis on making manufactured housing development "reasonable and realistic."
   - **Concerns**: Some committee members expressed a desire for more aggressive measures to expand manufactured housing stock.

#### **3. House Bill 1215 (Subdivision Regulations)**
   - **Objective**: The bill proposed amendments to clarify that building and fire codes applicable to subdivisions would be based on the date of the building permit issuance, not the subdivision approval date.
   - **Appeals Process**: The amendment also addressed appeals processes, limiting local boards of appeals to cases involving local amendments and directing other appeals to the State Building Code Review Board.

#### **4. House Bill 1065 (Fire Sprinkler Requirements)**
   - **Objective**: The bill addressed fire sprinkler requirements in residential buildings, particularly in structures with up to four dwelling units.
   - **Amendment**: An amendment clarified that municipalities could not impose stricter fire sprinkler requirements than the state fire code. The Fire Marshall raised concerns about mixed-use buildings, but the committee moved forward with the amendment.

#### **5. Parking Requirements**
   - **Objective**: The committee debated a provision limiting municipalities from requiring more than one parking space per housing unit, while allowing developers to provide additional spaces if needed.
   - **Support**: Supporters argued that excessive parking mandates act as barriers to housing development and that housing shortages should take precedence over parking concerns.
   - **Concerns**: Some members raised concerns about potential parking shortages, but the majority supported the amendment, emphasizing the need to prioritize housing.

#### **6. Study Committee on Disability Housing**
   - **Objective**: The committee considered a bill to create a study committee focused on housing for individuals with disabilities.
   - **Amendment**: The amendment added a list of organizations to be consulted and mandated at least six meetings before the November 1st reporting deadline.
   - **Support**: The majority supported the bill, recognizing the importance of addressing housing challenges for the disability community.

   - **Local vs. State Control**: Opponents of HB 1291 argued for local control over zoning and land use decisions, while supporters emphasized the need for statewide action to address the housing crisis.
   - **Incremental Progress**: The committee emphasized the importance of clarity in legislation and incremental progress to address the housing crisis, with a focus on practical solutions like ADUs and manufactured housing.
