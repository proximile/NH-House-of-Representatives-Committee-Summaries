The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on March 29, 2024, to discuss a wide range of bills and issues related to criminal justice, public safety, and emerging technologies. The meeting covered topics such as driving under the influence (DUI), bail commissioners' fees, drone regulation, drug trafficking, fentanyl penalties, parole system reform, and education for incarcerated individuals. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions, proposals, and outcomes:

---

### **Key Discussions and Proposals**

1. **Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Chemical Test Refusals**
   - **Issue**: New Hampshire has a high refusal rate (70-80%) for breathalyzer tests in DUI cases, partly because the penalty for refusal (180-day license suspension) is the same as for taking the test.
   - **Proposal**: Senate Bill 418 sought to increase penalties for refusing chemical tests, including longer license suspensions (1 year for first-time offenders and up to 3 years for repeat offenders) and allowing judges to suspend mandatory jail time for aggravated DUI if the defendant complies with substance abuse evaluation and treatment.
   - **Debate**: Supporters argued that stricter penalties would incentivize compliance and improve road safety, especially with rising poly-drug impairment cases. Opponents raised concerns about the severity of penalties, potential constitutional issues, and the lack of clarity in the Administrative License Suspension (ALS) form.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was discussed extensively, with no final decision recorded in the segments provided.

2. **Bail Commissioners' Fees**
   - **Issue**: Bail commissioners currently receive $40 per case, with no additional compensation for mileage or other expenses.
   - **Proposal**: A proposal to increase the fee to $60 was discussed to better reflect the responsibilities and costs incurred by bail commissioners.
   - **Outcome**: The proposal was debated, but no final decision was recorded in the segments provided.

3. **Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Drones)**
   - **Issue**: Drones pose public safety risks, including interference with medical helicopters and potential weaponization.
   - **Proposal**: Senate Bill 460 aimed to adopt federal drone regulations (Part 107) into state law to enforce safe and responsible drone use. The bill also sought to reinstate a critical section removed during the Senate amendment process.
   - **Outcome**: The committee emphasized the need for education and enforcement to mitigate risks, but no final decision was recorded in the segments provided.

4. **Drug Trafficking and Fentanyl**
   - **Issue**: Drug traffickers use sophisticated methods to conceal drugs, and fentanyl continues to devastate New Hampshire communities.
   - **Proposals**:
     - **Senate Bill 414**: Proposed enhanced penalties for fentanyl-related offenses, particularly in cases involving death.
     - **Senate Bill 316**: Introduced mandatory minimum sentences for fentanyl trafficking into New Hampshire.
   - **Debate**:
     - **Supporters**: Argued that harsher penalties would deter trafficking and hold traffickers accountable.
     - **Opponents**: Raised concerns about unintended consequences, such as discouraging 911 calls during overdoses and the ineffectiveness of mandatory minimums.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **SB 414**: The motion to pass the bill failed with a 10-10 vote, and it will proceed to the floor with no recommendation.
     - **SB 316**: The motion to pass the bill was approved unanimously (20-0) and will proceed to the floor with a recommendation for passage.

5. **Parole System Reform**
   - **Issue**: Systemic problems in the parole system, including high rates of parole violations and the use of correctional facilities to address mental health and substance abuse issues.
   - **Proposal**: Senate Bill 420 extended the work of the SB 251 study committee for another year, requiring an additional report before repealing the committee.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was approved to continue studying the parole system.

6. **Education for Incarcerated Individuals**
   - **Issue**: The role of education in reducing recidivism and helping incarcerated individuals reintegrate into society.
   - **Proposal**: House Bill 376 aimed to establish a planning group to coordinate college education programs for incarcerated individuals, using federal funding.
   - **Debate**:
     - **Supporters**: Highlighted the societal benefits of education in reducing recidivism.
     - **Opponents**: Argued that it was unfair to provide free education to incarcerated individuals while others outside prison must pay for their education.
   - **Outcome**: The motion to pass the bill failed with a 10-10 vote, and it will proceed to the floor with no recommendation.

7. **Synthetic Sexual Images ("Deep Fakes")**
   - **Issue**: The non-consensual dissemination of synthetic sexual images poses significant risks to victims.
   - **Proposal**: Senate Bill 464 sought to prohibit the creation and distribution of "deep fake" sexual images.
   - **Outcome**: The bill was moved to interim study to avoid duplication with another bill already passed.

8. **Pistol Permits**
   - **Issue**: Some police chiefs refuse to sign pistol permits due to liability concerns.
   - **Proposal**: Senate Bill 322 required police chiefs to sign pistol permits, addressing liability issues.
   - **Outcome**: The motion to pass the bill was approved unanimously (20-0) and will proceed to the floor with a recommendation for passage.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Public Safety vs. Individual Rights**: Many debates centered on balancing public safety with individual rights, particularly in the context of DUI penalties, drone regulations, and drug trafficking laws.
- **Rehabilitation vs. Punishment**: Legislators grappled with the balance between rehabilitation (e.g., education for incarcerated individuals) and punishment (e.g., mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses).
- **Technological Challenges**: Emerging technologies like drones and "deep fakes" prompted discussions on the need for updated regulations and enforcement mechanisms.
- **Legislative Process**: The importance of clear language, public education, and collaboration with federal and state agencies was emphasized throughout the discussions.

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**
Several bills were voted on and will proceed to the House floor with varying recommendations:
- **Passed with Recommendation**: Senate Bill 316 (mandatory minimums for fentanyl trafficking) and Senate Bill 322 (pistol permits).
- **Failed but Proceeding**: Senate Bill 414 (enhanced fentanyl penalties) and House Bill 376 (education for incarcerated individuals) will proceed to the floor with no recommendation.
- **Moved to Interim Study**: Senate Bill 464 (synthetic sexual images) was moved to interim study to avoid duplication with existing legislation.

The meeting highlighted the committee's focus on addressing pressing public safety issues while navigating complex legal and ethical considerations.
