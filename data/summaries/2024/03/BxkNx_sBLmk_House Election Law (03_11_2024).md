**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Election Law Committee Meeting (March 11, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee convened on March 11, 2024, to discuss a wide range of election-related bills and proposals. The meeting focused on preserving New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary, improving election administration, enhancing campaign finance transparency, and addressing emerging issues such as artificial intelligence (AI) in political advertising. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Preserving New Hampshire’s Presidential Primary**
1. **CACR 22 (Constitutional Amendment)**:
   - Senator Daryl Abbas introduced **CACR 22**, which seeks to enshrine New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary in the state constitution. Abbas emphasized the primary’s economic and cultural significance, arguing that it generates substantial economic activity and protects New Hampshire from external political pressures, particularly from national committees.

2. **Senate Bill 344 (Primary Date Flexibility)**:
   - Senator James Gray presented **SB 344**, which allows the Secretary of State to designate the presidential primary date without specifying it on the candidate filing form. This change provides flexibility to adjust the primary date if challenges arise to New Hampshire’s primary status.

3. **Senate Bill 380 (State Primary Date Change)**:
   - Senator Tim Lang proposed **SB 380**, which would move the state primary date to the second Tuesday in June, pushing filing deadlines back by 90 days. The goal is to give candidates more time to campaign and voters more time to vet candidates. While concerns were raised about increased workloads for legislators during campaign season, Lang argued that the benefits of a longer campaign period outweigh the challenges.

### **Election Integrity and Administration**
1. **Senate Bill 490 (Checklist Verification)**:
   - Senator Gary Daniels introduced **SB 490**, which changes the frequency of voter checklist verification from every 10 years to every 5 years. The bill aims to improve the accuracy of voter rolls and mitigate potential voter fraud. Representative Bob Weary provided a detailed analysis of the impact of the 5-year cycle, particularly in presidential election years, and suggested alternative verification timing options.

2. **House Bill 1523 (Moderator Worksheet for Elections)**:
   - The committee discussed **HB 1523**, which revises the moderator worksheet for counting votes. An amendment was proposed to include absentee ballot tracking in the pre-election certificate, but concerns were raised about redundancy, as absentee ballots are already tracked through the ElectionNet system. The amendment was adopted 18-2, but the bill itself failed to pass (11-9).

3. **House Bill 1085 (Public Inspection of Absentee Ballots)**:
   - The committee unanimously declared **HB 1085** **inexpedient to legislate**, meaning it will not move forward.

### **Campaign Finance Reforms**
1. **House Bill 1091 (Campaign Finance Overhaul)**:
   - The committee began a work session on **HB 1091**, which aims to streamline campaign finance laws. Key changes include:
     - Simplifying reporting periods by collapsing exploratory, primary, and general election periods into a single cycle.
     - Allowing surplus campaign funds to roll over into new campaign accounts.
     - Synchronizing reporting dates for all political committees.
     - Mandating online reporting through the Secretary of State’s system, with phased implementation starting with higher-level races.

2. **House Bill 1239 (Campaign Finance)**:
   - The committee declared **HB 1239** **inexpedient to legislate**, as similar issues are being addressed in **HB 1091**.

3. **Proposal for Low-Spending Candidates**:
   - Representative Howard proposed an amendment requiring candidates who spend less than $1,000 during a reporting period to attest to this by checking a box on the reporting form. While intended to ensure compliance, some members felt it added unnecessary paperwork.

### **Transparency and Accessibility**
1. **House Bill 1264 (Accessible Voting Systems)**:
   - The committee discussed **HB 1264**, which defines accessible voting systems. An amendment was proposed with input from the Secretary of State’s office, the Disability Rights Center, and the New Hampshire Municipal Association. The amendment was approved 19-0, and the bill was recommended to pass 20-0 with a fiscal note.

2. **Political Advertisement Disclaimers**:
   - Representatives discussed simplifying political advertisement disclaimers by removing the requirement to include a physical address, instead allowing candidates to provide a website where the information is available.

### **Artificial Intelligence in Political Advertising**
1. **House Bill 1596 (Disclosure of Deceptive AI)**:
   - The committee took up **HB 1596**, which requires disclosure of deceptive AI usage in political advertising. A motion was made to declare the bill **inexpedient to legislate**, as the Judiciary Committee is working on a broader AI framework. Supporters argued that the bill is crucial for addressing AI-related issues in the 2024 elections, as it is the only bill that can go into effect before November 2024. The committee recessed to allow for further discussion and potential amendments.
