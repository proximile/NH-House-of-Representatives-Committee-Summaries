The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on March 6, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative topics, including dam safety, housing, child care, education funding, and environmental services. The discussions highlighted key debates over funding mechanisms, state versus local responsibilities, and the balance between addressing urgent needs and ensuring fiscal accountability. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Dam Safety and Environmental Services**
1. **Dam Safety and Liability**:
   - Concerns were raised about the potential hazards of dam removal, including downstream impacts on water management and liability issues.
   - Representatives discussed the responsibilities of states and municipalities for dam removal, as well as the economic and environmental consequences.
   - **HB 1429**, which establishes a fund to help municipalities take over state-owned dams, was debated. Amendments were proposed to clarify which dams are covered (specifically those owned by the Department of Environmental Services) and to address exceptions for imminent danger situations. The fund would allow municipalities to borrow money for dam maintenance, with the state potentially profiting from interest on loans.

### **Housing**
2. **Housing Study Committee**:
   - A bill proposing a study committee to examine the feasibility and impact of low-income and workforce housing tax credits was discussed.
   - Representatives debated the need for the committee, given existing housing-focused committees, and the potential overlap in responsibilities.
   - **HB 1470**, which proposed a study on low-income and workforce housing, was narrowly defeated in its initial motion but later passed with an amendment.

### **Child Care Workforce Funding**
3. **Child Care Workforce Issues**:
   - The challenges faced by child care providers, including difficulty retaining workers due to low wages, were highlighted. The pandemic exacerbated these issues, and there was a call for increased funding to support child care services, particularly for families with two working parents.
   - A bill to establish a trust fund to support the child care workforce was a major topic. It proposed grants for various expenses like tuition assistance, training, and health benefits.
   - There was significant debate over the bill’s open-ended nature, lack of funding caps, and concerns about creating a "blank check" program.
   - **HB 1193**, which proposes a child care tax credit program for employers, was discussed. While the idea was generally supported, concerns were raised about the bill’s mechanism, including the $10 million cap, pro-rating of credits, and administrative challenges. The committee decided to put the bill on hold for further review.

### **Education Funding**
4. **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) and Constitutional Implications**:
   - Sam Garland, Senior Assistant Attorney General, provided an overview of two ongoing cases related to school funding: *ConVal School District v. State of New Hampshire* (filed in 2019) and *Rand v. State of New Hampshire*. The *ConVal* case focuses on the adequacy of base education funding, while *Rand* addresses the constitutionality of allowing towns to retain excess SWEPT funds.
   - The *Rand* case argues that allowing towns to retain excess SWEPT funds violates the state constitution’s requirement for equal and proportional taxation. The judge in the *Rand* case ruled the current SWEPT administration unconstitutional, and the state plans to appeal.
   - Representatives debated whether to pass bills addressing SWEPT immediately or wait for a more comprehensive solution. **HB 1514**, for example, proposes reverting to a pre-2011 system where excess SWEPT funds are remitted to the education trust fund.
   - The political challenges of adjusting SWEPT were discussed, particularly the impact on donor towns (towns that contribute more in taxes than they receive in education funding).
   - Representative Emmerik’s amendment to **HB 1583**, which increases the base per-pupil funding, was discussed. This amendment aligns with the funding level suggested in the *ConVal* case but could significantly increase SWEPT revenue and the number of affected towns.

### **Other Bills and Legislative Actions**
5. **Professional Licensing and Small Business Support**:
   - **HB 1565**, which allows small-scale food producers to avoid a $350 licensing fee, passed unanimously after an amendment corrected an error. It was placed on the consent calendar.
   - **HB 1198**, allowing extended operating days for certain entities to generate additional revenue, passed with one dissenting vote.
   - **HB 1293**, regulating fertilizer use on turf, passed unanimously and was placed on the consent calendar.
   - **HB 1303**, honoring a deceased individual’s wishes, passed unanimously and was placed on the consent calendar.
   - **HB 1709**, creating a commission with no fiscal impact, passed with one abstention and was placed on the consent calendar.

6. **Deferred Bills**:
   - Several bills, including **HB 1611** and **HB 1655**, were deferred to the next session on March 11, 2024, where the Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be present to provide more context.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee scheduled its next work session and executive session for March 11, 2024, to address unfinished business, including deferred bills and further discussions on SWEPT and child care funding.

### **Overall Themes**
- The meeting underscored the complex interplay between legal, political, and policy considerations in addressing critical issues like education funding, child care, and dam safety.
- There was a recurring emphasis on the need for fiscal accountability, clarity in legislative language, and alignment with existing laws and policies.
- The discussions also highlighted the challenges of balancing state and local responsibilities, particularly in areas like education funding and dam maintenance.
