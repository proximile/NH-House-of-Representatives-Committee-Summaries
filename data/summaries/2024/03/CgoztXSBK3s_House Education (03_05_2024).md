The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 5, 2024, to discuss a range of education-related bills and resolutions.

### **Literacy and Special Education**
**House Bill 1015 (HB 1015)** was a focal point of the meeting, aiming to improve literacy education and intervention strategies in New Hampshire schools. Key aspects of the bill include:
- **Expanded Definition of Literacy**: The bill broadens literacy to include reading, writing, math, listening skills, and communication, emphasizing phonics, grammar, and coherent writing.
- **Intervention Timeline**: It mandates immediate Tier 2 interventions for students six months behind in any competency to prevent delays in special education evaluations.
- **Evidence-Based Practices**: The bill requires scientifically-based literacy programs, addressing concerns about the over-reliance on memorization-based methods like Fountas and Pinnell.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including Professor Emeritus Tom Newkirk, argued that some mandates (e.g., phonics instruction through grade five) lack strong evidence and could impose financial burdens on districts. Supporters, led by Representative Lori Ball, emphasized the need for early interventions to prevent long-term learning gaps and misidentification of disabilities.

### **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) and Anti-Discrimination Policies**
**House Bill 1654 (HB 1654)** and **House Bill 1650 (HB 1650)** addressed anti-discrimination policies for EFA service providers and the **Learn Everywhere Program**:
- **HB 1654**: Introduced by Representative Dave Luno, this bill requires EFA service providers (e.g., private schools, vendors) to adopt anti-discrimination policies consistent with state law (RSA 193:39) and undergo annual reviews by the State Board of Education. Questions arose about its application to religious schools and businesses like bookstores.
- **HB 1650**: This bill mandates that third-party programs under the **Learn Everywhere Program** comply with anti-discrimination laws, ensuring taxpayer-funded programs do not support discriminatory practices. It also requires an ad hoc committee to evaluate program applications and annual reviews for compliance.

### **Learn Everywhere Program**
The **Learn Everywhere Program**, which allows students to earn credits through internships, work experiences, and other hands-on opportunities, was a recurring topic:
- **Concerns**: Critics of **HB 650** argued that requiring external programs to adopt anti-discrimination policies could create bureaucratic hurdles, limiting opportunities for disadvantaged students.
- **Support**: The Commissioner of Education highlighted the program’s success in providing unique learning experiences and aligning with competency-based education. However, concerns were raised about the potential impact of HB 650 on program accessibility.

### **Climate Education**
**House Resolution 30 (HR30)** advocated for robust climate education in New Hampshire schools, emphasizing the need to address gaps in current standards:
- **Purpose**: The resolution aims to update curricula to include human contributions to climate change, historical context, socioeconomic impacts, and mitigation strategies.
- **Student Advocacy**: High school students testified about their climate anxiety and the lack of comprehensive education, stressing the importance of preparing for green jobs and protecting New Hampshire’s environment and economy.
- **Community and Expert Support**: Educators and professionals emphasized the growing demand for climate literacy and the role of education in empowering students to take action. The resolution was amended to involve the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of Education (DOE) in developing resources.
- **Local Control**: HR30 is a recommendation, allowing school districts to decide how to incorporate climate education into their curricula.

### **Mask Mandates in Schools**
**House Bill 1093 (HB 1093)** sought to prohibit mask mandates in schools, sparking heated debate:
- **Opposition to Mandates**: Parents, educators, and students argued that mask mandates harmed children’s development, citing speech delays, mental health issues, and disrupted social interactions. Personal stories highlighted the negative impact on children’s well-being.
- **Parental Rights**: Supporters emphasized the importance of parental choice in deciding whether their children wear masks.
- **Public Health Concerns**: Advocates for mask mandates stressed their role in reducing virus transmission, particularly in protecting vulnerable populations.
- **Local Control**: Opponents of the bill argued that local school boards should retain the authority to implement mask policies based on community needs and public health guidance. The New Hampshire School Board Association (NHSBA) opposed the bill, citing the importance of local decision-making.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Equity in Education**: Discussions highlighted concerns about unfunded mandates and the disproportionate impact on lower-income schools, emphasizing the need for early interventions and equitable support.
2. **Parental Rights and Local Control**: Many bills, including those addressing mask mandates and the Learn Everywhere Program, underscored the importance of parental decision-making and local authority in education policies.
3. **Anti-Discrimination in Education**: Bills like HB 1654 and HB 1650 focused on ensuring that taxpayer-funded programs adhere to anti-discrimination laws, protecting students from discriminatory practices.
4. **Climate Literacy**: HR30 reflected a growing recognition of the need for comprehensive climate education to prepare students for environmental challenges and green careers.
5. **Balancing Public Health and Individual Freedoms**: The debate over mask mandates highlighted the tension between collective safety and individual rights, with strong opinions on both sides.
