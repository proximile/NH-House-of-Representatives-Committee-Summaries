The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on March 5, 2024, to discuss **House Bill 2024**, focusing on the reclassification of **Continental Boulevard** in the town of **Merrimack**. The primary issue was the maintenance responsibility of the road, which was currently classified as a **Class Two State Highway** maintained by the **Department of Transportation (DOT)**. The committee considered reclassifying it as a **Class Five Road**, which would transfer maintenance responsibility to the town of Merrimack.

Key points from the discussion:
1. **Proposed Amendment**: The amendment sought to reclassify Continental Boulevard as a Class Five Road, removing the DOT's maintenance responsibility. The DOT suggested this change to avoid ambiguity in the term "maintenance" and clarify ownership and maintenance obligations.
   
2. **Concerns and Clarifications**: Representatives raised concerns about potential ambiguity in the term "maintenance" and whether reclassification would fully transfer ownership and maintenance to the town. The DOT clarified that reclassifying the road to Class Five would make it clear that the town would own and maintain it.

3. **Historical Context**: The issue had been discussed two years prior, but the previous amendment lacked clarity on reclassification. The current amendment aimed to address this by explicitly reclassifying the road and transferring responsibility.

4. **Financial Implications**: The committee highlighted the financial burden of maintaining the road on the **Turnpike System**, with annual maintenance costs of $60,000 and past paving costs of $1.6 million. Reclassifying the road would alleviate this burden.

5. **Vote**: The committee voted **18-1** in favor of the amendment to reclassify Continental Boulevard as a Class Five Road. Following this, they voted **18-1** to pass House Bill 2024 as amended.

The meeting concluded with the committee thanking members for their collaboration and moving to recess. The bill will now proceed to the full House for further consideration.
