The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on Housing convened on March 15, 2024, to address several critical pieces of legislation aimed at tackling the state's housing crisis. The meeting focused on three main areas: municipal water and sewer capacity, duplex housing development, and accessory dwelling units (ADUs). The discussions highlighted the tension between increasing housing supply and ensuring municipalities have the infrastructure and resources to support new developments.

### Water and Sewer Capacity and Housing Development
The committee debated proposed legislation related to housing development and municipal water and sewer capacity. Key points included:
- **10-Year Delay Mechanism**: Municipalities could use engineering studies to determine if they have the capacity to support new developments. If a study shows insufficient capacity, a 10-year clock starts, during which developments can be denied. After 10 years, developments must be allowed even if capacity issues persist.
- **Concerns Over Clarity and Enforcement**: Some representatives expressed concerns about the ambiguity of the language, particularly regarding whether municipalities could commission new studies to reset the 10-year clock, potentially extending delays to 20 years.
- **Passage of the Amendment**: Despite these concerns, the amendment passed with a 9-1 vote, and the final bill also passed with the same margin. The committee acknowledged the need for further clarity before the bill moves forward.

### Duplex Housing Development (HB 1399)
The committee also discussed HB 1399, which aims to allow duplexes on lots of two acres or less in single-family residential zones, with specific exemptions:
- **Water and Sewer Capacity**: Municipalities with limited capacity can delay duplex developments for 10 years. After this period, developments must be allowed unless state regulations prohibit them. Concerns were raised about the financial burden on municipalities to upgrade infrastructure.
- **Septic Systems and Environmental Concerns**: For properties not connected to municipal systems, septic systems must meet state approval before duplex construction. Amendments were proposed to ensure septic systems are operational before occupancy permits are issued.
- **State vs. Municipal Authority**: The bill allows municipalities to deny developments based on state findings of adverse public health or environmental impacts. However, there were concerns about municipalities potentially delaying developments indefinitely by obtaining new engineering studies every 10 years.
- **Balancing Housing Needs and Infrastructure**: The bill seeks to increase housing density while addressing infrastructure limitations, but concerns about unintended consequences, such as overwhelming water and sewer systems, were raised.

### Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)
The committee also addressed several bills related to ADUs, focusing on increasing housing flexibility:
- **Amendments and Clarifications**: Amendments were proposed for HB 1215 and HB 1291, including extending the term of plot plans and clarifying zoning ordinances for certificates of occupancy. Another amendment adjusted parking requirements for ADUs from one per bedroom to one per unit.
- **Manufactured Housing**: The committee debated allowing ADUs associated with manufactured housing, with Representative Reed advocating for removing restrictions to ensure equitable treatment compared to stick-built homes.
- **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Representative Walsh expressed concerns about state mandates overriding local control, particularly regarding lot sizes and the impact on property values and neighborhood aesthetics.
- **Support for ADUs**: Several representatives highlighted the benefits of ADUs for elderly residents, disabled individuals, and young families, emphasizing their role in providing affordable housing and enabling aging in place.
- **Economic and Social Benefits**: ADUs were seen as a way to increase homeownership opportunities, provide rental income, and address the housing crisis. Public-private partnerships, such as Dover's collaboration with a credit union to finance ADUs, were noted as positive examples.
- **Final Vote**: After extensive discussion, the committee moved to vote on the amendments and the bill, focusing on balancing local control with the need for increased housing flexibility.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the committee's efforts to address New Hampshire's housing crisis through legislative changes. By balancing the need for increased housing supply with concerns about infrastructure capacity and local control, the committee aimed to create a more flexible and equitable housing market. The discussions highlighted the importance of clear legislative language and the need for ongoing collaboration between state and local authorities to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives.
