- **Transparency and Accountability**: In discussions about school safety and domestic relations, representatives stressed the importance of transparency, accountability, and protecting vulnerable populations, particularly children.
- **Practical Implementation**: Throughout the session, representatives highlighted the need for additional training, resources, and careful implementation to avoid unintended consequences, such as increased litigation or privacy violations.
