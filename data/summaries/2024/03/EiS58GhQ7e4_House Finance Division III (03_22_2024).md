**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (03/22/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 22, 2024, focused on detailed discussions, amendments, and votes related to several bills, with a strong emphasis on child welfare, fiscal responsibility, and policy implementation. The meeting was divided into multiple segments, each addressing specific legislative priorities.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

#### **1. House Bill (HB) 1598 and HB 1669:**
   - **HB 1598 Amendments**: The committee debated an amendment to HB 1598, which involves hiring a consultant to manage Social Security payments for foster children and preparing a report by December 31, 2024. After discussions on the consultant’s cost, the committee approved the amendment with a $150,000 cap (7-2 vote). The amendment also included language to ensure the consultant would assist with implementation beyond the report phase.
   - **HB 1669 Amendments**: The committee reviewed an amendment to HB 1669, which authorizes a new position and allocates funds to anonymize data in the immunization information system. The amendment, which aligns with state laws and ensures compliance with rulemaking processes, passed unanimously.

#### **2. Budget and Appropriation Discussions:**
   - The committee extensively discussed budget appropriations, lapses, and the financial implications of new mandates. Members debated whether to allocate specific funds for new tasks or allow departments to manage costs within existing budgets. The consensus was to provide clear funding for new mandates to ensure transparency and accountability.

#### **3. House Bill 1573 and Amendments 1290 and 1291:**
   - **Amendment 1290**: This detailed amendment outlines specific policies and procedures for child welfare, emphasizing accountability, compliance, and the protection of children, particularly in out-of-state placements. It includes provisions for unannounced visits, safe meeting spaces, and restrictions on placing children outside New England without DHHS director approval. The amendment was supported by DHHS and the Office of Child Advocate.
   - **Amendment 1291**: A streamlined version of Amendment 1290, this amendment focuses on appropriating $1 million to DHHS for child welfare improvements. It avoids embedding detailed policy in statute, leaving implementation to departmental rules. While some argued it lacked specificity, others saw it as more fiscally responsible.
   - **Outcome**: The committee adopted **Amendment 1291** with additional language requiring DHHS director approval for out-of-state placements. This compromise was seen as a pragmatic step forward, though some members expressed concerns about its adequacy.

#### **4. House Bill 1595:**
   - The committee discussed **HB 1595**, which deals with child support calculations and parenting time. Representative Priest raised concerns about domestic abuse not being adequately addressed in the amendment, while Representative Tersi argued the bill could disadvantage lower-income parents. A motion for an interim study failed (3-6), and the bill passed with an amended recommendation (5-4).

#### **5. House Bill 1363:**
   - The division considered an amendment to **HB 1363**, which involves an employee assistance program for state employees. The amendment clarified that legislators and their household members could participate while explicitly stating that legislators are not employees. The amendment was accepted (6-3), but the underlying bill failed to pass (4-5). A subsequent motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill passed (5-4).

#### **6. House Bill 1588:**
   - **HB 1588**, which extends court jurisdiction over individuals receiving special education services, was discussed. The fiscal note indicated a potential cost range of $2 million to $6 million annually. Representative Edwards proposed a $3 million supplemental appropriation to address the expanded eligibility, and the division agreed to move forward with the bill, pending the drafting of the appropriation amendment.

#### **7. Other Bills:**
   - The committee briefly touched on **HB 1564**, **HB 1282**, and **HB 1593**, which had been previously locked down with recommendations. Discussions also highlighted the need for better fiscal data and the challenges of addressing complex policy issues within tight deadlines.

### Procedural and Voting Highlights:
   - **Amendment 1291**: A show of hands resulted in a vote of 54 in favor of the modified amendment.
   - **Amendment 1290**: A motion to pass the amendment resulted in a 4-5 vote.
   - **Bill 1573**: The bill passed with the modified Amendment 1291 by a vote of 5-4.
   - **Executive Session**: The committee prepared for an upcoming Finance executive session on March 26th, where **Bill 1573** would be further discussed.

### Closing Remarks:
   - The chair acknowledged the progress made and the agreements reached during the session. The meeting concluded with final words from the committee and was adjourned.

### Overall Themes:
   - **Child Welfare**: A significant focus was placed on improving child welfare policies, particularly regarding out-of-state placements, foster care, and child support calculations.
   - **Fiscal Responsibility**: The committee emphasized the need for clear funding for new mandates, fiscal accountability, and cost-effective solutions.
   - **Policy vs. Statute**: There was ongoing debate about whether detailed policies should be codified in law or left to departmental rules, with compromises reached to advance legislation.
   - **Next Steps**: Several bills and amendments will be revisited in upcoming executive sessions and through companion Senate legislation, providing further opportunities for refinement.

This meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance fiscal responsibility with policy considerations, particularly in areas affecting vulnerable populations like children and individuals with special needs.
