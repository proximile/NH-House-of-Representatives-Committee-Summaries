The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 22, 2024, featured in-depth discussions and decisions on several key bills, with a focus on child welfare, fiscal responsibility, and legislative oversight. Below is a cohesive summary of the session:

### Key Bills and Discussions:
1. **House Bill 1595**:
   - This contentious bill addressed child support calculations and parenting time. Representative Priest raised concerns that the bill inadequately addressed domestic abuse issues. After debate, a motion to send the bill for interim study failed (3-6), and a motion to pass the amended bill also failed (4-5). Ultimately, the bill was recommended for further study (ITL motion passed 5-4).

2. **House Bill 1363**:
   - This bill proposed an employee assistance program for legislators. An amendment clarified that legislators are not employees and delayed the effective date to 2027. The amendment passed (6-3), but the amended bill failed (4-5). An ITL motion passed (5-4), recommending further study.

3. **House Bill 1588**:
   - The discussion centered on court jurisdiction over individuals receiving special education. The committee noted a lack of updated fiscal numbers and sought clarification from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). A supplemental appropriation of $3 million was proposed to fund the program, with the understanding that DHHS was already implementing it within its existing budget. The motion to adopt the bill with the amendment passed 7-2.

4. **House Bill 1669**:
   - This bill focused on authorizing a new position and allocating funds for data anonymization related to the New Hampshire Immunization Information System. The amendment passed with unanimous support (9-0), emphasizing the efficiency of the allocation and the scope of duties for the new position.

5. **House Bill 1598**:
   - An amendment proposed hiring a consultant to assist with the management and implementation of Social Security payments, with a report due by December 31, 2024. Concerns were raised about the $200,000 cost, with suggestions to reduce it to $100,000 and ensure the consultant had expertise in other states’ practices. The discussion highlighted the need for informed decision-making and fiscal responsibility.

6. **House Bill 1573**:
   - This bill addressed issues related to foster children receiving Social Security benefits and the oversight of residential treatment programs. Key points included:
     - **Consultant Hiring and Funding**: The committee debated the necessity and funding for a consultant, ultimately agreeing to allocate $150,000.
     - **Policy vs. Statute**: There was significant debate about whether certain provisions should be codified into law or left to departmental policy.
     - **Fiscal Responsibility**: The committee discussed the fiscal impact and considered adjusting the lapse amount in the budget to accommodate new expenses.
     - **Amendment Proposals**: Two main amendments were proposed:
       - **Amendment 1290**: A comprehensive amendment addressing various aspects of the bill, including the frequency of visits to residential facilities and recertification requirements.
       - **Amendment 1291**: A more streamlined amendment focusing on appropriating $1 million to support the department’s efforts without detailed policy provisions.
     - **Final Decision**: The committee voted to approve Amendment 1286, as verbally modified, with a final tally of 7-2.

### Out-of-State Placements and Amendments:
- **Amendments 1290 and 1291**: Representatives debated these amendments to House Bill 1573, with concerns raised about the fiscal responsibility and lack of specific policy guidance in Amendment 1291. Amendment 1290 was seen as more detailed and collaborative between DHHS and the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA).
- **Leadership and Continuity**: Testimony from DHHS Director Jeff Fler emphasized the importance of statutory guidelines to ensure continuity of care and oversight during leadership transitions.
- **Implementation of Policies**: Discussions highlighted concerns about the lack of documented evidence of practices being implemented by DHHS.
- **Votes on Amendments**: Amendment 1291 passed with modifications, and Amendment 1290 also passed. The underlying bill, HB 1573, was advanced with the modified Amendment 1291.
- **Interim Study Consideration**: Some representatives suggested an interim study to further refine the legislation, though the motion was not pursued at this time.

### Conclusion:
The session underscored the committee’s commitment to balancing detailed policy provisions with fiscal responsibility, ensuring that departments have the resources needed to protect vulnerable populations. Decisions to recommend further study on several bills reflected the complexity and unresolved issues surrounding child welfare and legislative oversight. The meeting concluded with a recognition of progress made and an acknowledgment that further work would be necessary to refine and effectively implement the proposed legislation.
