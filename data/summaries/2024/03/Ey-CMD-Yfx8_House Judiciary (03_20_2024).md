The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 20, 2024, addressed several significant bills aimed at improving access to justice, modernizing trust law, protecting sports officials, and addressing challenges in competency evaluations. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Access to Justice and Legal Services**
- **Senate Bill 361**: The focus was on extending and expanding a pilot program that allows paraprofessionals (non-lawyer legal professionals) to assist self-represented litigants in civil cases such as domestic violence, family law, and housing disputes. The program, which began in January 2023, has been successful in providing essential legal assistance to low-income individuals who cannot afford attorneys. The bill proposes extending the program’s sunset date to 2030 and expanding it statewide. The program operates under attorney supervision, ensuring accountability and adherence to ethical standards. Stakeholders, including New Hampshire Legal Assistance and the Paralegal Association of New Hampshire, strongly supported the bill, highlighting its importance in addressing the access-to-justice gap. The committee unanimously approved the bill, recognizing its potential to serve as a model for other states.

### **Modernizing Trust Law**
- **Senate Bill 435**: This bill addresses the establishment and conversion of unitrusts, which distribute a fixed percentage (3-5%) of the trust's value annually to beneficiaries. The bill allows for the conversion of traditional trusts to unitrusts, provided that qualified beneficiaries are notified and do not object within 60 days. The 3-5% distribution aligns with IRS guidelines, ensuring compliance with the unlimited marital deduction. The bill provides flexibility for grantors and trustees, allowing them to distribute assets in cash or in kind. The trust industry in New Hampshire has grown significantly, with $1.3 trillion in trust assets, and the bill aims to make the state more competitive in attracting out-of-state trust business. The state benefits through business profits taxes paid by trust companies.

### **Protecting Sports Officials**
- **Senate Bill 327**: This bill seeks to protect sports officials from assault and harassment during athletic events. It introduces penalties, including banning offenders from attending sports events for up to a year or even a lifetime for repeat violations. The bill addresses the increasing issue of assaults and harassment against sports officials, which has led to a shortage of officials across various sports. Concerns were raised about enforcement and the potential impact on single parents who might be banned from attending their children’s games. Advocates argued that the bill is necessary to protect officials and deter abusive behavior.

### **Competency Evaluations in the Legal System**
- **Senate Bill 314**: This bill addresses challenges faced by the Department of Corrections in conducting competency hearings. It aims to incentivize attendance at competency evaluations, reduce no-show rates, and provide a mechanism for dismissing charges in cases deemed non-restorable. The bill extends the time frame for evaluations if individuals fail to appear or if records are not provided and emphasizes the importance of medical, mental health, and educational records in conducting valid evaluations. Concerns were raised about privacy and the potential for defense attorneys to withhold records, but the bill aims to ensure that necessary records are accessible to forensic examiners.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Collaboration and Stakeholder Support**: Many of the bills discussed were developed with input from various stakeholders, including legal professionals, trust industry experts, and sports officials. This collaborative approach was evident in the support and testimony provided during the discussions.
- **Addressing Systemic Challenges**: The bills aimed to address significant systemic issues, such as the access-to-justice gap, the need for modern trust laws, the protection of sports officials, and the challenges in competency evaluations.
- **Balancing Effectiveness and Ethical Considerations**: The discussions highlighted the importance of balancing the effectiveness of proposed solutions with ethical considerations, such as privacy, fairness, and the potential impact on individuals and families.

Overall, the meeting focused on refining and advancing these bills to address pressing issues in New Hampshire’s legal, trust, and sports communities, with a strong emphasis on collaboration, systemic improvement, and ethical considerations.
