**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (March 6, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on March 6, 2024, to discuss a range of bills and amendments, with a focus on digital assets, financial regulations, beverage manufacturing, and healthcare-related legislation. The meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing innovation, consumer protection, and regulatory oversight. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Digital Assets and Cryptocurrency**
1. **Self-Custody of Digital Assets**:
   - A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to a bill aimed at recognizing and protecting individuals’ rights to **self-custody digital assets** (e.g., cryptocurrencies). The bill seeks to ensure that the state does not interfere with ownership rights, allowing individuals to use self-hosted or hardware wallets.
   - The bill was described as **prophylactic**, addressing potential future issues rather than existing problems. While no current instances of individuals being denied custody of digital assets were reported, the bill was seen as a preemptive measure.
   - Concerns were raised about potential impacts on banks, prompting suggestions for the **Chief Bank Examiner** to review the bill to ensure it does not compromise banking safety or operations.
   - Due to **time constraints** and the need for further analysis, the committee voted to **interim study** the bill, delaying further action until more review and public input could be conducted.

2. **Proprietary Cryptocurrency and Financial Sandbox**:
   - The committee discussed the regulation of proprietary cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the need to protect consumers from inflated valuations and potential risks.
   - The concept of a **financial sandbox**, which allows for the testing of innovative financial products in a controlled environment, was debated. Concerns were raised about the practicality and success of such programs in other states, as well as the potential need for additional resources to implement them in New Hampshire.
   - A proposal for **state-chartered non-lending payment banks**, inspired by similar legislation in Connecticut, was also considered. The discussion centered on the potential for these banks to obtain master accounts with the Federal Reserve and the implications for state sovereignty.

### **Beverage Manufacturing**
- The committee discussed an amendment to a bill that originally applied only to **wine manufacturers** but was expanded to include **beverage manufacturers**. The amendment, which allows beverage manufacturers to have on-premise licenses, was passed unanimously after minimal discussion.

### **Healthcare and Biological Products**
1. **HB 1365 - Interchangeable Biological Products**:
   - The committee revisited **HB 1365**, which concerns the substitution of interchangeable biological products by pharmacists. The subcommittee had initially recommended an interim study but reconsidered due to requests for further discussion.
   - The bill aims to allow pharmacists to substitute interchangeable biological products, provided there is **no increased cost to the patient**, and both the patient and prescriber are informed.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential for increased costs and the need for **active communication** with prescribers before substitution, particularly in complex medical cases like oncology treatments.
   - Amendments were proposed to clarify that pharmacists must inform both the patient and prescriber before making substitutions and that patients retain the right to refuse substitutions.
   - The committee also debated whether to wait for **FDA guidance** on biosimilars, which could impact the bill’s implementation.

2. **Other Healthcare-Related Bills**:
   - **HB 1018**: A minor amendment was proposed to correct a typo in a bill related to secondhand smoke exposure.
   - **HB 1076**: An amendment was discussed to ensure consistency in licensing for beverage manufacturers.

### **General Discussion and Outcomes**
- The committee emphasized the importance of **consumer protection**, **innovation**, and **regulatory clarity** across all topics. There was a strong focus on ensuring that new legislation does not inadvertently harm consumers or create unnecessary burdens for businesses.
- Several bills, including those related to digital assets and biological products, were deemed to require further study or refinement before passage. The committee voted to **interim study** some bills and passed others with amendments.
- The discussions reflected a cautious yet forward-looking approach, with members advocating for proactive measures while ensuring alignment with state and federal regulations.

2. **Consumer Protection**: Across all discussions, the committee prioritized safeguarding consumers from risks such as inflated cryptocurrency valuations or adverse healthcare outcomes.
3. **Regulatory Balance**: The committee sought to balance innovation with practical considerations, such as the need for additional resources or the potential impact on existing industries.
4. **Interim Studies**: Several complex issues were deferred for further analysis, highlighting the need for thorough review and stakeholder input before enacting legislation.
