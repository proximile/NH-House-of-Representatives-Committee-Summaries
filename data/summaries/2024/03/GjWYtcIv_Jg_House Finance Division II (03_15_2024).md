**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (March 15, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II convened on March 15, 2024, to discuss several key bills related to education funding, school meals, and special education. The meeting involved extensive debate on fiscal implications, policy intent, and potential amendments to ensure equitable and adequate funding for students across the state. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 1212: Expanding School Meal Eligibility**
- **Objective**: Inspired by a previous bill (HB 572) and championed by Art Ellison, who is in hospice, HB 1212 aims to expand school meal eligibility to 350% of the federal poverty level.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal note estimates an incremental cost of $50 million, which is in addition to current expenses.
- **Concerns and Support**: Some members raised concerns about potential waste in school meal programs, while supporters emphasized the importance of ensuring children have access to meals for effective learning.

### **House Bill 1570: Inventory of School Buildings**
- **Objective**: This bill involves an inventory of school buildings and proposes an amendment to allow the Department of Education to request funds for this purpose.
- **Key Discussion**: Concerns were raised about the lapsing of funds and the need for non-lapsing provisions to carry forward unused funds for future projects.

### **House Bill 1583: Education Funding Adequacy and Special Education Funding**
- **Education Funding Adequacy**:
  - **Proposal**: The bill proposes to raise the base adequacy to $7,356.01 per pupil, as suggested by a court ruling.
  - **Excess SWEPT Funds**: The amendment includes provisions for handling excess state-wide education property tax (SWEPT) funds, requiring towns to remit excess funds to the state.
  - **Penalties**: Discussions included penalties for towns that fail to comply, such as withholding state education aid and rooms and meals tax distributions.

- **Special Education Funding**:
  - **Weighted Funding Formula**: The bill proposes a weighted funding formula for special education students, categorizing them into three tiers (A, B, and C) based on the level of support required.
  - **Data Collection Deadline**: Concerns were raised about the October 1st data collection deadline, which could exclude approximately 4,631 students who enter the system after that date.
  - **Amendment Proposal**: An amendment was proposed to ensure all students receive at least Category A funding, even if they are identified later in the school year, increasing the cost by $17.7 million annually.
  - **Cost Implications**: Without the amendment, the bill would cost $11 million more than current law but would leave some students without funding. There was also discussion about the proportional cost increase and the transient student population.
  - **Implementation**: The bill is intended to take effect on July 1, 2024, with debate about whether it should apply to the current budget or the next biennial cycle.
  - **Policy Intent**: The bill aims to address inequities in special education funding, particularly for districts that become "magnet schools" for high-needs students.
  - **Constitutional Concerns**: There was a warning that if the bill does not ensure all students receive special education aid, it could be challenged as unconstitutional under the state's definition of educational adequacy.
  - **Future Considerations**: The committee acknowledged the complexity of the education funding formula and suggested that further adjustments may be needed in future budget cycles. They also highlighted the need for a public hearing on the amendment to ensure transparency and stakeholder input.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee's commitment to addressing critical issues in education funding and school meal programs. The discussions underscored the importance of equitable funding, the need for timely data collection, and the financial implications of proposed changes. The committee agreed to draft amendments to refine the bills and schedule public hearings to gather further input from stakeholders. The focus remains on ensuring all students, particularly those with special needs, receive adequate support to succeed in their educational endeavors.
