**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (March 25, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on March 25, 2024, to discuss several key energy-related bills and policies. The meeting focused on expediting energy facility siting, advancing energy storage, refining renewable energy programs, and addressing interconnection rules. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Senate Bill 451: Expedited Siting for Energy Facilities**
- **Purpose**: SB 451 proposes to streamline the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) process for repowering, retrofitting, or repurposing existing energy facilities, particularly those predating modern environmental laws. The bill aims to facilitate New Hampshire’s energy transition by attracting investment and leveraging federal funding opportunities like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
- **Key Concerns**:
  - **Definition of "Repowering"**: Ambiguity around the term led to suggestions for clearer language, such as "restarting" or "resuming operation."
  - **Public Interest and Environmental Review**: Concerns were raised about ensuring older facilities undergo adequate environmental scrutiny and maintaining public transparency.
  - **Expedited Timelines**: The bill proposes shortening SEC decision timelines, but some committee members questioned whether this would undermine thorough public engagement and environmental review.
  - **Municipal Involvement**: The removal of municipalities' ability to request separate public hearings was debated, with calls to ensure local communities impacted by projects have adequate participation opportunities.
- **Support and Opposition**:
  - Supporters, including Granite Shore Power, argued the bill is essential for accelerating clean energy projects and leveraging existing infrastructure.
  - The Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) opposed the bill, fearing it could allow fossil fuel plants to repower without sufficient environmental oversight. The CLF advocated for limiting the expedited process to clean energy technologies.

#### **2. Senate Bill 540: Energy Storage Investigation**
- **Purpose**: SB 540 requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to investigate ways to facilitate both behind-the-meter (residential) and utility-scale energy storage.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Dual-Track Investigation**: The investigation is divided into two parts, with reports due by December 30, 2025 (residential) and December 30, 2026 (utility-scale).
  - **Amendments**: The bill was amended to include considerations for accurate price signals and encouraging utility and non-utility investments in storage projects.
  - **Clarification Needed**: Questions arose about why the bill extends an existing report due in August 2024, with the DOE assuring the investigation would provide actionable outcomes for future legislation.

#### **3. Senate Bill 303: Renewable Energy Fund Reallocation**
- **Purpose**: SB 303 reallocates funds from the renewable energy fund to support battery storage projects and municipal solar programs. It also adjusts reporting deadlines and repeals outdated solar incentive programs.
- **Key Concerns**:
  - **Equitable Funding**: Debates centered on prioritizing funding for low-to-moderate-income communities and defining "low income" for grant allocation.
  - **Program Elimination**: Concerns were raised about eliminating existing programs without clear replacements.
  - **Battery Storage**: Discussions highlighted the infancy of battery storage technology and its potential role in grid reliability and renewable energy integration.

---

#### **4. Senate Bill 391: Interconnection Rules**
- **Purpose**: SB 391 addresses interconnection rules for energy systems, focusing on delays in rulemaking and whether the DOE or the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) should handle these rules.
- **Key Points**:
  - **DOE Authority**: The DOE argued it has statutory authority to develop interconnection rules but lacks enforcement power to resolve stakeholder disputes.
  - **PUC Role**: Some committee members suggested the PUC, as the regulator of utilities, should take on the rulemaking process.
  - **Working Groups**: The DOE previously recommended forming working groups to resolve contentious issues, but the introduction of SB 391 delayed this process. The committee discussed forming a legislative working group to address unresolved issues.
  - **Deadlines**: Concerns were raised about imposing deadlines, as the DOE cannot force stakeholder agreement. The committee planned to await updates from a stakeholder meeting before determining next steps.

---

#### **5. Senate Bill 388: Technical Cleanup for Solar Projects**
- **Purpose**: SB 388 is a technical cleanup bill requested by the DOE to address issues like renter eligibility, exemption procedures, and project readiness for solar projects.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Amendment Proposed**: An amendment was proposed to ensure projects are viable before receiving funding.
  - **Equitable Distribution**: Discussions emphasized the importance of defining "low-to-moderate-income" households and ensuring equitable resource distribution.

---

### **Themes and Broader Context**
- **Balancing Efficiency and Public Input**: Several bills highlighted the tension between expediting processes to attract investment and ensuring robust public engagement and environmental review.
- **Clarity in Legislation**: Ambiguity in terms like "repowering" and "low-to-moderate-income" underscored the need for precise legislative language to avoid future regulatory challenges.
- **Energy Transition**: Discussions emphasized the importance of renewable energy, energy storage, and grid reliability in New Hampshire’s energy transition, particularly in light of federal funding opportunities like the IRA.
- **Future Legislation**: Investigations and reports from bills like SB 540 are expected to inform future legislative actions to improve New Hampshire’s energy infrastructure and policy.

### **Next Steps**
The committee committed to refining bill language during upcoming work sessions, with a focus on addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring equitable and sustainable energy policies. Key deadlines include May 16th for finalizing Senate bills, with potential meetings resuming the week of April 8th. The committee also planned to await updates from stakeholder meetings, particularly on SB 391, to determine the need for formal working groups.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to advancing New Hampshire’s energy goals while balancing efficiency, public input, and environmental stewardship.
