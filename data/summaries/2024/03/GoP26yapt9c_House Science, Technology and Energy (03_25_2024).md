The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on March 25, 2024, to discuss several key legislative proposals aimed at modernizing the state’s energy infrastructure, improving renewable energy adoption, and addressing energy storage needs. The meeting focused on four main bills, with discussions highlighting concerns about public transparency, environmental impacts, and the need for clarity in legislative language.

### Key Legislative Discussions:

1. **Senate Bill 451 (SB 451)**:  
   - **Objective**: Streamline the process for repowering, retrofitting, or repurposing existing energy facilities under the Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) jurisdiction.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The bill proposes reducing SEC review timelines from 365 to 180 days to expedite projects and attract federal funding under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).  
     - Concerns were raised about the expedited process potentially limiting public input and transparency.  
     - The definition of "public interest" and the scope of "repowering" were debated, with stakeholders like the Conservation Law Foundation warning against repowering fossil fuel plants with other fossil fuels.  
     - Supporters, including Granite Shore Power, emphasized the need for efficiency to attract investment and complete clean energy projects.  
     - Discussions also touched on ensuring adequate environmental reviews for older facilities built before current regulations.  

2. **Senate Bill 540 (SB 540)**:  
   - **Objective**: Require the Department of Energy (DOE) to investigate behind-the-meter and utility-scale energy storage solutions.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The investigation is divided into two phases, with reports due in December 2025 and December 2026.  
     - Amendments were proposed to include public policy considerations for accurate price signals and investment incentives.  
     - Questions were raised about whether the bill merely extends existing reporting requirements and what actionable outcomes it would produce.  

3. **Senate Bill 303**:  
   - **Objective**: Reform the Renewable Energy Fund (REF) to better address current market needs, particularly for low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities and municipal projects.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of existing solar incentive programs, with suggestions that some programs are outdated.  
     - The committee debated how to define "low income" and ensure funding reaches the most financially needy communities.  

4. **Senate Bill 391**:  
   - **Objective**: Address energy storage systems and interconnection rules.  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - The committee clarified that solar incentive programs are available to renters, not just homeowners.  
     - Questions were raised about defining thresholds for LMI households and ensuring statutory consistency.  
     - The DOE proposed amendments to RSA 362 F related to useful thermal energy, adding language for rulemaking and enforcement.  
     - Concerns were raised about whether the DOE or the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) should handle rulemaking, given the technical nature of the rules.  
     - The possibility of forming a working group to resolve contentious issues and expedite the rulemaking process was discussed.  

### Broader Themes and Discussions:  
- **Energy Transition**: The bills collectively support New Hampshire’s transition to cleaner energy sources, including offshore wind, hydrogen, and battery storage.  
- **Public Transparency and Environmental Concerns**: Throughout the discussions, committee members emphasized the need for public transparency, adequate environmental reviews, and safeguards to ensure public participation.  
- **Investment and Efficiency**: Stakeholders highlighted the importance of efficient processes to attract investment and complete clean energy projects.  
- **Technical and Regulatory Challenges**: The complexity of technical rules and the role of the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) in evaluating them were acknowledged.  

### Next Steps:  
The committee plans to reconvene in early April to refine the bills and address concerns raised during the session. A working group may be formed to resolve contentious issues, particularly for SB 391. Feedback from stakeholders and ISO New England will inform further discussions and amendments.  

Overall, the meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to balancing efficiency, environmental protection, and public transparency in advancing New Hampshire’s energy goals.
