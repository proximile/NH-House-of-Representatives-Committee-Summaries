The **NH House of Representatives Finance Division II** meeting on **March 5, 2024**, addressed a wide range of legislative issues, focusing on housing, education funding, due process rights, and regulatory compliance. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing efficiency, fairness, and fiscal responsibility in policymaking. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates from the meeting:

---

### **Housing and Infrastructure**
1. **Driveway Permits and Residential Development (HB 1202)**:
   - The bipartisan Special Committee on Housing proposed a bill to impose a **30-day timeline** for the Department of Transportation to approve or deny driveway permits for residential developments. 
   - While the bill aims to streamline housing development, concerns were raised about the potential for denials due to tight timelines and the need to balance efficiency with safety, particularly in high-traffic areas.
   - The fiscal note initially suggested the need for four additional personnel, but questions were raised about workload justification. An amendment was proposed to correct a technical error in the bill.

2. **Driveway Location and Safety**:
   - Earlier discussions emphasized the role of district engineers and field staff in determining the safest locations for driveways based on site distance and field reports. This highlighted the importance of safety in infrastructure planning.

3. **Highway Fund Surplus**:
   - A mild winter left surplus funds in the highway budget, which were discussed as a potential source to cover costs for HB 1202 until the next budget cycle.

### **Education Funding**
1. **SWEPT and Base Adequacy Aid (HB 1583)**:
   - The bill seeks to increase **base adequacy aid** to $7,351 per student, as per a court order, and recharacterize local education taxes as **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)**. 
   - Concerns were raised about the redistribution of excess SWEPT funds, particularly in communities like Manchester, which does not retain its SWEPT funds. 
   - The fiscal impact of these changes, including potential property tax increases in some communities, was a major point of debate. Some members suggested removing SWEPT-related provisions to focus on other aspects of the bill.

2. **Special Education Funding (HB 1656)**:
   - The bill proposes a **weighted funding formula** for special education, categorizing students based on their needs (e.g., traumatic brain injury, developmental delays) and adjusting funding based on the percentage of time spent in special education.
   - The current special education funding of $66 million would increase to $101 million, adding $34.3 million. However, a **two-year lag** in data collection from the Special Education Bureau could delay implementation.
   - Members emphasized the need for bipartisan collaboration and stakeholder involvement to refine the bill.

3. **Statewide Facility Assessments**:
   - A separate discussion highlighted the need for **statewide facility assessments** for schools, with a potential fiscal impact of $5 million. The Department of Education lacks funding for this, and members discussed seeking fiscal committee approval.

### **Due Process Rights**
1. **Student Discipline and Due Process**:
   - A bill aimed at protecting the due process rights of students, faculty, and student organizations facing adverse actions was discussed. The bill seeks to ensure fair treatment during disciplinary proceedings, including the right to cross-examination and interim suspensions.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential **administrative burden** on universities and the cost of defending against lawsuits. The fiscal note for the bill was a point of contention, with some questioning the necessity and cost of implementation.

2. **EMS Disciplinary Review Panel**:
   - Representative Mark Pearson introduced a bill to update the disciplinary process for EMS personnel, moving from a single decision-maker to a **three-member panel**. The bill also includes provisions for timely updates on disciplinary cases and the removal of names from public disciplinary lists after seven years.

### **Regulatory Compliance and Fiscal Impact**
1. **Certificate of Title Exemptions (HB 1032)**:
   - The bill exempts vehicles over **20 years old** from requiring a certificate of title. It passed unanimously with a fiscal impact of $24,000, drawn from the current budget.

2. **Boat Decals and Fees (HB 1304)**:
   - The bill addresses federal compliance issues related to boat registration fees and introduces a **second decal system** to separate state fees from federal requirements. 
   - The fiscal impact is $48,000 for initial inventory, with costs recouped through fees. An amendment clarified the Department of Safetyâ€™s authority to charge replacement decal fees.

---

### **Key Themes**
- **Federal Compliance**: Several bills, including HB 1304, addressed federal requirements, ensuring alignment with regulations such as those from the Coast Guard.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Fiscal notes were a recurring focus, with discussions on funding sources, justification for additional personnel, and the potential financial burden on local communities.
- **Streamlining Processes**: Bills like HB 1202 aimed to expedite permitting processes to support housing development, though concerns about unintended consequences were raised.
- **Bipartisan Cooperation**: Many bills, including those on housing and education funding, were products of bipartisan efforts, reflecting shared priorities across party lines.
