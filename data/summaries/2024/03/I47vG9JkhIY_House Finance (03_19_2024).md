The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on March 19, 2024, to discuss and vote on a series of bills addressing a wide range of issues. The session featured debates on fiscal responsibility, state funding allocations, and the merits of various legislative proposals. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Decisions**

#### **Education and Youth Services**
1. **Farm-to-School Programs (House Bill 1678)**  
   - A bill supporting farm-to-school programs was debated, with proponents highlighting its benefits for farmers, schools, and students. Critics raised concerns about state funding being directed toward personnel and benefits rather than direct program use. The bill initially failed with a vote of 12-13, and a subsequent motion to deem it "inexpedient to legislate" passed 13-12. However, later in the session, the committee revisited the bill as a pilot program and voted 13-12 to recommend it as "ought to pass."

2. **Child Advocate Services for Homeless Youth (House Bill 1199)**  
   - This bill sought to expand the Office of the Child Advocate’s services to homeless youth up to age 25 using ARPA funds. Concerns were raised about creating a new state employee position and long-term funding sustainability. The committee voted 13-12 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

#### **Judicial and Legal Reforms**
3. **Due Process Rights in Higher Education (House Bill 1288)**  
   - This bill aimed to establish due process rights for students, faculty, and organizations facing disciplinary actions in state higher education institutions. Supporters emphasized the importance of fair hearings, while opponents argued it was unnecessary and could conflict with federal laws. The bill passed narrowly with a vote of 13-12.

4. **Judicial Training (House Bill 1005)**  
   - The bill proposed establishing a judicial training coordinator and regular training for judges and judiciary staff. An amendment included bail commissioners in the training and adjusted the effective date to 60 days. The bill was held for further review to align it with other bail reform bills.

#### **Emergency Services and Public Safety**
5. **Emergency Medical Services Disciplinary Review (House Bill 1330)**

9. **State Payment for Municipal Retirement Contributions (House Bill 1279)**  
   - The bill proposed the state cover part of municipal and county employees' retirement costs. Concerns were raised about fiscal responsibility and the state’s inability to control municipal hiring and pay raises. The committee voted 16-9 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."
