The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee held a hearing on **Amendment 92h**, a "replace all" amendment to **House Bill 1521**, which proposes changes to the definition of **recovery houses** and clarifies how they should be treated under zoning ordinances. The amendment aims to address ambiguities in the law and streamline the permitting process for recovery residences, which provide supportive housing for individuals recovering from substance use disorder.

### Key Points from the Hearing:
1. **Purpose of the Amendment**:
   - The amendment seeks to align the statutory definition of recovery houses with existing fire and building codes.
   - It clarifies that recovery houses should be treated as residential uses, not as separate or distinct entities, for zoning purposes.
   - It removes subjective language like "safe and healthy family-like" and replaces it with more objective terms like "non-transient dwelling."

2. **Support from Stakeholders**:
   - **Ben Frost**, Deputy Executive Director of New Hampshire Housing, expressed strong support, noting that recovery houses face significant challenges due to legal ambiguities and local hostility. He emphasized the need for clarity to facilitate the establishment of these residences.
   - **Sean Canazzaro**, owner of recovery houses in Claremont, shared his personal experience, highlighting the lengthy and complex zoning process that delayed the opening of his facilities, potentially costing lives due to the lack of available recovery housing.
   - **Cheryl Andrews**, Executive Director of Dismas Home in Manchester, discussed the difficulties faced during zoning board meetings, including opposition from neighbors, and stressed the importance of this amendment in providing clear guidance to municipalities.

3. **Impact on Communities**:
   - Recovery houses provide a supportive, family-like environment for individuals in early recovery, helping them transition back into society by teaching life skills and offering peer support.
   - The amendment would reduce barriers to establishing recovery houses, ensuring that individuals have access to stable housing, which is critical for long-term recovery.

4. **Challenges and Opposition**:
   - Misconceptions about recovery houses (e.g., confusion with rehab centers or boarding houses) have led to resistance from communities and lengthy zoning battles.
   - Neighbors often express concerns about the presence of recovery houses in their neighborhoods, despite evidence that these facilities contribute positively to the community.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The amendment is supported by various organizations, including **New Hampshire Housing**, the **New Hampshire Coalition of Recovery Residences (NH CORR)**, and **New Futures**, a health policy advocacy group.
   - The committee will consider the testimony and decide whether to move forward with the amendment.

### Conclusion:
The amendment aims to simplify the process of establishing recovery houses, reduce stigma, and provide clear guidance to municipalities, ultimately increasing access to this vital resource for individuals recovering from substance use disorder.
