### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee (March 13, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on March 13, 2024, to discuss and vote on several bills related to environmental management, resource protection, and recreational activities on public bodies of water. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. House Bill 1554 (Aquatic Vegetation Management)**  
This bill focused on the management of native and invasive aquatic vegetation in New Hampshire’s lakes. Key points included:  
- **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to explicitly grant the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** authority to regulate the cutting of native aquatic vegetation, addressing uncertainty in existing statutes.  
- **Testimony**: Residents and conservationists highlighted the ecological importance of native vegetation in maintaining water clarity and preventing cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) blooms. A case study from **Little Island Pond** illustrated the negative effects of unregulated vegetation cutting.  
- **Outcome**: The amended bill passed unanimously, with strong support for providing DES the tools needed to protect lake ecosystems.

#### **2. House Bill 1113 (Septic System Regulations)**  
This bill addressed septic system regulations for waterfront properties. Key points included:  
- **Amendment**: An amendment extended the time for septic system repairs from 6 months to 1 year, aligning with Massachusetts’ Title 5 regulations. It also addressed issues related to property transactions and septic system evaluations.  
- **Outcome**: The amended bill passed unanimously, with discussions about potential future adjustments.

#### **3. House Bill 721 (Wetland Permit Exemptions)**  
This bill dealt with wetland permit exemptions following natural disasters or flooding. Key points included:  
- **Amendment**: An amendment clarified the removal of woody debris from watercourses and channels, ensuring no new permanent impacts.  
- **Concerns**: Some committee members questioned the necessity of the bill, given ongoing rule-making processes.  
- **Outcome**: The amended bill passed unanimously.

#### **4. House Bill 1513 (Pease Development Authority Board)**  
This bill proposed changes to the board of directors of the **Pease Development Authority (PDA)**, shifting appointment authority from local communities to the governor. Key points included:  
- **Sponsor’s Argument**: Representative Mark Makoni argued that the PDA is a state economic engine, not just a local entity, and that local representatives have sometimes prioritized their towns over state interests.  
- **Local Opposition**: Representatives from **Greenland**, **Newington**, and **Portsmouth** opposed the bill, emphasizing the importance of local control and accountability, particularly in addressing environmental issues like **PFAS contamination**.  
- **PDA Chair’s Testimony**: PDA Chair Steve Dupri recommended killing the bill, suggesting a new bill to clarify board member independence instead.  
- **Outcome**: The committee recommended **indefinite postponement (ITL)** of the bill, with potential for a future bill addressing board member independence.

#### **5. House Bill 1121 (Cleanup of Woody Debris in Streams)**  
This bill aimed to regulate the cleanup of woody debris in streams, minimizing sediment disturbance and ensuring no permanent impacts. Key points included:  
- **Concerns**: Some committee members raised concerns about unpermitted cleanup activities and the need for DES to document disturbances.  
- **Outcome**: The bill passed as amended with a vote of 17-3.

---

#### **6. House Bills 1301 and 1390 (Wake Surfing Regulations)**  
These bills sought to regulate wake surfing, particularly in shallow areas, to protect ecosystems and other lake users. Key points included:  
- **Environmental Concerns**: Testimony highlighted the environmental damage caused by wake surfing, including sediment disturbance and increased phosphorus levels, which contribute to cyanobacteria growth.  
- **Amendments**: Amendments were proposed to reduce wake surfing setbacks from 500 feet to 300 feet from the shoreline and restrict wake surfing on bodies of water smaller than 50 acres. These amendments aimed to balance environmental protection with recreational use.  
- **Outcome**: Both bills faced deadlocked votes (10-10) on key motions, resulting in no committee recommendation for either bill.

---

#### **7. Other Bills**  
- **Wetlands Definition**: A bill attempting to redefine wetlands was deemed inexpedient to legislate, as wetlands are scientifically defined and redefining them could conflict with federal statutes.  
- **Safe Boater Education Certificates**: A bill allowing electronic presentation of safe boater education certificates passed, with an amendment ensuring both sides of the document (including barcodes or QR codes) are included for verification.  
- **Personal Watercraft Safety**: A bill addressing personal watercraft safety was voted inexpedient to legislate, but representatives expressed interest in revisiting the issue with a more focused approach in the future.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**  
1. **Environmental Protection**: Discussions emphasized the importance of protecting natural resources, particularly lakes and wetlands, from invasive species, sediment disturbance, and nutrient pollution.  
2. **Balancing Interests**: Many debates centered on finding a balance between environmental conservation and recreational activities, such as wake surfing and wake sports.  
3. **Regulatory Clarity**: Several bills and amendments aimed to clarify the roles and authorities of state agencies, particularly the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**, in managing natural resources.  
4. **Local vs. State Control**: The debate over **House Bill 1513** highlighted tensions between local and state control, particularly in decisions affecting local communities and environments.  
5. **Collaboration and Compromise**: The committee emphasized the need for collaboration and compromise in crafting legislation that addresses complex environmental and recreational issues.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing environmental and recreational challenges through careful legislation and stakeholder engagement.
