The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) convened on March 4, 2024, to address systemic issues and concerns related to DCYF and the family court system. The meeting featured testimonies from individuals sharing personal experiences, discussions on due process and constitutional rights, and calls for legislative and procedural reforms. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Testimonies and Personal Experiences**
1. **Allegations of Due Process Violations**:
   - Multiple individuals testified about due process violations in their interactions with DCYF and family courts. Issues included unfounded allegations of abuse, falsified or omitted court records, and judicial misconduct.
   - **Joshua Peruse** shared his experience of being investigated by DCYF following a custody dispute. Despite criminal charges being dropped, DCYF found him responsible for abuse and added his name to the central registry without a hearing or opportunity to present evidence.
   - **Lauren Vaugh** recounted being separated from her daughter for 360 days despite complying with court orders. She criticized DCYF for contradictory reports, violations of court orders, and unreliable drug testing procedures, including allegations of false positives.

2. **Systemic Failures in DCYF Practices**:
   - Testimonies highlighted DCYF’s failure to follow its own policies, retaliatory behavior, and prioritizing financial incentives over children’s welfare. For example, one case involved DCYF denying a family member guardianship of a child despite the mother’s wishes, allegedly to keep the child in foster care for financial gain.
   - **Katrina Heinrich** shared her decade-long struggle with the family court system and DCYF, citing issues such as perjury, lack of enforcement of court orders, and ineffective intervention in cases of abuse and child removal.

3. **Emotional and Long-Term Impact**:
   - Witnesses emphasized the emotional toll on families, including the trauma of prolonged separations, lack of transparency, and the inability to challenge DCYF decisions effectively.

### **Concerns About Due Process and Constitutional Rights**
1. **Common Law and Due Process**:
   - The committee discussed the importance of common law doctrines in establishing due process rights, which predate the Constitution. It was noted that courts of record should operate under common law principles rather than statutory law when addressing individual rights.
   - Speakers argued that DCYF and family courts often violate constitutional rights, including the right to a trial by jury, proper hearings, and the ability to present evidence.

2. **Lack of Transparency and Accountability**:
   - Testimonies highlighted the lack of oversight and accountability within DCYF, including failures to contact witnesses, consider all sides of a story, or provide proper legal representation.
   - Concerns were raised about the enforcement of court orders and the failure of DCYF to act in the best interests of children and families.

3. **Drug Testing and Legal Representation**:
   - Issues with drug testing procedures were raised, including allegations of false positives and lack of forensic validation. Testimony also criticized attorneys for failing to advocate effectively for their clients in DCYF cases.

### **Systemic Issues and Calls for Reform**
1. **Federal Funding and Financial Incentives**:
   - Speakers raised concerns about federal funding tied to foster care programs, suggesting that DCYF may prioritize financial gain over the welfare of children.

2. **Training and Complexity of Child Protection Services**:
   - The lack of training on due process within DCYF and the complexity of child protection services were identified as barriers to fair and effective case handling.

3. **Advocacy for Legislative Action**:
   - Testifiers called for legislative reforms to ensure transparency, accountability, and adherence to constitutional principles in DCYF and family court proceedings.
   - **Representative JD Bernard**, who sponsored HR14 leading to the creation of the special committee, urged members to focus on identifying patterns of systemic issues and developing solutions based on the experiences of those harmed by the system.

### **Committee’s Next Steps**
