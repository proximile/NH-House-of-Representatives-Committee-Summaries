**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (03/04/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee convened on March 4, 2024, to address critical issues related to the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) and its intersection with the family court system. The meeting featured testimonies from individuals who shared their personal experiences, alongside discussions on due process, transparency, and systemic reforms. Key themes and findings from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Key Issues and Testimonies**
1. **Due Process and Transparency Concerns**  
   - Multiple witnesses highlighted the lack of due process in DCYF investigations and family court proceedings. Issues included delayed hearings, inadequate communication, and the inability to present evidence or challenge accusations.  
   - Witnesses described being placed on the DCYF central registry without hearings or opportunities to defend themselves, raising questions about fairness and accountability.  
   - Concerns were also raised about the opacity of DCYF processes, including delays in obtaining reports and the lack of transparency in decision-making.

2. **Judicial and DCYF Misconduct**  
   - Allegations of judicial misconduct, such as falsification of court records and lack of accountability, were brought forward. One witness claimed that a chief administrative judge may have lied under oath regarding the handling of their case.  
   - Witnesses criticized DCYF for failing to act in cases of child safety concerns and for prioritizing financial incentives, such as federal funding for foster care, over the best interests of children.  

3. **Personal Experiences with DCYF and Family Courts**  
   - **Joshua Peruse** shared how a DCYF investigation during a divorce led to a determination of abuse based solely on children’s testimony, despite evidence from adult witnesses. He emphasized the emotional toll and challenges of navigating the system.  
   - **Katrina Heinrich** spoke about her decade-long experience with the family court system, citing perjury, lack of due process, and DCYF’s failure to provide resources or support.  
   - Another parent testified about losing custody of their child due to alleged negligence and drug use, criticizing DCYF for violating court orders, misrepresenting facts, and failing to provide forensic drug testing.  
   - **Betty Gay** testified on behalf of Diane Cody, who faced repeated obstacles from DCYF in gaining guardianship of her great nephew, despite winning a Supreme Court case.  

4. **Cross-Agency and Multi-State Challenges**  
   - Witnesses described the complexities of navigating cases involving multiple agencies, such as New Hampshire DCYF and Los Angeles County’s DCFS. These cases highlighted the challenges of coordinating across jurisdictions and the lack of consistency in child welfare practices.  

5. **Constitutional and Common Law Principles**  
   - **Dan Baton** argued that due process should be grounded in constitutional and common law principles rather than procedural or statutory law. He emphasized that DCYF courts, which operate under statutory law and often have sealed records, lack the authority to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property.  

6. **Drug Testing and Forensic Evidence**  
   - Concerns were raised about the reliability of drug testing in DCYF cases. Witnesses claimed that tests were improperly conducted and used against them without forensic analysis or opportunities to challenge the results.  

### **Committee Discussions and Reforms**
- The committee debated procedural issues, such as whether witnesses should be sworn in under oath, ultimately deciding to administer oaths to ensure truthful testimony.  
- Members discussed the need for systemic reforms, including:  
  - Strengthening due process protections in DCYF investigations and family court proceedings.  
  - Implementing forensic drug testing and ensuring transparency in evidence collection.  
  - Holding DCYF accountable for violating court orders and individual rights.  
  - Addressing financial incentives that may prioritize foster care placements over family reunification.  
- A representative noted that complaints about the family court system and DCYF were among the top concerns raised by constituents during their campaign, underscoring the urgency of addressing these issues.  

### **Closing Remarks**
The committee chair announced the email address for submitting additional testimony and indicated that discussions would continue at the next meeting on March 25, 2024. The meeting concluded with a strong call for legislative action to address the systemic issues within DCYF and the family court system, emphasizing the need to protect families’ rights and ensure the well-being of children.  

### **Overall Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted significant deficiencies in the current processes of DCYF and the family court system, including a lack of due process, transparency, and accountability. The testimonies underscored the emotional and personal toll on families and the urgent need for reforms to ensure fairness, protect constitutional rights, and prioritize the best interests of children.
