**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting on March 13, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee convened on March 13, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on several education-related bills. The meeting focused on a range of issues, including cooperative school districts (co-ops), school administrative unit (SAU) governance, and budget committee roles. Key discussions, amendments, and decisions from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1195**:
   - This bill addresses the apportionment method for school administrative unit (SAU) costs, allowing constituent school districts to approve alternative methods. 
   - An amendment (1125H) was passed to clarify the apportionment process, ensuring transparency and fairness.
   - Concerns were raised about potential disadvantages to certain localities, prompting discussions on refining the bill’s language and referencing **RSA 194 C5** to address superintendent responsibilities.

2. **House Bill 1579**:
   - This bill encourages the merging of SAUs to reduce administrative costs and streamline governance.
   - Amendments (1128H) were proposed and passed to remove the minimum student threshold (initially 1,500, then 1,200) for mergers, allowing smaller districts to consolidate.
   - The committee debated financial incentives ($200 per pupil) for mergers and whether to limit administrative positions (e.g., one superintendent per merged SAU).
   - Concerns were raised about potential increases in bureaucracy and the need for clear processes, including public hearings and supermajority votes, to ensure successful mergers.

3. **House Bill 1383**:
   - This bill aimed to change how school board members are elected in cooperative school districts (co-ops), ensuring that representatives from pre-existing districts are elected only by voters within their own district, rather than at-large by all co-op voters.
   - The committee debated the implications of retroactively changing existing co-op agreements, with concerns about unintended consequences.
   - An amendment was proposed to restore original statutory language while addressing the sponsor’s intent. The bill ultimately failed with a 10-10 vote, and a motion for interim study was passed to allow further examination.

4. **House Bill 1481**:
   - This bill addressed filling vacancies in at-large co-op school board seats, discussing whether vacancies should be filled by voters from the specific town or district or by the entire co-op.
   - The bill passed with a 10-10 vote, but a motion for interim study was also approved to allow for more input from co-op representatives.

5. **House Bill 1493**:
   - This bill pertained to the powers and duties of co-op budget committees.
   - A motion for interim study was made and seconded, with the rationale that the topic requires further discussion and input from stakeholders.

6. **House Bill 1642**:
   - This bill proposed changing the role of school board members on budget committees to an ex officio, non-voting capacity.
   - The motion to pass the bill (OTP) was made and seconded, with some representatives supporting and others opposing.

### **Interim Study Motions**
   - Several bills, including **HB 1383**, **HB 1481**, and **HB 1493**, were referred to interim studies for further examination. This allows the committee to explore complex issues such as the costs of exiting cooperative agreements, building depreciation, and market value assessments, as well as to gather more input from stakeholders.

### **Administrative Costs and Mergers**
   - The committee highlighted discrepancies in administrative staffing across districts, with some SAUs being “top-heavy.” The goal of bills like **HB 1579** is to streamline administration and reduce costs, though skepticism was expressed about whether mergers would achieve this.
   - Financial incentives were seen as crucial to encourage districts to merge, but some members emphasized the need to ensure these incentives are tied to actual reductions in administrative staff.

### **Next Steps**
   - The committee noted that 13 bills remain to be addressed, with plans to continue work on the following Monday.
   - A hearing for a non-germane amendment to another bill (HB 1450) was also scheduled.

### **Key Themes**
   - **Transparency and Fairness**: The committee emphasized the importance of transparency in governance, fairness in representation (especially for smaller towns within co-ops), and clarity in legislative language.
   - **Local Control vs. State Oversight**: Discussions highlighted the complexity of balancing local decision-making with state oversight, particularly in co-op governance and SAU mergers.
   - **Streamlining Administration**: Reducing administrative costs and inefficiencies were recurring goals, though concerns were raised about the potential for increased bureaucracy despite mergers.

Overall, the meeting involved detailed discussions, amendments, and votes on various education bills, reflecting the committee’s commitment to thorough examination and thoughtful decision-making on complex issues affecting New Hampshire’s education system.
