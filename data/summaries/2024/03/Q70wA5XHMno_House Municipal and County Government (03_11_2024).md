#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1175 (Official Ballot Referendum for Town Meetings)**:
   - The bill aimed to restore equitable standards for adopting or rescinding certain measures, particularly concerning the transition to the **SB2** form of town governance versus traditional town meetings.
   - Debates focused on voter participation, democratic processes, and procedural challenges. Multiple motions resulted in tied votes (9-9), leading the committee to send the bill to the floor **without recommendation**.

2. **House Bill 1187 (Lease Agreements for School Equipment)**:
   - This bill sought to close a loophole allowing school districts to bypass traditional funding methods through lease agreements for building and facility improvements.
   - An amendment was proposed to clarify the bill’s intent, ensuring lease agreements are treated as special warrant articles. Due to concerns about unintended consequences, the bill was **recessed** until March 20 for further review.

3. **House Bill 1281 (Zoning Restrictions on Residential Rental Properties)**:
   - The bill aimed to address the housing crisis by limiting municipalities from enforcing ordinances that restrict renters to fewer than one person per bedroom.
   - An amendment reduced the occupancy limit from two persons per bedroom to one, aligning with state building and fire codes. While supporters argued it would increase rental availability, concerns about infrastructure overburden in densely populated areas led to a recommendation for **interim study**.

4. **House Bill 1210 (Strafford County Commissioner Elections)**:
   - The bill proposed reverting Strafford County’s election of county commissioners to an at-large system. The committee was divided, with debates about representation and gerrymandering. The bill ended in a **tied vote (9-9)** and was sent to the floor without recommendation.

5. **House Bill 1284 (Quasi-Judicial Nature of Planning Boards)**:
   - This bill sought to clarify the quasi-judicial role of local planning boards. Concerns about its necessity and potential duplication of existing laws led to a unanimous recommendation for **interim study (ITL)**.

6. **House Bill 1345 (Term Extensions for Coos County Officers)**:
   - The bill proposed extending the terms of Coos County officers from two to four years. Supporters argued for continuity and reduced training costs, while opponents emphasized accountability and voter control. The committee ultimately voted against the ITL motion, supporting the bill.

7. **House Bill 1101 (Study Committee for State Loan Programs)**:
   - The bill proposed creating a study committee to address housing and student debt through state loan programs. After initial opposition, the committee voted 10-7 to recommend **ITL**, questioning the feasibility of combining housing and student loan issues.

8. **House Bill 1053 (Residential Units in Commercial Zones)**:
   - The bill proposed allowing residential units in commercial zones. The committee voted 15-2 to recommend **ITL**, citing the importance of local control over zoning and concerns about unintended consequences.

9. **House Bill 526 (Temporary Traffic Control Personnel)**:
   - The bill aimed to regulate temporary traffic control personnel. The committee voted 12-4 to recommend **ITL**, citing concerns about undermining police chiefs’ authority and existing regulations.

10. **Waste Reduction in Master Plans**:
    - A bill allowing municipalities to include waste reduction sections in their master plans was discussed. The committee voted to recommend **Ought to Pass (OTP)**, encouraging communities to consider waste reduction strategies.

11. **County Property Sales**:
    - A bill requiring greater transparency in the sale of county property was debated. Concerns about notification periods and appraisal requirements led to a recommendation for **interim study**.

12. **Bond Issuance Approval**:
