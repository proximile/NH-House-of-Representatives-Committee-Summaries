The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on March 26, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on several legislative bills and amendments, with a focus on clarifying legislative language, addressing constitutional concerns, and ensuring fiscal responsibility in light of the state’s current revenue challenges.

### Key Bills and Amendments Discussed:

1. **Senate Bill 324 (Lottery Commission Notifications)**:
   - The committee reviewed an amendment proposed by Representative PL, which clarified that the bill applies only to annual licenses. The amendment requires the Lottery Commission to notify licensees at least 45 days before their licenses expire. The amendment was approved without further debate.

2. **Senate Bill 363 (Greyhound Racing)**:
   - Representative PL introduced an amendment to eliminate the "simulcast" provision for greyhound racing, citing past animal abuse issues. The committee supported the amendment, noting that greyhound racing had already been abolished and the economic impact of the change would be minimal. The bill was passed with a motion to "ought to pass" (OTP) and placed on the consent calendar.

3. **Senate Bill 473 (Unclaimed Lottery Tickets)**:
   - An amendment was presented to streamline the handling of unclaimed lottery funds. The amendment redirected these funds to the education trust fund instead of the governor’s scholarship fund, which was deemed unconstitutional. The committee agreed to remove the reference to the governor’s scholarship fund, ensuring the funds would go to the education trust fund. The bill was passed as amended.

4. **Senate Bill 454 (Affordable Housing Funding)**:
   - This bill proposes increasing funding for affordable housing by $5 million, sourced from the real estate transfer tax (RETT). The committee debated the timing and feasibility of the increase, given current revenue uncertainties. While some representatives emphasized the urgent need for affordable housing, others recommended delaying the decision until more revenue data is available. The committee ultimately voted to send the bill to interim study for further assessment.

5. **SP 513 (Charity Auctions and Licensing)**:
   - The bill aims to clarify licensing exemptions for charitable organizations, particularly 501(c)(3) entities, during charity auctions. Representatives raised concerns about the bill’s ambiguous language, including whether the exemption applies to the organization, the auctioneer, or both. There was also confusion about the inclusion of various charitable organizations (e.g., Masons, Elks, Knights of Columbus) that may not fall under the current definitions. The committee agreed to work with legal experts to refine the language and ensure it covers all intended organizations.

6. **SP 514 (Timber Tax Exemption)**:
   - The committee passed this bill, which increases the volume of timber eligible for personal use exemptions under the timber tax law. The bill was deemed to have a minimal revenue impact and was moved to the consent calendar.

7. **SB 497 (Hospital Disproportionate Share Payments)**:
   - The bill, which addresses hospital disproportionate share payments, was amended to clarify language and ensure compliance with federal requirements. The amended bill was passed.

### Broader Fiscal and Revenue Discussions:

- The committee discussed the state’s revenue outlook, particularly the significant shortfall in business taxes compared to the previous year and the budget plan. Representatives acknowledged the challenges of predicting future revenues, especially with recent tax cuts in place.
- There was caution about making new financial commitments without a clearer picture of the state’s fiscal health. The committee emphasized the importance of fiscal prudence in light of current revenue challenges.

### Outcomes and Next Steps:

- **SB 454** was sent to interim study for further evaluation, with plans to revisit the issue once more revenue data becomes available.
- **SP 513** will undergo further refinement, with the committee collaborating with legal experts to address ambiguities and ensure the bill covers all relevant charitable organizations.
- Several bills, including **SB 324**, **SB 363**, **SB 473**, **SP 514**, and **SB 497**, were passed with amendments.
- The committee decided not to meet the following week and tentatively scheduled its next meeting for April 9, 2024, to address **SP 513** and any new Senate bills. Public hearings for new Senate bills were also planned.

### Conclusion:

The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on refining legislative language, addressing constitutional concerns, and balancing immediate policy needs with fiscal responsibility. While progress was made on several bills, the committee acknowledged the need for further clarification and data before finalizing decisions on key issues such as affordable housing funding and charitable auction exemptions. The discussions underscored the challenges of navigating policy priorities in the context of uncertain revenue projections.
