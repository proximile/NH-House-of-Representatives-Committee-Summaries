**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Commerce and Consumer Affairs (March 19, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 19, 2024, to discuss and refine several legislative bills and amendments across various sectors, including cryptocurrency, healthcare, real estate, and alcohol manufacturing. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting.

### Cryptocurrency and Financial Regulations
The committee revisited the definition of "stored value" in the context of cryptocurrency, with an amendment aimed at explicitly excluding digital assets from this term. Representative Keith emphasized that "stored value" should refer solely to dollars, not digital assets. One representative argued that cryptocurrency is a commodity with subjective value, likening it to Beanie Babies. The committee agreed to address this amendment separately and reconvene the following day for further deliberation. Additionally, a bill regulating money transmitters, which included provisions for cryptocurrency, was debated. Concerns were raised about consumer protection and the need for regulatory clarity, leading to proposed amendments to explicitly exclude virtual currency from stored value definitions.

### Condominium Association Proxies
The committee discussed an amendment allowing condominium associations to use proxies for voting, specifying that proxies must be issue-specific. While concerns were raised about the exclusion of time shares, the amendment ultimately passed with support from key representatives.

### Pharmacy and Medication Switching
Concerns were raised about pharmacists having the authority to switch patients to off-formulary medications, potentially increasing costs. The discussion emphasized the need for legal protections and further study before expanding pharmacists' prescribing powers. Amendments were proposed to ensure patients could refuse such switches and address cost concerns.

### Biosimilar Drugs
The conversation centered on the safety and cost-effectiveness of interchangeable biosimilar drugs, which have undergone extensive switching studies. Supporters argued that these drugs could help reduce rising drug prices, while critics questioned the need for further study. Amendments were introduced to clarify that substitutions must not increase costs for patients. Given the complexity of the issue and FDA guidance, the committee leaned toward recommending an interim study rather than advancing the bill.

### Liquor Licensing
A bill related to on-premise and off-premise liquor licenses was discussed, with amendments addressing clerical errors and adding requirements for cigar bar licenses. The amendment passed unanimously.

### Healthcare and Insurance
The committee supported a bill aimed at reducing healthcare costs by allowing follow-up tests after mammograms without additional patient costs, emphasizing its potential to improve healthcare accessibility.

### Flood Risk Disclosures in Real Estate Transactions
The committee discussed an amendment requiring clear and specific disclosures about flood risk in real estate transactions. The amendment proposed attaching the official FEMA flood insurance map to the purchase and sale agreement if the property is in a flood zone. It also included protections for sellers who rely on third parties for flood risk information and required buyer acknowledgment of the disclosures. Realtors expressed concerns about the potential for increased litigation and the complexity of interpreting flood maps. The committee moved to adopt the amendment, with discussions on refining the language for clarity and educational value.

### Contract Brewing and Manufacturing
The committee discussed an amendment expanding contract brewing and manufacturing provisions to include wine and liquor manufacturers, not just beer. Developed in collaboration with the New Hampshire Brewers Association and other industry stakeholders, the amendment aimed to ensure clarity and appropriateness for different manufacturing license types. The committee moved to pass the amendment.

### Administrative Matters
The meeting concluded with administrative discussions about tracking motions and reports for future reference, ensuring a structured approach to legislative updates and revisions.

Overall, the meeting focused on refining legislation to balance consumer protection, cost reduction, and regulatory clarity across various sectors. Amendments were proposed and passed to address specific concerns, and the committee moved several bills forward for further consideration. The committee planned to reconvene the next day to finalize the cryptocurrency amendment and address other pending matters.
