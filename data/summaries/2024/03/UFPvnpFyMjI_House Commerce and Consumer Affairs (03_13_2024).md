**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (March 13, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on March 13, 2024, to address a wide range of bills and issues related to commerce, consumer protections, and regulatory updates. The meeting was divided into several segments, each focusing on different topics, including flood risk disclosures, service animals, short-term rental regulations, and various consumer protection measures. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Flood Risk Disclosure in Real Estate Transactions**  
A significant portion of the meeting focused on a bill aimed at improving flood risk disclosure in real estate transactions. The discussion highlighted concerns that many homebuyers, particularly those paying cash, were unaware they were purchasing properties in flood zones until after the sale, leading to unexpected costs for flood insurance and financial strain.  

Key points included:  
- **Proposed Solutions**: The bill seeks to remove the "unknown" option from disclosure forms, requiring sellers and realtors to provide a definitive "yes" or "no" regarding flood zones.  
- **Liability Issues**: Lawmakers debated whether sellers, realtors, or third-party vendors should be held accountable for incorrect flood zone information. The bill proposes shifting liability to third-party vendors if they provide inaccurate data.  
- **Broader Concerns**: The discussion expanded to include drainage issues and the need for comprehensive water-related disclosures beyond flood zones.  
- **Challenges**: There was debate over the feasibility of requiring specific FEMA flood maps and the potential for lawsuits if buyers receive incorrect information. Some lawmakers suggested placing more responsibility on buyers to verify flood risk, while others advocated for stricter seller and realtor accountability.  
- **Landlord-Tenant Issues**: Provisions for renters were initially included but faced pushback, with some arguing that disclosures should focus solely on property sales.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to revisit the bill to refine language and address unresolved concerns.

### **2. Companion vs. Service Animals**  
The committee debated the distinction between companion and service animals, particularly in the context of businesses and landlords. While service animals must be accommodated under the ADA, businesses can refuse companion animals. Challenges include verifying legitimate service animals and the legal risks of refusing service. A study committee was proposed to address these complexities and find solutions to protect both businesses and individuals with legitimate service animals.

### **3. Short-Term Rental Registry**  
The committee discussed establishing a short-term rental registry but decided to table the related bills due to ongoing litigation and opposition from real estate and municipal associations. The motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) these bills was passed without further discussion.

---

### **4. Bed and Breakfast Regulations**  
The discussion centered on food service rules for bed and breakfast establishments, particularly the definition of snacks and the reheating of commercially prepared food. The Department of Public Health had preemptively updated rules to allow for the service of snacks to late-arriving guests, rendering the bill redundant. The motion to ITL the bill was passed.

### **5. Other Bills and Key Discussions**  
The committee addressed several additional bills, including:  
- **Heating Fuel Repricing**: A bill prohibiting the repricing of heating fuel after a sale was discussed, with considerations for propane dealers and consumers.  
- **Right to Repair Educational Technology**: The committee examined a bill limiting the right to repair to educational technology, such as computers, noting that state-level legislation may not be necessary.  
- **Retail Installment Sales of Motor Vehicles**: A bill modernizing laws governing retail installment sales of motor vehicles was discussed, aiming to enhance consumer protections and establish regular examinations of retail sellers by the banking department.  
- **Sewage Disposal Systems Disclosure**: A bill requiring disclosure of sewage disposal system information during real estate transactions was deemed necessary for consumer protection and passed.
