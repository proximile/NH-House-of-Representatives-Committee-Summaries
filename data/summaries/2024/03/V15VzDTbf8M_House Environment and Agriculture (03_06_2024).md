**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (March 6, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on March 6, 2024, to discuss a range of legislative bills and issues related to environmental protection, waste management, agriculture, and animal welfare. The meeting featured robust debates, public testimony, and committee votes on several key topics. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Landfill Legislation and Waste Management**
The committee extensively debated two bills aimed at addressing landfill issues and waste management practices in New Hampshire:
- **HB 1145**: Prohibits private ownership of landfills, emphasizing state control over waste management to limit out-of-state trash and protect natural resources.
- **HB 1632**: Imposes a 15% cap on out-of-state waste for privately owned landfills, aligning with the Commerce Clause.

**Key Points**:
- Representatives argued that public ownership would ensure stricter regulations, better environmental protection, and accountability for cleanup.
- Concerns were raised about private landfills prioritizing profit over environmental safety, potentially leading to overcapacity and environmental risks.
- The committee discussed the need for a comprehensive waste management plan, including recycling, food waste reduction, and incentives for composting.
- A moratorium on new landfills until 2028 was mentioned, though it had not yet fully passed.

**Waste Management Rules (Chapter 800)**:
Mike Wims, Director of the Waste Management Division at the Department of Environmental Services (DES), provided updates on the ongoing revision of solid waste management rules. Key issues included:
- Industry concerns about the potential difficulty and cost of expanding or siting new landfills.
- Public confidence issues due to vacancies on the Waste Management Council, particularly for public interest and public health representatives.
- Updated rules addressing climate change impacts, such as increased rainfall intensity and updated stormwater and leachate management requirements.

### **2. Animal Cruelty Legislation**
The committee discussed **HB 1102**, which seeks to define animal cruelty, particularly concerning breeding practices:
- Testimony highlighted the complexity of legislating breeding standards, with some suggesting that stakeholders (breeders, veterinarians, etc.) should address the issue outside of legislation.
- Concerns were raised about the bill's language and its potential impact on animal shelters and breeders.

### **3. Agricultural Legislation**
Several bills related to agriculture were discussed:
- **HB 1463**: Proposed establishing a study committee to examine laws affecting beef, pork, and poultry production, aiming to consolidate conflicting federal and state regulations. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "ought to pass" (OTP).
- **HB 1628**: Streamlined and updated regulations for agricultural products like apples, cider, milk, and lumber by removing outdated provisions and aligning state standards with federal ones. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "ought to pass with amendment" (OTPA).
- **HB 1578**: Proposed repealing the state’s organic certification program, which was already being phased out due to staffing issues. Testimony from a farmer opposed the repeal, arguing for the importance of maintaining organic standards. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).

### **4. Raw Milk and Food Safety**
The committee revisited **HB 1574**, which pertains to the sale of raw milk and related products:
- The current 20-gallon daily sales limit for raw milk was discussed, with some members opposing an increase due to health risks.
- The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) highlighted the higher risk of foodborne illnesses associated with raw milk, referencing a 2021 outbreak linked to campylobacter bacteria.
- The bill also proposed removing size limits for raw milk-based frozen desserts, which DHHS opposed due to safety concerns.
- The committee voted to kill **HB 1529**, a bill related to unpasteurized eggs, after determining it was unnecessary under existing regulations.

### **5. Procedural Matters and Future Plans**
The committee addressed procedural issues, including amendments and moving bills to consent calendars. They also announced upcoming events:
- A field trip to Waste Management facilities on April 5 to learn about waste processing and landfill operations.
- A breakfast with the Farm Bureau and a discussion with military recruitment officials on veterans' affairs.
