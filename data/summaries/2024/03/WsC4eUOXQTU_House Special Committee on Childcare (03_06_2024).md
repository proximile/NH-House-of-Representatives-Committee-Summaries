**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Childcare Meeting (03/06/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare convened on March 6, 2024, to address several bills aimed at improving childcare access, affordability, safety, and regulatory oversight. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and focused on three key pieces of legislation: **House Bill 1056**, **House Bill 1409**, and **House Bill 1584**. Throughout the discussions, the committee emphasized the need to balance childcare availability with safety and quality, particularly in rural areas, and highlighted the challenges faced by families and providers.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **House Bill 1056: Maximum Hours in Childcare**
Representative Walner introduced an amendment to **House Bill 1056**, which initially proposed a 13-hour daily limit for children in childcare. The amendment sought to remove this limit, acknowledging the evolving work schedules of families in fields like healthcare and corrections. The committee revised the amendment to allow exceptions for emergencies, parents working over 13 hours, or military deployments. Concerns were raised about childcare providers needing to comply with residential care rules if the limit were removed entirely. After deliberation, the committee adopted the amendment and reported the bill out as **"Ought to Pass"** with the amendment.

#### **House Bill 1409: Licensing Violations Review**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1409**, which pertains to the review of childcare center licensing violations by the Advisory Council. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) presented a draft rule proposal for an independent informal dispute resolution process, enabling providers to appeal licensing decisions through a panel of peers. The committee agreed that the proposed rule effectively addressed the bill's intent. Consequently, they voted **"Inexpedient to Legislate"**, concluding that the issue could be resolved through rulemaking rather than legislation.

#### **House Bill 1584: Unlicensed Childcare Providers**
**House Bill 1584** proposed increasing the number of children a provider can care for without a license from three to four. Representative Walner moved to deem the bill **"Inexpedient to Legislate"**, citing safety concerns, particularly in emergencies like fires. The committee debated the balance between expanding childcare availability and ensuring child safety, with significant concerns raised about unlicensed care environments. The motion was seconded, and the committee prepared to vote on the bill. Earlier in the meeting, the committee had already voted 5-4 to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate," effectively halting its progress.

### **Themes and Committee Perspectives**
Throughout the meeting, several recurring themes emerged:
1. **Safety vs. Access**: The committee grappled with the challenge of balancing childcare access and affordability with safety and quality. Rural communities, in particular, face limited childcare options, prompting some members to prioritize access over stringent regulations.
2. **Rural Challenges**: Representatives from rural areas emphasized the need for family and group childcare solutions, as larger centers are often impractical in these regions. They advocated for continued support for these models.
3. **Collaborative Efforts**: Despite disagreements, committee members expressed appreciation for their collaborative work and a shared commitment to addressing childcare issues in the future.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with members acknowledging the complexity of childcare issues and the importance of ongoing efforts to improve access, safety, and quality, especially in rural areas. The committeeâ€™s discussions and decisions reflected a nuanced approach to addressing the diverse needs of New Hampshire families and childcare providers.
