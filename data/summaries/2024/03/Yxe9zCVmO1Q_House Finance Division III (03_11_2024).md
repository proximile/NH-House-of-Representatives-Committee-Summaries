### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (03/11/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on March 11, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative topics, focusing on **child welfare**, **child support**, **employee benefits**, **judicial oversight**, and **data sharing**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **Child Welfare and Social Security Benefits (HB 1598)**
The committee extensively discussed **House Bill 1598**, which seeks to ensure that Social Security and veterans' benefits for children in foster care are retained for their benefit rather than being used to cover state foster care costs. Key points included:

1. **Purpose and Current Practice**: The bill aims to protect benefits for vulnerable children, particularly those with disabilities or deceased parents. Currently, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) collects Title IV-E benefits for approximately 25 children, which allows the state to receive more federal funding but reduces the children’s access to their Social Security benefits.
2. **Financial Implications**: The fiscal note estimates a **$1.4 million loss in federal SSI revenue** and a **$74,000 loss in Title IV-E funds**. There is debate over whether the state can claim both Title IV-E and SSI benefits simultaneously.
3. **Administrative Burden**: Implementing the bill would require significant staffing increases to manage fiduciary responsibilities, including hiring attorneys and support staff to handle eligibility, appeals, and compliance.
4. **Proposed Amendments**: Amendments were suggested to clarify the state’s ability to claim both benefits, particularly for children in institutional care, and to mitigate financial losses.
5. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to revisit the bill in a future work session, potentially with amendments, and DHHS recommended hiring a consultant for a detailed analysis of the bill’s impacts.

### **Employee Assistance Program (HB 1363)**
The committee debated **House Bill 1363**, which proposes extending the **Employee Assistance Program (EAP)** to legislators. Key points included:

1. **Purpose of EAP**: The EAP provides support for workplace or personal challenges, offering brief services, assessments, and connections to community resources.
2. **Legislator Inclusion**: The bill would extend EAP benefits to all 424 legislators and their household members, at a cost of **$177,000 annually**.
3. **Debate**: Concerns were raised about treating legislators as employees, equity, cost, and redundancy, as some legislators already have EAP benefits through other employment.
4. **Amendment Proposal**: An amendment was proposed to delay the effective date to **July 1, 2034**, to separate voting legislators from those who would directly benefit.

### **Child Support Legislation (HB 1282, HB 1564, HB 1595)**
Multiple child support bills were discussed, with a focus on aligning formulas and resolving conflicts:

1. **HB 1282**: Addresses the duration of child support, with an effective date of **July 1, 2025**, following a 6-month contract amendment and implementation process.
2. **HB 1564 and HB 1595**: Both bills impact the **New England Child Support Enforcement System (Nexus)**.
   - **HB 1564**: A compromise bill that increases the self-support reserve, allows shared costs for childcare and extracurriculars, and introduces rebuttable presumptions for deviations in child support calculations based on shared parenting time.
   - **HB 1595**: A more comprehensive bill incorporating a **1.5 multiplier formula** for child support.
3. **Proposed Amendments**: An amendment to HB 1595 was proposed to include provisions from HB 1564, such as a self-support reserve and a domestic violence clause, potentially resolving conflicts between the two bills.
4. **Implementation and Costs**: Each bill has an estimated IT implementation cost of **$290,000**. Merging the bills could streamline costs and implementation timelines.

### **Juvenile Justice and Residential Care (HB 1573)**
**House Bill 1573** focuses on increasing judicial oversight to expedite moving children out of residential care. Key points included:

1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to address issues with juvenile residential care by improving judicial oversight.
2. **Fiscal Impact**: Concerns were raised about the bill’s fiscal impact on the judicial branch, with discussions on streamlining judicial obligations to reduce costs.

---

### **Recreational Funding for Adults with Disabilities (HB 1593)**
An amendment to **House Bill 1593** restricts funding for recreational activities to adults with disabilities who have exited the school system, capping funding at **$600 per individual**. The amendment also adjusts fiscal language and suggests using existing area agencies to streamline administration.

---

### **Data Sharing in Immunization Information System (HB 1669)**
**House Bill 1669** proposes changes to the state’s immunization information system, particularly around data sharing with other states. Key points included:

1. **Funding Needs**: DHHS indicated that additional funding would be required to comply with the bill’s requirements.
2. **Proposed Amendment**: An amendment was proposed to delay implementation until **July 1, 2025**, to allow for system changes without immediate budget impacts.

---

### **Extension of Court Jurisdiction for Special Education (HB 1588)**
**House Bill 1588** extends court jurisdiction over individuals receiving special education services from age 21 to 22. Key points included:

1. **Fiscal Impact**: Estimates ranged from **$1.65 million to $5.76 million** due to increased costs for residential and community-based services.
2. **Proposed Amendment**: The committee discussed shifting costs from local school districts to the state and requested an amendment to adjust the effective date to **July 1, 2025**.
