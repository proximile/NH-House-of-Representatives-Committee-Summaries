**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (03/06/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on March 6, 2024, to discuss and vote on several key bills, addressing issues ranging from tenant-landlord relations and end-of-life options to artificial intelligence (AI) legislation and public records requests. The meeting highlighted deep philosophical divides and practical concerns across various topics.

### **1. Tenant-Landlord Relations (House Bill 1082)**
The committee debated **House Bill 1082**, which seeks to overturn a Supreme Court ruling that allows tenants to stay indefinitely after a lease ends. Proponents, including the chairman, argued that leases should be enforced as written, giving landlords the right to terminate tenancy at the lease's expiration. Supporters like Representative Gon compared rental agreements to homeownership contracts, emphasizing the importance of contractual obligations. Opponents, including Representatives Kenny, Stapleton, and D. Loreno, highlighted the housing crisis, low vacancy rates, and the potential for increased homelessness if tenants are evicted without cause. They stressed the need for tenant protections and stability, particularly in a tight housing market. The committee ultimately moved to consider an interim study for further examination of the issue.

### **2. End-of-Life Options (House Bill 1283)**
The committee also discussed **House Bill 1283**, which allows terminally ill patients with less than six months to live to request medication to end their lives under strict conditions, including mental competency and approval by two independent physicians. An amendment removed physician assistants from the process and clarified pharmacists' role, limiting them to dispensing medication. Supporters argued the bill provides a compassionate option for terminally ill patients, emphasizing safeguards like the six-month prognosis requirement and dual-physician approval. Opponents raised concerns about slippery slopes, potential coercion, and the normalization of suicide, particularly among vulnerable populations. The committee voted **14-6** to recommend the bill with the amendment, reflecting deep philosophical divides.

### **3. Sentencing, Housing Permits, and Medical Malpractice**
Several other bills were discussed, including:  
- **Sentencing and Plea Deals**: Concerns were raised about the disparity between standard sentencing and plea deals, with fears that large differentials might discourage defendants from seeking trials.  
- **Housing Permits**: Representative Alexander proposed an interim study to expedite housing permit processes, addressing New Hampshire's housing crisis. The motion passed unanimously.  
- **Medical Malpractice and Detransitioning**: A bill related to medical malpractice in gender transition cases was debated, but both the bill and an amendment failed due to concerns about liability for decisions made with informed consent.  
- **Qualified Immunity**: A bill addressing qualified immunity standards was moved to interim study, with concerns about excessive lawsuits against municipalities.  
- **Loss of Consortium**: A bill expanding the definition of loss of consortium to include pets was voted down due to concerns about its scope and legal implications.

### **4. AI and Deep Fake Legislation**
The committee discussed multiple bills related to **AI and deep fakes**, focusing on creating consistent definitions and addressing concerns across different bills. Representative Manos proposed an amendment to strengthen AI-related legislation, including adding audio and revising penalties for creating deep fakes. The committee considered forming a subcommittee to reconcile definitions and refine the proposals.

### **5. Right-to-Know Law (House Bill 1283)**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 1283**, which focuses on the **Right-to-Know Law (RSA 91-A)**. An amendment introduced by Representative Katab aimed to address **burdensome public records requests** by allowing municipalities to charge fees for requests exceeding **10 hours of work** in a month, at a rate of **$25 per hour**. The amendment included provisions for fee waivers for indigent individuals and encouraged the use of automated redaction software. Supporters argued the amendment balances transparency and fiscal responsibility, while opponents expressed concerns about its potential impact on press freedom and access to information. The committee passed the amendment but suggested further study to refine the proposal.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of the issues facing New Hampshire, from housing and healthcare to technology and transparency. The committee's discussions reflected a balance between individual rights, societal risks, and practical considerations, with several bills moving to interim study for further examination. The session concluded with instructions for report writing and scheduling subcommittee meetings, setting the stage for continued deliberation in the coming weeks.
