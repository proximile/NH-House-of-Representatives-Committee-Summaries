### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on Charitable Gaming Laws (March 4, 2023)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a meeting on March 4, 2023, focused on the **Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws**. The discussions spanned three key segments, addressing issues such as **fund management and accountability**, **problem gambling and regulatory oversight**, and the **impact of charitable gaming on nonprofits and community services**. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

---

#### **1. Fund Management and Accountability**
The meeting began with a focus on the **tracking and allocation of charitable gaming revenues**, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability. Key points included:
- **Accounting Practices**: Charities explained their processes for categorizing and reporting gaming revenues, ensuring funds are applied to specific programs rather than administrative costs.
- **State Reporting Requirements**: The possibility of mandating detailed reports on how charitable gaming funds are spent was discussed. While some charities expressed concerns about the administrative burden, others acknowledged the importance of accountability.
- **Breakage and Manufacturer Fees**: The issue of "breakage" (unclaimed winnings) in gaming machines was debated. Some representatives suggested eliminating breakage and instead charging manufacturers an annual fee to adapt to industry growth.
- **License Moratorium and Local Control**: Pending bills proposing a seven-year moratorium on new gaming licenses and allowing municipalities to opt in or out of hosting charitable gaming activities were discussed. The impact on existing applications and the need for incremental growth were considered.
- **License Transfers**: The process of transferring gaming licenses when a business is sold was clarified, noting that new owners must undergo background and financial checks.

#### **2. Problem Gambling and Regulatory Oversight**
The commission addressed **problem gambling**, **regulatory oversight**, and **funding for responsible gambling initiatives**. Key highlights included:
- **Consultant Selection**: **Spectrum Gaming Group** was chosen as a consultant to study charitable gaming laws, focusing on fund allocation and regulatory oversight, with a bid of $77,500.
- **Problem Gambling Funding**: The **New Hampshire Council on Problem Gambling** provides education, advocacy, and treatment referrals but faces funding challenges. Despite a $250,000 budget, the council has not received funds due to a lack of a formal contract with the state.
- **Voluntary Self-Exclusion Program**: The lack of a **centralized self-exclusion program** was a major concern. Currently, individuals must self-exclude at each facility, which is inefficient and increases the risk of relapse.
- **Helpline and Outreach**: The council operates a helpline, which received 306 calls in 2023, with 78 identified as problem gamblers. However, limited resources hinder the implementation of comprehensive programs like Massachusetts’ **GameSense**.
- **Structural Reforms**: The inactive **Council for Responsible Gaming** was discussed, with suggestions to move it to the **Department of Health and Human Services** for better oversight. The commission plans to learn from Massachusetts’ comprehensive approach to problem gambling prevention and treatment.
- **Industry Involvement**: Gaming facilities shared their problem gambling plans, including employee training and self-exclusion programs, but the lack of a centralized database limits their effectiveness.

#### **3. Impact of Charitable Gaming on Nonprofits**
The meeting concluded with discussions on the **benefits and challenges of charitable gaming** for nonprofits and community services. Key points included:
- **Charitable Gaming’s Impact**: Representatives from organizations like **Angel Flight**, the **New Hampshire Police Fire and EMS Foundation**, and leadership programs in the Lakes Region highlighted how charitable gaming funds support critical services such as medical flights, emergency assistance, and educational programs.
- **Testimonies from Charity Leaders**: Charity leaders shared personal stories of how gaming revenues enabled them to expand services, such as providing fuel assistance, supporting families in crisis, and funding scholarships.
- **Challenges with Access and Equity**: Some charities face difficulties accessing gaming dates due to long waiting lists, raising concerns about equitable distribution.
- **Promotion and Support**: Charities promote gaming dates through social media and community outreach, with casinos like **The Brook** and **Lakes Region Casino** praised for their supportive approach.
- **Potential Reforms**: The commission considered reforms to ensure fairer distribution of gaming dates, such as implementing a lottery system or capping the amount a single charity can receive.
- **Future Considerations**: The discussion emphasized the need to balance the needs of established charities with the desire to support new entrants, ensuring charitable gaming continues to serve the community effectively.
