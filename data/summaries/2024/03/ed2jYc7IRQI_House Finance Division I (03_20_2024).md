**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (March 20, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 20, 2024, featured extensive discussions on a range of legislative issues, with a particular focus on cannabis legalization, veterans and drug courts, employee benefits, PFAS regulation, and bail reform. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The legalization and regulation of cannabis dominated much of the meeting, with detailed discussions on the proposed framework, fiscal implications, and public health concerns. Key points included:

1. **Fiscal Note and Appropriations**: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided updates on costs associated with implementing the cannabis program, including funding for positions related to recordkeeping and data collection. The bill also included provisions for public education campaigns, drug recognition experts, and driving enforcement to address public safety concerns.

2. **Agency Model and Market Control**: New Hampshire’s proposed "agency model" for cannabis regulation emphasizes state control over the market, with strict advertising and marketing rules to prevent misuse. The bill limits the number of cannabis stores to 15 initially, ensuring controlled growth. The Secretary of State is tasked with developing rules around lobbying and political contributions.

3. **Therapeutic Cannabis Program**: Concerns were raised about the potential impact of adult-use legalization on the existing therapeutic cannabis program, which serves approximately 14,000 patients. Efforts are being made to ensure the program remains viable despite potential drops in patient numbers.

4. **Community Reinvestment Fund**: A portion of cannabis revenue is earmarked for a Community Reinvestment Fund, supporting local projects such as water and sewer expansion, legal aid for cannabis convictions, and grants for farmers entering the cannabis market.

5. **Funding Allocation**: The bill outlines specific percentages of cannabis revenue for public safety, children’s behavioral health, and municipal aid. Debate arose over whether fixed percentages should be set or if the finance committee should allocate funds based on current needs.

6. **Amendment Discussions**: Representative Maguire presented an amendment crafted in consultation with the Senate and the governor, though further changes were expected. Concerns were raised about provisions that could increase criminal penalties for cannabis-related offenses, which were strongly opposed.

7. **Public Hearing and Next Steps**: A public hearing on the cannabis amendment was scheduled for the following Wednesday, with further discussions and potential amendments planned afterward.

### **Employee Benefits and Business Regulations**
The committee addressed House Bill 1178, which concerns employee vacation pay and earned time upon termination, layoff, or business closure. Key points included:

1. **Amendments and Debates**: Several amendments were proposed, focusing on seasonal employment, layoffs, and business closures. Representative Cahill proposed a 30-day cap for reimbursements, while Representative Infantine’s amendment, which excluded layoffs and focused on business closures, was ultimately passed.

2. **Business and Industry Association Concerns**: The BIA expressed concerns about the bill, preferring no legislation but supporting Infantine’s amendment as the best available option.

3. **Committee Vote**: The bill was passed as amended, with further amendments possible before it moves to the full committee.

### **Veterans and Drug Courts**
The committee discussed a bill allocating $2 million annually to counties for veterans and drug courts. Key points included:

1. **Language Debate**: Representatives debated whether to use "shall" (mandatory) or "may" (optional) language, with concerns about the financial burden on counties.

2. **Incentive Amendment**: An amendment proposing $5,000 per case handled in veterans courts failed, but the bill was ultimately passed with amendments and moved to the full committee.

### **PFAS Regulation**
House Bill 1666, aimed at regulating PFAS, was debated with a focus on refining the definition of PFAS and addressing cost concerns. Key points included:

1. **Amendments**: One amendment passed, moving the effective date of the bill forward, while another to change the definition of PFAS failed.

2. **Committee Vote**: The bill passed with amendments and was moved to the full committee.

### **Bail Reform**
Three bills related to bail reform (Senate Bills 249, 252, and House Bill 318) were consolidated into one bill. Discussions focused on aligning fiscal notes and addressing overlapping provisions. The consolidated bill was scheduled for further discussion the following week.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on fiscal responsibility, transparency, and balancing the needs of various stakeholders. Complex issues like cannabis legalization, veterans’ treatment, and PFAS regulation required careful negotiation and amendment to address financial, policy, and public health concerns. The committee emphasized its role as a finance-focused body, prioritizing fiscal implications over policy decisions while navigating the legislative process.
