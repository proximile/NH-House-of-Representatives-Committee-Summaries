**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) Meeting – March 25, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) convened on March 25, 2024, to address systemic issues within DCYF and the family court system. The meeting featured testimonies from individuals sharing personal experiences, as well as discussions among committee members about reforms needed to improve transparency, accountability, and due process within DCYF. Key themes and takeaways from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **Systemic Failures and Lack of Trust**
Multiple speakers shared personal stories of mistrust and betrayal by DCYF and family courts. Testimonies highlighted emotional trauma caused by perceived manipulation, dishonesty, and lack of support from these systems. One speaker recounted being lied to and manipulated against their own children, while another shared their experience of being sex trafficked and receiving inadequate assistance from DCYF. These accounts underscored a pervasive lack of trust in DCYF’s ability to prioritize the well-being of children and families.

---

### **Credibility, Accountability, and Financial Incentives**
Concerns were raised about the credibility of DCYF workers and law enforcement, with allegations of perjury, false affidavits, and unethical practices. One speaker referenced a case where DCYF workers lied under oath, leading to unwarranted interventions. Several testimonies pointed to financial incentives tied to federal funding (Title IV) as a driving force behind DCYF’s actions, suggesting that the system prioritizes revenue over the welfare of families. A specific example highlighted DCYF’s alleged preference for conducting assessments themselves to secure $6,000 per assessment through Title IV, rather than allowing external agencies to perform them.

---

### **Due Process Violations and Constitutional Concerns**
Testimonies and committee discussions emphasized widespread violations of due process, including cases where children were denied the right to appear in court and parents were subjected to unconstitutional orders. Representative Leah Kushman highlighted the constitutional requirement for trial by jury, arguing that DCYF’s administrative tribunals bypass this fundamental right. Speakers also criticized family courts for operating without proper oversight, leading to abuse of the legal process and long-term harm to families.

---

### **Trauma, Abuse, and Systemic Neglect**
Personal stories of trauma and systemic neglect were central to the meeting. Speakers detailed cases where children were exposed to harmful situations under DCYF supervision, including allegations of child trafficking and inadequate responses to abuse. The committee acknowledged the emotional toll on families and the need for systemic change to prevent further harm.

---

### **Calls for Reform and Legislative Action**
Speakers and committee members called for urgent legislative action to address systemic flaws. Proposed reforms included repealing unconstitutional laws, increasing oversight of DCYF and family courts, and ensuring accountability for unethical practices. One speaker urged the legislature to unseal cases and investigate DCYF’s practices, while others emphasized the need for better communication, transparency, and standardized procedures.

### **Committee Goals and Focus Areas**
The committee outlined its commitment to improving DCYF’s processes, making them more transparent and understandable for families. Key areas of focus included:
1. **Due Process and DCYF Procedures**: Ensuring that cases are handled fairly and that families can access appropriate levels of care as their needs evolve.
2. **Parental Rights vs. Child Protection**: Balancing the rights of parents with the need to protect children from abuse, particularly in cases of unfounded allegations.
3. **Early Intervention and Support Services**: Advocating for proactive measures to strengthen families and prevent escalation of issues.
4. **Data Tracking and Follow-Up**: Improving data collection and analysis to identify patterns and address systemic issues.
5. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engaging with DCYF officials, police chiefs, and other stakeholders to better understand current processes and identify areas for improvement.

### **Specific Legal Issues and Allegations**
One speaker detailed a contentious legal case involving a contempt motion filed by Ross McLoud, an attorney for DCYF, which was later vacated. The speaker accused DCYF of engaging in “maladministration” and “fraud” and criticized the agency for prioritizing financial gain over child welfare. Allegations of discrepancies between caseworker documentation and police reports were also raised, though the speaker acknowledged uncertainty about whether these communications were verbal or written.

### **Committee’s Commitment to Reform**
The meeting concluded with the committee chair expressing a commitment to reviewing policies and procedures to address potential breakdowns and improve outcomes for families and children. The committee plans to continue its work, with future meetings tentatively scheduled to further investigate DCYF’s practices and explore avenues for reform.

### **Conclusion**
The March 25, 2024, meeting of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on DCYF highlighted deep systemic issues within the agency and the family court system. Testimonies painted a picture of a system that often prioritizes financial incentives and bureaucratic efficiency over the rights and well-being of children and families. The committee’s focus on due process, transparency, and accountability reflects a commitment to meaningful reform, with the ultimate goal of creating a fairer and more effective system for all stakeholders.
