**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (March 20, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on March 20, 2024, to discuss and vote on several bills and amendments. The meeting focused on administrative, regulatory, and licensing-related issues, with key decisions and debates summarized below:

### **Key Bills and Amendments**

1. **House Bill 1271**  
   - The committee discussed and voted on **Amendment 2024-248H**, proposed by Representative Levas. The amendment sought to convert several regulatory boards to advisory boards to address liability concerns and streamline operations.  
   - While the amendment passed, it faced some dissent due to concerns about the growing authority of the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and the potential loss of autonomy for the affected boards.  
   - Earlier in the meeting, a motion to pass the bill with an amendment resulted in a 10-10 tie. A subsequent motion for an interim study was approved, indicating the bill will undergo further review.

2. **House Bill 1688**  
   - The committee unanimously adopted **Amendment 1254**, which simplifies the bill, aligns definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) with other legislation, and incorporates ethics requirements into law. The motion to pass with amendment was approved 20-0.

3. **House Bill 1622**  
   - The committee resumed discussion from a previous session and adopted **Amendment 1226**, which enhances public comment reporting and incorporation into rule-making processes. The motion to pass with amendment was also approved unanimously (20-0).

4. **House Bill 1095**  
   - Representative Gorda moved **Amendment 2024-2121H**, which aimed to resolve conflicts between the OPLC and various professional boards. The amendment proposed transferring responsibilities such as licensing, fee setting, and investigations from the boards to the OPLC, while the boards would retain credentialing and adjudication of complaints. The amendment passed unanimously (20-0).

### **Key Discussions**

- **Advisory Boards and OPLC’s Role**:  
   The committee debated the rationale for converting regulatory boards to advisory boards, emphasizing liability reduction, operational efficiency, and addressing conflicts of interest in smaller professions. However, some members expressed reservations about the OPLC’s expanding authority and the lack of input from affected boards.  
   Questions were also raised about the fiscal impact of the OPLC’s increased responsibilities and the inconsistency in converting only some small boards to advisory status.

- **Committee Scheduling and Deadlines**:  
   The chair announced that this was the last executive session for House bills, with all committee reports due that day. No committee activities were scheduled for the following week, but hearings on Senate bills were planned for April 3 and 10.

### **Outcome**

The meeting concluded with unanimous approval of amendments to House Bills 1688, 1622, and 1095, while House Bill 1271 was sent for further study due to unresolved concerns. The discussions highlighted a mix of support for administrative streamlining and caution regarding the shift of authority to the OPLC. The committee’s focus on technical and operational changes to licensing and board processes underscored ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and address regulatory challenges.
