### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **1. Education-Related Audits**
   - **Special Education Oversight**:
     - The committee examined the state’s monitoring of special education programs to ensure compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Concerns were raised about the limited state funding ($225,000) allocated for oversight, which was deemed insufficient for effective monitoring.
     - The Department of Education acknowledged resource constraints but highlighted efforts to support districts through targeted interventions and contractors like WestEd. Committee members expressed concerns about the lack of district-level oversight and enforcement, with Commissioner Frank Edelblut noting that many issues go unreported.
     - The ongoing special education audit, expected to include over 40 observations, focuses on the Department of Education’s special education bureau. Expanding the scope to local districts was deemed challenging due to statutory limitations.

   - **Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program Audit**:
     - The committee debated the audit of the EFA program, administered by the Children’s Scholarship Fund. A significant issue arose regarding access to data held by the scholarship organization, particularly personally identifiable information.
     - The Department of Education argued that certain data is not state property and is therefore not subject to audit under the current statute. The audit team countered that the lack of access to this data creates a substantial scope limitation, hindering a thorough audit.
     - The Attorney General’s office clarified that the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) cannot compel the scholarship organization to provide data but can note discrepancies in its findings. The committee considered amending the statute to clarify data access or proceeding with a limited audit.

#### **2. Health and Behavioral Health Services**
   - **Statewide Treatment Services Program**:
     - The committee discussed the need to evaluate the efficiency of the Statewide Treatment Services program, focusing on wait times, affordability, and the distribution of calls between daytime and nighttime/weekend call centers. The program, operational for at least five years, has not been audited recently.
   - **Children’s Behavioral Health**:
     - One member prioritized examining the interplay between the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and children’s behavioral health services, citing a recent case of a child stuck in an emergency department as a motivating factor.

#### **3. Environmental Services Audit**
   - **DES Appeals and Hearings Process**:
     - The Judiciary Committee proposed a performance audit of the Department of Environmental Services (DES), focusing on its four councils (Air Resources, Wetlands, Water, and Waste Management) that handle hearings and appeals. Concerns were raised about inconsistent rules and procedures, particularly in housing-related cases.
     - The committee considered whether to conduct a broad audit or focus on specific areas, with plans to refine the scope and invite DES officials for further context.

#### **4. Constitutional Duties and Legal Disputes**
   - **Secretary of State’s Archives and Records**:
     - Secretary of State David Scanlan argued that the archives and records are part of his constitutional duties and thus exempt from performance audits. The Attorney General’s office supported this view, citing RSA 1431a, which exempts constitutional officers from performance audits in the execution of their constitutional duties.
     - The committee acknowledged the importance of maintaining the integrity of state records and elections but noted the need for clarity on the boundaries of constitutional exemptions.

#### **5. Performance Audit Updates**
   - **Completed Audits**:
     - Audits on mental health workforce licensing and special education dispute resolution were completed, with reports presented to the fiscal committee.
   - **Ongoing Audits**:
     - The audit of the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights is nearing completion, while the state oversight of special education audit, a large-scale effort, is expected to produce a draft report by the end of the year.
   - **Suspended Audits**:
     - The Bureau of Elderly and Adult Services audit remains suspended due to ongoing litigation, and the committee discussed whether to retain or remove it from the list of suspended topics.

#### **6. Committee Operations**
   - **New Members and Informational Needs**:
     - Several new committee members requested summaries of audit topics to better understand their history and relevance.
   - **Scheduling**:
     - The committee scheduled its next meeting for April 29, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., to finalize audit topics and scope statements.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**
   - **Transparency vs. Legal Constraints**: The committee grappled with balancing transparency and accountability with legal and contractual limitations, particularly in auditing programs administered by third parties.
   - **Resource Limitations**: Insufficient funding and statutory constraints were recurring themes, especially in special education oversight and state-administered programs.
   - **Constitutional Exemptions**: The debate over auditing constitutional duties highlighted the need for clarity on the boundaries of legislative oversight.

### **Next Steps**
   - The committee plans to refine the scope of proposed audits, including DES appeals and EFA program audits, and address legal and resource challenges to ensure effective oversight. Future meetings will focus on prioritizing audit topics and advancing the committee’s oversight responsibilities.
