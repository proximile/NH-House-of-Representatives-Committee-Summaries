The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee meeting on March 19, 2024, addressed a wide range of topics related to renewable energy development, environmental regulation, and climate initiatives. The discussions highlighted challenges, legislative actions, and opportunities to advance the state’s energy and environmental goals. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and takeaways from the meeting:

---

### **Renewable Energy Development and Interconnection Challenges**
1. **Solar Interconnection Delays**:
   - Stakeholders, including developers, municipalities, and homeowners, testified about significant delays in the interconnection process for solar and other renewable energy projects, often exceeding a year. These delays threaten project timelines, economic viability, and the use of federal funds.
   - Specific examples included the Town of Whitefield waiting months to activate a solar array and Rockingham County facing challenges with a large solar project. Residential customers also expressed frustration with lengthy interconnection processes for solar installations.
   - Proposed solutions included establishing clear timelines, creating separate tracks for small and large projects, and implementing penalties or incentives to ensure timely interconnection. There was a call for the Department of Energy (DOE) to expedite rulemaking and adopt best practices from neighboring states like Massachusetts.

2. **Senate Bill 391**:
   - This bill aims to streamline the interconnection process for solar energy systems, particularly for larger projects used by businesses. Proposed amendments included requiring utilities to respond to applications within 10 days, eliminating unnecessary system impact studies for smaller projects, and allowing customer generators to pay for utility upgrades upfront.
   - Stakeholders emphasized the economic benefits of efficient interconnection processes, including job creation, energy cost savings, and increased investment in New Hampshire. Concerns were raised about the costs of grid upgrades, with clarification that customer generators should bear the costs of their own upgrades.

3. **Offshore Wind Development**:
   - The Gulf of Maine is progressing toward offshore wind development, with leases expected to be auctioned by the end of 2024. Challenges include the need for floating turbines and DC transmission cables, which are still developing technologies.
   - New Hampshire is collaborating with federal and state agencies to address fisheries impacts, transmission infrastructure, and workforce development. Unlike neighboring states, New Hampshire does not have renewable energy procurement mandates, reducing its direct involvement in offshore wind development.

### **Legislative Updates and Renewable Energy Funding**
1. **Senate Bill 303**:
   - This bill modifies the administration of the Renewable Energy Fund (REF) to align with current energy sector developments. It removes battery storage language (as it does not generate renewable energy certificates (RECs)), repeals the residential solar rebate program (deemed ineffective), and directs the DOE to create programs for political subdivisions to reduce energy costs.
   - Concerns were raised about the removal of battery storage, with some arguing it enhances renewable energy systems’ efficacy. The DOE clarified that the REF is designed to incentivize REC-generating projects, and battery storage does not qualify under this framework.

2. **Senate Bill 388**:
   - This bill makes technical and administrative changes to statutes governing the DOE’s oversight of utilities. Key changes include clarifying that public utilities must comply with DOE orders, updating reporting timelines for the REF, and streamlining the process for entities to request exemptions from DOE assessments.
   - Amendments ensure only new solar installations are eligible for certain programs and allow the DOE to rank projects based on demonstrated readiness (e.g., site control, financing plans).

### **Environmental Regulation and Climate Initiatives**
1. **Air Quality Management**:
   - New Hampshire maintains compliance with federal air quality standards, operating 13 air monitoring sites and implementing programs under the Clean Air Act. The state also oversees the disbursement of $30 million from the Volkswagen settlement, with 15% allocated for EV infrastructure development.
   - The state is part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which regulates CO2 emissions from power plants, and is working with other states to review and potentially update the program.

2. **PFAS Contamination**:
   - The state has implemented regulations to address PFAS contamination, particularly from the Saint-Gobain facility, which caused significant groundwater pollution. Efforts include setting soil and surface water standards for PFAS compounds and reducing emissions.

3. **Climate Action Plan (CPRG)**:
   - New Hampshire received a $3 million federal grant to develop a Preliminary Climate Action Plan (PCAP) aimed at reducing emissions and preparing for climate change. The state plans to apply for up to $50 million in additional federal funding to support transportation, EV charging, public transit, weatherization, and workforce development programs.
   - The state is also part of multi-state coalitions seeking funding for resilience projects and heat pump incentives.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Regulatory Clarity and Efficiency**: There is an urgent need for clear, enforceable rules and timelines for renewable energy projects, particularly in the interconnection process, to support the growth of solar and offshore wind energy.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: The DOE emphasized the importance of stakeholder input in designing effective programs and addressing challenges in renewable energy development and environmental regulation.
- **Economic and Environmental Benefits**: Efficient processes and clear rules are essential for attracting investment, creating jobs, and achieving New Hampshire’s renewable energy and climate goals.
- **Collaboration and Innovation**: The state is working with federal and regional partners to address challenges in offshore wind development, air quality management, and climate resilience.

The meeting concluded with a focus on advancing legislative and regulatory measures to support renewable energy, improve environmental management, and address climate challenges in New Hampshire.
