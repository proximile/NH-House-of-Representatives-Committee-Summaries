### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (March 19, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on March 19, 2024, to address a broad range of topics, including renewable energy legislation, interconnection challenges, offshore wind development, air quality monitoring, environmental regulations, and public health issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting.

---

#### **Legislation on Renewable Energy and Utility Administration**
The committee focused on two primary bills: **Senate Bill 303** and **Senate Bill 388**.

- **Senate Bill 303**: This bill proposes changes to the Renewable Energy Fund (REF) by adding battery storage projects, repealing ineffective programs like the residential solar rebate, and authorizing grants for municipalities to reduce energy costs. While battery storage was initially included, it was removed during Senate amendments because it does not generate Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), which are central to the REF’s purpose. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and is supported by the Department of Energy, though concerns were raised about the exclusion of battery storage, which enhances renewable energy systems.
  
- **Senate Bill 388**: This bill introduces technical changes to utility administration, including clarifications on compliance orders, net metering, and assessment exemptions for small utilities. It also removes outdated statutes and aligns reporting timelines with House Bill 2. The Department of Energy requested additional amendments to improve eligibility criteria for solar programs and streamline project ranking.

#### **Interconnection Challenges for Solar Projects**
Significant attention was given to **Senate Bill 391**, which addresses interconnection rules and standards for renewable energy projects, particularly solar. Stakeholders, including developers, municipalities, and businesses, expressed frustration with delays, inconsistent communication, and lack of clear rules in the interconnection process. Key points included:
- **Delays**: Projects often face lengthy delays in system impact studies and activation, jeopardizing funding and economic viability.
- **Need for Clear Rules**: Stakeholders called for standardized rules, timelines, and transparency to streamline the process.
- **Cost Allocation**: Debate centered on whether developers or ratepayers should bear the costs of grid upgrades.
- **Proposed Solutions**: Amendments were suggested to enforce timelines, eliminate unnecessary studies for smaller projects, and allow customer generators to pay for upgrades upfront.

#### **Offshore Wind Development**
New Hampshire is making progress in offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine, with a focus on floating wind turbines. Key highlights include:
- **Lease Process**: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is expected to finalize leases by the end of 2024, with extensive stakeholder input.
- **Technological Challenges**: Floating turbines and DC transmission cables are required due to the Gulf of Maine’s depth and distance.
- **State Coordination**: New Hampshire is working with state agencies to mitigate impacts on fisheries and ensure local benefits.
- **Procurement Differences**: Unlike neighboring states, New Hampshire lacks renewable energy procurement mandates, limiting its involvement in offshore wind development.

---

#### **Air Quality Monitoring and Environmental Regulations**
The state operates 13 air quality monitoring stations, tracking pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. Efforts include:
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Investments in new technologies to streamline operations.
- **Regional Collaboration**: Coordination with other New England states and federal agencies to address air pollution.
- **Enforcement**: A robust air permitting program with about 700 permitted sources, focusing on compliance and enforcement.

---

#### **Public Health and Environmental Issues**
The Department of Environmental Services (DES) addressed several public health and environmental concerns:
- **PFAS Contamination**: The state has enforceable drinking water standards for four PFAS compounds and is developing standards for soil and surface water. DES collaborates with federal agencies and research institutions to study and mitigate PFAS impacts.
- **Climate Action Plan**: New Hampshire received a $3 million federal grant to develop a Preliminary Climate Action Plan (PCAP), focusing on transportation, EV charging, weatherization, and workforce development.
- **Volkswagen Settlement**: The state is disbursing $30 million from the settlement, with 15% allocated for EV infrastructure.

---

#### **Key Takeaways and Next Steps**
- **Interconnection**: Continued stakeholder engagement and rulemaking are needed to address delays and improve processes for solar projects.
- **Offshore Wind**: Developers will begin detailed planning, with construction expected in about five years. New Hampshire will focus on workforce development and local economic benefits.
- **Environmental Compliance**: The state will maintain its high compliance standards and seek legislative adjustments to align with federal requirements.
- **Climate Initiatives**: Implementation of the PCAP and expansion of public transit programs, particularly in low-income areas, will be prioritized.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to advancing renewable energy, maintaining environmental standards, and addressing public health concerns, despite challenges in funding and stakeholder coordination. Committee members expressed appreciation for the detailed presentations and the efforts of state agencies in meeting aggressive timelines.
