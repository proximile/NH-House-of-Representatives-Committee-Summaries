The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee met on March 6, 2024, to discuss several bills. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **House Bill 17 FN (Remote Work)**: The committee voted to recommend an interim study for this bill, which addresses the complexities of remote work and whether a home qualifies as a workplace. Concerns were raised about the implications of labeling a home as a workplace, such as inventorying toxic materials in a home garage. The committee felt further discussion was needed to address these unique challenges.

2. **House Bill 1051 (Restaurant Wage Deductions)**: The committee voted "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) on this bill, which sought to prohibit certain wage deductions for restaurant employees. It was noted that the proposed changes were already covered under existing statutes, making the bill redundant.

3. **House Bill 1110 (E-Verify System)**: The committee also voted ITL on this bill, which aimed to require the use of the E-Verify system for employment verification. Concerns were raised about the system's reliability, particularly for individuals with short last names, and the burden it places on employers to verify immigration status.

4. **House Bill 1201 (Deceased Employee Payments)**: The committee voted "ought to pass" (OTP) on this bill, which increases the amount an employer can pay directly to a deceased employee's survivor from $300 to $3,000. The bill was deemed prudent, with safeguards to prevent complications in probate.

5. **House Bill 1246 (Payment in Gold and Silver)**: After an amendment to make payment in gold and silver voluntary failed, the committee voted ITL on the original bill. Concerns were raised about the practicality of using commodities with fluctuating values for wage payments.

6. **House Bill 1519 (Minor Work Hours)**: The committee voted ITL on this bill, which aimed to address minor work hours. It was determined that existing laws already cover the distinctions between different age groups, making the bill unnecessary.

7. **House Bill 1648 (Electronic Pay Cards)**: The committee voted ITL on this bill, which sought to allow electronic pay cards as a default payment method. Concerns were raised about fees associated with pay cards and the potential burden on low-wage workers. The committee felt the current system, which allows for checks and direct deposit, works well for most employees.

Throughout the meeting, the committee emphasized the importance of thoughtful consideration of each bill's impact on employers, employees, and the broader community. The chair encouraged members to submit their blurbs for the bills promptly to ensure timely reporting.
