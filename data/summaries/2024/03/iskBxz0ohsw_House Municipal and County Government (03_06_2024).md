- **Provisions**: The bill mandates competitive bidding, a two-thirds delegation vote, and a qualified appraisal to ensure fair market value.

- **Purpose**: To update RSA 53B, allowing political subdivisions to use contracted services for waste disposal, streamline bill payments, and address budget overruns due to unforeseen circumstances.

- **Outcome**: The bill was discussed but no final vote was recorded in the transcript.

#### **5. HB 1180 - Homestead Exemption**

- **Outcome**: The committee emphasized the need for clear and precise legislation to avoid unintended consequences.

#### **10. HB 1317 - Tax Abatements**
