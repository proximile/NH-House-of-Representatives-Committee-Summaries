The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Municipal and County Government Committee convened on March 6, 2024, to discuss and vote on several key bills and amendments. The meeting highlighted themes of transparency, local control, fiscal responsibility, and governance. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions and actions taken:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 1124: Conflicts of Interest in Local Government**  
   The committee discussed and passed HB 1124, which aims to limit conflicts of interest in local government positions. The bill prohibits individuals from holding multiple conflicting roles, such as being a selectman and a department head simultaneously. Amendments emphasized the need for transparency and checks and balances in local governance. An executive session was held to clarify roles, particularly regarding town managers and tax collectors.

2. **HB 1460: Sale or Lease of County-Owned Property**  
   Representative Anita Burrow presented HB 1460, which establishes a process for selling or leasing county-owned property. The bill was prompted by the sale of a historic Carroll County courthouse for $1, raising concerns about transparency and public input. It requires appraisals, public notice, and opportunities for public comment to ensure fair and transparent transactions.

3. **HB 1414: Gunstock Area Commission and Financial Oversight**  
   The committee debated HB 1414, which initially included provisions for video recording and financial transparency at the Gunstock ski resort. An amendment proposed requiring a forensic audit every five years, but the committee voted against it, arguing that the existing annual audit is sufficient. The bill passed with a vote of 15 to 5, focusing on maintaining oversight without additional bureaucratic burdens.

4. **HB 101: Masonic Lodges Property Tax Exemption**  
   The House debated HB 101, which seeks to exempt Masonic lodges from property taxes. Supporters highlighted the community services provided by lodges, while opponents expressed concerns about setting a precedent that could shift the tax burden to residential property owners. The bill passed with a vote of 17 to 3.

5. **HB 1223: Charitable Gaming and Historical Horse Racing**  
   Representative Rochford introduced HB 1223, which allows municipalities to vote on permitting historical horse racing machines and games of chance. The bill aims to provide local control similar to the existing option for keno. Discussions focused on the potential impact on communities and the gambling industry, with the committee recommending further refinement of the amendment.

6. **HB 1181: Solid Waste Districts**  
   Representative Dan Veu presented HB 1181, which proposes administrative updates to RSA 53b regarding Solid Waste Districts. The bill allows political subdivisions to use contracted incinerators, designates members to sign off on invoices, and addresses unanticipated expenses like those arising from COVID-19. Concerns were raised about third-party contracts and financial implications.

7. **HB 1180: Homestead Exemption**  
   The committee discussed HB 1180, which relates to the scope of the homestead exemption. A potential amendment was proposed to clarify that both spouses must be named on the deed to claim the exemption. The committee voted 18-1 to recommend killing the bill (ITL).

8. **HB 1101: Housing Crisis Study Committee**  
   Representative Ellen Reed introduced HB 1101, which proposes a study committee to explore a state loan program for moderate-income homebuyers and student loan consolidation. The goal is to address the state’s housing crisis and make homeownership more accessible. The committee discussed the feasibility and potential impact of the program.

### **Local Option for Gambling Facilities**  
The committee focused on an amendment allowing municipalities to decide whether to permit gambling facilities, such as casinos and historic horse racing machines, within their towns. Discussions highlighted concerns about addiction, economic impacts, and the importance of local control. Testimonies from stakeholders emphasized the need for local input to protect community welfare. The committee recommended further collaboration to refine the amendment and address technical and legal issues.

### **Executive Session Scheduling**  
Due to a backlog of approximately 26 bills, the chair outlined a plan to address multiple bills in executive sessions between hearings. Remaining executive bills were scheduled for discussion the following Monday, with overflow items to be addressed the subsequent Wednesday.
