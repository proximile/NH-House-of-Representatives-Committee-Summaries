**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (March 15, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened on March 15, 2024, to evaluate the state’s pandemic response strategies, with a focus on the effectiveness of measures such as masking, social distancing, lockdowns, school closures, and vaccination policies. The meeting featured a detailed presentation by Steven Petty, a certified industrial hygienist and expert on exposure control and personal protective equipment (PPE), who critiqued many of the widely implemented COVID-19 protocols and advocated for alternative, evidence-based solutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **Critique of Masking and Social Distancing**
Steven Petty argued that masking and social distancing lacked scientific support and were ineffective in controlling COVID-19 transmission. Key points included:
- **Mask Ineffectiveness**: Petty cited studies, including the Cochrane review, showing that masks (surgical and N95) made little to no difference in preventing COVID-19 transmission. He emphasized that masks cannot effectively filter aerosolized viral particles, likening their efficacy to stopping a BB with a soccer net. He also noted that masks can amplify bacteria and mold, potentially weakening the immune system.
- **Social Distancing**: The 6-foot rule was criticized as arbitrary and unsupported by scientific evidence. Petty referenced a study from China showing that proximity to fresh air sources, rather than distance, influenced infection rates.
- **Harm to Children**: Masking in schools was shown to cause significant harm to children’s learning, psychological development, and emotional well-being, with no measurable reduction in COVID-19 transmission.

### **Advocacy for Engineering Controls**
Petty emphasized that engineering controls, rather than masking or social distancing, are the most effective way to mitigate airborne pathogens like COVID-19. He highlighted:
- **Ventilation and Air Filtration**: Improving HVAC systems, increasing fresh air intake, and using technologies like bipolar ionization and UVC light can significantly reduce viral transmission.
- **Cost and Feasibility**: Implementing these solutions in schools and other buildings is relatively affordable and avoids the negative side effects of masking and lockdowns.
- **Hierarchy of Controls**: Petty stressed prioritizing engineering controls over administrative measures like masking and social distancing, which he argued are less effective.

### **Critique of Public Health Guidance and Lockdowns**
The committee expressed concerns about the collateral damage caused by lockdowns and inconsistent public health messaging. Key points included:
- **Lockdown Efficacy**: There was no clear evidence that lockdowns reduced COVID-19 transmission. Instead, they disproportionately harmed the working class and children, while the wealthy were less impacted.
- **Collateral Damage**: Lockdowns and school closures led to severe mental health issues, delayed cancer screenings, increased opioid overdoses, and significant learning loss. Petty emphasized the importance of considering long-term public health impacts beyond COVID-19.
- **Public Trust**: Frequent changes in public health guidance, such as the CDC’s shifting stance on masking, undermined public trust. Petty criticized the promotion of non-scientific measures that diverted resources from more effective solutions.

### **Targeted Protection and International Comparisons**
Petty and the committee advocated for a targeted approach to pandemic response, focusing on high-risk populations while minimizing harm to younger, lower-risk groups. Highlights included:
- **Focus Protection**: Protecting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, while allowing younger individuals to live normally, was presented as a more effective strategy than broad lockdowns.
- **International Examples**: Sweden and Florida were cited as regions that avoided strict lockdowns and focused on protecting high-risk groups. Sweden, in particular, showed no significant increase in COVID-19 deaths among children and minimal learning loss.
- **Vaccination Strategies**: Prioritizing the elderly for vaccination was crucial in reducing mortality rates. Petty criticized the U.S. for not focusing enough on vaccinating high-risk groups initially.

### **COVID-19 Mortality and Data Analysis**
The committee reviewed COVID-19 mortality data, emphasizing the importance of age-adjusted analysis and transparency:
- **Age-Adjusted Mortality**: New Hampshire had one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates in the U.S., largely due to its effective vaccination strategies and older population. However, mortality among younger age groups (15-44) increased over time, raising concerns about societal loss.
- **Excess Mortality**: Excess mortality was highest among older populations but also affected younger individuals, highlighting the complex impacts of the pandemic.
- **PCR Testing Concerns**: Potential false positives in PCR testing may have inflated COVID-19 case numbers, complicating data interpretation.

---

### **Lessons for Future Pandemics**
The committee concluded with recommendations for improving future pandemic responses:
- **Evidence-Based Solutions**: Prioritizing science-based measures like engineering controls and targeted protection, rather than broad lockdowns and masking.
- **Transparency and Trust**: Clear, honest communication from public health officials is essential to maintain public trust. Acknowledging uncertainties and limitations is critical.
- **Educational and Health Priorities**: Ensuring schools remain open and addressing learning gaps should be a priority in future pandemics. Remote learning should be a last resort, as in-person instruction is most effective for student success.

---

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to invite additional experts, including the Homeland Security director and Dr. Chan, to future meetings. The next session was scheduled for March 29, 2024, with a focus on further reviewing COVID-19 data and policies.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for a more targeted, evidence-based approach to pandemic response, emphasizing the importance of engineering controls, protecting vulnerable populations, and minimizing collateral damage. The committee’s discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing public health measures with societal well-being and the critical role of transparency in maintaining public trust.
