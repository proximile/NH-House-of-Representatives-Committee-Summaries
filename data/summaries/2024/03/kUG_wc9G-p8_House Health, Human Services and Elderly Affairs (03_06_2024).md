#### **Healthcare Access and Services**
1. **HB 1028 (Mental Health Services for Individuals with Disabilities):**
   - An amendment clarified eligibility for mental health services for individuals with co-occurring intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses, ensuring they are not denied services solely because their symptoms stem from a disability. The amendment passed unanimously (20-0).

2. **HB 1568 (Medicaid Reimbursement for Non-Transport Emergency Services):**

   - The bill extends the time frame for parents to surrender infants safely. An amendment proposed removing a clause preventing law enforcement from using evidence of abuse found on surrendered infants.
