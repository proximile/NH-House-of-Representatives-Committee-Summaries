### **Key Issues and Discussions**

#### **1. Climate Change Education (HR30)**
- **Student Testimony**: A student, Sarah Wiro, highlighted the need for climate change education, emphasizing that students feel helpless about its impacts on agriculture, the economy, and lifestyles.
- **Debate**: Representatives debated whether the resolution should present a balanced view of climate science, including disagreements about human impact versus natural factors like sunspots or volcanic activity. Some argued that the resolution’s language about fossil fuel companies engaging in misinformation campaigns was politically charged.
- **Amendment and Vote**: An amendment to remove contentious language and provide a more balanced historical context passed with a 10-10 vote. The resolution, as amended, also passed 10-10 and moved forward.

#### **2. Special Education Services in Charter Schools (HB1476)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposed adjusting the deadline for Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between charter schools and resident districts for special education services from the start of the school year to November 1.
- **Challenges**: The current July deadline was deemed impractical because charter schools often lack staff in the summer, and districts may not know which students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are attending charter schools until enrollment data is collected in October.
- **Student Impact**: Concerns were raised about potential delays in service provision, but it was clarified that districts are legally obligated to provide services regardless of MOU status.
- **Timing Debate**: Some suggested aligning the MOU deadline with October 1 enrollment data collection to ensure smoother implementation.

#### **3. Transgender Athletes in Women’s Sports (HB1205)**
- **Bill Overview**: HB1205 sought to restrict transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports at the middle and high school levels. Amendment 0973 narrowed the scope to exclude elementary and collegiate sports and emphasized biological sex based on birth certificates.
- **Arguments in Favor**: Supporters argued the bill protects female athletes from unfair competition and ensures safety, citing examples of transgender athletes outperforming female peers and causing injuries.
- **Arguments Against**: Opponents called the bill discriminatory, emphasizing the challenges faced by transgender youth and the lack of evidence of widespread harm. They also criticized the bill’s punitive measures, including civil action against schools or athletes who violate the law.
- **Co-Ed Sports**: Some representatives suggested co-ed sports as a potential solution to balance inclusivity and fairness.
- **Emotional Testimonies**: Personal stories, including a letter from a parent of a transgender athlete, highlighted the emotional impact of the bill.

#### **4. Voter Registration for High School Students**
- **Bill Redundancy**: Some representatives argued that the bill was unnecessary, as existing statutes already address voter registration and civics education.
- **Civics Education**: The importance of civics education was emphasized, with references to existing laws requiring the distribution of the State Constitution and election laws to history and civics teachers.
- **Amendment**: An amendment removed private schools from the bill and prohibited voter registration from being a graded assignment or course requirement. It focused on informing students about voter registration rather than assisting them in filling out forms.
- **Debate**: Concerns were raised about potential political bias in school-based voter registration efforts and the role of schools versus parental responsibility in fostering civic engagement.

#### **5. Other Education-Related Bills**
- **HB1592 (Education Freedom Accounts and Religious Schools)**: The committee debated the use of Education Freedom Account funds in religious schools, with concerns about disregarding Supreme Court rulings. The motion to recommend the bill as inexpedient to legislate (ITL) passed.
- **HB1625 (School Health Services)**: The committee discussed removing the requirement for school nurses to be certified through the State Board of Education and recommended an interim study.
- **HB1650 (Alternative Programs for Granting Credits)**: The bill requiring programs to comply with anti-discrimination laws faced disagreement, with motions to recommend ITL and OTP both failing.
- **HB1654 (Review of EFA Service Providers)**: The bill requiring annual reviews of Education Freedom Account service providers for compliance with anti-discrimination laws also saw motions to recommend ITL and OTP fail.
