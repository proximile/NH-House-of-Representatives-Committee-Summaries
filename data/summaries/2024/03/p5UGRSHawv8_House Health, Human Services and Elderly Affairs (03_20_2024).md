### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (March 20, 2024)

The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on March 20, 2024, to discuss and debate several bills and amendments related to healthcare, patient rights, and elderly care. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance patient safety, ethical considerations, and practical implementation in legislative efforts. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. House Bill 1300: "Right to Try" Legislation**
- The committee considered an amendment to align state law with federal "right to try" legislation, which allows patients with life-threatening conditions to access investigational drugs, biologics, or devices. 
- The amendment aimed to remove state-level restrictions conflicting with federal law and provide protections for healthcare providers. 
- The committee voted **20-0** to pass the amendment, emphasizing the importance of compassionate care for patients with limited treatment options.

#### **2. House Bill 1585: Medication Administration in Assisted Living Facilities**
- The committee discussed an amendment addressing the administration of injectable medications by Certified Medication Assistants (CMAs) in residential care facilities. 
- The amendment clarified the use of pre-filled, self-administered auto-injectors (e.g., EpiPens) to minimize errors, while medications requiring precise measurement or mixing (e.g., drawing from a vial) were deemed too complex for CMAs. 
- The committee emphasized the need for flexibility in rule-making to define CMA responsibilities rather than embedding strict limitations in statute. 
- The amendment passed **20-0**, and the bill was recommended to proceed to the House floor without further amendments at this stage.

#### **3. House Bill 16007: Safe Haven Law and Baby Boxes**
- The committee debated an amendment to the "safe haven" law, which allows parents to surrender newborns anonymously. 
- The amendment aimed to extend the surrender period from 5 to 60 days and provide immunity from criminal prosecution for parents using "baby boxes" (safe, monitored drop-off points). 
- Supporters argued the extension would save lives by giving parents more time to make a difficult decision, especially in cases of postpartum crisis or lack of support. 
- Opponents raised concerns about potential abuse or neglect during the extended period, the lack of a "warm handoff," and the endorsement of a specific company’s product. 
- The amendment passed **20-0**, but the underlying bill faced mixed opinions. Ultimately, the bill failed to pass (9-11), and a motion for interim study was approved **19-1** to refine the bill and address concerns.

#### **4. House Bill 1280: Informed Consent in Medical Practices**
- The committee debated a bill focused on mandating informed consent processes in medical practices. 
- Concerns were raised about the state adding bureaucratic burdens to healthcare providers, particularly in a state already struggling to recruit healthcare professionals. 
- Some representatives argued that existing ethical guidelines and administrative rules already address informed consent, while others emphasized the importance of prioritizing patient rights. 
- The bill’s narrow focus on physicians, excluding other healthcare providers like nurse practitioners and dentists, was also criticized. 
- The committee voted **10-10** on whether to pass the bill, resulting in it being sent to the House with **no recommendation**. A subsequent motion to move the bill to interim study also resulted in a **10-10 tie**, meaning the bill will proceed to the House without further committee action.

#### **5. HP 1067: Access to Sterilization Procedures**
- The bill sought to prevent physicians from denying hysterectomies or sterilizations based on assumptions about a patient's desire for future children. It also required referrals to willing providers and provided legal protection for doctors if patients later regretted their decision. 
- Concerns were raised about the bill being in the wrong section of law (Patient Bill of Rights) and the challenge of compelling doctors to perform procedures they were uncomfortable with. 
- The committee moved the bill to interim study **17-3** to address these issues and find a more workable solution.

#### **6. HB 1568: Reimbursement for Emergency Medical Responses**
- The committee briefly discussed this bill, which addressed reimbursement for emergency medical responses. 
- A motion for interim study passed, with the expectation that a more comprehensive Senate bill (SB 409) would address the issue in greater detail.

### **Themes and Takeaways**

1. **Patient Safety and Rights**: Across all discussions, the committee emphasized the importance of protecting patient rights, ensuring informed consent, and providing compassionate care, particularly for vulnerable populations like newborns and patients with life-threatening conditions.

2. **Balancing Regulation and Efficiency**: There was a recurring tension between ensuring patient safety and avoiding overregulation that could burden healthcare providers or exacerbate administrative inefficiencies.

3. **Flexibility in Rule-Making**: The committee highlighted the need for flexibility in rule-making to address complex healthcare issues, particularly in areas like medication administration and informed consent.

4. **Interim Study as a Tool**: Several bills were moved to interim study to allow for further refinement and address unresolved concerns, reflecting the committee’s commitment to thoughtful and effective legislation.

5. **Ethical and Practical Considerations**: The discussions underscored the complexity of balancing ethical considerations (e.g., parental rights, patient autonomy) with practical challenges (e.g., healthcare provider shortages, administrative burdens).
