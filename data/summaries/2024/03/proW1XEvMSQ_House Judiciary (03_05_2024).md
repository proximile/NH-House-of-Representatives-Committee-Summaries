### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting (03/05/2024)

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened to discuss the legal and ethical implications of transferring or selling a deceased lawyer’s solo practice, as well as broader issues related to **House Bill 1082** (HB 1082), which aims to modify rules for **solo practice Professional Limited Liability Companies (PLLCs)**. The discussions centered on ensuring business continuity, preserving the value of professional practices, and safeguarding ethical and legal standards across professions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Continuity and Value of Solo Practices**
- **Deceased Lawyers’ Practices**: The committee acknowledged that a deceased lawyer’s solo practice retains value and can be sold, particularly if structured as a PLLC. The corporate structure of a PLLC facilitates continuity by allowing the practice to exist independently of the individual practitioner.
- **Broader Application**: While the discussion initially focused on legal practices, HB 1082 addresses challenges faced by all professions using the PLLC structure, including veterinary practices. The bill seeks to prevent the collapse of a practice when a solo practitioner dies or becomes incapacitated.

---

### **2. Ethical and Legal Concerns**
- **Professional Standards**: A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to ensuring that any transfer or sale of a practice complies with ethical guidelines and professional standards. Concerns were raised about non-professional managers (e.g., assistant managers) accessing sensitive client or patient information or overstepping into professional duties.
- **Confidentiality and Judgment**: Specific emphasis was placed on maintaining confidentiality and ensuring that only licensed professionals exercise professional judgment. The legal profession already has ethical guidelines for handling deceased attorneys’ practices, but other professions lack similar frameworks.
- **Avoiding Conflicts**: The committee stressed the importance of ensuring that HB 1082 does not conflict with existing laws or professional ethical standards.

---

### **3. Proposed Solutions and Amendments**
- **Assistant Manager’s Role**: HB 1082 proposes allowing an assistant manager to handle corporate and administrative tasks (e.g., paying bills, managing staff) but explicitly prohibits them from performing professional duties. Amendments were discussed to clarify this limited authority and prevent any infringement on professional responsibilities.
- **Drafting Amendments**: The committee agreed to draft amendments to address these concerns, ensuring the bill aligns with ethical and legal requirements. Key goals include:
  - Preserving the practice’s value for the estate.
  - Providing continuity for clients or patients.
  - Ensuring a licensed professional steps in for professional duties.
- **Expert Input**: Legal experts, such as Attorney John Cunningham, will be consulted to refine the language and ensure the amendments are sound.

---

### **4. Broader Implications**
- **Balancing Continuity and Ethics**: The discussions highlighted the complexity of balancing business continuity with professional ethics and responsibilities. The committee recognized the need for tailored solutions that respect the unique requirements of different professions.
- **Preventing Practice Collapse**: By allowing an assistant manager to temporarily maintain operations, the bill could prevent the collapse of a practice, preserving its value and providing time for a licensed professional to take over.

---

### **5. Timeline and Next Steps**
- **Amendment Deadline**: The committee does not need to finalize the amendments immediately but aims to complete them by March 13th. Drafts will be circulated for input and reviewed by legal experts.
- **Interim Study**: If consensus is not reached before the legislative crossover deadline, the committee discussed the possibility of an interim study to further refine the bill.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of addressing the challenges faced by solo practitioners and their practices in a way that upholds ethical and legal standards while ensuring business continuity. The committee committed to refining the amendments to HB 1082 and presenting them for further review, with a focus on preserving the integrity of professional practices across various fields.
