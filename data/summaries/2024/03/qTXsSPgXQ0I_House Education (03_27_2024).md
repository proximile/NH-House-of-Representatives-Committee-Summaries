**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on March 27, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 27, 2024, addressed several key initiatives related to education and disability programs, focusing on improving support for individuals with disabilities, addressing teacher shortages, and enhancing educational leadership and communication. The meeting covered the following major topics:

### **New Hampshire ABLE Plan**
The meeting began with a discussion of the **New Hampshire ABLE Plan**, a program designed to help individuals with disabilities save money without jeopardizing their eligibility for benefits like Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Key points included:
- **Program Overview**: The ABLE Plan allows individuals with disabilities (onset by age 21) to open accounts in their own names, contributing up to $18,000 annually (plus an additional $14,000 if employed). Funds can be used for qualified disability expenses, such as education, transportation, and basic living expenses.
- **Transition to a New Consortium**: New Hampshire has joined a new consortium of 19 states, led by Illinois, to manage the ABLE Plan, transitioning from the previous "Stable NH" program managed by Ohio.
- **Administrative Fees**: The program includes a $5 annual maintenance fee per account, with a portion returned to the state quarterly to support program promotion and administration.
- **Growth and Funding**: The state aims to grow the program from 104 accounts to 1,000 participants, potentially collecting $5,000 annually in fees to support program administration.
- **Legislative Changes**: The bill discussed removes restrictions on using general funds for the program, renames it to "New Hampshire ABLE Plan," and allows the state to accept additional funds through grants or gifts.
- **Promotion and Outreach**: The state treasurer and the Governor’s Commission on Disability are actively promoting the program to increase awareness and participation.

### **Education-Related Bills**
The meeting also focused on two significant education bills aimed at addressing teacher shortages and enhancing educational leadership:

1. **Senate Bill 217: Rural and Underserved Area Educator Incentive Program**
   - **Purpose**: To address the teacher shortage in rural and underserved areas by offering loan repayment for teachers who commit to working in these areas.
   - **Key Points**:
     - New Hampshire has approximately 104 rural school districts struggling to attract and retain teachers.
     - The program is modeled after a successful initiative in Idaho and was developed based on recommendations from the Commission to Study the Teacher Shortage.
     - Teachers who move between underserved districts can reapply but will not receive double loan repayments.
     - The bill currently has a $1 placeholder, with funding expected to be allocated in the upcoming budget.

2. **Senate Bill 521: Master Teacher Certification**
   - **Purpose**: To revise the requirements and fees for the Master Teacher Certification, making it more accessible and attractive to experienced teachers.
   - **Key Points**:
     - The certification, established in 1998, has seen limited use due to stringent requirements and a high application fee ($800).
     - The bill proposes reducing the fee to $100 for the initial application and $25 for annual renewal, and shifting to a competency-based portfolio model.
     - The certification recognizes teachers for their leadership, curriculum development, and mentoring roles, potentially aiding career advancement.
     - Local school districts would decide whether to reward certified teachers, as the certification does not guarantee salary increases.

### **Additional Education and Disability Initiatives**
The meeting also covered several other bills aimed at improving education and support for individuals with disabilities:

1. **Master Teacher License (SB 521)**:
   - The bill proposes the creation of a Master Teacher License for educators who have demonstrated teaching and leadership skills, allowing them to expand their impact without leaving the classroom.
   - The portfolio-based application process aims to document leadership contributions and improve student achievement.

2. **Communication of IEPs via Email (SB 340)**:
   - This bill allows parents to receive communications about Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) via email by default, with the option to request postal mail.
   - The change aims to speed up communication, save money, and ensure timely responses.

3. **CTE Representation on Education Professional Standards Board (SB 338)**:
   - The bill seeks to add a representative from Career and Technical Education (CTE) to the Education Professional Standards Board to address the unique credentialing and hiring requirements for CTE teachers.

4. **ABLE Savings Account Program Administrative Fund (SB 377)**:
   - This bill establishes a dedicated administrative fund for the ABLE Savings Account Program, ensuring that administrative costs are covered and the program continues to operate effectively.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the state’s commitment to supporting individuals with disabilities through the ABLE Plan and addressing critical issues in education, such as teacher shortages and the need for enhanced leadership and communication. Committee members expressed support for these initiatives, emphasizing their potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities and the educational outcomes for students across New Hampshire.
