**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee Meeting (03/19/2024)**

On March 19, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives, specifically the Election Law Committee, convened to address a range of legislative issues pertaining to election laws, campaign finance, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in political advertising. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance legislative efficiency with the thorough consideration of complex issues, emphasizing transparency, accuracy, and consistency in election processes.

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

1. **Primary Election Timing**:
   - The committee debated the proposal to move the state primary to June. Proponents argued that the change would address issues with the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) and reduce incumbent protection. However, concerns were raised about the increased burden on legislators, who would be campaigning while still in session, and the potential influx of out-of-state campaign funds. The motion to move the primary to June ultimately failed on a tied vote.

2. **Artificial Intelligence in Political Advertising**:
   - House Bill 1596, which requires disclosure of deceptive AI usage in political ads, was discussed. An amendment was introduced to align the bill with other AI-related legislation, ensuring cohesive definitions and bipartisan support. While the amendment passed, the bill itself failed on a tied vote. Critics argued that the bill could infringe on free speech and that existing laws or social media platforms' terms of service could address the issue. Supporters emphasized the need to protect voters from deceptive AI-generated content, particularly deep fakes, during the election cycle.

3. **House Bill 1091 (Campaign Finance Reform)**:
   - This bill, focusing on campaign finance reform, was amended and passed with unanimous support. The amendments addressed minor issues, including the definition of the election cycle and the effective date of the bill. Further adjustments were planned via a floor amendment to ensure the bill’s accuracy and effectiveness. The bill includes provisions for phasing in online reporting and introducing waivers for certain reporting requirements.

4. **Senate Bill 489 (Election Audits)**:
   - The committee discussed and unanimously recommended Senate Bill 489, which aims to continue and refine the election audit process initiated a few years ago. The bill incorporates lessons learned and ensures transparency and accuracy in election results, including enhancements such as marking ballots for audit tracking.

5. **Senate Bill 535 (Absentee Ballot Forms)**:
   - The committee considered Senate Bill 535, which aligns the absentee ballot request form with existing statutes regarding eligibility for absentee voting during winter storms. The bill was deemed redundant since a similar House bill (HB 1119) had already passed. The committee unanimously recommended the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

6. **Senate Bill 530 (Campaign Finance Reporting)**:
   - The committee discussed Senate Bill 530, which involves campaign finance reporting. The bill's language was incorporated into House Bill 1091, making it redundant. The committee unanimously recommended the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

7. **Senate Bill 380 (State Primary Date)**:
   - The committee discussed Senate Bill 380, which proposes moving the state primary date to June. Representative Brennan expressed concerns about the impact on local elections and the extended campaign season, advocating against the change. Despite these concerns, the committee unanimously recommended the bill as "ought to pass."

### Procedural Matters:
The committee addressed procedural issues, including the withdrawal of motions and amendments, to streamline the legislative process. Members expressed appreciation for the clerk’s hard work throughout the session.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the challenges of balancing legislative efficiency with the need for thorough consideration of complex issues like election timing, AI regulation, and campaign finance reform. The committee aimed to address these issues while respecting the time constraints and priorities of its members, ultimately striving to enhance transparency, accuracy, and consistency in election processes.
