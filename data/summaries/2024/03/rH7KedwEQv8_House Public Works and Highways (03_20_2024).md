**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (March 20, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on March 20, 2024, to discuss several key issues and legislative proposals, with a primary focus on highway noise mitigation, toll credits, and highway naming initiatives. The meeting highlighted both ongoing challenges and proposed solutions to address community concerns and honor public servants.

### **Key Discussions and Proposals**

#### **1. Sound Barriers and Noise Mitigation**
- **Effectiveness and Challenges**:  
  Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of sound barriers, particularly in areas like T-Berry Lane, where previous measures, such as stockade fences, had deteriorated and failed to adequately address noise issues. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is working on improvements, including constructing berms and more robust fences, though these are not comprehensive noise mitigation solutions.  
  Sound barriers are effective in reducing noise for homes closest to the barrier, typically by 12-15 decibels, but they do not eliminate highway noise entirely. Some residents expressed dissatisfaction, especially in areas where trees were removed during construction.  

- **Cost and Demand**:  
  The cost of sound barriers is significant, with estimates around $1 million per mile. The state has identified approximately 260 potential locations statewide needing noise barriers, with an estimated total cost of $760 million.  

#### **2. Toll Credits and Funding Mechanisms**
- **Decline in Toll Credits**:  
  New Hampshire uses toll credits to match federal funding for transportation projects. However, the state has seen a decline in toll credits from a peak of over $300 million in 2014 to about $186 million currently.  
  The state uses $40-50 million annually in toll credits to match federal funds, but the rate of usage exceeds the rate of accrual, raising concerns about future availability.  

- **Proposed Solutions**:  
  A proposed bill would allow the state to sell up to $10 million in toll credits annually to fund sound barrier projects, though the establishment of a toll credit marketplace is not yet federally authorized.  
  The bill aims to create a broader funding mechanism for noise mitigation projects but does not prioritize specific locations like T-Berry Lane.  

#### **3. Legislative Proposals**
- **Senate Bill 580**:  
  This bill seeks to address noise pollution by establishing a noise barrier construction fund, funded through the sale of toll credits. The fund would support noise barrier projects in areas heavily affected by highway noise, such as the T-Berry Lane neighborhood in Bedford. The committee heard testimony emphasizing the importance of improving residents' quality of life and will continue discussions on the bill.  

- **Senate Bill 470**:  
  This bill formalizes an existing practice allowing municipal vehicles with municipal plates to use toll-free transponders on state highways. The bill was introduced to codify this practice into law, ensuring clarity and continuity. The committee unanimously approved the bill.  

#### **4. Highway Naming Initiatives**
- **Senate Bill 468**:  
  This bill proposes designating a portion of Route 111 in Hudson as the "Senator Robert E. Clee Jr. Memorial Highway" in honor of the late Senator Robert Clee, who served in both the House and Senate and was a significant figure in New Hampshire politics. Testimonies highlighted Clee's extensive public service, mentorship, and community contributions. The committee unanimously voted in favor of the bill.  

- **Senate Bill 592**:  
  This bill seeks to rename a segment of Route 127 in Franklin as the "Officer Bradley Haas Memorial Highway" in memory of Bradley Haas, a former Franklin police chief and veteran who was killed in a shooting at the New Hampshire Hospital. Family members and colleagues shared heartfelt testimonies about Haas's dedication to public service. The committee decided to delay the vote to allow for family attendance and further review.  

### **Challenges and Future Concerns**
- The DOT faces challenges in maintaining sound barriers and meeting the maintenance of effort requirements to claim toll credits.  
- The committee discussed the need for new funding sources to address the growing demand for noise mitigation projects, given the limited availability of toll credits.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene to address the bills further, pending additional information and the scheduling of executive sessions. Committee members expressed support for honoring public servants and addressing community concerns, with a focus on fiscal responsibility and practical solutions.
