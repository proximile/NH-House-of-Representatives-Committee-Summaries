The New Hampshire House of Representatives, specifically the House Ways and Means Committee, convened on March 11, 2024, to discuss and vote on a range of bills addressing issues such as affordable housing, education funding, timber taxation, animal welfare, and healthcare funding. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Affordable Housing and Real Estate Transfer Tax**
- **SB 454**: This bill proposed increasing the allocation from the real estate transfer tax for affordable housing from $5 million to $10 million. With New Hampshire facing a severe housing shortage, nonprofits and housing developers emphasized the critical need for additional funding to address the crisis. The committee discussed the bill’s potential to stretch federal resources and support various housing projects, with no significant opposition noted. Additionally, representatives clarified that the Affordable Housing Fund operates more as a subsidy than a revolving fund, with most funds reserved for long-term affordability projects.
- **Real Estate Transfer Tax Distribution**: Representatives also discussed the distribution of real estate transfer tax revenues, with 33% allocated to the education trust fund and the remainder to the general fund. Concerns were raised about declining revenues and their impact on public school funding, highlighting the interconnectedness of housing stability, education, and workforce development.

### **Education Funding and Property Taxes**
- **HB 514**: This bill addressed the redistribution of excess property taxes (swept funds) from donor towns to the state education trust fund. The committee debated the bill’s timing, as related litigation is still pending in the courts, and leaned toward placing it in interim study to allow for further consideration.
- **HB 1563**: This bill proposed eliminating the statewide property tax (swept tax) from tax bills while maintaining a local contribution within the education aid formula. Acknowledging its potential to simplify funding discussions, the committee also recommended interim study to align with broader education funding reforms.

### **Timber Taxation**
- **SB 514**: This bill aimed to simplify timber tax calculations for small-scale operations by increasing personal use exemptions (e.g., firewood, wood chips) and clarifying language around equivalent measures. While the fiscal impact on municipalities was deemed negligible, concerns were raised about potential abuse of exemptions. Proponents argued the bill would reduce administrative burdens for small landowners and contractors.
- **Timber Processing and Taxation**: Representatives discussed the complexities of timber tax calculations and the minimal revenue generated from small-scale operations. The bill focused on land conversion (e.g., clearing for construction) rather than forest management, with support for reducing administrative inefficiencies.

### **Animal Welfare**
- **SB 363**: This bill sought to ban simulcast betting on greyhound racing, aligning with New Hampshire’s 2010 ban on live greyhound racing due to animal welfare concerns. Supporters highlighted the inhumane practices in greyhound racing, while opponents argued the ban would harm local businesses without impacting racing elsewhere. The committee considered the bill’s economic impact and suggested further study.

### **Healthcare Funding**
- **SB 497 (DISH Fund)**: This bill proposed creating a dedicated account for the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DISH) Fund to streamline the distribution of funds to hospitals serving uninsured or Medicaid patients. Representatives sought clarity on the fund’s mechanics, including the role of federal audits and the redistribution process. The program was described as cost-neutral to the state, ensuring hospitals are compensated for uncompensated care.

### **Unclaimed Funds and Scholarships**
- **Historic Horse Racing and Unclaimed Tickets**: A bill was discussed to streamline the process for unclaimed horse racing and historic horse racing tickets. The proposal would redirect unclaimed funds to the Governor’s Scholarship Fund, providing more predictable funding for New Hampshire students attending in-state colleges. Legal concerns were raised about whether these funds are subject to the same constitutional restrictions as lottery revenues, which must fund education.

### **Other Key Bills**
- **SB 324**: This bill required the Lottery Commission to notify licensed distributors of Lucky 7 tickets when their licenses expire or are revoked. The committee agreed to refine the language to address concerns about the 45-day notification requirement for monthly licenses.
- **SB 513**: This bill allowed nonprofit organizations to conduct charity auctions using licensed auctioneers without holding the auctioneer liable for the items sold. Concerns were raised about the bill’s language and its implications for auctioneer licensing and liability.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Animal Welfare**: SB 363 highlighted concerns about the inhumane treatment of greyhounds in racing.
- **Economic Impact**: Bills like SB 363, SB 454, and SB 514 sparked discussions about their economic implications, including impacts on local businesses, housing development, and municipal revenues.
- **Legislative Process**: The committee emphasized the importance of refining language, avoiding conflicts with existing statutes, and considering the practical effects of proposed legislation.
- **Interconnected Issues**: Discussions underscored the interconnectedness of housing stability, education funding, and workforce development, emphasizing the need for comprehensive solutions.

The meeting concluded with plans to refine and vote on the bills, with a focus on balancing policy goals with economic and practical considerations. Several bills were recommended for interim study to allow for further deliberation and alignment with ongoing litigation and broader funding reforms.
