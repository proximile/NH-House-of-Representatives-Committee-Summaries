**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Ways and Means, March 5, 2024)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on March 5, 2024, focused on several key legislative bills and issues, with a particular emphasis on addressing the childcare workforce crisis, financial reforms, and administrative adjustments. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

---

### **Childcare Workforce Crisis (HB 1611 and Related Discussions)**

1. **Workforce Shortages and Economic Impact**:
   - The childcare sector in New Hampshire is facing a severe staffing crisis, resulting in empty classrooms, long waitlists, and parents being forced to leave the workforce or rely on unsafe childcare options.
   - The average wage for childcare workers ($13.78/hour as of 2022) has not kept pace with inflation, leading many workers to leave for higher-paying jobs in retail or fast food.

2. **Proposed Solutions**:
   - A dedicated fund (HB 1611) is being proposed to increase childcare wages by approximately $5/hour, aiming to make the sector competitive with neighboring states like Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts.
   - The fund would support benefits such as health insurance and tuition assistance to retain and attract workers.
   - Funding sources could include federal block grants, state appropriations (e.g., a recent $15 million childcare workforce grant), or third-party administration via voucher systems.

3. **Challenges and Next Steps**:
   - Concerns were raised about the administrative complexity of the proposed system, including how funds would be allocated and whether individual employees could apply directly if employers do not participate.
   - The committee plans to hold work sessions and executive sessions to refine the funding mechanism and address logistical challenges.

### **Financial and Tax Reforms (HB 1517)**

1. **Use of Excess Gaming Revenue**:
   - HB 1517 proposes using excess funds from games of chance (over $6.6 million) to reduce the state's $363 million "swept" calculation, which affects property taxes.
   - Concerns were raised about the clarity of the bill, particularly regarding the date range for payments and the calculation of excess funds.

2. **Fiscal Impact**:
   - The Department of Revenue provided a fiscal note but did not take a position on the bill, emphasizing the need for specific information to perform accurate calculations.

---

### **Food Safety and Licensing (HB 1565)**

1. **Regulatory Changes**:
   - HB 1565 would allow producers of acidified foods (e.g., pickles, salsa) to operate without a food license, potentially reducing state revenue by $10,000 annually.
   - Testimonies highlighted the risks of allowing high-risk foods to be made in home kitchens without proper licensing, which could increase expenditures due to foodborne illness investigations.

### **Occupational Licensing and Administrative Adjustments**

1. **HB 1410: Medical Technician Registration**:
   - This bill addresses dysfunctional registration requirements for medical technicians by eliminating the need for registration, as the board overseeing it is unable to function.
   - The fiscal impact is minor, and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification confirmed they could absorb the revenue reduction.

2. **HB 1655: Criminal History Record Checks**:
   - This bill adds responsibilities to the Department of Education, including processing criminal history record checks for school employees.
   - Representative Fellows suggested that part of the bill might be unnecessary, as it involves creating a new dedicated fund that already exists.

---

### **Holiday Operations and Revenue (HB 1198)**

1. **State Liquor Commission Stores**:
   - HB 1198 allows the State Liquor Commission to open stores on Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, which are currently closed.
   - The bill is enabling legislation, giving the Commission discretion to open stores on these days, with potential fiscal benefits including increased revenue.
   - Concerns were raised about labor costs, as employees would be paid time-and-a-half for working on holidays.

---

### **Estate Funds and Agricultural Definitions**

1. **HB 1303: Disposition of Estate Funds**:
   - This bill directs funds from the estate of a deceased individual who died without a will to the DHHS Refugee and Resettlement Office.
   - The Department of Justice explained that the probate judge recommended legislative action to direct the funds to a charitable purpose.

2. **HB 1293: Agricultural Definitions**:
   - This bill involves agricultural definitions and has no fiscal impact, according to the fiscal note.

### **Overall Themes and Next Steps**

The meeting highlighted the urgent need to address the childcare workforce crisis through targeted funding and policy changes, while also addressing financial reforms, food safety regulations, and administrative adjustments. The committee emphasized the importance of refining funding mechanisms, clarifying legislative language, and addressing potential fiscal impacts. Work sessions and executive sessions are planned to further discuss and finalize the bills.
