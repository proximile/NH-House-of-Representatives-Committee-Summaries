The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 13, 2024, focused on a range of significant legislative proposals, with particular attention to their financial implications, public health impacts, and regulatory frameworks. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions across all segments:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. PFAS Regulation (House Bill 1649)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to prohibit the sale or distribution of products containing intentionally added PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), such as cosmetics, food packaging, carpets, and juvenile products. The goal is to reduce environmental contamination and protect public health.
- **Background**: PFAS are persistent chemicals linked to cancer and other health issues, with significant contamination in communities like Merrimack, NH. Remediation costs are substantial, often in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.
- **Support**: The bill has broad support from environmental groups, waste management organizations, and public health advocates. It focuses on source reduction to prevent further contamination.
- **Fiscal Impact**: Amendments removed notification and labeling requirements, reducing administrative costs to around $250,000, primarily for oversight and enforcement.

#### **2. Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
- **Proposed Model**: The bill proposes a state-controlled cannabis market, initially limiting retail outlets to 15 stores. It includes provisions for public safety, revenue generation, and addressing past injustices related to cannabis prohibition.
- **Amendments**: Key amendments include a ban on lobbying and political contributions from cannabis entities, a $100 fine for first-time public consumption offenses, and integration of medical cannabis (ATC) with the adult-use market.
- **Financial Implications**: Startup costs are estimated at $8 million, with ongoing expenses for enforcement and rule-making. Revenue potential is significant, with projections of reclaiming 10-15% of cannabis sales currently going to neighboring states.
- **Public Health and Safety**: The bill emphasizes harm reduction, with funds allocated for treatment, prevention, and recovery. Penalties for public use are debated, with some advocating for stricter measures to address concerns about widespread cannabis odor and use.
- **Governance**: The Liquor Commission is proposed to oversee cannabis sales, with a preference for a franchise model over a state monopoly to avoid federal legal risks and ensure controlled rollout.

#### **3. Pension System Fix (House Bill 1647)**
- **Objective**: The bill aims to repair the pension system to make emergency service jobs more attractive and ensure a healthy pension system.
- **Concerns**: Ongoing costs to municipalities are estimated at $4 million annually, particularly for future hires who would receive better pensions under the new system.
- **Outcome**: A friendly amendment aligned the bill's appropriation with the fiscal note, and it passed unanimously.

#### **4. Veterans Treatment Court (House Bill 1589)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes the establishment of a veterans treatment court, modeled after successful drug courts, to provide alternative sentencing for veterans and reduce recidivism.
- **Concerns**: The potential $2 million annual cost and the need for additional probation officers were raised. The committee considered piloting the program in a few counties before statewide expansion.
- **Outcome**: The bill was tabled for further discussion.

#### **5. Digital Images of Ballots (House Bill 1577)**
- **Proposal**: The bill allows voters to view digital images of ballots from new ballot-counting devices.
- **Concerns**: Issues of privacy, vote buying, and the costs associated with memory cards and staffing were raised.
- **Outcome**: The bill was postponed for further discussion and potential amendments.

#### **6. Music Therapist Regulation (House Bill 1394)**
- **Amendment**: Representative McGuire proposed an amendment to reduce costs by not hiring a new employee for music therapist regulation, suggesting temporary or part-time help instead.
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed with unanimous support.

### **General Observations**
- **Financial Responsibility**: Across all discussions, legislators emphasized the importance of balancing financial implications with the intended benefits of proposed legislation.
- **Public Health and Environmental Protection**: Bills addressing PFAS contamination and cannabis legalization highlighted the need to protect public health and the environment while considering long-term financial impacts.
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: The focus on creating controlled, transparent regulatory frameworks, particularly for cannabis legalization, underscored the importance of cautious and well-planned implementation.

Overall, the meeting reflected a comprehensive approach to addressing significant public health, environmental, and financial issues through thoughtful legislative action.
