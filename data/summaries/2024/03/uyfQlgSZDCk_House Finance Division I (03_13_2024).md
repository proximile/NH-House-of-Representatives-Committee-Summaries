The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on March 13, 2024, addressed a wide range of legislative proposals, with a particular focus on financial impacts, policy implications, and public health concerns. The discussions centered on key bills related to pension reform, veterans' treatment courts, nuclear energy studies, PFAS regulation, cannabis legalization, and waste management. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Pension System and Veterans Treatment Court**
1. **House Bill 436 (Pension System)**:
   - The discussion focused on reducing unfunded liabilities in the state pension system, with an appropriation adjustment from $55.9 million to $53.6 million. The goal is to ensure a healthy pension system, particularly for emergency service workers, and to make these jobs more attractive.

2. **House Bill 1589 (Veterans Treatment Court)**:
   - The bill proposes establishing a Veterans Treatment Court to address legal issues specific to veterans, potentially reducing incarceration costs. Concerns were raised about the ongoing costs, estimated at $2 million annually, and the need for additional resources for the Department of Corrections. The court is seen as a cost-effective alternative to incarceration, focusing on rehabilitation and support for veterans.

### **Nuclear Energy Studies and Music Therapist Regulation**
1. **House Bill 1647 (Nuclear Energy Studies)**:
   - The bill, which passed the House with amendments, involves studies of nuclear energy technologies. The Department of Energy explained that the renewable energy fund, sourced from alternative compliance payments, would fund the proposed position. The discussion highlighted the dynamic nature of the renewable energy market and the potential impact on other renewable energy projects.

2. **House Bill 1394 (Music Therapist Regulation)**:
   - The bill, which passed the House with a close vote (194-186), was discussed with concerns about its fiscal impact. An amendment was proposed to reduce costs by eliminating a new employee position, suggesting part-time or overtime help instead. The amendment passed 6-3, with the proposer voting against it, citing opposition to the bill and unnecessary spending.

### **PFAS Regulation and Waste Management**
1. **House Bill 1649 (PFAS Regulation)**:
   - The bill aims to prohibit the sale or distribution of products containing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in New Hampshire. The discussion emphasized the severe health effects of PFAS, including links to cancer, and the significant costs associated with remediating PFAS contamination. The bill received strong support from various stakeholders, including the solid waste industry and public health advocates. A revised fiscal note is expected to provide a more accurate financial impact.

2. **Waste Management and PFAS Amendments**:
   - The discussion focused on the fiscal impact of amendments to the bill, particularly the removal of notification and labeling requirements for products containing PFAS. This significantly reduced the fiscal impact, with costs now estimated at under $10,000 annually. The bill aims to reduce PFAS exposure by banning these substances in certain products, with provisions for compliance monitoring and enforcement.

### **Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
1. **House Bill 1633 (Cannabis Legalization)**:
   - The bill proposes the legalization and regulation of cannabis, with a state-controlled model for oversight. Key provisions include a 15-store limit, a 10% agency fee instead of a tax, and restrictions on public consumption. The Liquor Commission would oversee cannabis regulation, with enforcement authority statewide. The bill requires $8 million in General Funds for initial implementation, with potential costs for rulemaking and enforcement.

2. **Franchise Model vs. State Monopoly**:
   - The discussion highlighted the debate between a franchise model and a state monopoly for cannabis distribution. Proponents of the franchise model argued that it would be easier to adjust if problems arise and would allow private businesses to operate with some state oversight. They also emphasized the importance of incorporating existing therapeutic cannabis businesses into the new legalization framework to avoid disrupting the current program.

3. **Revenue and Public Health**:
   - The potential revenue benefits of cannabis legalization were discussed, with proposals to direct funds towards education, substance abuse prevention, public safety, and behavioral health services. There was also a debate about whether the initial funding should come from the general fund or the liquor fund. Public health concerns were addressed, with testimony from individuals in recovery emphasizing the differences between cannabis and alcohol.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a careful and detailed approach to addressing complex issues, balancing financial impacts with policy goals and public health concerns. The discussions on pension reform, veterans' treatment courts, PFAS regulation, and cannabis legalization highlighted the importance of fiscal responsibility, public health protection, and effective policy implementation. The House Finance Division I will continue to review these bills, focusing on cost estimates, funding sources, and potential amendments to ensure they meet the needs of New Hampshire residents.
