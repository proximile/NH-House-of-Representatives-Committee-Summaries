The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on March 26, 2024, to address a range of critical issues, including education funding, cannabis legalization, child welfare, and environmental protection. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Education Funding (House Bill 1583)**
The committee reviewed **House Bill 1583**, focusing on a non-germane amendment that adjusts the state’s education funding formula. The amendment redefines "adequacy" in education funding to $7,335 per student, as recommended by a judge in the **ConVal education case**. Key components of the amendment include:
1. **Adequacy Adjustment**: Redefines local property taxes as "swept" funds, increasing state contributions by approximately $400 million.
2. **Appropriation Controls**: Caps school district budgets at levels approved in town meetings, with increases tied to the Consumer Price Index or a two-thirds legislative vote.
3. **Excess Swept Funds**: Requires districts with excess funds to remit them to the state’s educational trust fund.

**Key Concerns**:
- **Local Control**: Critics argued the amendment undermines local control by capping budgets and requiring districts to send excess funds to the state.
- **Taxpayer Impact**: Concerns were raised about potential property tax increases, particularly in "donor towns" that must remit excess funds.
- **Judicial Influence**: Questions were raised about the judiciary’s role in setting funding levels, with some suggesting it encroaches on legislative authority.
- **School Spending**: Concerns were voiced about wasteful spending in some districts, with examples of surplus funds being used for non-essential projects.
- **Charter Schools and EFAs**: The amendment increases funding for charter schools and addresses Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs), though some argued it doesn’t sufficiently control EFA growth.

The committee plans to hold a work session to further discuss the amendment and address administrative and policy concerns.

### **Cannabis Legislation (House Bill 1633)**
The committee debated **Amendment 2023-1633h**, which proposes a **franchise model** for cannabis retail, overseen by the state Liquor Commission. Key points include:
1. **Franchise Model vs. Free Market**: The amendment proposes a state-controlled franchise model, where the Liquor Commission sets prices, locations, and operational standards. Critics argue this stifles free enterprise and benefits wealthy investors, while supporters see it as a compromise that balances state control with private enterprise.
2. **Impact on Medical Cannabis**: The amendment imposes a 12.5% tax on medical cannabis, which advocates argue unfairly burdens vulnerable patients. It also excludes Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs) from retail licenses, potentially putting them out of business.
3. **Federal Legal Risks**: The franchise model could expose the state to federal legal risks, as cannabis remains illegal under federal law.
4. **Equity and Social Justice**: Concerns were raised about the amendment’s lack of equity provisions, which could exclude marginalized communities from participating in the industry.
5. **Funding for Public Health**: The amendment allocates 10% of cannabis revenue to substance abuse prevention and treatment, but advocates argue this is insufficient.

The debate highlights a divide between those favoring a state-controlled franchise model and those advocating for a free market approach. Critics argue the amendment is poorly designed, risks federal legal challenges, and fails to address key concerns like equity, public health, and medical cannabis access.

### **Child Welfare and Support**
Several bills related to child welfare and support were discussed:
1. **House Bill 1573**: Addressed the placement of children in out-of-state facilities, prompted by a concerning report from the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA). An amendment was adopted, reducing the fiscal note significantly and providing $1 million in discretionary funds to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The bill passed as amended.
2. **House Bill 1595**: Addressed co-parenting time and child support calculations. An amendment was adopted to make it compatible with another bill (HB 1564) without additional cost. The bill passed as amended.
3. **House Bill 1212**: Aimed to expand eligibility for free school meals. An "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) motion passed, arguing there was no evidence of children being denied food due to inability to pay.

### **Environmental Protection (House Bill 1649)**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1649**, which aims to prohibit the sale of products with intentionally added PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), often referred to as "forever chemicals." Key points include:
1. **Bill Overview**: The bill seeks to ban PFAS in various consumer products, effective January 1, 2027. The bill was refined in the Commerce Committee to address concerns about compliance and enforcement.
2. **Support for the Bill**: Proponents emphasized the health and environmental risks of PFAS, citing contamination incidents like the St. Gobain case in Merrimack, NH.
3. **Concerns and Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about the broad scope of the bill, which could ban thousands of useful chemical compounds. They argued that the bill could have unintended economic consequences and questioned the scientific basis for banning PFAS without considering dosage or specific risks.
4. **Amendment 1086**: The committee discussed an amendment to move the effective date of the ban to January 1, 2027, from July 2028. The amendment passed.
5. **Interim Study Motion**: A motion for an interim study to further examine the bill’s implications passed.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected ongoing efforts to address complex issues in education funding, cannabis legalization, child welfare, and environmental protection. The discussions highlighted tensions between local control and state oversight, the need for equitable solutions, and the importance of balancing public health and economic considerations. The committee plans to continue work on the discussed bills and prepare for the next session.
