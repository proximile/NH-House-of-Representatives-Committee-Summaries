### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on March 26, 2024

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on March 26, 2024, to discuss and vote on several key bills and amendments, with a focus on education funding, cannabis legislation, PFAS regulation, and other fiscal and policy matters. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Education Funding and House Bill 1583**
The House Finance Committee reviewed **House Bill 1583**, which includes a **non-germane amendment** addressing education funding adequacy. The amendment, based on the **ConVal education case**, proposes to increase the base cost per student to **$7,356** and includes three main provisions:
1. **Adequacy Adjustment**: Increases state contributions by redefining local contributions, raising the "sweep" (local tax revenue redirected to the state) by approximately **$400 million**.
2. **Appropriation Controls**: Caps school district budgets, requiring a **two-thirds vote** or inflation adjustments to exceed approved amounts.
3. **Excess Sweep Redistribution**: Requires **53 donor towns** to remit excess sweep funds to the state’s **Educational Trust Fund**.

**Key Discussion Points:**
- **Local Control Concerns**: Critics, including Representative Doug Hall, argued the spending cap undermines local control and could perpetuate disparities between districts.
- **Donor Town Impact**: Representatives like Mark Takoto highlighted the unfairness of redistributing property taxes from wealthier towns without accountability, potentially leading to **double taxation**.
- **Efficiency and Accountability**: Economist Jason Sens warned that redistribution could discourage fiscal responsibility in school districts.
- **Public Testimony**: Representative Kulum pointed to wasteful spending in her district, questioning the need for increased funding.

The committee plans to hold a **work session** to address these concerns, particularly the tension between **adequacy funding**, **local control**, and **taxpayer fairness**.

### **Cannabis Legislation and House Bill 1633**
The discussion on **House Bill 1633** focused on the **Maguire Amendment**, which proposes a **state-controlled franchise model** for cannabis sales. Key points included:

**Opposition to the Franchise Model:**
- Critics argued the model would **stifle small businesses**, harm **medical cannabis providers**, and conflict with New Hampshire’s values of **free enterprise** and **limited government intervention**.
- Concerns were raised about **federal legal risks**, as cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance.
- Medical cannabis providers opposed taxing medical cannabis at **12.5%**, fearing it would burden patients and undermine **Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs)**.

**Support for a Free-Market Approach:**
- Proponents of the original bill advocated for a **free-market model**, emphasizing **local control**, support for small businesses, and alignment with public health goals.

**Alternative Models:**
- Representative Leon proposed an **agency model**, allowing regulated but independent cannabis businesses, which was seen as a safer and more balanced approach.

The meeting revealed widespread opposition to the Maguire Amendment, with calls for a more deliberative process to ensure cannabis legislation aligns with New Hampshire’s values and legal framework.

### **PFAS Regulation and House Bill 1649**
The committee discussed **House Bill 1649**, which seeks to **ban products with intentionally added PFAS** (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) by **January 1, 2027**. Key points included:

**Support for the Bill:**
- Proponents, including Representative Eel and Representative Mooney, emphasized the **public health and environmental benefits** of reducing PFAS contamination, particularly in **Merrimack**.
- The bill has broad support from **clean water advocates**, **firefighters**, and **public health organizations**.

**Opposition Concerns:**
- Critics argued the bill’s definition of PFAS is **too broad**, potentially banning thousands of useful compounds.
- Concerns were raised about the **economic impact on industries**, **feasibility of enforcement**, and lack of **scientific evidence** for banning all PFAS compounds.

**Interim Study:**
