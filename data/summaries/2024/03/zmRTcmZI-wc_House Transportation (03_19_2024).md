The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on March 19, 2024, to discuss several bills and issues related to transportation, vehicle inspections, and public safety. The meeting focused on refining legislation to enhance safety, streamline processes, and address public concerns. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **SB 465 (Move Over Law Expansion):**  
   - The committee discussed expanding the state’s Move Over Law to include disabled vehicles, requiring motorists to slow down or move over when approaching any stopped or standing vehicle on the roadside.  
   - Testimony from the New Hampshire State Police, the Department of Transportation, and AAA Northern New England emphasized the bill’s importance in reducing accidents and fatalities.  
   - Concerns were raised about enforcement, practical implementation, and potential unintended consequences, such as unsafe lane changes. The committee explored ways to improve public awareness through signage and simplified messaging.

2. **SB 467 (Injury Prevention Decal Plates):**  
   - This bill authorizes the Injury Prevention Center to issue motor vehicle decal plates to raise awareness and funds for injury prevention programs.  
   - Abby Rogers from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) highlighted the significant impact of unintentional injuries, such as car crashes and overdoses, which are leading causes of death for those under 44 in New Hampshire.  
   - Funds from the decal plates would support programs like bike helmet distribution, life jacket loaner programs, and child passenger safety initiatives. The committee discussed funding sources, program expansion, and enforcement.

3. **SB 510 (Temporary Plates for Massachusetts Residents):**  
   - The bill seeks to repeal the requirement for New Hampshire car dealers to notify the DMV when selling a vehicle to a Massachusetts resident, allowing dealers to issue temporary plates.  
   - Currently, Massachusetts does not recognize New Hampshire temporary plates, creating logistical challenges. Senator Donovan Fenton and Dan Bennett from the New Hampshire Auto Dealers Association testified in support, framing it as a fairness and commerce issue.  
   - Concerns about potential risks for Massachusetts drivers were addressed by proposing disclaimers to inform customers.

4. **HB 1637 (Vehicle Inspection Standards):**  
   - The committee debated proposed changes to streamline vehicle inspection requirements, including:  
     - Allowing inspections to occur when a car is purchased rather than on the owner’s birth month.  
     - Removing requirements related to broken door latches and extending the correction period for inspection failures to 30 days.  
     - Eliminating the need to fail inspections due to cracked headlights, reflectors, or non-functional windows, provided they don’t impair safety.  
     - Addressing rust on brake components by focusing on pitting rather than rust alone.  
   - Key debates centered on cracks in headlights/tail lights, window functionality, and the subjectivity of inspection criteria. The committee adopted an amendment to clarify standards, and the bill was moved to the consent calendar with a unanimous vote.

5. **SB 429 (Executive Council License Plates):**  
   - The committee discussed allowing Executive Council license plates to return to their traditional blue and white design, deviating from the current red and green alternation.  
   - Supporters argued for consistency and historical practice, noting there would be no additional cost to implement this change.

### **Other Key Points**

- **Vehicle Inspection Concerns:**  
   Representatives expressed concerns about the complexity and subjectivity of vehicle inspection rules, particularly regarding cracked headlights and hazy headlight covers. The lack of clear guidance for inspection stations was highlighted, and the committee discussed the need for clearer guidelines to ensure consistency.

- **Public Hearings and Executive Sessions:**  
   The committee conducted public hearings on the bills and planned to reconvene in executive sessions to finalize amendments and recommendations. The challenges of coordinating with external companies and transmitting updates to inspection stations were also discussed.

- **Injury Prevention Advocacy:**  
   Senator Sue Prentis, the sponsor of SB 467, emphasized the importance of injury prevention, citing statistics on injury-related deaths and the economic impact. She dedicated her work to Elaine Frank, a longtime advocate for injury prevention, and highlighted the need for consistent funding to support prevention programs.

### **Next Steps**

The committee aimed to resume meetings after the crossover deadline on April 11, 2024, to address remaining Senate bills. The session underscored the challenges of updating vehicle inspection laws to reflect modern technologies while balancing public complaints and safety standards. The committee expressed gratitude to members and guests for their contributions to the discussions.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on improving public safety, streamlining processes, and addressing practical concerns related to transportation and vehicle inspections. Key bills like SB 465 and SB 467 aim to enhance roadside safety and fund injury prevention programs, while HB 1637 seeks to modernize and simplify vehicle inspection standards. The committee’s discussions and amendments reflect a commitment to balancing safety, fairness, and efficiency in transportation policies.
