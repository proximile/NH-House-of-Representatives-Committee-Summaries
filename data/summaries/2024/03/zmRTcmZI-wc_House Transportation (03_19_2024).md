  - **Cracked Headlights and Taillights**: The committee debated whether minor cracks should fail inspections, ultimately considering amendments to allow color-matched automotive lens tape for repairs.
  - **Brake Inspections**: Subjective criteria like “rust” were discussed, with a focus on measurable issues such as pitting or damage affecting braking performance.
  - **Window Functionality**: Concerns were raised about allowing vehicles with non-functioning windows to pass inspections, particularly regarding safety and emergency situations.
- **Amendments**: The committee unanimously adopted Amendment 2024-1222, which clarified language on fogging, clouding, or oxidation of headlights and removed references to windows and extensive brake pitting.

#### **Senate Bill 429 (Executive Council License Plates)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposed reverting Executive Council license plates to blue numbers and letters on a white background, aligning with historical practice.

- **Outcome**: The committee adjourned the hearing on SB 429 after supportive discussions.

#### **Senate Bill 467 (Injury Prevention Decal Plates)**
- **Purpose**: The bill authorized the Injury Prevention Center to issue motor vehicle decal plates to raise awareness and funds for injury prevention programs.
