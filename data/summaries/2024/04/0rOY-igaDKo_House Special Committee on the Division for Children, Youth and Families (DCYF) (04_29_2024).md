### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) Meeting (04/29/2024)

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) convened on April 29, 2024, to address systemic issues within DCYF and the broader family court system. The meeting highlighted critical concerns related to due process, accountability, federal funding influence, and the rights of families involved in child welfare cases. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes across the three segments:

---

### **Key Issues and Concerns**

1. **Due Process Violations**:
   - **Administrative Tribunals**: Testimony revealed that DCYF's administrative tribunals often find individuals guilty of abuse or neglect without proper notice or opportunity to defend themselves. Appeals are the first chance to present evidence, which critics argue violates constitutional due process.
   - **14th Amendment Protections**: The committee emphasized the importance of the 14th Amendment's due process clause, which guarantees notice, an opportunity to be heard, and an impartial tribunal. Concerns were raised about the lack of these protections in child welfare cases.
   - **State Comparisons**: The committee examined how states like Texas and New York handle due process, with Texas now requiring Child Protective Services to inform parents of their rights, akin to Miranda warnings.

2. **Weaponization of DCYF and Lack of Impartiality**:
   - **Family Court Bias**: Several speakers, including Eric Blair, shared personal experiences of DCYF being weaponized in contentious family court cases, particularly during divorces. False allegations and lack of accountability were recurring themes.
   - **Influence of Federal Funding**: The committee discussed how federal funding, particularly from the Adoptions and Safe Families Act of 1997, incentivizes prioritizing case volume over justice. This has led to a significant increase in child abuse cases and prolonged family court proceedings.

3. **Parental Rights and Voluntary Compliance**:
   - **Coercion vs. Compliance**: The committee debated the line between voluntary compliance with DCYF processes and coercion, especially when parents face the threat of losing their children. Clear guidelines and protections for parents were deemed necessary.
   - **False Reporting**: The issue of false reporting, particularly in contentious divorce cases, was addressed. Concerns were raised about attorneys potentially encouraging clients to make false claims, with calls for disciplinary action against such conduct.

4. **Child Abuse and Criminal Prosecution**:
   - **Latitude in Abuse Cases**: Representatives expressed concern about DCYF's latitude in child abuse cases, particularly when there are no broken bones or hospitalization. Stricter enforcement and criminal prosecution were advocated for cases of physical assault on children.
   - **Investigative Practices**: Concerns were raised about DCYF's investigative practices, including the lack of specialized skills compared to law enforcement and the potential for children to be intimidated during questioning.

5. **Case Worker Overload and Resource Shortages**:
   - **Overwhelming Caseloads**: The committee acknowledged the overwhelming caseloads faced by DCYF workers, which can lead to lapses in child protection. More resources and personnel were identified as necessary to manage the workload effectively.

6. **Constitutional and Historical Context**:
   - **New Hampshire Amendments**: Concerns were raised about New Hampshire's constitutional amendments (Article 72a and 73a) and their impact on the judiciary's rule-making authority, which some argue has led to lawlessness in the courts.
   - **Historical Legal Precedents**: A representative cited the Supreme Court case *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen* to argue for a more stringent application of due process rooted in the founding principles of the Constitution.

### **Proposed Solutions and Calls to Action**

1. **Systemic Reforms**:
   - **Separating Court Functions**: Suggestions included separating civil, criminal, and equity cases in family court to ensure impartiality and fairness.
   - **Reinstating Consequences for False Accusations**: The committee called for reinstating penalties for false allegations to deter abuse of the system.

2. **Accountability and Transparency**:
   - **Impeachments and Subpoenas**: The committee was urged to take decisive action, including potential impeachments, subpoenas, and warrants, to address systemic issues and ensure justice for families.
   - **Public Trust**: Representatives emphasized the need for public officials, including DCYF workers, to be held to high standards of accountability, with severe consequences for breaches of trust.

3. **Due Process Protections**:
   - **Miranda-Style Warnings**: The committee explored the possibility of implementing Miranda-style warnings for parents involved in DCYF investigations to ensure they are aware of their rights.
   - **Thorough Investigations**: Calls were made for thorough investigations into potential corruption within the system and better oversight of the affidavit process to prevent unjust removals of children.

4. **Federal Funding and Timelines**:
   - **Reevaluating Federal Incentives**: The committee expressed concern about federal funding mandates, such as those in the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which may influence case outcomes. A reevaluation of these incentives was suggested.

### **Next Steps**

The committee concluded with plans to continue discussions in future sessions, focusing on bringing in DCYF and the Office of the Child Advocate for further testimony. The goal is to address systemic challenges, improve transparency, and ensure that child protection measures are balanced with the constitutional rights of parents and families.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting underscored the urgent need for systemic reforms within DCYF and the family court system to address due process violations, ensure accountability, and protect the rights of families. The committee's discussions highlighted the complex interplay between federal funding, judicial impartiality, and child welfare, with a strong call for action to restore public trust and justice in New Hampshire's child welfare system.
