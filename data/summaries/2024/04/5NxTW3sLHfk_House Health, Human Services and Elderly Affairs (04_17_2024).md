**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (April 17, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on April 17, 2024, to address a range of critical issues, including Medicaid reimbursement policies, the regulation of synthetic THC products, oversight of substance use treatment facilities, and the therapeutic cannabis program. The meeting highlighted the complexities and challenges in balancing patient care, provider needs, and regulatory oversight.

### **Medicaid Reimbursement Policies**
1. **Senate Bill 409 (Ambulance Services)**: The committee discussed **Amendment 1529h**, which proposes a $1 million appropriation for Medicaid reimbursement of ambulance services that provide treatment without transportation. Key points included:
   - **Patient Consent**: Concerns were raised about unresponsive patients who cannot consent to treatment.
   - **Documentation**: Debate centered on whether providers must explicitly document that all reimbursement criteria are met.
   - **Reimbursement Criteria**: The committee debated whether all listed requirements must be met or if meeting some is sufficient.
   - **Medicaid Billing Challenges**: Low reimbursement rates and bureaucratic burdens discourage providers from submitting claims.
   - **House vs. Senate Bill**: Some members preferred the broader House version, while others favored the detailed Senate version. The committee planned to refine the bill further.

2. **Prosthetic and Orthotic Devices**: Legislators addressed the low Medicaid reimbursement rates for prosthetic and orthotic devices, which stand at 80% of Medicare rates and have not increased since July 2021. Providers like Seacoast Prosthetics highlighted financial losses and the impact on patient care. The bill proposes increasing reimbursement rates to 90% of Medicare rates to better support providers and ensure patients receive high-quality devices.

### **Regulation of Synthetic THC Products**
The committee discussed the risks associated with synthetic THC products, such as Delta-8 and Delta-9 THC, which are derived from hemp and often unregulated. Key points included:
   - **Health Risks**: These products can be more potent than natural cannabis and may contain harmful contaminants, particularly in vape form.
   - **Accessibility**: The lack of regulation allows these products to be sold in places like gas stations, making them easily accessible to minors.
   - **Proposed Solutions**: Legislators emphasized the need for independent lab testing and stricter regulations to ensure consumer safety.

### **Therapeutic Cannabis Program**
1. **Senate Bill 357**: The committee reviewed a bill to expand the definition of providers under the therapeutic cannabis program to include those licensed to prescribe medication. The bill also requires certification from two providers for minors, with one specializing in pediatric care.
2. **Senate Bill 419**: This bill focuses on collecting data on violations, enforcement actions, and corrective measures within the therapeutic cannabis program. Amendments were proposed to refine the data collection process.
3. **Senate Bill 505**: The committee considered permanently banning hemp-derived THC products (e.g., Delta-8 and Delta-9) in New Hampshire, addressing concerns about unregulated products marketed to younger audiences.

### **Oversight of Substance Use Treatment Facilities**
1. **Senate Bill 495**: The bill aims to establish a certification system for outpatient substance abuse treatment facilities to ensure quality and oversight. Key points included:
   - **Gaps in Oversight**: Currently, only nine of 65 Medicaid-enrolled outpatient providers are under state oversight.
   - **Certification vs. Licensing**: The bill requires outpatient providers to obtain certification, which some argue functions similarly to a license.
   - **Exemptions**: Individual practitioners and small independent providers are exempt, as they are already covered by professional licensing boards.
   - **Patient Safety**: Advocates cited anecdotal reports of misconduct and substandard care, emphasizing the need for improved oversight.
   - **Rulemaking Process**: The bill initiates a rulemaking process led by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to develop standards for outpatient providers.

### **Broader Medicaid Concerns**
The committee acknowledged the broader issues of low Medicaid reimbursement rates across various services. While incremental approaches like increasing reimbursement for prosthetics were discussed, some legislators questioned why this specific area should receive increased funding when many other Medicaid services also suffer from low funding.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for comprehensive solutions to address Medicaid reimbursement policies, regulate synthetic THC products, and improve oversight in substance use treatment facilities. The committee planned to continue refining the bills and addressing concerns in subsequent meetings, emphasizing the importance of balancing provider needs, patient care, and regulatory oversight.
