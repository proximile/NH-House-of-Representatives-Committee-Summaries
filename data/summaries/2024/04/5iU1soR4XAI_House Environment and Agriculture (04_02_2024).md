The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee meeting on April 2, 2024, focused on updating landfill regulations through discussions and a subcommittee work session. The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing environmental protection, industry concerns, and public input, with a focus on ensuring the new rules are more protective than existing ones. Key points from the combined segments include:

1. **Setting Standards for Landfills**: The committee emphasized the importance of establishing a minimum standard (a "floor") for new landfill siting to ensure environmental protection, while acknowledging that future landfills could exceed these standards.

2. **Concerns About Existing vs. New Landfills**: A representative raised concerns about whether expanding existing landfills should be held to the same stringent criteria as new sites. The response stressed that all communities deserve equal protections, regardless of whether a landfill is new or expanding.

3. **Regulated Community’s Role**: There was a debate about the role of landfill operators in shaping the rules. While they provide input, the committee clarified that they do not write the rules, aiming to balance industry concerns with public safety and environmental protection.

4. **Rulemaking Process**: The committee reviewed the ongoing rulemaking process, including public hearings and comment periods. They noted that the proposed rules are more protective than existing ones, though some members expressed concerns about perceived weakening of certain provisions.

5. **Expert Testimony**: Hydrogeologist Muriel Robinette testified, emphasizing the need for stricter landfill rules to protect groundwater and manage leachate effectively. She criticized the proposed rules for focusing only on the top five feet of soil, arguing this is insufficient to safeguard bedrock water supplies, which many residents rely on.

6. **Landfill Siting and Soil Permeability**: Robinette and committee members discussed the risks of siting landfills in sandy areas, where contaminants can migrate quickly. They questioned why the rules only require testing the top five feet of soil and why setbacks from water bodies are measured in feet rather than travel time, which would be more protective.

7. **Proposed Rule Changes**: The committee reviewed updates to the Department of Environmental Services (DES) rules, including adjustments to hydraulic conductivity requirements and setback distances. Concerns were raised about weakening standards, such as allowing an average soil permeability value, which could leave some areas more porous and vulnerable to contamination.

8. **Geology of New Hampshire**: Robinette provided a geological overview of the state, comparing it to neighboring regions, to underscore the importance of tailored regulations that account for local environmental conditions.

9. **Requests for Clarity**: Representatives requested a summary comparing the new rules to the previous ones, highlighting how the new rules provide better environmental protection. This would help them communicate the improvements to constituents.

10. **Future Meetings and Field Trip**: The committee planned additional meetings to further discuss the rules, including a rescheduled site visit to a waste management facility on May 3rd due to weather concerns. Members were encouraged to submit formal comments during the public comment period.

Overall, the meeting underscored the need for robust landfill regulations to protect New Hampshire’s environment and public health, while navigating the challenges of rulemaking and stakeholder input.
