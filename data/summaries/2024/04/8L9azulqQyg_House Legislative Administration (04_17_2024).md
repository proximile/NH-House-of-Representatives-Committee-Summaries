The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 17, 2024, to address key legislative matters, with a primary focus on ethics guidelines, recusal standards, and a bill concerning historic commemorations.

---

### **Ethics and Recusal Standards: Senate Bill 605**
The central focus of the meeting was **Senate Bill 605**, which aims to clarify legislative ethics and recusal standards. Key points included:

1. **Introduction and Purpose**: Senator Donna Susi (District 18) introduced SB 605, developed in response to advisory opinions from the Legislative Ethics Committee. The bill seeks to provide clear guidelines for when legislators should recuse themselves from voting due to potential conflicts of interest.

2. **Recusal Criteria**: The bill outlines three primary criteria for recusal:
   - Receiving financial remuneration from an organization.
   - Holding a position with substantial influence over the organization.
   - The organization has lobbied or testified on the legislation in question.

3. **Exemptions and Debates**: Discussions centered on whether state, federal, county, and municipal employees should be exempt from recusal requirements. Concerns were raised about balancing the need for recusal with the value of their expertise in legislative matters. Specific examples included selectmen, firefighters, and landlords.

4. **Ethics Committee Perspective**: Ned Gordon, Chair of the Ethics Committee, supported the bill, emphasizing its alignment with existing advisory opinions. He suggested reorganizing the bill to list "facts and circumstances" before specific roles deemed to have substantial influence.

5. **Practical Implications**: The committee explored how the bill would impact legislators in real-world scenarios, such as voting on issues affecting their employers or municipalities. Questions about the clarity and practicality of the bill’s language were raised.

### **Broader Discussions on Ethics and Transparency**
Beyond SB 605, the meeting included broader discussions on ethical guidelines and transparency:

1. **Public Perception**: Members emphasized the importance of maintaining public trust by ensuring legislators are transparent and ethical. They acknowledged the complexity of defining ethical boundaries and the challenges of creating clear, enforceable guidelines.

2. **Recusal and Disclosure**: The conversation highlighted the need for consistent criteria for recusal and disclosure, particularly in cases involving organizations or roles that could influence legislative outcomes. Examples included university financial officers and landlords.

3. **Simplified Ethics Guidelines**: There was a consensus on the need for a simpler, more accessible guide to ethics rules for legislators, potentially in the form of a concise booklet or one-page summary.

4. **Work Session and Future Steps**: The meeting transitioned into a work session, where members sought further clarification on aspects of the bills, including IRS-related language. They also discussed the possibility of a committee of conference to reconcile differences between SB 605 and another ethics bill.

### **Senate Bill 331: Historic Commemorations**
The meeting also addressed **Senate Bill 331**, which focuses on historic commemorations:

1. **Portrait of Martha Fuller Clark**: The bill proposes accepting a portrait of former Senator Martha Fuller Clark, a bipartisan legislator known for her significant contributions to New Hampshire. The portrait, painted by local artist Ralph Stony Jacobs, would be displayed in the State House or Legislative Office Building.

2. **Historic Liquor Bottles**: The bill directs revenue from commemorative liquor bottles celebrating the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution to fund events organized by the American Revolution Cester Centennial Commission. These events include celebrations at Fort Constitution and the State House in 2026.

3. **Support for the Bill**: Testimonies highlighted Fuller Clark’s legacy in historic preservation, agriculture, and economic development, as well as the importance of honoring her contributions. The New Hampshire Preservation Alliance and others expressed strong support for the bill.
