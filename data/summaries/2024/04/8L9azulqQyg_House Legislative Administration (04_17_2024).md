### Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting (April 17, 2024)  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 17, 2024, centered on two primary areas: historical commemorations and legislative ethics. The discussions highlighted the importance of recognizing historical contributions and ensuring clarity in ethical standards for legislators.  

#### **1. Historical Commemorations and Portrait Acceptance**  
The committee addressed a bill directing the Joint Legislative Historical Committee to accept a portrait of former Senator Martha Fuller Clark, a prominent figure in New Hampshire politics. The portrait, painted by artist Ralph "Stony" Jacobs, was discussed in the context of honoring Senator Clark’s bipartisan legislative record and her significant contributions to the state. The committee emphasized the need to increase representation of women in the State House, noting that only nine out of 213 portraits are of women.  

Additionally, the bill included plans for commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. These plans involve producing historic liquor bottles to raise funds for events at Fort Constitution and the State House. The proceeds will support historical preservation efforts and celebratory activities tied to this milestone.  

#### **2. Legislative Ethics and Recusal Standards**  
The meeting featured extensive discussions on **Senate Bill 605**, which seeks to clarify when legislators should recuse themselves from voting on legislation. The bill introduces a three-pronged test for recusal:  
- Receiving financial remuneration from an organization.  
- Holding a position of substantial influence over the organization.  
- The organization has lobbied or testified on the legislation.  

**Key Points of Debate:**  
- **Municipal Officials**: Questions were raised about whether local government officials (e.g., selectmen, school board members) should be subject to recusal requirements, given their roles in municipalities and potential conflicts of interest.  
- **Public Perception**: The importance of maintaining public trust and addressing perceived conflicts of interest was emphasized, particularly for legislators who hold positions in organizations or government entities.  
- **IRS Code Influence**: The bill’s language is partially derived from the IRS code, which defines "substantial influence." Some members questioned why the IRS code was used as a reference instead of examining approaches from other states.  

**Ethics Committee Perspective:**  
Ned Gordon, chair of the Ethics Committee, supported the bill, stating it provides clear statutory guidance on recusal, which is currently lacking. He emphasized that the committee’s role is educational rather than punitive, focusing on informing legislators about ethical standards rather than punishing violations.  

**Additional Testimony:**  
Eric Power, representing the School District Governance Association, supported the bill but suggested adding an upper limit for financial remuneration to avoid disqualifying individuals receiving small stipends (e.g., school board members). He also recommended using the term "political subdivision" to cover various local government entities.  

#### **3. Senate Bill 331**  
The meeting briefly discussed **Senate Bill 331**, which directs the Joint Legislative Historical Committee to accept the portrait of former Senator Martha Clark and allocates revenue from Craner liquor bottles to the American Revolution 250th Commission.  

#### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the importance of historical preservation and the need for clear, accessible ethical guidelines for legislators. The discussions on Senate Bill 605 aimed to refine recusal standards, ensuring fairness and transparency in legislative decision-making while addressing concerns about conflicts of interest. The commemorative initiatives highlighted the state’s commitment to honoring its history and increasing representation of women in public spaces.
