The New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on April 9, 2024, addressed several critical issues, including the review of key bills, the urgent need to replace the aging New Hampshire State Prison for Men, and logistical planning for upcoming committee activities.  

### Key Bills Reviewed:  
1. **Senate Bill 592**:  
   - The bill proposes renaming Route 127 from Central Street to the Franklin Town Line of Sanborn as the "Chief Bradley Hos Memorial Highway," honoring former Franklin Chief of Police Bradley Hos, who served for decades and tragically passed away.  
   - An amendment was introduced to change the title from "Officer Bradley Hos" to "Chief Bradley Hos" to accurately reflect his rank.  
   - The committee unanimously passed both the amendment and the bill, recognizing the importance of honoring Chief Hos's legacy. The Department of Safety supported the bill, emphasizing the need to reflect Hos's highest rank in the highway's name.  

2. **Senate Bill 580**:  
   - The bill authorizes the sale of toll credits to fund a newly established noise barrier construction fund for highway projects.  
   - Concerns were raised about the feasibility of using toll credits, as they are increasingly needed for other federal programs.  
   - The committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," citing the premature nature of the proposal and the lack of a marketplace for toll credits.  

### New Hampshire State Prison Replacement:  
The committee discussed the pressing need to replace the aging New Hampshire State Prison for Men, built in 1878 and last renovated in the 1980s. Senator James Gray emphasized the urgency of addressing the prison's deteriorating conditions, noting the state's budget capacity for a $40 million investment in design and preliminary work.  

Assistant Commissioner Paul Raymond of the Department of Corrections highlighted the severe structural and operational challenges of the current facility, including high vacancy rates among corrections officers and inadequate conditions for staff and inmates. He outlined the benefits of a new prison, such as improved efficiency, reduced recidivism, and enhanced safety. The estimated cost for a new facility is approximately $584 million, with significant cost savings expected from a modernized design.  

The committee also reviewed **Senate Bill 476**, which seeks funding for the architectural and engineering design phase of the new prison. Concerns were raised about potential capacity expansion, but assurances were given that the new facility would not increase bed numbers. The ACLU of New Hampshire, represented by Executive Director Devon Chaffy, expressed support for the replacement, stressing the importance of adequate healthcare, education facilities, and maintaining the current population size.  

### Additional Discussions and Planning:  
The committee scheduled a tour of the state prison and a work session to address concerns about **Senate Bill 476**, agreeing to meet on April 17th for these activities. Discussions also included logistical aspects of posting new highway signs for the Chief Bradley Hos Memorial Highway.  

The meeting concluded with expressions of gratitude for members' efforts and adjustments to their schedules to ensure maximum participation in upcoming activities.  

This comprehensive summary highlights the committee's focus on honoring public service, addressing critical infrastructure needs, and planning for future legislative and operational priorities.
