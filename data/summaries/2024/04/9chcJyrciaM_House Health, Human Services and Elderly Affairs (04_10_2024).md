**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (April 10, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 10, 2024, to discuss a range of Senate bills focused on health, human services, and elderly affairs. The meeting featured detailed testimonies, robust discussions, and considerations of fiscal impacts across several key areas, including early childhood health, healthcare workforce shortages, emergency medical services (EMS) reimbursement, climate-related health risks, and reproductive healthcare access.

### **Early Childhood Health and Prevention**
1. **Senate Bill 355-FN**: This bill addresses the early detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in newborns, a virus that can lead to severe health issues such as hearing loss and developmental disabilities. The bill mandates the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to provide CMV information to parents and update oversight committees on newborn screening efforts. Testimonies underscored the importance of early detection and the benefits of antiviral treatments and frequent hearing and vision tests for affected infants.
2. **Senate Bill 349**: Aimed at improving access to home visiting services for new mothers and their babies, this bill directs the Wellness and Primary Prevention Council to study barriers to these services and recommend a more comprehensive system. Home visiting has been shown to enhance maternal and infant health, reduce child abuse, and improve school readiness.

### **Healthcare Workforce Development**
1. **Senate Bill 403**: This bill seeks to address healthcare workforce shortages by certifying community health workers (CHWs) and expanding their roles. CHWs act as liaisons between healthcare systems and communities, addressing social determinants of health like housing and food insecurity. Certification would allow CHWs to be reimbursed by Medicaid and private insurance, providing financial sustainability. The bill also includes provisions to help licensed nursing assistants (LNAs) transition to medication nursing assistants (MNAs) to alleviate nursing shortages.
2. **Senate Bill 456**: This bill targets the healthcare workforce shortage by providing student loan repayment incentives for nurses, particularly in rural and underserved areas. A $300,000 appropriation to DHHS would fund 6 to 10 full-time nursing contracts, benefiting over 15,000 patients. The bill was amended to integrate into the existing State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP).

### **Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Reimbursement**
1. **Senate Bill 409**: This bill aims to allow Medicaid reimbursement for EMS services when patients are treated but not transported to hospitals. Currently, EMS providers are only reimbursed for transports, leading to financial strain. The bill is expected to reduce unnecessary hospital visits, lower healthcare costs, and improve patient care. It requires a $1 million state appropriation to match federal Medicaid funds. Discussions also highlighted the need to refine the billâ€™s language to ensure it covers all relevant scenarios.

### **Climate Change and Public Health**
1. **Senate Bill 496**: This bill directs DHHS to monitor and respond to the health impacts of climate change, such as heat-related illnesses, tick-borne diseases, and respiratory issues from wildfires. It reestablishes a previously grant-funded program to collect data and develop mitigation strategies. Testimonies emphasized the growing health threats posed by climate change and the need for proactive measures. The program relies on grants rather than state appropriations.

### **Reproductive Healthcare Access**
1. **Senate Bill 567**: This bill seeks to protect and expand access to abortion medications, specifically mifepristone and misoprostol, which are also used for miscarriage management. It requires DHHS to submit a report identifying barriers to access and potential actions to ensure availability. The bill is a proactive response to ongoing legal challenges, including a Supreme Court case that could restrict access to mifepristone nationwide. Supporters highlighted the safety and effectiveness of medication abortion, while opponents raised concerns about coercion, safety, and fiscal responsibility.
