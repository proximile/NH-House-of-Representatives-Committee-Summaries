**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Meeting (04/09/2024):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 9, 2024, to discuss a range of education-related bills and rule changes, focusing on improving educational standards, supporting career and technical education (CTE), and addressing administrative and credentialing issues. The meeting was divided into three key segments, each addressing specific topics and legislative proposals.

### **Segment 1: Key Bills and Amendments**
The session began with discussions on two significant bills:
1. **Master Teacher Certification Bill**:  
   The bill aims to remove financial barriers preventing qualified teachers from obtaining Master Teacher certification. This initiative is seen as a win-win for educators and students, incentivizing professional development and enhancing educational excellence.  
2. **Senate Bill 528 (University System Trustees)**:  
   An amendment (1425) was proposed to increase student trustee slots from two to three, ensuring representation from Keene, Plymouth, and UNH campuses. The amendment also addressed the removal of an alumni trustee position tied to the now-defunct Granite State College, integrating its alumni into UNH's representation. Both the amendment and bill were recommended for passage (OTP).

The meeting concluded with a reminder about the next day’s session, which would focus on **Senate Bill 378**, related to the performance-based school accountability system task force.

### **Segment 2: Review of Proposed Rule Changes**
The Education Subcommittee reviewed proposed changes to **Ed 306.31 through .49**, which pertain to **minimum academic standards for public school approval**. Key discussions included:
1. **Purpose of the Subcommittee**:  
   The subcommittee was tasked with evaluating whether the proposed rule changes align with statutory law and policy, providing recommendations to **JLCAR (Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules)**.  
2. **Proposed Rule Changes**:  
   The focus was on replacing the term **"program"** with **"curriculum"**, particularly in **Arts education (Ed 306.31)**. Concerns were raised about whether this change would weaken public school requirements by making **instruction** and **assessment** optional rather than mandatory.  
3. **Definitions and Implications**:  
   The committee debated the definitions of **"curriculum"**, **"program"**, **"instruction"**, and **"competency"**, noting that **"program"** traditionally includes curriculum, instruction, and assessment. The potential shift from local to state control over curriculum was also discussed.  
4. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee planned to prepare a report summarizing their concerns and questions for **JLCAR** and the Department of Education, ensuring the proposed changes align with statutory requirements and maintain robust educational standards.

### **Segment 3: Education Policy Refinements**
The final segment focused on refining educational policies and addressing specific bills:
1. **Program vs. Curriculum Definitions**:  
   Representatives emphasized the need for clear distinctions between **"program"** and **"curriculum"**, noting that programs encompass curriculum, instruction, and assessment.  
2. **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**:  
   Several bills addressed CTE, including **SB 338**, which proposed adding a CTE teacher and principal to the Professional Standards Board. The importance of CTE in preparing students for high-demand careers was highlighted, along with the need for updated funding and infrastructure.  
3. **Licensing of Part-Time Teachers (SB 374)**:  
   The committee discussed concerns about the 30-hour threshold for part-time teachers, favoring a 20-hour threshold to avoid pushing full-time teachers into part-time status.  
4. **ABLE Savings Account Program (SB 377)**:  
   The bill aimed to resolve administrative issues with ABLE accounts, which help individuals with disabilities save for future expenses. The committee supported the bill.  
5. **Master Teacher Credentials (SB 521)**:  
   An amendment was debated to define criteria for the "Master Teacher" credential, emphasizing exceptional teaching, leadership, and inspiration.  
6. **School Transportation Vehicles (SB 443)**:  
   The committee approved a bill defining school transportation vehicles to align with safety standards.  
7. **Advisory Group for CTE Funding (SB 441)**:  
   The committee supported forming an advisory group to explore funding sources for CTE construction and renovation, with the amendment adding business and industry representatives.  
8. **Legislative Process and Oversight**:  
   Representatives discussed the timeline and process for reviewing and revising educational standards, emphasizing the legislature's oversight role.
