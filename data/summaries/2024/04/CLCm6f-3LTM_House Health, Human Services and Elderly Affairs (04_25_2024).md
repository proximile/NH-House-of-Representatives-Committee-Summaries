### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (April 25, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on April 25, 2024, to discuss several critical healthcare-related bills. The meeting focused on cancer screening for firefighters, pharmacy regulations, medical record access, and vaccine administration, among other issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Cancer Screening for Firefighters (Senate Bill 352 FNA)**
**Purpose**: Senate Bill 352 FNA aims to establish an **early cancer detection screening pilot program** for **active and retired firefighters**, who face high cancer risks due to occupational exposure to carcinogens, including PFAS (forever chemicals) in firefighting gear.

**Key Points**:
- **Screening Methods**: The bill proposes comprehensive screenings, including blood tests, ultrasounds, lung CT scans, and skin cancer screenings. The **multi-cancer blood test (Galleri)**, though not yet FDA-approved, was debated for inclusion.
- **Sponsor’s Argument**: Senator Sharon Carson emphasized the importance of early detection, citing the case of a Manchester firefighter diagnosed with colon cancer through early screening.
- **Concerns**: 
  - **Experimental Tests**: Some representatives questioned the inclusion of unproven tests like the Galleri test.
  - **Scope**: Questions arose about whether **volunteer firefighters** would eventually be included.
  - **Costs**: The bill’s $1,300 per-person cap was scrutinized, with concerns about whether it would cover all necessary screenings.
- **Support**: Stakeholders, including **Brian Ryle** of the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire, highlighted the success of similar programs in other states, such as New Jersey.
- **Amendments**: Proposed amendments included removing skin cancer screenings (already covered by insurance) and vendor-specific language to allow flexibility in screening providers.
- **Next Steps**: The bill was forwarded to the finance committee for further review, with strong bipartisan support.

### **2. Pharmacy Regulations and Dispensing (Senate Bill 458)**
**Purpose**: SB 458 allows **New Hampshire Oncology and Hematology** centers to obtain pharmacy licenses to directly dispense a limited supply of medications to patients.

**Key Points**:
- **Concerns**: The 60-day supply limit was criticized as potentially wasteful for cancer patients, whose treatments often change frequently.
- **Opposition**: **Tanya Carlton** of the New Hampshire Society of Health System Pharmacists opposed the bill in its current form, advocating for clearer language under existing regulations.
- **Amendment**: Representative Gary Merchant proposed an amendment to clarify the Board of Pharmacy’s authority to issue permits for in-house dispensaries, reducing regulatory burdens.

---

### **3. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) (Senate Bill 560)**
**Purpose**: SB 560 proposes a study committee to examine the impact of **Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)** on healthcare costs and patient access to medications.

**Key Points**:
- **Focus**: The study would explore PBM transparency and their effects on consumers and healthcare systems.
- **Stakeholders**: Discussions included whether manufacturers and wholesalers should be part of the study.

---

### **4. Access to Medical Records (Senate Bill 400)**
**Purpose**: SB 400 seeks to cap the cost of accessing medical records at $6.50 for electronic copies and $50 for paper copies.

**Key Points**:
- **Concerns**: High fees charged by third-party vendors, especially to attorneys, were criticized. Some cases involved charges of up to $4,500 for records.
- **HIPAA Compliance**: The importance of verifying authorization and ensuring no misrelease of information was emphasized.
- **Patient Ownership**: Medical records are the property of the patient, but third-party requests involve additional scrutiny and costs.
- **Opposition**: Opponents argued that capping fees could lead to financial losses for healthcare providers and vendors.

### **5. Vaccine Administration and Biological Products (Senate Bill 559)**
**Purpose**: SB 559 updates the state’s immunization statutes to include **biological products**, such as the **RSV monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab)**, ensuring access to these treatments under federal vaccine programs.

**Key Points**:
- **Terminology Debate**: Discussions focused on whether to use terms like **"biological products"** or **"immunization products"** to future-proof the statute.
- **Federal Compliance**: Aligning state statutes with federal guidelines (e.g., CDC and FDA) is crucial for cost savings and accessing federal contracts.
- **Voluntary Nature**: The treatment is voluntary and already available in hospitals and clinics.
- **Logistical Challenges**: Concerns were raised about inventory management and distinguishing between federal and commercial vaccine products.

---

### **6. Pharmacist-Administered Vaccines (Senate Bill 402)**
**Purpose**: SB 402 allows pharmacists to administer FDA-approved vaccines (e.g., flu, COVID-19) without requiring explicit legislative approval each time.

**Key Points**:
- **Concerns**: Clarification was sought on the role of certified technicians in vaccine administration.
- **Goal**: The bill aims to streamline vaccine access for the public, including children.

---

### **7. New Hampshire Vaccine Association (Senate Bill 559)**
**Purpose**: SB 559 updates RSA 126-Q to allow the New Hampshire Vaccine Association to receive assessments from insurers for newly available immunizations, such as the RSV vaccine for infants.

**Key Points**:
- **Objective**: Ensure commercially insured children have access to recommended vaccines at no cost to families or healthcare providers.
- **Public Testimony**: Stakeholders emphasized the importance of equitable access to immunizations.

---

### **8. Medical Record Costs and HIPAA Compliance**
**Key Points**:
- **Cost Disparities**: Patients can access records for $6.50, but third parties (e.g., attorneys) face significantly higher fees.
- **Operational Challenges**: Fulfilling medical records requests involves compliance with HIPAA, trained staff, and potential burdens on healthcare systems.
- **Proposed Legislation**: SP 400 seeks to cap fees, but opponents argue it could harm healthcare providers and vendors.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on improving healthcare access, reducing costs, and addressing occupational health risks. Key bills, such as the cancer screening program for firefighters and updates to vaccine administration statutes, received strong support. However, concerns about costs, regulatory clarity, and operational challenges remain central to ongoing discussions. The committee plans to reconvene to finalize amendments and move forward with these critical initiatives.
