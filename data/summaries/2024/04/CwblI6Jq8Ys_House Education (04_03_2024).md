The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on April 3, 2024, centered on a performance audit of the state’s Department of Education (DOE) concerning its management of special education dispute resolution processes during fiscal years 2020–2022. The audit, conducted by the Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA), revealed significant deficiencies and long-standing issues, prompting a robust discussion among committee members and DOE representatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and findings from the meeting:

### **Audit Findings and Recommendations**
The audit identified critical shortcomings in the DOE’s oversight, tracking, and enforcement of special education dispute resolution processes. Key issues included:
- **Inadequate Controls**: Lack of strategic planning, inconsistent implementation of regulations, and insufficient stakeholder engagement.
- **Data Management**: Outdated and insufficient databases for tracking dispute resolution cases, leading to poor compliance with state and federal reporting requirements.
- **Ad Hoc Rules**: Many DOE requirements were established through non-enforceable, poorly documented, and inconsistently communicated ad hoc rules.
- **Historical Context**: Similar deficiencies were identified in previous audits in 1991 and 1999, indicating persistent systemic problems.
- **Impact on Stakeholders**: Deficiencies compromised compliance, transparency, and potentially the state’s eligibility for federal funding. Parents and schools faced significant barriers, often requiring legal assistance to navigate complex processes.

The audit made 20 recommendations, five of which may require legislative action. The DOE concurred fully or in part with all recommendations and committed to addressing them.

### **Key Areas of Concern**
1. **Timeliness and Efficiency**: Concerns were raised about the prolonged resolution of special education cases, delaying access to critical services for children. Efforts are underway to streamline processes and reduce timelines.
2. **Hearing Officer Contracts**: Discussions focused on modifying contracts to include specific language on invoice submissions and timely payments to mitigate fraud risks. Contracts, typically three-year terms, will be updated upon renewal.
3. **Training and Oversight**: Enhanced training for local special education directors was emphasized to ensure compliance with federal and state regulations. The DOE plans to formalize training schedules and improve communication with stakeholders.
4. **Financial Controls**: The audit identified potential fraud risks in contractor payments, though the DOE clarified these were technical errors that have been addressed. The department is strengthening internal financial controls and collaborating with the Department of Administrative Services and the Attorney General’s office.
5. **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**: NDAs in dispute resolution agreements were criticized for burdening parents and reducing transparency. The DOE is working with the Attorney General’s office to address this issue carefully.
6. **Local School Districts (LEAs)**: The audit noted a lack of DOE controls to ensure LEAs comply with federal and state laws. The department is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance.

### **DOE’s Response and Commitments**
Deputy Commissioner Christine Brennan outlined the DOE’s efforts to improve processes, including:
- Streamlining dispute resolution and enhancing transparency.
- Collaborating with stakeholders, including parents, educators, and federal technical assistance organizations.
- Implementing stricter controls on invoicing and contractor payments.
- Modernizing data tracking systems to improve oversight and reporting.

### **Legislative Involvement and Oversight**
The DOE highlighted the need for legislative support to address some audit recommendations, particularly those requiring statutory changes. Committee members emphasized the importance of legislative oversight and accountability. The DOE is required to provide quarterly updates on its progress, which will be posted to Transparent New Hampshire.

### **Future Steps and Audits**
The LBA is conducting another audit of the special education program, expected to be completed by the end of 2024. This audit will cover areas beyond dispute resolution, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the DOE’s management of special education services.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for systemic improvements in the DOE’s management of special education dispute resolution processes. Addressing the audit’s recommendations is critical to enhancing efficiency, transparency, and compliance while ensuring better outcomes for students and families. The DOE’s commitment to collaboration, training, and modernization, coupled with legislative support and oversight, will be essential in achieving these goals.
