**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (April 23, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on April 23, 2024, addressed a range of critical issues related to shelter funding, school nutrition programs, and fiscal responsibility. The discussions centered on several key bills and policies, with a focus on balancing state and local interests, ensuring fiscal integrity, and addressing the needs of vulnerable populations.

### **Shelter Contracts and Funding**
1. **Shelter Contracts**: The committee reviewed shelter contracts, emphasizing the need for transparency and financial sustainability. Amendments were proposed to adjust reimbursement rates for shelter beds, increasing from $8 to $20 per night, with a further proposed increase to $27. The state currently funds 950 shelter beds, and new contracts were awarded to 13 organizations, effective April 1, 2024, with an option to renew for five years.

2. **Housing First Policy**: The federal Housing First policy, which prioritizes providing housing without preconditions, was scrutinized for potentially overriding state-level priorities, such as prioritizing veterans and the elderly for shelter resources.

3. **Identification and Eligibility**: Challenges related to individuals accessing shelters without identification were discussed. The committee considered whether shelters could prioritize those with identification or legal status, though concerns about practicality and legality were raised.

4. **Hamstead Hospital Property Tax Reimbursement**: The committee debated a proposal to reimburse the town of Hamstead for lost property tax revenue due to the state's acquisition of Hamstead Hospital. Discussions focused on whether this should be a one-time payment or an ongoing obligation.

### **School Nutrition Programs (SP 499)**
1. **Breakfast After the Bell**: This program, which allows students to eat breakfast after the school day starts, was discussed for its benefits in reducing stigma and increasing participation. Schools implementing the program would need new equipment, with funding contingent on meeting certain criteria.

2. **Reduced Price Lunches**: The bill proposes converting reduced-price lunches to free lunches for eligible students, costing the state approximately $500,000. This change would simplify the system to two categories: free or full-price lunches.

3. **Summer EBT Program**: A federally funded program providing food benefits to eligible children during the summer was discussed. Implementation is contingent on federal approval, with benefits likely distributed in October or November 2024.

4. **Elderly Simplified Application**: The bill includes a provision to simplify the SNAP application process for elderly or disabled individuals, allowing them to apply once every three years instead of annually.

### **Fiscal Implications and Concerns**
1. **Fiscal Note for SP 499**: The fiscal note was updated due to a Senate amendment introducing contingency language. The total estimated cost for fiscal year 2025 is $12 million, but only $499,000 is directly appropriated for the reduced-price lunch program. The rest relies on federal funds, which may not be available, potentially delaying or suspending implementation.

2. **Staffing Needs**: The Department of Education (DOE) estimates needing three new positions to implement the programs, costing $351,000 in the first year.

3. **Local Impact**: The bill could impose indeterminable costs on local school districts, particularly for administrative startup and staffing. Some districts may need to hire additional staff to manage new programs.

### **Future Considerations and Next Steps**
The committee emphasized the need for further research and input, including potential amendments to bills and inviting additional testimony from stakeholders, such as the town of Hamstead, to better understand the financial and operational impacts of the discussed policies. The DOE and DHHS will provide further clarification on implementation details, costs, and local impacts before final decisions are made.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing fiscal responsibility with the needs of vulnerable populations. Key issues included the sustainability of shelter funding, the implications of federal policies on state priorities, and the challenges of implementing school nutrition programs with uncertain funding. The committee's ongoing work will focus on ensuring transparency, efficiency, and equitable support for all affected parties.
