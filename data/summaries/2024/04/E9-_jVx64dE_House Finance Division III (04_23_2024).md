### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (04/23/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on April 23, 2024, covered a wide range of topics, including school nutrition programs, shelter funding, elderly assistance initiatives, and state property agreements. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

---

### **School Nutrition Programs (SB 499)**

1. **Breakfast After the Bell**:  
   - This program mandates schools with more than 10% of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals to offer breakfast after the school day begins.  
   - Estimated startup costs for equipment (e.g., mobile carts) are $3.7 million, with concerns raised about the high participation assumption in the fiscal note.  
   - Participation is not mandatory, but schools opting in may receive reimbursement for equipment if 40% or more of their students qualify.  
   - Implementation depends on state funding, as federal funds cannot be used for this specific program.

2. **Reduced-Price Lunches**:  
   - The bill proposes covering the cost of reduced-price lunches, making them free for eligible students.  
   - This would eliminate the reduced-price category, leaving only free or full-price options.  
   - Estimated annual cost: $500,000.

3. **Community Eligibility Provision (CEP)**:  
   - Allows schools with high poverty rates to offer free meals to all students.  
   - Estimated annual cost: $7.6 million, contingent on federal funding.  
   - Implementation could be delayed if federal funds are insufficient.

4. **Summer EBT Program**:  
   - Provides $120 per eligible child for summer meals via EBT cards.  
   - Benefits for summer 2024 will likely be distributed in October or November 2024 due to implementation challenges.  
   - Fiscal note includes costs for setting up the program for both 2024 and 2025.

5. **Staffing and Local Costs**:  
   - The Department of Education (DOE) estimates three new positions are needed, costing $351,000 in the first year.  
   - Local school districts face indeterminable costs for staffing, infrastructure, and administrative expenses, particularly for schools not currently offering breakfast.

6. **Concerns and Next Steps**:  
   - Representatives raised questions about food waste, program mandates, and the accuracy of fiscal estimates.  
   - The DOE agreed to issue a questionnaire to schools for better cost estimation.  
   - Policy decisions were deferred to the House Education Committee, emphasizing the Finance Committee’s focus on funding.

### **Elderly Assistance and Simplified Applications**

1. **Elderly Simplified Application Program**:  
   - Simplifies the application process for elderly or disabled individuals with no earned income, allowing benefits to last up to three years.  
   - One-time system cost: $75,000, with $37,500 covered by state funds.

---

### **Shelter Funding and Policies (SB 406)**

1. **Shelter Bed Reimbursement**:  
   - The state funds 950 shelter beds across 13 organizations, with contracts renewed through a competitive bid process.  
   - The bill proposes increasing the daily reimbursement rate from $20 to $27 per bed, addressing rising operational costs.  
   - Total cost: $2.5 million.

2. **Prioritization of Veterans and Elderly**:  
   - The bill includes language prioritizing veterans and elderly individuals for shelter resources.  
   - Concerns were raised about the practicality of prioritization in the **housing-first model**, which does not require identification for access.  
   - Representatives suggested strengthening the prioritization language to ensure resources reach those most in need.

3. **Youth and LGBTQ+ Homeless Services**:  
   - While the bill does not directly address these populations, representatives emphasized the need for targeted support for vulnerable groups, including youth and LGBTQ+ individuals.

4. **Fiscal Oversight**:  
   - Monthly financial reporting for shelters was proposed to ensure fiscal integrity and prevent fraud.

### **Low-Barrier Housing and Shelter Eligibility**

1. **Eligibility Challenges**:  
   - Discussions focused on eligibility for low-barrier housing, particularly for undocumented individuals and those without identification.  
   - Concerns were raised about the lack of practical methods to verify immigration status during shelter check-ins.  
   - Representatives highlighted the challenges homeless individuals face in obtaining identification and the importance of providing services to help them secure housing and economic stability.

2. **Housing First Policy**:  
   - There was interest in revisiting the federal Housing First policy to address inefficiencies and improve sustainability in shelter operations.

### **Hampstead Hospital Payment Agreement**

1. **Background**:  
   - The state acquired Hampstead Hospital in 2022, resulting in a loss of property tax revenue for the town of Hampstead.  
   - The state has made annual payments of approximately $80,000 in lieu of taxes for the past two years, though there is no written agreement.

2. **Discussion**:  
   - Representatives debated whether these payments should continue and whether they should be included in the state budget for transparency.  
   - Concerns were raised about future property improvements potentially increasing the town’s tax burden and whether the state should continue compensating for lost revenue.  
   - Similar state payments to other municipalities, such as Concord for parking revenue loss, were also discussed.

3. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee plans to invite the Hampstead CFO for further discussion and prepare recommendations for the full Finance Committee.
