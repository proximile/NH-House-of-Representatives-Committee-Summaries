### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Senate Bill 169 (Repeal of Repeal)**  
   - This bill repeals a previous repeal related to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).  
   - Updates focus on opiate-related issues, physical injuries to non-ambulatory children, and the rebuttable presumption of harm in domestic violence cases.  
   - Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, emphasized the importance of these updates in protecting children.

2. **Senate Bill 459 (Child Abuse Reporting Requirements)**  
   - Expands reporting requirements to include healthcare providers treating children under 13 for sexually transmitted diseases, aiming to address child sexual abuse and trafficking.  
   - A study committee will explore broadening the definition of abuse and neglect to include emotional and psychological factors.  
   - The bill aligns with nationwide practices to protect children from exploitation.

3. **Senate Bill 574 (Temporary Agent for Minors)**  
   - Allows parents to appoint a temporary agent for minor children or incapacitated individuals, with a 60-day limit (renewable).  
   - Safeguards include requiring consent from both parents (if not together) and ensuring the agent does not interfere with court-appointed guardianships.  
   - Concerns were raised about potential misuse in high-conflict family situations.

4. **Senate Bill 573 (Healthcare Consent and Confidentiality for Adolescents)**  
   - Establishes a committee to study consent and confidentiality laws for adolescents’ healthcare, focusing on parental rights and gaps in current laws.  
   - Examples cited include cases where children received medical treatment (e.g., vaccinations) without parental consent.  
   - The committee voted unanimously (14-0) to move the bill forward.

5. **Senate Bill 463 (Legal Representation for Children in Dependency Proceedings)**  
   - Expands access to court-appointed counsel for children in residential or group home care, ensuring their voices are heard in legal proceedings.  
   - Mandates representation for children in or at risk of entering residential care, with access to their medical, psychological, and educational records.  
   - Fiscal impact estimated at $500,000, with implementation delayed to July 1, 2025, to allow for preparation and training of specialized attorneys.  
   - Concerns were raised about representing non-verbal children and ensuring adequate attorney availability.

6. **Senate Bill 417 (Child Protection and Placement Preferences)**  
   - Reforms child welfare statutes to prioritize family and community-based placements over residential or out-of-state facilities.  
   - Key provisions include keeping siblings together, evaluating non-custodial parents’ fitness, and ensuring trauma-informed care.  
   - Inspired by the **Bledsoe Youth Academy incident** and the **Harmony Montgomery case**, the bill aims to prevent children from being placed in unsafe environments.  
   - An amendment removed contentious language about “unique needs” and parental cooperation, adding a definition for “fictive kin” (close non-biological relationships).  
   - Concerns were raised about staffing needs (66 new positions requested by DHHS) and potential overreach in evaluating non-custodial parents.
