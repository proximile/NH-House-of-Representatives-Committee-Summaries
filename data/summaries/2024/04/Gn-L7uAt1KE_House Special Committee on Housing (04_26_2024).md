**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on Housing Meeting (04/26/2024)**

On April 26, 2024, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing convened to address critical housing issues, focusing on student housing, affordable housing for individuals with disabilities, and zoning restrictions. The meeting highlighted the complexities of housing policy, particularly in college towns like Durham, and explored legislative proposals aimed at balancing community preservation, housing affordability, and anti-discrimination concerns.

### Key Discussions and Themes:

#### **1. Town-Gown Relations and Student Housing**
   - **Concerns Over Local Ordinances**: A significant portion of the discussion centered on the impact of housing ordinances on the relationship between the University of New Hampshire (UNH) and the town of Durham. Concerns were raised that restrictive policies, such as the "three unrelated" rule (limiting the number of unrelated individuals in a single-family home), could harm town-gown relations, alienate students, and hinder UNH's ability to recruit faculty and students.
   - **Student Housing Challenges**: The meeting addressed the difficulties students face in finding affordable housing, with some seeking off-campus accommodations in residential neighborhoods. This often leads to conflicts with families and long-term residents, particularly in areas where investors purchase single-family homes to rent by the bed to students, driving up housing costs and displacing families.
   - **Enforcement and Community Impact**: Durham’s code enforcement officer clarified that housing regulations are enforced based on violations rather than targeting students specifically. However, the "three unrelated" rule applies to both the main unit and any accessory dwelling units (ADUs), treating them as a single unit.

#### **2. Affordable Housing and Workforce Housing**
   - **Commitment to Affordable Housing**: Speakers from the Durham Housing Task Force and the Workforce Housing Coalition emphasized their commitment to affordable housing and supported state mandates like the ADU statute, which promotes housing options.
   - **Housing Crisis and Disability Community**: Senate Bill 48 (SP48), introduced by Senator Denise Ricciardi, aims to study the effects of the housing crisis on individuals with disabilities and recommend policy solutions. The committee discussed the importance of coordinating with existing studies to avoid overlap and extended the reporting deadline to November 1, 2025, with an interim report due by November 1, 2024.
   - **Workforce Housing Solutions**: There was broad support for promoting workforce housing, with suggestions to incentivize developers to include affordable units in new projects. Representatives also highlighted the need for collaboration between universities and municipalities to address housing shortages for students and the workforce.

#### **3. Zoning Restrictions and Legal Concerns**
   - **Debate Over "Unrelated" Definition**: The legal definition of "unrelated" individuals living together sparked significant debate, with some representatives questioning whether targeting students in housing ordinances could be seen as discriminatory. Legal experts, including Ben Frost from NH Housing, argued that such ordinances may violate state anti-discrimination laws, particularly regarding familial and marital status.
   - **Non-Germane Amendment (Amendment 1482)**: Introduced by Representative Diane Pauer, this amendment sought to prohibit municipalities from enforcing zoning ordinances that limit the number of unrelated individuals in a dwelling based on familial or marital status. Proponents argued that removing these restrictions would increase housing supply and lower rental costs, while opponents raised concerns about potential overcrowding, noise, and community safety.
   - **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Durham residents and officials emphasized the importance of local control in managing housing issues, particularly in balancing student housing with neighborhood quality of life. They argued that preventative measures like the "three unrelated" rule are more effective than relying on noise and behavior ordinances.

#### **4. Policy Recommendations and Next Steps**
   - **Collaborative Solutions**: Senate Bill 527 (SP527), introduced by Senator Suzanne Prentiss, focuses on student housing and includes a study committee and policy statement to encourage collaboration between universities and municipalities. The bill aims to address the need for affordable housing for students and the workforce.
   - **Further Consideration Needed**: The committee decided to delay voting on several proposed ordinances and amendments to allow for further discussion and coordination. Members emphasized the need to balance housing affordability with community well-being, ensuring that policies do not disproportionately impact specific groups or undermine local efforts to address housing challenges.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the intricate balance required in housing policy, particularly in college towns like Durham. While there is a clear need for more affordable housing and solutions to the housing crisis, the committee recognized the importance of inclusive, thoughtful policy-making that considers the interests of students, families, landlords, and the broader community. The discussions highlighted the tension between local control and state mandates, the potential for discriminatory practices in housing ordinances, and the need for collaborative approaches to address New Hampshire’s housing challenges. Further deliberation and coordination will be essential to develop policies that promote housing affordability while preserving community character and quality of life.
