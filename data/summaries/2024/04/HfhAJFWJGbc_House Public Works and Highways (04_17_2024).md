**Summary of the New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (04/17/2024): Discussion on Senate Bill 476**

On April 17, 2024, the New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee convened to discuss **Senate Bill 476**, which proposes a **$40 million capital appropriation** for the Department of Corrections to replace the New Hampshire State Prison for Men. The committee’s discussion centered on the urgent need for prison modernization, the financial challenges of the project, and the logistical complexities of constructing a new facility while maintaining the current one. Here are the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Prison Conditions and Urgency of the Project**
1. **Deteriorating Infrastructure**: Representatives emphasized the dire state of the prison, noting outdated infrastructure, sewage issues, peeling paint, and aging facilities. Parts of the prison date back to the 1800s, and cosmetic maintenance has been neglected due to prioritization of critical repairs, such as plumbing.
2. **Population and Capacity**: The current prison population is **1,280**, with a capacity of approximately **1,400**. The total incarcerated population across all facilities, including transitional housing, is **1,897** as of 2023.
3. **Medical Equipment**: Concerns were raised about outdated medical equipment, though the Department of Corrections highlighted challenges in upgrading due to space constraints.

### **Proposed Funding and Financial Considerations**
1. **$40 Million Appropriation**: The bill seeks to bond **$40 million** for architectural design, engineering, and construction documents, with the goal of completing the design within **1-2 years** and the new facility by **2034**.
2. **Total Project Cost**: The full project is estimated to cost **$600 million** over 10 years, with the **$40 million** serving as the initial phase. Representatives acknowledged future struggles to fund the remainder of the project, potentially requiring additional bonding or budget adjustments.
3. **Bonding vs. Cash Funding**: While some representatives expressed discomfort with bonding, preferring cash funding, others supported the move given the urgency of the project. The State Treasurer assured that bonding at 5.5% interest is feasible and suggested structuring the project over a **30-year amortization schedule** to ease budget pressures.
4. **Bonding Capacity**: The **$40 million** bond would increase the state’s total bond authorization to **$177 million**, which the Treasurer confirmed is within the state’s capacity.

### **Historical Delays and Rising Costs**
1. **Decade-Long Delays**: The project has been delayed for over a decade, with construction costs rising significantly. Had action been taken earlier, the new prison might already be operational.
2. **Cost Comparisons**: Representatives questioned the high cost of the project compared to other states, such as Nebraska, which built a **1,500-bed prison for $350 million**. The Department explained that New Hampshire’s costs are higher due to security requirements and specialized infrastructure.

---

### **Design and Construction Plans**
1. **Engineering Firm**: The Department has already selected an engineering firm for initial site evaluation and testing. The **$40 million** would fund the detailed design of the new facility.
2. **Phased Construction**: Building the new prison in phases while maintaining the current facility would require significant logistical coordination and additional staffing, which could be a challenge.

### **Committee Decision**
The committee voted **15-4** to approve the bill as "ought to pass," moving it to the finance committee for further consideration. However, the committee also acknowledged the need for further evaluation of the financial and operational implications of the project.

### **Key Takeaways**
The discussion highlighted the critical need for modernizing the New Hampshire State Prison for Men, the challenges of funding large capital projects, and the trade-offs between cash and bonding. While the **$40 million** appropriation is a necessary first step, the full project’s cost and logistical complexities will require careful planning and sustained financial commitment over the next decade.
