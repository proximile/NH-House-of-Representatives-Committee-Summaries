**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (April 19, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 19, 2024, to address a wide range of administrative rules and procedural issues across various state departments and professional licensing boards. The meeting focused on aligning rules with statutory authority, addressing public safety concerns, and reducing barriers to workforce entry while ensuring clarity and consistency in administrative processes.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Jurisprudence Exams and Professional Licensing**:
   - Concerns were raised about the incorporation of jurisprudence exams, which test knowledge of state laws, into the rules of various professional boards. While the requirement for these exams is included in the rules, the actual questions are not specified, leaving the scope to be determined by individual boards with an emphasis on New Hampshire laws and professional practice.
   - The state is transitioning to using external contractors to administer these exams, allowing applicants to take them at any time rather than waiting for quarterly sessions.
   - The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) rules were reviewed, with particular attention to the process for issuing licenses to individuals licensed in other states. Concerns were raised about whether the OPLC is adequately consulting with relevant boards, prompting discussions on the need for legislative clarification on what constitutes "consultation." There were also calls for adding a jurisprudence exam for certain professions to ensure out-of-state applicants meet New Hampshire’s safety standards.

2. **Licensing and Education Requirements**:
   - A licensed electrician representing the Electrical Contractors Business Association highlighted procedural issues with licensing requirements, particularly the lack of clarity in the law regarding continuing education and schooling hours. Recent legislative changes have caused confusion, and there has been insufficient time to address these issues. The committee was urged to consider these challenges before enforcing new rules.
   - The Mechanical Licensing Board also raised concerns about issuing licenses to individuals from other states without ensuring they meet New Hampshire’s safety standards, particularly for professions involving public safety like plumbing and gas fitting.

3. **Gas Fitters and Plumbers Licensing**:
   - The committee discussed the challenges of implementing a state-approved examination for gas fitters, as the current process involves examinations administered as part of training programs rather than a standardized statewide test. The committee considered whether requiring such an exam would be consistent with the intent of the statute, which aims to facilitate the entry of out-of-state professionals.
   - Conditional approvals were granted for certain rule changes related to the licensing process for plumbers and gas fitters, pending further modifications to ensure alignment with statutory requirements.

4. **Health and Human Services Rule**:
   - The Department of Health and Human Services presented a rule regarding the treatment of specific types of income for eligibility purposes. It was noted that most sections of the rule had expired in June 2023, and the department had continued to enforce the rule in the interest of clients while working to update it. The committee approved the rule without further changes.

5. **Explosives Regulations**:
   - The Department of Safety's rules on explosives were reviewed, with concerns raised about the effective dates of forms and the voluntary request for Social Security numbers on certain forms. The committee considered conditional approval, with some members expressing discomfort with the voluntary disclosure of Social Security numbers.

6. **Prime Wetlands and Permit Extensions**:
   - The committee discussed the lack of clear rules regarding 40-day extensions for good cause in wetland permit applications. A motion was made to approve the rules on the condition that the Department seeks to amend Chapter 300 to include clearer guidelines.

7. **Legislative Intent and Workforce Development**:
   - The OPLC director emphasized that the rules were developed in response to HB 594, aimed at reducing barriers to workforce entry by allowing qualified individuals from other states to obtain licenses in New Hampshire. The director highlighted the efforts to consult with boards and incorporate their feedback, ensuring that the rules align with legislative intent while maintaining public safety.

### Overall Themes and Outcomes:
The meeting underscored the importance of ensuring that administrative rules align with statutory authority, address public safety concerns, and facilitate workforce development. Conditional approvals were granted for several rule changes, with further modifications expected to ensure compliance with the law. The discussions highlighted the need for clarity in licensing requirements, the importance of consulting with professional boards, and the challenges of implementing standardized testing for certain professions. The committee’s efforts reflect a commitment to balancing regulatory oversight with the need to reduce barriers to professional licensure in New Hampshire.
