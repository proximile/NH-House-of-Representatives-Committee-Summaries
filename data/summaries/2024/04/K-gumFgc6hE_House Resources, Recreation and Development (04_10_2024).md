**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Resources, Recreation, and Development (April 10, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee convened on April 10, 2024, to discuss a range of legislative proposals addressing mental health, outdoor recreation, water security, state park management, infrastructure funding, and economic development. Key topics and discussions from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **1. Mental Health and Outdoor Recreation (Senate Bill 387)**
- **Proposal**: A pilot program to provide free state park passes to individuals served by Community Mental Health Centers and recovery centers, aimed at promoting mental health and recovery through outdoor recreation.
- **Support**: Senator David Waters and representatives from NAMI New Hampshire and Riverbend Community Mental Health highlighted the mental health benefits of outdoor activities and the financial barriers many clients face. The Division of Parks and Recreation supported the initiative, emphasizing mechanisms for anonymized data collection to evaluate the program’s success.
- **Concerns**: Transportation for clients and logistical challenges in pass distribution were raised. The bill includes provisions to address these issues while ensuring the program’s effectiveness.

---

### **2. Metal Detecting and Treasure Hunting (RSA 227-C:122)**
- **Proposal**: Amendments to prohibit metal detecting on athletic fields and school grounds due to safety concerns, including injuries from uncovered holes dug by users. The bill also updates the term "dumps" to "transfer stations."
- **Debate**: Discussions centered on whether the prohibition should be a state mandate or left to local control. Concerns were raised about the broad definition of "school grounds," with suggestions to refine the language to allow local flexibility.

---

### **3. Water Security and Desalination Study (House Bill 301)**
- **Proposal**: A study to explore the feasibility of desalination or alternative water treatment plants (e.g., reverse osmosis) in New Hampshire, addressing water supply issues from natural disasters or landfill contamination.
- **Support**: Senator Kevin Avard emphasized the need for a "Plan B" for water security, particularly in coastal areas. The study would examine costs, benefits, and environmental impacts.
- **Context**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) highlighted existing water supply studies and ongoing efforts, such as interconnecting water systems and addressing challenges for small water suppliers.

---

### **4. State Park Fees and Resident Priority (Senate Bill 345)**
- **Proposal**: Adjusting state park entry fees to prioritize New Hampshire residents by doubling fees for out-of-state visitors while keeping in-state fees at $4.
- **Concerns**: Brian Wilson (Division of Parks and Recreation) and Jim Chase (Seacoast Science Center) opposed the bill, citing potential disruptions to tourism, reduced revenue, and operational complexity. They emphasized the self-funded nature of the park system and the economic impact of out-of-state visitors.
- **Alternatives**: Suggestions included prioritizing in-state reservations, implementing staggered booking windows, and conducting a comprehensive review of the fee structure to account for inflation and capacity issues.

---

### **5. Wastewater Engineering and Infrastructure (Senate Bill 492)**
- **Proposal**: Clarifying the term "intercepting" in RSA 486 for state aid grants for sewer infrastructure projects, increasing wastewater operator certificate fees (from $50 to $100) to fund training and equipment upgrades, and updating the term "Consulting Engineers" to "Consulting Engineering Firms."
- **Impact**: The bill aims to ensure consistent application of grants and improve funding for wastewater infrastructure projects.

---

### **6. Dam Maintenance and Funding (Senate Bill 549)**
- **Proposal**: Addressing funding shortfalls for the maintenance of state-owned dams by forming a committee to explore new revenue sources (e.g., gas taxes or shoreline maintenance fees) and clarifying procedures for reclassifying non-menace dams.
- **Challenges**: Corey Clark (Dam Bureau) highlighted the declining revenues from hydropower leases and the $300 million needed to rehabilitate high-hazard dams. The bill also allows revenue from the sale or lease of dams to be deposited into the dam maintenance fund.

---

### **7. Economic Development through Wastewater Surcharge (Senate Bill 589)**
- **Proposal**: Allowing municipalities to allocate funds from a 15% surcharge on out-of-town wastewater customers towards economic development initiatives, similar to a 2021 bill that benefited Dairy.
- **Support**: Representatives from Dairy and Londonderry emphasized the economic benefits of regional cooperation and shared infrastructure, enabling towns to extend sewer services and fund local development projects.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Mental Health and Recreation**: The committee recognized the importance of outdoor activities for mental health and supported pilot programs to increase accessibility.
- **Public Safety and Local Control**: Debates on metal detecting highlighted the balance between state mandates and local flexibility.
- **Water Security and Infrastructure**: Proposals for desalination studies and wastewater infrastructure improvements underscored the need for long-term planning and funding.
- **State Park Management**: Discussions on fee structures and resident priority revealed the challenges of balancing revenue, tourism, and equitable access.
- **Economic Development**: Innovative funding mechanisms, such as wastewater surcharges, were seen as vital for regional economic growth and infrastructure development.

The meeting concluded with a focus on refining legislative proposals, addressing concerns, and ensuring that policies align with the state’s priorities for public health, safety, and economic prosperity.
