The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee meeting on April 10, 2024, covered a wide range of topics, including state park fees, mental health initiatives, wastewater management, water resource planning, and infrastructure funding. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **State Park Fees and Access**
Two significant bills focused on state park fees and accessibility were discussed:

1. **SB 345: State Park Fees for State Residents**  
   - This bill proposes updating state park fees, with a focus on differentiating fees for residents and non-residents. The Commissioner of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources would set separate fee schedules, potentially doubling fees for out-of-state visitors while keeping resident fees unchanged.  
   - **Key Points:**  
     - Proponents argued the bill would generate revenue and prioritize access for New Hampshire residents, who often struggle to secure park reservations due to high out-of-state demand.  
     - Opponents, including the Division of Parks and Recreation and the Seacoast Science Center, expressed concerns about deterring tourism and reducing revenue, which is critical for the self-funded park system.  

2. **SB 387: State Park Pass Pilot Program for Recovery Centers and Community Mental Health Centers**  
   - This bill establishes a pilot program providing free state park passes to participants in state-registered recovery centers and community mental health centers.  
   - **Key Points:**  
     - The $3,000 pilot program, funded by the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs, aims to support mental health and recovery through outdoor recreation.  
     - The Division of Parks and Recreation supports the initiative, recognizing the health benefits of outdoor activities.

### **Mental Health and Outdoor Recreation**
Holly Stevens from NAMI New Hampshire testified in favor of SB 387, emphasizing the mental health benefits of outdoor recreation and the financial barriers faced by many individuals. Discussions also highlighted the importance of outdoor spaces in promoting recovery and well-being, particularly in the post-pandemic era.

---

### **Metal Detecting Restrictions**
Senator Carrie Gendron proposed amendments to RSA 227-C:122 to prohibit metal detecting on athletic fields and school grounds due to safety concerns and damage caused by unregulated digging. The discussion included clarifying definitions and whether local municipalities should control such restrictions.

---

### **Wastewater and Sewer Management**
Several bills addressed wastewater and sewer infrastructure:

1. **SB 492: Wastewater Engineering Updates**  
   - This bill clarifies terminology in sewer-related statutes, increases wastewater operator certificate fees from $50 to $100 to fund training and equipment, and updates the pre-qualified engineering firms list by removing individual engineers.  
   - Tracy Wood from the Wastewater Engineering Bureau supported the bill, emphasizing the need for modernization and clarity in funding and qualifications.  

2. **House Bill 2 and Wastewater Projects**  
   - Discussions focused on the one-year warranty period for wastewater projects before state payments begin, with calls to streamline the application process to align with this requirement.  

---

### **Planned Unit Development (PUD) and Sewer Capacity**
The committee discussed a PUD project straddling I-93, which includes 350 residential units, 300 institutional beds, a 200-bed hotel, and 700,000 square feet of commercial space. The project faces sewer capacity challenges, with options including a costly pipeline to Manchester or leveraging an existing intermunicipal agreement with Derry. The economic benefits, including millions in tax revenue, were highlighted.

---

### **Water Resource Planning and Desalination**
**House Bill 301** proposes a study on the feasibility of establishing a desalination plant or alternative water treatment systems (e.g., reverse osmosis) along the Seacoast. The bill aims to address water contamination risks from landfills, rising tides, and other environmental threats. Senator Kevin Avard emphasized the need for alternative water resources, citing ongoing water quality issues. Concerns were raised about overlapping efforts with existing studies, and suggestions were made to broaden the scope to include other water treatment methods and environmental impacts.

---

### **Dams and Infrastructure Funding**
1. **SB 549: Dams and Funding**  
   - This bill addresses the inspection, transfer, and funding of dams, including forming a committee to study alternative funding sources for dam maintenance. Corey Clark from the Dam Bureau highlighted the need for $414 million to repair state-owned dams, given decreasing revenue from hydropower leases.  

2. **SB 589: Economic Development Funds**  
   - This bill allows Derry to allocate funds from a surcharge on out-of-town wastewater customers toward economic development initiatives, mirroring a previous bill for water systems.  

---

### **Regionalization and Resource Sharing**
Brian Chirichello, a Derry town councilor, emphasized the importance of regionalizing resources, such as sharing water and wastewater systems with neighboring towns, to benefit the regional economy.

---

### **Key Themes**
- **Self-Funding Model:** New Hampshire’s state park system relies on user fees, necessitating a balance between revenue generation and equitable access.  
- **Mental Health Focus:** Outdoor recreation is increasingly recognized as a vital tool for mental health and recovery.  
- **Infrastructure Modernization:** Updates to wastewater and sewer management systems aim to improve clarity, funding, and compliance.  
- **Proactive Water Resource Planning:** Efforts to explore desalination and alternative water treatment systems reflect the need to address contamination risks and ensure long-term water security.  
- **Regional Collaboration:** Regionalization of resources and infrastructure projects is seen as a key strategy for economic growth and sustainability.  

The meeting concluded with discussions on potential amendments and the importance of proactive planning to address the state’s resource, recreation, and development needs.
