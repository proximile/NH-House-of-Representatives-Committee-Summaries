The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare held a public hearing on **Senate Bill 478**, which addresses licensing and administrative changes for childcare, residential care, and child-placing agencies. The bill was introduced by **Senator Sharon Carson**, who outlined its key provisions:

1. **Administrative Fines**: Extends fines for non-compliance to residential care and child-placing agencies, aligning them with existing daycare and recreation camp regulations.
2. **Elimination of Employment Eligibility Cards**: Removes the requirement for childcare employment eligibility cards, as staff eligibility information is accessible through the New Hampshire Connections Information System.
3. **Notification Simplification**: Eliminates the requirement for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to notify local health and fire departments about licensing, as these entities are already involved in the application process and licensing results are publicly available online.
4. **Licensing Cycle Alignment**: Changes the specialized care licensing cycle from two to three years, consistent with other childcare entities.

Representatives from **Early Learning New Hampshire** and **DHHS** testified in support of the bill, emphasizing the reduced administrative burden on childcare providers and the need for consistent enforcement mechanisms, including the introduction of a $2,000 penalty for non-compliance in residential care programs.

The committee voted **7-0** to recommend the bill **Ought to Pass**, with no discussion or objections. The committee report was scheduled to be completed by noon.
