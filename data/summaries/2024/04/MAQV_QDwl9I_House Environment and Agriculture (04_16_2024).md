The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on April 16, 2024, to discuss and vote on several Senate bills related to environmental and agricultural matters.

### **Legislative Discussions and Votes**

1. **SB 385 - Cost of Care Fund**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill aims to streamline reimbursements to third parties (e.g., rescues, shelters) for the care of animals seized in cruelty cases, bypassing municipal budgets that often lack sufficient funds.
   - **Testimony**: Senator Howard Pearl and Commissioner Sean Jasper highlighted the billâ€™s importance, citing high-profile cases like the Wolfeboro Great Danes incident. The fund would allow direct payments to third parties, alleviating financial burdens on towns.
   - **Amendments**: Discussions focused on clarifying eligibility for third parties and ensuring proper oversight of fund disbursements. Suggestions included making the bill effective immediately rather than after 60 days.
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously supported the bill, recognizing its significance in addressing animal cruelty cases without straining municipal budgets.

2. **SB 545 - Study Committee on Veterinary Technicians**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes a study committee to explore expanding the role of veterinary technicians, particularly in addressing the shortage of large animal veterinarians.
   - **Testimony**: Jenny Horan (on behalf of Senator Apprentice) and Rob Johnson (NH Farm Bureau) emphasized the nationwide veterinarian shortage and the potential for vet techs to alleviate workload pressures, especially in rural areas.
   - **Amendments**: Representative Bixby proposed increasing the committee size from three to four members to ensure quorum and smoother operations.
   - **Outcome**: The committee adopted the amendment and moved to execute the bill, highlighting the need to explore solutions to the veterinarian shortage.

3. **SB 329 - Background Checks for Solid Waste Management Personnel**:
   - **Purpose**: Introduced by Senator Howard Pearl, the bill addresses a technical error in a previous bill (SB 211) that limited background checks to directors and officers, excluding other key personnel.
   - **Discussion**: The correction ensures background checks can be conducted on all relevant individuals, including facility managers and decision-makers.
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously recommended the bill for passage (OTP) and placed it on the consent calendar.

4. **SB 587 - Quarantine Rules for Animals Brought into the State**:
   - **Purpose**: Introduced by Senator Howard Pearl, the bill allows littermates (e.g., puppies or kittens) to be quarantined together rather than separately, addressing concerns from rescue organizations.
   - **Discussion**: Questions about age restrictions were clarified, noting that existing statutes prohibit transferring animals under eight weeks old. The bill grants the Department of Agriculture rulemaking authority to implement these changes.
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously recommended the bill for passage (OTP) and placed it on the consent calendar.
