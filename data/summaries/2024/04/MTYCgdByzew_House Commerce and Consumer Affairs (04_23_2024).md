The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on April 23, 2024, to discuss several key bills aimed at improving healthcare access, insurance coverage, and consumer protections.

### **Healthcare and Insurance Coverage Bills**

1. **Prosthetic Coverage for Children (SB 177)**:
   - **Purpose**: Requires private insurers to cover activity-specific prosthetics for children under 19, ensuring they can participate in sports and physical activities.
   - **Testimony**: Aiden, an 11-year-old cancer survivor and amputee, and his mother shared their struggle to afford a running blade, which was not covered by insurance. Kate Martin, a certified prosthetist, emphasized the physical and mental health benefits of such coverage, noting its minimal cost impact on insurers.
   - **Support**: The bill is backed by organizations like the Hanger Clinic, which highlighted similar legislation in other states. It builds on the Affordable Care Act’s essential health benefits.

2. **Lead Testing Coverage (SB 399)**:
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies that insurance must cover blood lead testing and follow-up tests for children without cost-sharing.
   - **Testimony**: Molly Ellis shared her son’s lead poisoning experience, stressing the importance of early detection. Kirsten Cornell from NH Legal Assistance highlighted the economic and health impacts of lead poisoning, particularly in older housing.

3. **Medicaid Third-Party Liability (SB 312)**:
   - **Purpose**: Aligns state Medicaid practices with federal requirements regarding third-party liability for healthcare costs.
   - **Testimony**: John Williams from the NH Department of Health and Human Services explained the bill’s technical adjustments to ensure compliance with federal law.

4. **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy for Down Syndrome (SB 353)**:
   - **Purpose**: Expands insurance coverage for ABA therapy to include individuals with Down Syndrome, addressing a gap in current coverage.
   - **Testimony**: Parents and advocates, including Amy Ray and Will Walker, shared personal stories of ABA therapy’s transformative impact, improving communication, safety, and social skills. Concerns were raised about clinical evidence and provider shortages, but supporters emphasized the fiscal responsibility of the bill (estimated at 18 cents per insurance member per year).

5. **Pelvic Floor Therapy Coverage (SB 176)**:
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies insurance coverage for pelvic floor therapy, particularly for postpartum care.
   - **Testimony**: Senator Rebecca Perkins Kwoka highlighted the need for consistent reimbursement for providers, as some face uncertainty in getting coverage.

### **Consumer Protections and Surprise Billing**

6. **Alignment with the No Surprises Act (SB 173)**:
   - **Purpose**: Aligns state law with the federal No Surprises Act, protecting consumers from unexpected medical bills in emergency or out-of-network situations.
   - **Key Provisions**: Establishes a state-level independent dispute resolution (IDR) process, improves price transparency, and expands the Patients' Bill of Rights. Ground ambulance services are excluded.
   - **Testimony**: DJ Bettencourt, Commissioner of the NH Insurance Department, emphasized the three-year effort to harmonize state and federal laws, ensuring consistent consumer protections.

7. **Prior Authorization Reform (SB 561)**:
   - **Purpose**: Streamlines prior authorization processes to reduce delays in patient care and improve transparency.
   - **Key Provisions**: Sets turnaround times (72 hours for urgent requests, 7 days for non-urgent), requires peer-to-peer review, and mandates automatic approval if deadlines are missed.
   - **Testimony**: Stakeholders, including the NH Hospital Association and NAMI NH, praised the bill for reducing administrative burdens and improving access to care. Concerns about financial impact were addressed with a focus on long-term savings.

### **EMS and Ambulance Service Reimbursement (SB 407)**

8. **Ambulance Reimbursement and Balance Billing (SB 407)**:
   - **Purpose**: Establishes a minimum payment floor (325% of Medicare rates) for ambulance services and requires direct payment to providers.
   - **Challenges**: Rural EMS providers highlighted financial struggles due to low reimbursement rates, delayed payments, and balance billing. They argued that current rates do not cover operational costs, forcing reliance on taxpayer funding.
   - **Support**: Fire chiefs, ambulance directors, and municipal representatives emphasized the need for fair reimbursement to sustain services.
   - **Opposition**: Insurance companies, including Anthem, raised concerns about increased premiums and the lack of a balance billing ban. The Insurance Department proposed an alternative amendment setting rates at 165% to 200% of Medicare and prohibiting balance billing.
   - **Broader Issues**: The debate highlighted nationwide challenges driven by low Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, particularly affecting small, rural towns.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Consumer Protection**: Multiple bills aimed to protect vulnerable populations, including children, patients facing surprise medical bills, and individuals with disabilities.
- **Alignment with Federal Law**: Efforts were made to harmonize state laws with federal regulations, such as the No Surprises Act and the Affordable Care Act.
- **Access to Care**: The discussions emphasized closing gaps in insurance coverage to ensure patients and families do not face financial barriers to necessary medical devices and services.
- **Rural vs. Urban Challenges**: Unique challenges faced by rural areas, particularly in EMS and ambulance services, were a recurring theme, with calls for equitable reimbursement and sustainable funding models.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Many bills resulted from extensive collaboration among legislators, healthcare providers, insurers, and advocacy groups, though some issues, like SB 407, remained contentious.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the legislature’s focus on improving healthcare access, protecting consumers, and addressing systemic issues in insurance and emergency services. While there was strong support for many bills, debates over reimbursement rates, balance billing, and long-term fiscal impacts underscored the complexity of these issues. The committee’s next steps will involve refining bills, addressing technical flaws, and finding balanced solutions that benefit patients, providers, and insurers.
