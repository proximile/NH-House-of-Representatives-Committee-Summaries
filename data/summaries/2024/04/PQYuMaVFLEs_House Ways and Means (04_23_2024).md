### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (04/23/2024)

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on April 23, 2024, to discuss a range of legislative bills focused on taxation, charitable gaming, LLC liability, and land conservation. The meeting highlighted the complexity of these issues and the need for precise legislative language to address legal gray areas, ensure fair revenue distribution, and clarify responsibilities. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Charitable Gaming and Historic Racing**
The committee addressed several bills related to charitable gaming and historic horse racing, focusing on regulation, revenue distribution, and legal clarity:
- **Advanced Deposit Wagering (ADW) (SB 432)**: This bill seeks to regulate online betting on historic horse racing, which currently operates in a legal gray area. The bill aims to establish a licensing and taxation framework, with revenue directed to charities through a third-party nonprofit intermediary. Stakeholders, including Churchill Downs, supported the bill, emphasizing the need for clarity and fairness. However, some legislators raised concerns about the legality of past unregulated activities and whether the state should pursue back taxes. The committee voted 13-6 to recommend killing the bill (ITL), citing issues with clarity and compliance.
- **Charitable Gaming Licensing (SP 472)**: The committee debated the allocation of gaming dates to municipalities and charities, with concerns that municipalities might not benefit due to high demand from charities. While the billâ€™s language was deemed solid, the committee acknowledged that municipalities might see limited immediate benefits. The bill passed unanimously (19-0) and was placed on consent.
- **Lucky 7 Gaming Machines (SP 597)**: The committee discussed eliminating the requirement for printed receipts for Lucky 7 machines, as players often discard them. Despite concerns that these machines resemble slot machines, it was clarified that they are electronic versions of pull-tab tickets with predetermined outcomes. The bill passed 18-1 and was placed on consent.

#### **2. LLC Liability for Unpaid Taxes**
The committee examined **SP 585**, which addresses liability for unpaid meals and rooms taxes within LLCs:
- The bill aims to hold managing entities of LLCs liable for unpaid taxes, rather than silent investors. There was extensive debate over the definition of "managerial capacity" and whether it should include non-member managers. The Department of Revenue Administration suggested clarifying the language to include both members and non-members who manage the LLC. The committee decided to delay execution of the bill until their next meeting to allow for further clarification and a revenue update.

#### **3. Land Conservation and Easements**
The committee discussed **SB 546**, which proposes changes to the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP):
- The bill seeks to streamline LCHIP operations by removing the requirement for the state to hold an executory interest in easements, as it is deemed unnecessary to protect public investments. Other changes include clarifying funding purposes and removing redundant legal obligations. The bill, described as a "housekeeping measure," received unanimous support in the Senate and from the LCHIP board. The committee passed it unanimously (19-0) and placed it on consent.

#### **4. Land Trust Easements and Deeds**
The committee clarified the legal framework of land trust easements, emphasizing that an easement is a separate legal document from the title deed. The easement runs with the land regardless of ownership and is held by the land trust. The discussion underscored the importance of precise legal definitions in land conservation efforts.

#### **5. Executive Session Votes and Next Steps**
The committee held executive sessions to vote on several bills:
- **SB 472**: Passed unanimously (19-0) and placed on consent.
- **SB 432**: Motion to "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate) passed 13-6.
- **SB 597**: Passed 18-1 and placed on consent.
- **SB 546**: Passed unanimously (19-0) and placed on consent.
The committee aims to finalize all bills by May 16th, with members submitting reports by noon the following day to expedite the process.
