**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (April 24, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 24, 2024, centered on two primary legislative issues: **Senate Bill 440 (SB 440)**, which seeks to expand the scope of practice for optometrists, and **Senate Bill 481 (SB 481)**, which proposes elevating Juneteenth to a state holiday. The discussions also briefly touched on **Senate Bill 373**, concerning air exchange rates in new homes. Below is a detailed summary of the key debates and outcomes:

---

### **Senate Bill 440: Expanding Optometrists’ Scope of Practice**
SB 440 aims to modernize New Hampshire’s optometry regulations by granting the **New Hampshire Board of Optometry** the authority to regulate the profession and allow optometrists to perform certain advanced procedures, such as minor surgeries and laser treatments, without requiring legislative approval for each update. The bill sparked intense debate between optometrists and ophthalmologists, focusing on **access to care**, **patient safety**, and **professional autonomy**.

#### **Key Arguments in Favor:**
1. **Access to Care**: Proponents, including optometrists, argued that expanding their scope of practice would improve access to eye care, particularly in rural areas where ophthalmologists are scarce. They highlighted cases where patients face long wait times or cannot afford referrals for procedures optometrists are trained to perform.
2. **Training and Competency**: Optometrists emphasized their rigorous education and clinical training, including hands-on experience in states where similar procedures are already permitted. They noted that 12 states allow optometrists to perform laser procedures without adverse outcomes.
3. **Regulatory Efficiency**: The bill would eliminate the need for frequent legislative updates, allowing the Board of Optometry to adapt to advancements in the field. Proponents argued this aligns New Hampshire with other states where doctoral-level healthcare professions have similar autonomy.
4. **Continuity of Care**: Supporters highlighted that allowing optometrists to perform certain procedures would improve continuity of care and reduce duplicative services.

#### **Key Arguments Against:**
1. **Patient Safety**: Ophthalmologists and other opponents raised concerns about patient safety, arguing that optometrists lack the extensive surgical training and experience required for procedures like laser surgeries and eyelid surgeries. They emphasized that complications could lead to permanent vision loss or other severe outcomes.
2. **Training Disparities**: Critics noted that optometrists do not receive hands-on surgical training during their education, often practicing on plastic eyes or chicken breasts, which does not replicate real-life surgical conditions. In contrast, ophthalmologists undergo 8-10 years of post-college training, including surgical residencies.
3. **Complications in Other States**: Opponents cited examples from states like Oklahoma and Kentucky, where optometrists performing laser procedures have led to complications, including misdiagnoses and improper use of lasers.
4. **Lack of Legislative Oversight**: Critics argued that the bill grants the Board of Optometry sole authority to determine the scope of practice, potentially leading to unchecked expansion without sufficient safeguards.

#### **Subcommittee Review:**
The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review, with both supporters and opponents expressing willingness to participate in ongoing discussions. The subcommittee will evaluate the details of the bill, address concerns about patient safety and training standards, and consider potential compromises.

### **Senate Bill 481: Elevating Juneteenth to a State Holiday**
SB 481 sought to elevate Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the United States, from a day of observance to a state holiday in New Hampshire. The discussion also included an amendment to ensure the official names of state holidays are used in communications like calendars.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Historical Significance**: Proponents, including Senator Perkins’ representative, emphasized Juneteenth’s importance as a historical milestone and argued that recognizing it as a state holiday would align New Hampshire with other states.
2. **Financial and Operational Concerns**: Opponents raised concerns about the potential costs to municipalities and schools, particularly if Juneteenth (June 19th) conflicts with school exams or other activities.
3. **Amendment Proposal**: Representative Susan Pelli introduced an amendment to ensure schools and municipalities use the official names of state holidays in communications, preventing renaming (e.g., Juneteenth as "Black Lives Matter Day").
4. **Committee Vote**: The committee voted **16-0** to recommend the bill as **inexpedient to legislate**, citing concerns about the financial and operational impacts of adding another state holiday and the belief that the current observance of Juneteenth is sufficient.

### **Senate Bill 373: Adjusting Air Exchange Rates in New Homes**
The meeting briefly discussed **Senate Bill 373**, which proposed increasing the maximum air exchange rate in new homes from three to five air changes per hour to improve indoor air quality.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Health Concerns**: Supporters argued that the change would address health issues related to poor indoor air quality.
2. **Opposition from Building Officials**: The New Hampshire Building Officials Association opposed the bill, arguing that such changes should go through the standard building code review process rather than being legislated directly.
3. **Home Builders’ Support**: The Home Builders Association supported the bill, citing challenges in meeting the current three-air-exchange standard and its impact on home affordability and health.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the tension between **access to care** and **patient safety** in the debate over SB 440, with optometrists advocating for expanded scope of practice and ophthalmologists emphasizing the need for rigorous training and oversight. The committee’s decision to recommend SB 481 as inexpedient to legislate reflected concerns about the practical implications of adding another state holiday, while the brief discussion on SB 373 underscored the importance of following established processes for technical issues like building codes. Both bills will undergo further review and deliberation in subcommittees.
