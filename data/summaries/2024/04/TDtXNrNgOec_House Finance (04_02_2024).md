**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Finance Committee Meeting (04/02/2024)**

On April 2, 2024, the New Hampshire House Finance Committee convened to deliberate on a range of bills and amendments, focusing on judicial reform, education funding, public safety, and fiscal responsibility. The meeting began with introductions of committee replacements, including representatives from education, election law, housing, and judiciary committees.

**Key Legislative Discussions and Actions:**

1. **Judicial and Bail Reform**:
   - **House Bill 1005 (Judicial Training)**: Incorporated into **House Bill 318**, HB 1005 faced concerns from its sponsor regarding its inclusion in bail reform legislation. However, the committee argued that combining it with HB 318 would enhance its chances of passage.
   - **Senate Bill 252 (Electronic Monitoring Program)**: Deemed redundant as its provisions were included in HB 318, SB 252 was voted "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).
   - **House Bill 318 (Bail Commissioners)**: The committee discussed an amendment increasing the number of magistrates from five to ten and awaited a fiscal note before finalizing its decision. The bill combines several bail reform measures, including judicial training and electronic monitoring.

2. **Election Law**:
   - **House Bill 1577 (Digital Images of Ballots)**: Amended to reduce costs by eliminating state employee-led viewing sessions, the bill passed with a close vote, allowing public access to digital images of ballots from new voting machines.

3. **Veterans and Public Safety**:
   - **House Bill 1589 (Veterans Courts)**: Amended to reduce costs from $2 million annually to $5,000 per case, capped at $200,000 annually, the bill passed unanimously, establishing veterans courts similar to drug courts.

4. **Cannabis Legalization**:
   - **House Bill 1633 (Cannabis Legalization and Regulation)**: Amended to include fiscal oversight and quarterly updates, the bill passed unanimously.

5. **Transportation**:
   - **House Bill 1202 (Driveway Permits)**: Amended to streamline the approval process for driveway alterations on state roads, the bill passed with strong support.

6. **Education Funding**:
   - **House Bill 1583 (Education Funding)**: The bill, which increases per-pupil funding, passed with some opposition after an amendment was withdrawn due to cost concerns.
   - **House Bill 1656 (Special Education Funding)**: Amended to categorize students based on their needs, the bill passed after a second amendment proposing increased funding was defeated.

7. **Financial and Procedural Amendments**:
   - **Amendments and Costs**: The committee debated the financial implications of various amendments, including the $1.6 million annual cost for a bail information system versus a preferred $800,000 cost, and the one-time $1.7 million cost for upgrading computer systems.
   - **Bail Commissioners and Magistrates**: Discussions included increasing bail commissioners' fees from $40 to $60 and the necessity and number of magistrates needed to handle serious crimes.

8. **Employee Assistance Program (EAP)**:
   - A bill proposing to extend the EAP to members of the general court and their families was narrowly defeated (13-12) due to concerns about personal benefit forecasting and constitutional compensation limits.

9. **Social Security for Children in State Custody**:
   - The committee approved a $150,000 consultant to study and recommend budget proposals for ensuring that Social Security benefits for children in state custody are used for their benefit, rather than going into the general fund.

10. **Data Sharing Restrictions**:
    - A bill to restrict data sharing through the state immunization registry was unanimously approved after an amendment reduced the associated costs.

**Votes and Reports**:
The committee conducted roll call votes on several motions, including adopting amendments and passing bills as amended. Reports for each bill were assigned to specific representatives, with an emphasis on brevity and readiness for the upcoming legislative calendar.

**Conclusion**:
The meeting highlighted the committee's focus on cost management, judicial and bail reform, education funding, and public safety. Several bills passed with amendments aimed at reducing costs or improving oversight, reflecting the committee's commitment to fiscal responsibility and effective governance.
