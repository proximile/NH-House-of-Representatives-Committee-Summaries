**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (04/26/2024)**

On April 26, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened to evaluate the state's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan committee, tasked with investigating various aspects of the state's response, focused on mental health impacts, public messaging, vaccination policies, federal and state guidance, treatment protocols, and the broader societal and economic consequences of the pandemic. The meeting emphasized a science-based, fact-finding approach to identify lessons learned and recommend improvements for future public health emergencies.

### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Mental Health and Societal Impacts**:
   - **Resilience and Therapeutic Approaches**: Representative Belcher highlighted resilience as the default human condition, referencing Abigail Shrier’s *Bad Therapy*. The committee questioned whether excessive rumination and a therapeutic mindset worsened mental health outcomes during the pandemic, contrasting with more task-oriented individuals who fared better.
   - **Pandemic Effects**: The mental health consequences of lockdowns, including increased rates of addiction, alcoholism, and delayed education, were discussed. The committee debated whether public health messaging focusing on daily negative statistics (e.g., deaths) instilled fear rather than empowering individuals with actionable information.
   - **Call for Positive Messaging**: There was a push for more positive public health messages to mitigate fear and anxiety.

2. **Public Health Measures and Their Efficacy**:
   - **Lockdowns and Introspection**: The committee explored how lockdowns contributed to increased introspection and fear, potentially exacerbating mental health issues.
   - **Masking and Environmental Controls**: The effectiveness of mask mandates was debated, with concerns raised about their psychological and physical effects. The committee emphasized the importance of environmental controls, such as HVAC systems and fresh air, in mitigating virus spread.
   - **Social Distancing**: The lack of scientific basis for social distancing measures was highlighted, with a focus on the need for evidence-based public health policies.

3. **Vaccination Policies and Treatment Protocols**:
   - **Vaccine Efficacy and Mandates**: The committee questioned the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing virus transmission, particularly among healthcare professionals. The impact of vaccine mandates on healthcare staffing, leading to shortages in hospitals and nursing homes, was a significant concern.
   - **Treatment Restrictions and Medical Exemptions**: The restrictions on certain treatments and the denial of medical exemptions for vaccinations were examined, with personal anecdotes illustrating the consequences of these policies.
   - **Funding and Public Messaging**: The committee expressed interest in reviewing the funding and mechanisms behind public health advertisements, particularly those promoting vaccinations, and called for public assistance in gathering these materials for analysis.

4. **Federal vs. State Guidance**:
   - **Guidance Disconnect**: The committee noted confusion and inconsistency between state and federal guidelines, particularly in nursing homes, where federal mandates overrode state recommendations, leading to service reductions.
   - **Constitutional Implications**: The delegation of police powers and the constitutional implications of federal mandates on states were discussed, with a focus on ensuring that future public health measures respect individual rights.

5. **Scientific Research and Bias**:
   - **Research Integrity**: Concerns were raised about potential biases in pharmaceutical research and the selective publication of studies. The committee expressed a desire to hear from experts in scientific and statistical analysis to better understand these issues.

6. **Economic and Healthcare Impacts**:
   - **Healthcare Staffing**: The financial impact on hospitals due to reduced capacity and staffing shortages was discussed. The committee expressed interest in obtaining data on hospital bed availability and staffing levels before, during, and after the pandemic.
   - **Economic Consequences**: The broader economic impact of the pandemic, including the financial strain on healthcare systems and the need for better coordination between state and federal guidance, was highlighted.

7. **Future Recommendations**:
   - **Final Report Structure**: The committee discussed the structure of their final report, suggesting a topical breakdown with sections on testimony received, constitutional impacts, federalism, and recommendations for future pandemics.
   - **Stricter Scrutiny of Government Actions**: The committee considered recommending stricter scrutiny of government actions that impact individual rights, particularly in future public health emergencies.
   - **Positive Lessons and Mental Health Prioritization**: Emphasis was placed on learning positive lessons from the pandemic and ensuring that mental health and individual well-being are prioritized in future public health responses.

### Next Steps:
- **Upcoming Meetings**: The committee scheduled a full-day meeting on May 16 to discuss federal mandates and vaccine rollout, with a work session on May 17 featuring Commissioner Caswell to discuss federal funds and their distribution.
- **Public Engagement**: The committee encouraged public input, inviting grievances and petitions related to the state's COVID-19 response, and emphasized the importance of hearing from constituents about what worked and what didn’t.

Overall, the meeting reflected a comprehensive review of the state's COVID-19 response, with a focus on understanding the impacts of various policies and preparing more effectively for future public health emergencies. The committee adjourned with a commitment to continued investigation and public engagement to inform their final report and recommendations.
