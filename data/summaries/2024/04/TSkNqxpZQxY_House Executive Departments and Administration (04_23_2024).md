The transcript from the NH House of Representatives meeting on April 23, 2024, covers discussions and votes on several bills and amendments. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **SP 437**: The bill was discussed and deemed well-written by the subcommittee. A motion to pass it as is was approved without further debate.

2. **House Bill 439**: The committee opposed using the state's purchasing power for political posturing, particularly regarding boycotts of Israel. The bill was seen as ineffective due to an existing executive order. A motion to declare the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) passed 14-6.

3. **Senate Bill 480**: An amendment was proposed to adjust the effective date and remove problematic sections related to board staffing. The amendment and the bill were both passed unanimously.

4. **Senate Bill 437**: The subcommittee recommended passing the bill, which addresses municipal building code amendments. The bill aims to ensure consistency across the state and prevent municipalities from adopting unapproved codes. It passed unanimously.

5. **Senate Bill 372**: An amendment was introduced to increase the number of apprentices a plumber can have from one to two and clarify language. The amendment and the bill passed unanimously.

6. **Senate Bill 369**: An amendment was proposed to clarify public comment and testimony procedures. The amendment and the bill passed unanimously.

7. **Senate Bill 306**: An amendment was introduced to define "manufactured housing dispute resolution." The amendment and the bill passed unanimously.

8. **Senate Bill 485**: The bill, which included provisions for digitally verifiable licenses, was deemed too complex and costly. The committee moved to study the issue further, with a plan to address specific sections in a future amendment.

The meeting concluded with plans for upcoming public hearings and executive sessions to address remaining bills. Committee reports were also due, and a Minority Report was requested for the ITL vote on House Bill 439.
