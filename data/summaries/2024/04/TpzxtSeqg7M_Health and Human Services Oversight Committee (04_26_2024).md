**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (April 26, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on April 26, 2024, to address critical issues related to the state’s healthcare workforce, service delivery, and health improvement initiatives. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, focusing on workforce challenges, healthcare access, and strategies to improve health outcomes across the state. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Healthcare Workforce and Primary Care**
1. **Residency Programs and Rural Access**:
   - New Hampshire has two family medicine residencies in rural areas (Coos and Cheshire) and three family practice residencies at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Conquered Hospital, and Portsmouth Regional Hospital. These programs aim to increase the supply of primary care physicians, particularly in underserved rural areas.
   - In-state training and education were emphasized as critical factors for retaining healthcare providers, with rural physicians more likely to have graduated from New Hampshire medical schools or completed residencies in the state.

2. **Provider Trends and Retention**:
   - Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) and Physician Assistants (PAs) were highlighted as essential in addressing physician shortages, especially given the aging physician workforce.
   - The pandemic and burnout have leveled disparities in provider reductions between rural and non-rural areas, though challenges persist in both regions.

3. **Medical Education and Future Needs**:
   - The University of New England’s osteopathic program, which produces a high number of primary care providers, was noted as a positive influence.
   - The committee considered the potential establishment of a medical school at the University of New Hampshire to meet growing healthcare demands, though no formal discussions were reported.

4. **Primary Care Distribution**:
   - While primary care practice is relatively consistent across the state, New Hampshire still falls short of the WHO benchmark of 2.5 primary care providers per 1,000 residents, with a current rate of 1.66 per 1,000.
   - Federal grants and workforce initiatives have benefited rural areas like the Upper Valley and North Country.

### **Healthcare Services and Access**
1. **Home Care vs. Institutionalization**:
   - The state’s reliance on institutionalization for individuals with disabilities was contrasted with the challenges of hiring in-home care workers due to rate issues. Legislative efforts to improve rates were appreciated, as they positively impact service provision.

2. **Adult Dental Benefit Program**:
   - The committee celebrated the first anniversary of the adult dental benefit program, which has seen steady increases in unique members served and claims submitted. Efforts to expand the provider network and mobile services, particularly in underserved areas like Cheshire County, were discussed.

3. **Newborn Screening Program**:
   - The annual report on the newborn screening program highlighted the screening of 99% of newborns for 36 heritable conditions. Efforts to improve timeliness and reduce unsatisfactory specimens were emphasized, along with staffing changes and quality improvement activities.

4. **Out-of-Hospital Births**:
   - The increase in out-of-hospital births was discussed, with a focus on tracking and supporting these births to ensure compliance with newborn screening protocols.

### **State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP)**
1. **Holistic Health Improvements**:
   - Deputy Associate Commissioner Trish Tilly presented the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP), which focuses on four broad areas: access to opportunity, community health status and outcomes, social connectedness, and coordinated action across sectors.
   - The plan emphasizes addressing social determinants of health, such as housing, nutrition, and financial independence, and includes goals like reducing barriers to safe housing, improving nutrition, and promoting lifelong learning.

2. **Traditional Health Outcomes**:
   - The SHIP also targets traditional health outcomes, including expanding access to affordable dental and behavioral healthcare, improving maternal and child health services, and reducing substance misuse.
   - A significant focus is on combating loneliness and social isolation, which are linked to serious health risks.

3. **Community Health Workers (CHWs)**:
   - CHWs were recognized as crucial in addressing social determinants of health and connecting families to needed services. The state is working on certification for CHWs to enable Medicaid billing and ensure competency.

### **Medicaid Updates**
1. **Postpartum Coverage Expansion**:
   - Medicaid has expanded postpartum coverage from 60 days to one year, benefiting 137 women so far.
   - New Hampshire has made significant progress in Medicaid unwinding, with a high renewal rate and low backlog compared to other states.

2. **CFI Waiver Program**:
   - Improvements to the Choices for Independence (CFI) waiver program were discussed, with a focus on supporting aging in place. Regulatory changes now require 80% of CFI rate increases to go to direct service providers.

### **Environmental Health and Legislative Support**
1. **Environmental Health Concerns**:
   - The committee discussed environmental health issues, such as lead exposure and water testing, and the need for public health involvement in permitting processes for projects like asphalt plants and transfer stations.

2. **Legislative Support and Future Goals**:
   - The department expressed gratitude for legislative support in areas like Medicaid expansion, housing, and behavioral health. Strategic investments were emphasized as essential to continue progress in health improvement areas.

### **Future Focus and Collaboration**
- The committee committed to ongoing collaboration and strategic planning to address the state’s health and human services priorities. The next meeting was scheduled for May 24, 2024, with a continued focus on healthcare workforce analysis and improvement initiatives.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for policy interventions to support education, training, and retention of healthcare providers, particularly in rural areas. It also highlighted the importance of addressing social determinants of health, improving access to care, and leveraging programs like Medicaid and the adult dental benefit to enhance health outcomes for all New Hampshire residents.
