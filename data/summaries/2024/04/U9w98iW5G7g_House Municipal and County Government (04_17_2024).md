**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Municipal and County Government (April 17, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 17, 2024, to discuss several bills related to municipal and county governance. The session focused on enhancing transparency, local control, and practical solutions for public health, financial management, and infrastructure maintenance. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed:

---

### **Senate Bill 63: Public Health Ordinances**
- **Purpose**: To limit the authority of municipal health officers to regulate nuisances and similar public health threats, preventing overreach into broader mandates like mask requirements or vaccinations.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to clarify the scope of health officers' authority, ensuring it remains within well-defined legal boundaries for nuisances.
  - Examples of overreach, such as mask mandates and restrictions on businesses, were cited as motivations for the bill.
  - After several public hearings and amendments, the health officers' association no longer opposes the bill, indicating consensus.
  - Concerns were raised about the clarity of the bill’s language and its potential limitations during public health emergencies.

### **Senate Bill 532: Financial Transparency**
- **Purpose**: Requires municipalities and school districts to post on their official websites the amount of state funds received (e.g., allocations or grants) within 30 days to increase transparency.
- **Key Points**:
  - If a municipality lacks a website, the information must be posted in two public places.
  - The bill does not dictate how funds are used but encourages sharing this information to foster community engagement.
  - Concerns were raised about potential confusion if both schools and municipalities post the same funds, but it was clarified that funds are allocated separately.
  - The bill is seen as a first step toward greater transparency, with potential future improvements like linking to state-level databases.

### **Senate Bill 491: Private Road Maintenance**
- **Purpose**: Allows municipalities to enter into agreements with private road owners for maintenance or repairs without assuming long-term liability.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill addresses issues like gravel runoff into lakes, particularly in towns like Wakefield, where private roads are common.
  - Written consent from all property owners is required for such agreements.
  - Concerns were raised about liability, fairness, and the potential for towns to be forced into long-term obligations.
  - The bill is seen as enabling short-term agreements with protections for both municipalities and property owners.

### **Senate Bill 383: Local Tax and School Budget Caps**
- **Purpose**: Enables towns and school districts to adopt tax and budget caps based on inflation and population changes rather than fixed percentages or dollar amounts.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to provide flexibility and protection against inflation, particularly as student populations decline.
  - Caps require a 60% supermajority for adoption but can be overridden with a three-fifths supermajority at town or school district meetings.
  - Supporters, including the School District Governance Association, argue the bill prevents "runaway budgets" and offers tax relief.
  - Opponents, such as the New Hampshire School Boards Association, argue it limits voter choice and flexibility.
  - The bill includes provisions for bonding, ensuring only the first-year bond payment is included in the tax cap calculation.

### **Senate Bill 531: Background Checks for Health Officers**
- **Purpose**: Removes the requirement for municipalities to send health officer candidates' background checks to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) before nomination, restoring local authority.
- **Key Points**:
  - DHHS retains oversight in appointments and terminations but no longer reviews background checks.
  - The bill reduces administrative burdens and privacy concerns while maintaining accountability.
  - Questions were raised about DHHS’s role in oversight and the process for disqualifying candidates.

---

### **Senate Bill 447: Study Committee on Transportation Expenses**
- **Purpose**: Proposes a study committee to examine the inclusion of transportation expenses in school district default budgets.
- **Key Points**:
  - Rising transportation costs and the complexity of default budget calculations prompted the bill.
  - Supporters, including the NH School Board Association, highlighted the challenges school districts face with unclear rules.
  - Questions were raised about whether a study committee is necessary versus immediate legislative action.

### **Key Themes Across Bills**
1. **Local Control**: Many bills emphasized empowering municipalities and school districts to make decisions tailored to their needs.
2. **Transparency**: Efforts to increase financial transparency and community engagement were central to SB 532.
3. **Practical Solutions**: Bills like SB 491 and SB 383 addressed real-world challenges, such as private road maintenance and tax cap flexibility.
4. **Accountability and Oversight**: While restoring local authority, bills like SB 531 retained mechanisms for oversight and accountability.
5. **Environmental and Economic Concerns**: Issues like gravel runoff into lakes and the impact of inflation on budgets were highlighted as motivations for legislative action.

### **Outcome and Next Steps**
The committee planned to hold further hearings and executive sessions to refine the bills. Discussions reflected a balance between local autonomy and the need for clear, practical governance solutions. The session underscored the importance of addressing both immediate challenges and long-term structural issues in municipal and county governance.
