### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Senate Bill 595: Pole Attachment Rates and Broadband Access**
- **Purpose:** Establishes a formula for resolving disputes over pole attachment rates, aligning New Hampshire’s rules with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) standards to promote universal broadband access.
- **Key Provisions:**
  - Replaces the current multi-part test with a streamlined, formula-based system for calculating rates.
  - Introduces an accelerated dispute resolution process to reduce delays (currently up to 180 days).
  - Requires pole owners to maintain transparent records of attachment rates.
- **Support:**
  - Supported by NECTA, Crown Castle, and Eversource for providing consistency, transparency, and accelerating broadband deployment.
- **Opposition:**
  - The New Hampshire Telephone Association (NHTA) and Granite State Communications argued it would harm smaller pole owners and disrupt private negotiations.
  - Consumer Advocate Donald Kreis warned of potential ratepayer cost increases due to lost pole owner revenues.
- **Outcome:** The committee considered sending the bill to interim study for further analysis.

#### **2. Senate Bill 603: Conservation of the 603 Area Code**

  - The cultural and economic significance of the 603 area code was emphasized.
- **Outcome:** The bill remained under discussion, with questions about cost and efficiency.

#### **3. Senate Bill 449: Air Permit Processing Timeline**
- **Purpose:** Establishes a 180-day timeline for the Department of Environmental Services (DES) to act on air permit applications, replacing the current "reasonable time" standard.
- **Key Provisions:**
  - Applies to non-affected sources (e.g., hospitals, small manufacturers) but excludes Title V sources regulated under the Clean Air Act.
- **Debate:**
  - DES supported the bill, citing resource constraints and the need for public engagement.
  - The Business and Industry Association (BIA) opposed it, arguing it could harm small businesses and suggested dual tracks for simpler and complex permits.
- **Outcome:** The bill remained under review, with discussions on balancing regulatory requirements and business needs.

#### **4. Senate Bill 540: Energy Storage Study**
- **Purpose:** Proposes a study on utility-scale and behind-the-meter energy storage to support grid reliability and renewable energy integration.
- **Key Issues:**
  - Criticism focused on the bill’s vagueness, potential $250,000 cost to ratepayers, and concerns about government overreach.
  - Supporters argued for the value of studying energy storage’s potential benefits.
- **Outcome:** The committee voted 11-8 to refer the bill for interim study.

#### **5. Senate Bill 451: FastTrack Process for Repurposing Energy Facilities**
- **Purpose:** Streamlines permitting for repurposing existing energy facilities, particularly for renewable energy and new technologies like hydrogen.
- **Key Issues:**
  - Debate centered on conflicting permitting timelines (120 vs. 180 days) and the practicality of deadlines.
