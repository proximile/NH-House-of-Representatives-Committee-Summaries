**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (04/02/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on April 2, 2024, to address a wide range of issues related to family law, child welfare, juvenile justice, and the foster care system. The meeting featured discussions on legislative bills, subcommittee reports, and expert testimony, emphasizing the need for systemic improvements to protect vulnerable children and families. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

### **1. Guardian ad Litem (GAL) and Parenting Coordinators**
The subcommittee on Guardian ad Litem and parenting coordinators presented its report, focusing on the parenting coordinator model. **House Bill 1263**, which addresses this model, has passed the House and is now in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee requested data collection on the use of GALs and parenting coordinators to evaluate their effectiveness and affordability. Three judges will track cases to gather this data, aiming to inform future policy decisions.

### **2. Judicial Training, Education, Supervision, and Accountability**
The subcommittee on judicial training highlighted the need for timely and essential training for judges within two years of appointment. The current six-week basic training program includes ethics, mental health, and family core training. The committee suggested improvements, such as pairing new judges with experienced mentors, increasing staff attorneys, and considering mediation to reduce caseloads. **House Bill 105**, which addresses judicial training, has passed the House and is in the Finance Committee.

### **3. Child Abuse and Domestic Violence**
The committee discussed the intersection of family court and child abuse cases, particularly in situations where criminal charges are not pursued. Representative Erica Leon raised concerns about the current process for addressing physical or sexual abuse of children and the potential role of the courts in these cases. The committee considered whether to explore this issue further, possibly in conjunction with domestic violence cases.

### **4. Civil vs. Criminal Court Proceedings**
The committee addressed the differences between civil and criminal court proceedings, particularly in cases involving child abuse. They discussed the potential for individuals to face civil penalties (e.g., loss of custody) even if acquitted in criminal court, raising concerns about fairness and due process.

### **5. Senate Bill 359: Ending Child Marriage**
The committee debated **Senate Bill 359**, which seeks to raise the minimum marriage age to 18 with no exceptions. Advocates, including **Unchained at Last** and the **AHA Foundation**, emphasized that child marriage is a form of human trafficking and exploitation, disproportionately affecting girls. Survivors shared personal stories highlighting the long-term physical, mental, and economic consequences of child marriage. The committee voted unanimously (15-0) to recommend the bill as amended, signaling strong bipartisan support.

### **6. Senate Bill 506: Juvenile Justice Reform**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 506**, a technical cleanup bill aimed at aligning statutes with the juvenile delinquency statute (RSA 169-B). The bill raises the age of juvenile jurisdiction from 17 to 18 and passed unanimously (13-0).

### **7. Senate Bill 498: Child Welfare and Kinship Care**
The committee debated **Senate Bill 498**, which focuses on aligning child welfare laws with federal standards, including adding kinship caregivers as placement options and adjusting reporting dates for youth detention centers. A significant part of the discussion centered on the "rebuttable presumption of harm," which allows courts to presume harm in cases of exposure to substance misuse, domestic violence, or psychological maltreatment. The bill passed with broad support, though concerns were raised about the subjectivity of psychological maltreatment definitions.

### **8. Fictive Kin and Kinship Care**
Representative Erica Leon raised concerns about the inclusion of fictive kin (non-relatives with a significant relationship to the child) in placement decisions, warning about potential risks of inappropriate relationships. The committee emphasized the need for thorough vetting processes to ensure child safety while providing timely placements for children in need.

### **9. Senate Bill 566: Foster Care Study Committee**
The committee discussed **Senate Bill 566**, which establishes a committee to study foster care families and the foster care system. The bill aims to address issues like placement shortages, discrepancies between kin and non-kin fostering, and training for foster parents. The bill passed unanimously (13-0).

### **10. Senate Bill 572: Study Commission on Sharing Confidential Records**
The committee debated **Senate Bill 572**, which establishes a commission to study the sharing of confidential records between law enforcement, medical providers, and child protection services to improve child abuse investigations. The bill was amended to comply with RSA 1449, reducing the commission to five legislators while retaining other stakeholders as consultants. The final report deadline was moved to 2024 to ensure timely completion. The bill passed unanimously.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Child Safety**: The committee emphasized the importance of protecting vulnerable children from abuse, exploitation, and unsafe living conditions, as seen in discussions on child marriage, kinship care, and foster care reforms.
2. **Systemic Improvements**: The committee highlighted the need for systemic changes, including better judicial training, data collection on GALs, and enhanced information sharing in child abuse cases.
3. **Legislative Collaboration**: The committee underscored the importance of collaboration between the legislature and the judiciary to address complex family law issues.
4. **Bipartisan Support**: Several bills, including SB 359 and SB 506, received unanimous or near-unanimous support, reflecting bipartisan agreement on critical child welfare issues.

The committee decided to remain open until the end of October to address any emerging issues, such as child abuse and domestic violence, that may require further investigation. The meeting concluded with the approval of subcommittee reports and the passage of key legislative bills, signaling a commitment to improving New Hampshireâ€™s family court and child welfare systems.
