**Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education (04/10/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 10, 2024, to discuss several education-related bills and initiatives, with a primary focus on improving the state’s performance-based accountability system (PBAS) for schools. The meeting highlighted the need for systemic reform, practical legislation, and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure schools provide an adequate education. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Performance-Based Accountability System (PBAS) and Task Force Proposal**
- **Frustration with Current System**: The existing PBAS was criticized for its complexity, lack of alignment with adequate education standards, and insufficient consideration of mitigating factors like poverty and medical conditions. Representatives emphasized the need for comprehensive reform rather than incremental fixes.
- **Task Force Formation**: Senate Bill **SB 378** proposed reestablishing a task force to review and improve the PBAS. The task force, previously disbanded in 2020, would include superintendents, principals, school board members, educational experts, parents, guardians, and public interest group representatives. There was debate about explicitly including teachers and limiting membership to current public school employees.
- **Task Force Responsibilities**: The task force would develop a performance-based scoring system using indicators such as attendance rates, graduation rates, and career technical education (CTE) participation. It would also recommend additional metrics for data collection, ensuring measurable and objective assessments of school performance.
- **Legislative Oversight**: The task force’s recommendations would require legislative approval, emphasizing the need for alignment with state goals and laws. The existing PBAS will remain in place until a new system is implemented.

### **2. State vs. Federal Accountability Systems**
- **Distinction Between Systems**: The meeting clarified the differences between state accountability (PBAS and input-based accountability system, IBAS) and federal accountability under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). While the state system ensures schools provide an adequate education, the federal system identifies low-performing schools for additional support.
- **Historical Context**: The task force was initially removed in 2020 as part of efforts to consolidate accountability systems. However, the department now advocates for separate state and federal systems due to differing goals and metrics.
- **Challenges**: Confusion persists regarding the interplay between state and federal systems, particularly in resource allocation and identifying underperforming schools.

### **3. Other Bills Discussed**
- **SB 526 (School Facility Condition Assessments and Temperature Control Grants)**: This bill was recommended for ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) due to concerns over costs and unworkable provisions.
- **SB 339 (Repealing FAFSA Graduation Requirement)**: Also recommended for ITL, as a similar House bill was preferred for its inclusion of school board policies to provide FAFSA information to families.

### **4. Next Steps and Future Discussions**
- **Upcoming Meetings**: The committee planned to meet the following Tuesday to discuss **SB 219** (mandatory reporting of school expenses) and **SB 379** (emergency action plans for sports injuries). A subcommittee would also work on amendments for **SB 378**.
- **Task Force Timeline**: The task force is expected to operate until September 25, with a focus on defining performance criteria, organizational structure, and public engagement processes.

---

### **5. Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Systemic Improvement**: The meeting underscored the need for a robust, adaptable accountability system that accurately measures school performance and supports student success.
- **Collaboration and Expertise**: The task force’s success will depend on diverse expertise, including representatives from the business community, special education, and CTE, as well as alignment with legislative goals.
- **Practical Legislation**: Discussions emphasized the importance of cost-effective, workable legislation, as evidenced by the ITL recommendations for **SB 526** and **SB 339**.

In conclusion, the meeting highlighted the complexities of education accountability and the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to develop systems that ensure schools provide an adequate education while addressing the diverse needs of students and communities. The task force’s work and legislative oversight will play a critical role in shaping the future of education in New Hampshire.
