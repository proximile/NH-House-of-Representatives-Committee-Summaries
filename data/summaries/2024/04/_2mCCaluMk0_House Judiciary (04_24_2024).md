The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 24, 2024, covered a range of significant legislative topics, with a focus on modernizing laws, addressing public health concerns, and balancing economic impacts. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the session:

### **Senate Bill 422: Child Support and Parentage**
The bill aims to update New Hampshire’s child support regulations by replacing gender-specific terms like "paternity" with "parentage," aligning with federal recommendations. **Lisa Decowski**, Bureau Chief of Child Support Services, testified in support, noting that the changes could be implemented within existing resources by the effective date of July 1, 2025. The bill also streamlines the process of establishing legal parentage for children born through assisted reproduction, using gender-neutral language like "birth parent" and "non-birth parent." Supporters, including **Senator Sharon Carson** and **Christine Hansen**, emphasized the bill’s inclusivity and efficiency in addressing modern family structures.

### **Senate Bill 462: Raising Caps on Wrongful Death Damages**
This bill proposes raising the caps on damages for wrongful death and loss of consortium claims, increasing spousal consortium claims from $150,000 to $500,000 and parent-child consortium claims from $50,000 to $300,000. **Senator Sharon Carson** introduced the bill as a compromise after pushback from the insurance industry, which opposed eliminating caps entirely. Supporters, including **Attorney Holly Haynes** and **Roger Turon**, argued that the current caps are outdated and unfair, particularly for families without significant economic losses, such as homemakers. Opponents, including **Joan Pesce** (New Hampshire Association of Insurance Agents) and **Keith Nyhan** (Deputy Insurance Commissioner), warned that raising the caps could lead to increased insurance premiums, particularly in a challenging market already impacted by rising costs and catastrophic weather events. The **New Hampshire Hospital Association** and **DMC Primary Care** also expressed concerns about higher liability insurance costs potentially driving healthcare providers out of the state, reducing access to care.

### **Senate Bill 576: Reporting of Voter Deaths**
The bill addresses the reporting of voter deaths, requiring executors of estates to notify town clerks within 30 days. **Deputy Secretary of State Aaron Hennessy** raised concerns about enforcement and the necessity of the bill, given that death certificates are already automatically integrated into the voter registration system. Representatives discussed potential amendments, such as judicial branch notices to executors, but noted challenges in enforcing the requirement, as not all estates go through probate. The overall sentiment was that the bill may be redundant due to existing automated processes.

### **Senate Bill 413: Civil Actions for PFAS Contamination**
This bill creates strict liability for PFAS contamination, allowing the Attorney General to recover cleanup costs from responsible parties. **Senator Denise Rashard** highlighted the importance of clean water, particularly in her district, which has been impacted by PFAS contamination. The bill targets major polluters, such as Saint-Gobain, and ensures property owners can seek remedies like connecting to public water supplies or installing treatment systems. **Mike Whims** from the NH Department of Environmental Services testified in support, emphasizing the bill’s alignment with existing laws and its focus on significant contamination sites.

### **Key Themes and Debates**
1. **Modernizing Laws**: Several bills aimed to update outdated laws to reflect contemporary societal norms and challenges, such as gender-neutral parentage language and fairer compensation for wrongful death claims.
2. **Balancing Economic Impacts**: Discussions on raising wrongful death caps highlighted the tension between providing justice for families and maintaining affordable insurance premiums. Concerns about rising costs for businesses, healthcare providers, and consumers were central to the debate.
3. **Public Health and Environmental Protection**: The focus on PFAS contamination underscored the state’s commitment to addressing environmental health risks and holding polluters accountable.
4. **Efficiency and Redundancy**: The debate on voter death reporting raised questions about the necessity of new legislation when existing automated systems already address the issue.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting showcased the House’s efforts to address complex issues, from modernizing family law to balancing economic and public health concerns. While supporters emphasized fairness, inclusivity, and accountability, opponents raised valid concerns about economic impacts and potential unintended consequences. The discussions highlighted the need for careful consideration and compromise to ensure that legislative changes benefit all stakeholders.
