**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting - House Executive Departments and Administration Committee (April 17, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' **House Executive Departments and Administration Committee** convened on April 17, 2024, in Room LOB 302/304 to discuss two key legislative topics: proposed changes to **resident physician and apprentice licensing** and the implications of **SB 437** regarding municipal building code amendments. The meeting focused on balancing administrative efficiency, public safety, and legal considerations while addressing the unique needs of various stakeholders.

### **Resident Physician and Apprentice Licensing**

1. **Resident Physician Licensing**:  
   The committee considered an amendment to extend the validity of resident physician licenses from the current two-year renewal cycle to the full duration of residency (3-7 years). This change aims to reduce administrative burdens for hospitals and residents, particularly at institutions like **Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center**, which employs over 450 resident physicians. Historically, licenses were issued for the duration of residency without issues, but recent legislation disrupted this practice. The amendment seeks to revert to the previous system.

2. **Public Safety and Fees**:  
   Concerns were raised about whether extending license durations would compromise public safety. The committee also discussed adjusting licensing fees to reflect the longer durations, as the current $200 fee per renewal cycle could be costly for institutions.

3. **Apprentice Licensing**:  
   The discussion briefly touched on apprentice licenses, particularly for electricians, which are currently issued for one year. The committee debated whether to include apprentice licenses in the amendment but concluded it was unnecessary.

4. **Coordination with Other Bills**:  
   The committee noted that multiple bills are amending the same statutory paragraph (**RSA 3108**). They discussed consolidating language from these bills to avoid conflicts and streamline the legislative process.

5. **Next Steps**:  
   The subcommittee agreed to proceed with the amendment, pending further refinement of language and fee adjustments. A public hearing may be held for additional provisions unrelated to resident physician licensing.

### **SB 437: Municipal Building Code Amendments**

1. **Municipal Building Code Amendments**:  
   The bill aims to ensure municipalities submit their building code amendments to the **Building Code Review Board (BCRB)** for review and compliance with state standards. Currently, only 4-5 out of 100+ municipalities have submitted amendments, despite it being a long-standing requirement. If municipalities fail to submit amendments within 60 days, they lose enforcement authority, potentially allowing builders to avoid penalties for non-compliance.

2. **Prohibition on Adopting Future Model Codes**:  
   The bill addresses concerns about municipalities (e.g., **Portsmouth** and **Durham**) adopting newer versions of model codes (e.g., 2026 codes) before they are officially published or adopted by the state. This practice undermines the intent of maintaining a **statewide building code**, creating inconsistencies across jurisdictions. The bill seeks to prohibit municipalities from adopting later editions of model codes unless they align with the state’s building code cycle.

3. **Retroactive Application and Legal Concerns**:  
   The bill includes provisions to reset the enforcement of local codes by requiring municipalities to resubmit amendments by **July 1, 2024**. Concerns were raised about the retroactive nature of this provision, potentially violating constitutional principles. The committee discussed alternative language to avoid retroactivity while still achieving the bill’s goals.

4. **One-Stop Shop for Building Codes**:  
   The bill aims to create a centralized resource for building professionals and homeowners to access all relevant state and local building codes, improving consistency and transparency.

5. **Enforcement and Liability**:  
   The committee discussed scenarios where municipalities enforce codes that haven’t been properly submitted or approved, potentially exposing them to legal liability. Building inspectors could face claims of **gross negligence** if they enforce non-compliant codes.

6. **Public Testimony and Amendments**:  
   The committee also addressed a separate amendment related to public testimony timelines, clarifying that written testimony can be submitted within **10 days** of a hearing, aligning with standard practice.

### **Outcome**

The committee expressed support for both the resident physician licensing amendment and **SB 437**, acknowledging their intent to streamline processes and improve compliance. However, they emphasized the need to refine language to address legal, practical, and public safety concerns. The discussions highlighted the complexity of balancing administrative efficiency, local autonomy, and statewide consistency in both healthcare licensing and building code enforcement. The subcommittee will proceed with further refinements and may hold public hearings to gather additional input on specific provisions.
