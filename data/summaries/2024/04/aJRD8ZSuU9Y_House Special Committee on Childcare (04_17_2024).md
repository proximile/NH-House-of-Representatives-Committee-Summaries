**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare Meeting (April 17, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare convened on April 17, 2024, to address critical issues surrounding the state’s childcare crisis, focusing on two key areas: a childcare pilot program and **Senate Bill 404**. The discussions highlighted the challenges of workforce shortages, funding constraints, and the economic impact of inadequate childcare access.

### **Childcare Pilot Program (Option B)**
The committee discussed a proposed childcare pilot program, referred to as "Option B," designed to support families and childcare workers. Key details include:

1. **Program Structure**:  
   - Families would contribute a 7% cost share, similar to existing childcare scholarships.  
   - Families earning enough that their cost share exceeds private childcare costs are expected to opt out.  
   - The program currently targets single mothers with incomes up to $72,000 and aims to support dual-income households earning over $100,000, who would otherwise lose eligibility for scholarships.  

2. **Income and Eligibility Concerns**:  
   - The committee debated the appropriateness of subsidizing high-income families (e.g., those earning $225,000), emphasizing the need to focus on retaining childcare workers, often mothers, in the workforce.  

3. **Fiscal Implications**:  
   - The pilot program is initially funded for six months, with potential carryover into the next fiscal year.  
   - High setup costs ($250,000) and an overall funding range of $1.5 million to $2.9 million raised fiscal concerns.  

4. **Legislative Process**:  
   - Amendments were discussed, including reverting to a previous version of the bill without an $18 million funding note.  
   - The bill is expected to move to the Finance Committee for further review and potential budget incorporation.  

5. **Conflict of Interest**:  
   - One representative acknowledged a potential conflict of interest, as the program could directly benefit their employees, and stated they would not vote on the bill on the floor.  

6. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee plans to meet the following Wednesday to finalize amendments and continue discussions.  
   - A Republican committee member may co-sponsor the bill, pending confirmation.  

### **Senate Bill 404: Addressing the Childcare Workforce Crisis**
The committee also reviewed **Senate Bill 404**, which originally aimed to create a childcare assistant pilot program but was significantly scaled back by the Senate Finance Committee. Key points include:

1. **Childcare Crisis in NH**:  
   - New Hampshire faces a severe childcare workforce shortage, with only 28 workers for every 100 open positions.  
   - Many parents, especially those with children aged 0-5, report job changes or leaving the workforce due to childcare issues.  
   - Childcare workers earn a median wage of $12.99/hour, making retention difficult.  

2. **Original Bill vs. Current Version**:  
   - The original bill, introduced by Senator Becky Whitley, proposed automatic eligibility for childcare scholarships, streamlining the process for workers and centers.  
   - The Senate Finance Committee amended the bill to remove the pilot program, leaving only a report requirement, which was criticized as ineffective.  

3. **Proposed Solutions**:  
   - Advocates urged the committee to reinstate the original bill or the amended version from the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, which proposed a 2.5-year pilot program with $2.5 million in funding.  
   - The pilot would provide childcare scholarships to workers earning above 85% of the state median income, using existing state scholarship structures.  

4. **Economic Impact**:  
   - Childcare shortages hinder economic growth, as parents struggle to stay in the workforce.  
   - Businesses face recruitment and retention challenges due to the lack of affordable childcare.  

5. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee did not vote on the bill but scheduled a vote for the following week.  
   - The Department of Health and Human Services noted that implementing a pilot program would require system changes, with an effective start date of January 1, 2025.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s efforts to balance program effectiveness, fiscal responsibility, and equitable support for childcare workers and families. Stakeholders emphasized the urgent need for actionable solutions to address the childcare crisis, which has far-reaching implications for families, businesses, and the state’s economy. The committee plans to continue refining proposals and advancing legislation to tackle these critical issues.
