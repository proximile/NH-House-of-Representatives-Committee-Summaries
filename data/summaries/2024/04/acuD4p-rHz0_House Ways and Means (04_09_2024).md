The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on April 9, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative topics, including historic horse racing (HHR), charitable gaming, auctioneer licensing exemptions, and tax collection issues. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Historic Horse Racing (HHR) and Charitable Gaming**
1. **Senate Bill 472**:
   - **Moratorium Extension**: The bill proposes extending the moratorium on new HHR charitable gaming licenses until 2031. Proponents argue that the current 14 gaming facilities are sufficient to prevent market oversaturation.
   - **License Transfer Restrictions**: The bill clarifies that gaming licenses cannot be sold separately from the business that holds them, addressing concerns about license valuation and market competitiveness.
   - **Host Community Provisions**: Municipalities hosting HHR events can receive a portion of gaming revenue, but only if there are no charities on the waiting list for gaming dates.
   - **Charity Concerns**: Nonprofits expressed concerns about potential revenue shifts from charities to municipalities but acknowledged the need for the moratorium to prevent market oversaturation.
   - **Economic Impact**: Discussions highlighted that while gaming revenue has increased, charities receive a smaller percentage compared to the past.

2. **Senate Bill 597**:
   - **Modernization**: The bill eliminates the requirement for Lucky 7 ticket dispensary devices to print paper tickets, reflecting the industry shift towards digital results.
   - **Support**: Over 50 game operators supported the bill, citing the difficulty in finding machines that still print paper tickets.
   - **Game Speed**: The Lottery Commission clarified that gameplay speed, regulated by a 3-5 second delay between plays, would remain unchanged.

### **Auctioneer Licensing Exemptions**
1. **Senate Bill 513**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill clarifies that non-member individuals (non-licensed auctioneers) can conduct charity auctions for nonprofits without requiring an auctioneer license. This addresses a gap in existing law, which only allows members of charitable organizations to conduct auctions without a license.
   - **Confusion and Amendments**: The Senate introduced an amendment referencing RSA 721, which defines nonprofit organizations, but this was deemed confusing and narrowed the scope of eligible organizations. The committee agreed to remove this reference and revert to the original, broader language of "charitable, educational, religious, or other nonprofit organizations."
   - **Testimony**: Licensed auctioneer Al Buyers and Michael Haley from the Department of Justiceâ€™s Charitable Trusts Division supported the change, emphasizing that auctioneer licensing laws are designed to protect sellers, not nonprofit fundraising events.
   - **Final Recommendation**: The committee agreed to remove the RSA 721 reference and proceed with the original bill language, which was considered clear and inclusive.

### **Tax Collection and Liability**
1. **Meals and Rentals (M&R) Tax**:
   - **LLC Liability**: The committee
