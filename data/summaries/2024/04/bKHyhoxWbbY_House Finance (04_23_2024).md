**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Finance Committee Meeting (04/23/2024):**

The New Hampshire House Finance Committee convened on April 23, 2024, to address the escalating homelessness crisis in the state, focusing on the urgent need for increased funding and support for shelter services. The meeting centered on **Senate Bill 406**, which proposes a $2.5 million appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to enhance reimbursement rates for shelter programs. The discussions highlighted the challenges faced by shelters, the broader housing crisis, and the critical role of community and legislative support in addressing homelessness.

### Key Discussions and Testimonies:
1. **Shelter Operations and Growing Demand**: Representatives from organizations such as Families in Transition and 100 Nights detailed their services, including emergency and permanent housing, day services, and shelter for adults and families. They emphasized that shelters are operating at full capacity, with many facilities turning people away nightly due to insufficient resources. The demand for shelter beds has surged, driven by a more than 50% increase in homelessness over the past year, attributed to housing shortages, income disparities, and lack of supportive programs.

2. **Funding Challenges and Service Reductions**: Shelters face significant funding gaps, with Families in Transition reporting a $1.5 million deficit and 100 Nights relying heavily on philanthropic contributions. The state currently reimburses shelters at $20 per bed, far below the actual cost of $45-$75 per bed. This shortfall forces organizations to cover indirect expenses like building repairs (e.g., HVAC systems, roofs) out of pocket. Without additional funding, shelters may reduce services, such as closing during the day or cutting beds, which would push vulnerable individuals back onto the streets.

3. **Special Populations and Housing Barriers**: Shelters serve diverse populations, including veterans, young adults, families, and undocumented immigrants. Housing for undocumented individuals is particularly challenging due to a lack of identification, highlighting the need for inclusive solutions.

4. **Support for Senate Bill 406**: Organizations like New Futures and the New Hampshire Hospital Association expressed strong support for Senate Bill 406, which aims to stabilize vulnerable populations by addressing the intersection of homelessness, substance misuse, and mental illness. The bill would increase reimbursement rates to $27 per bed, though this remains below the true cost. Stakeholders emphasized that the bill is a short-term solution and called for long-term investments in affordable housing and comprehensive support services.

5. **Broader Housing Crisis**: Speakers linked homelessness to the statewide housing crisis, characterized by a less than 1% rental vacancy rate and skyrocketing rents. They stressed the need for increased investment in affordable housing and supportive services to address the root causes of homelessness.

6. **Impact on Healthcare and Community Stability**: The New Hampshire Hospital Association highlighted the strain homelessness places on the healthcare system, as it often delays patient discharges and occupies hospital beds. Sustaining shelter programs would alleviate this burden and improve community stability.

7. **Community and Legislative Reliance**: Organizations underscored their dependence on community and business support to bridge funding gaps but expressed uncertainty about future sustainability. They called for increased legislative action to ensure the continuity of essential services.

### Next Steps:
The meeting was recessed, with a joint work session scheduled for the afternoon to further discuss Senate Bill 406, including the geographic distribution of funds and the specific needs of different regions. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of a collaborative approach to develop both immediate and long-term solutions to the homelessness crisis.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the critical need for increased funding and support to maintain shelter services and address homelessness in New Hampshire. While Senate Bill 406 is a necessary step, stakeholders highlighted the importance of broader systemic changes, including investments in affordable housing and comprehensive support services, to create lasting solutions.
