### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Senate Bill 301 (Desalination Plant)**  
   - A motion to oppose the bill, which proposed the construction of a desalination plant, passed 19-1.  
   - Representatives argued that the bill was unnecessary, citing an existing commission already studying similar issues.

2. **House Bill 345 (State Park Fees for Out-of-State Visitors)**  
   - The bill proposed higher park fees for out-of-state visitors but faced concerns about fiscal responsibility, impacts on tourism, and constraints on fee adjustments.  
   - The motion to pass the bill failed, and an interim study was proposed and passed 19-1 to further examine the issue.

3. **Senate Bill 474 (Treasure Hunting on State Property)**  
   - A motion to oppose the bill, which would restrict treasure hunting on state property, passed 19-1.  
   - Some argued that state property should remain accessible unless explicitly restricted.

4. **Senate Bill 492 (Wastewater Infrastructure and Certification Fees)**  
   - The bill, aimed at streamlining wastewater infrastructure processes and increasing certification fees to cover training costs, passed 18-2.

5. **Senate Bill 549 (Dam Funding and Reclassification)**  
   - The bill, which establishes a committee to address dam funding and reclassification, passed unanimously.  
   - It allows for the reclassification of dams based on risk, even without downstream changes.

6. **House Bill 589 (Intermunicipal Agreements for Wastewater Systems)**  
   - The bill was amended to include cities, not just towns, in promoting intermunicipal agreements for wastewater systems.  
   - The amendment aimed to encourage collaboration between cities and towns.

7. **Senate Bill 431 (Wake Surfing Regulations)**  
   - The bill, which proposes a 200-foot setback for wake surfing from shorelines, an education component for boaters, and limits wake surfing to lakes over 50 acres, sparked extensive debate.  
   - Supporters, including Senator Tim Lang, argued that the bill represents a compromise to protect shorelines while allowing recreational use.  
   - Opponents, including environmental advocates, argued that the 200-foot setback is inadequate, citing studies showing waves can cause shoreline erosion, loon nest failures, and water quality degradation at distances up to 500 feet.  
   - Amendments were proposed to increase the setback to 300 feet and add a minimum depth requirement of 10 feet, but the bill ultimately passed with a 19-0 vote.  

8. **Senate Bill 539 (State-Owned Dams)**  
   - The bill addresses the state’s responsibility for maintaining and potentially transferring ownership of state-owned dams to municipalities.  
   - Key provisions include requiring DES to offer municipalities the option to take over ownership and liability of dams before their removal.  
   - Concerns were raised about the financial burden on municipalities and liability for dam failures, leading to the removal of a revolving loan fund provision via amendment.  

9. **Senate Bill 547 (Land and Community Heritage Investment Program - LCHIP)**  
   - The bill updates the LCHIP program to clarify and streamline its operations, particularly in funding historic preservation and land conservation projects.  
   - Amendments removed the requirement for a qualifying stewardship plan but retained the requirement for stewardship capacity.  
   - The bill was well-received, with amendments aimed at improving clarity and administrative efficiency.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Environmental Protection vs. Recreational Use**: The debate over **Senate Bill 431** highlighted the challenge of balancing recreational activities like wake surfing with environmental protection and safety concerns. While the bill passed, there were calls for stricter regulations to mitigate shoreline erosion, water quality degradation, and risks to wildlife and non-motorized water users.  

- **Fiscal Responsibility and Municipal Burden**: Discussions on bills like **Senate Bill 539** and **House Bill 345** emphasized the need to avoid imposing undue financial burdens on municipalities and taxpayers. Interim studies and amendments were used to address these concerns.  

- **Public Access and Collaboration**: Bills like **Senate Bill 474** and **House Bill 589** underscored the importance of maintaining public access to state property and fostering collaboration between municipalities on infrastructure projects.  

- **Streamlining and Updating Programs**: **Senate Bill 547** and **Senate Bill 492** focused on improving administrative efficiency and updating outdated processes, reflecting a broader effort to modernize state programs.
