The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on April 2, 2024, focused on reviewing and amending a bill related to electronic monitoring and indigency criteria for individuals under court supervision. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Funding Adjustment**: The appropriation for a veterans treatment program was updated from $100,000 to $163,000 to account for a coordinator position.

2. **Electronic Monitoring and Indigency Criteria**: The debate centered on whether the court or counties should develop uniform criteria for determining indigency and manage electronic monitoring reimbursements. Concerns were raised about inconsistencies across counties, as programs and costs vary significantly (e.g., $7/day vs. $100/week).

3. **Amendments Proposed**: Representatives discussed changing language in the bill to shift responsibility from the courts to the counties. Proposed amendments included:
   - Counties developing uniform criteria for indigency.
   - Counties, not courts, being reimbursed for electronic monitoring costs.
   - Counties determining indigency for repayment purposes.

4. **County Flexibility**: Representatives emphasized allowing counties flexibility in implementing electronic monitoring programs, recognizing that what works in one county may not work in another. They suggested allowing counties to experiment with different approaches before standardizing practices.

5. **Process and Precision**: The discussion highlighted the importance of the legislative process in ensuring accuracy and addressing unintended consequences. Multiple eyes and steps were noted as crucial for refining the bill.

Overall, the meeting focused on clarifying roles between courts and counties, ensuring consistency in indigency determinations, and allowing counties flexibility in managing electronic monitoring programs.
