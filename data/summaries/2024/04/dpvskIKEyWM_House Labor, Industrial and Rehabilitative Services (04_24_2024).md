The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 24, 2024, focused on several bills related to labor, industrial services, and rehabilitative issues.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **Employment Classification of Resident Assistants (RAs)**
   - **Senate Bill 517** and related discussions centered on clarifying the employment status of RAs in educational institutions. The bill aimed to align state law with federal guidelines, which exempt RAs from being classified as employees under certain labor laws (e.g., minimum wage and overtime).
   - **Support**: University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the New Hampshire College and University Council (NHCUC) argued that RAs receive educational benefits (e.g., free room and board) rather than wages, and classifying them as employees could complicate financial aid and billing processes.
   - **Opposition**: Student RAs from Dartmouth College and other institutions emphasized the demanding nature of their roles, including 24/7 availability for emergencies, and argued that the bill would strip them of labor protections like workers' compensation, anti-discrimination laws, and the ability to unionize.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents raised issues about the removal of workers' compensation and discrimination protections, as well as the potential for misclassification of other student workers.

2. **Veterans Benefits Bill (SB 588)**
   - This bill aimed to ensure veterans are aware of their benefits by requiring employers to display a poster with relevant information. It received bipartisan support, with testimonies emphasizing the importance of making veterans aware of mental health and educational resources.
   - The bill passed unanimously (15-0) in a roll call vote, with no amendments proposed.

3. **Health Insurance for Firefighters and Emergency Responders (SB 350)**
   - This bill sought to ensure that firefighters and other emergency responders retain health insurance coverage while their workers' compensation claims for presumptive conditions (e.g., cancer, PTSD) are under appeal.
   - **Testimonies**: Firefighters and union representatives highlighted the financial and emotional toll of losing health insurance during appeals, with personal stories underscoring the need for this safety net.
   - **Scope and Cost**: The bill includes safeguards, such as limiting coverage to 18 months and applying only to single-person coverage. The financial impact was deemed minimal, with few cases expected.

4. **Remote Work and Unemployment Eligibility (SB 330)**
   - Introduced by Senator Rebecca Perkins Kula, this bill aimed to allow remote work to count toward unemployment benefits eligibility, addressing the growing remote workforce.
   - **Testimonies**: Individuals shared experiences of being denied unemployment benefits because they were only available for remote work, despite the prevalence of remote jobs in their field.
   - **Neutral Position**: The NH Department of Employment Security did not oppose the bill but noted it would require rule-making to define "substantial employment opportunities."

5. **Vacation Time Bill (HB 1178)**
   - Representatives discussed amendments to a bill concerning vacation time, reaching consensus on two out of three proposed changes. Further details on the specifics of the amendments were not provided.

6. **Unemployment Benefits Bill**
   - A bill to increase unemployment benefits failed to pass in the Senate due to concerns about the lack of discussion and effort from the presenting senator.

7. **Medical Marijuana for UTI Treatment**
   - A bill allowing medical marijuana as a treatment for UTIs faced pushback from law enforcement, and its fate in the Senate remained uncertain.

4. **Administrative Challenges**: Implementing these changes raised concerns about compliance with federal laws, administrative burdens, and the need for clear definitions (e.g., "substantial employment opportunities").
5. **Bipartisan Support**: Many bills, such as the veterans benefits bill, received strong bipartisan support, reflecting a shared commitment to addressing critical issues.
