The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 24, 2024, focused on several key bills related to labor, veterans' benefits, and workers' rights. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Veterans' Benefits and Labor Protections**
- **Senate Bill 588**: This bill aims to ensure veterans are aware of available benefits by requiring employers to display a veterans' benefits poster in the workplace. The poster, created by the Labor Commissioner in consultation with the Department of Business and Economic Affairs, includes information on mental health resources, educational and workforce training, tax benefits, unemployment insurance, and contact details for veterans' services. The bill received bipartisan support, with testimonies from veterans and organizations like the United Steel Workers Union and the State Veterans Advisory Committee. Key points included concerns about remote workers accessing the information, enforcement of the poster requirement, and the minimal costs associated with implementation.

### **Employment Status of Resident Assistants (RAs)**
- **Senate Bill 517**: This bill seeks to clarify the employment status of RAs at colleges and universities, aligning state law with federal guidelines under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Proponents, including the New Hampshire College and University Council, argued that RAs receive compensation in the form of room and board, tuition credits, or stipends, which should not classify them as traditional employees. Opponents, including RAs from Dartmouth College, argued that the role involves significant responsibilities and should come with employee protections, such as workers' compensation and minimum wage. The bill sparked debate about the balance between educational opportunities and labor protections, with concerns about the potential for RAs to lose rights and the broader national trend of RAs unionizing.

### **Remote Work and Unemployment Benefits**
- **Senate Bill 330**: This bill addresses outdated unemployment laws that disqualify individuals who are only available for remote work. Testimonies highlighted the growing prevalence of remote work, particularly in the tech industry, and the need to adapt unemployment laws to reflect this shift. The bill would allow individuals to collect unemployment if they are only available for remote work, provided there is a reasonable expectation of substantial employment opportunities. The Department of Employment Security would adopt rules to assess this on a case-by-case basis.

### **Firefighters' Health Coverage**
- **Senate Bill 350**: This bill aims to ensure firefighters diagnosed with cancer retain health insurance coverage during workers' compensation appeals. Testimonies from firefighters and advocates emphasized the life-saving importance of continuous health coverage, especially for those facing serious health issues. The bill mandates continued health coverage for up to 18 months during the appeals process, addressing gaps in the current system. The bill received strong bipartisan support and was passed unanimously by the committee.

### **Additional Discussions**
- **HB 57**: This bill proposes to remove RAs and dorm counselors from the definition of employees under state labor laws, shifting the burden of proof to these individuals to establish their employee status if disputes arise. Concerns were raised about the implications for workers' compensation and discrimination protections, with some representatives suggesting that guidance from the Department of Labor might be more appropriate than legislative changes.
- **Volunteer Liability**: The conversation briefly touched on liability issues for volunteers under workers' compensation laws.

### **Outcome**
The meeting highlighted ongoing debates about labor protections, workers' rights, and adapting state laws to modern work environments. Key bills, such as SB 350 and SB 330, received strong support for addressing critical gaps in health coverage and unemployment benefits, while SB 517 and HB 57 sparked significant discussion about the employment status of RAs and the balance between educational opportunities and labor protections. A subcommittee was formed to further review HB 57, and the committee considered the implications of SB 330 for modernizing unemployment benefits in the context of remote work.
