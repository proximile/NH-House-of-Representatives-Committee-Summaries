**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on April 10, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on April 10, 2024, to discuss and debate a series of significant bills and topics. The meeting highlighted legislative efforts to address building code updates, mental health support for first responders, environmental health awareness, fire safety, software licensing, and foreign policy issues. Here’s a detailed overview of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. State Building Code Amendments**
Several bills and discussions focused on updating and regulating the **State Building Code**:
- **Senate Bill 437 (SB 437)**: Aimed to clarify how municipalities amend the State Building Code, ensuring local amendments comply with state standards and preventing conflicts with the most recent state codes. The bill requires municipalities to submit amendments to the **State Building Code Review Board** for review and confirmation. Supporters, including the **New Hampshire Building Officials Association**, argued it would reduce confusion and ensure statewide consistency. Concerns were raised about retroactive enforcement and potential legal challenges for municipalities that had already adopted amendments.
- **Municipal Amendments to Fire and Building Codes**: Discussions also addressed a bill requiring municipalities to submit local amendments to fire and building codes for state review. Enforcement mechanisms and penalties for non-compliance were key concerns.

### **2. Mental Health Support for First Responders**
- **Senate Bill 367 (PTSD Commission)**: This bill sought to continue the work of the **PTSD Commission**, which has established training requirements for first responders, standards for **comfort dogs**, and streamlined workers' compensation processes to avoid retraumatization. The commission also focuses on improving data collection on first responder suicides and addressing mental health issues among first responders. Testimonies emphasized the importance of the commission’s work in reducing suicide rates and supporting first responders.

### **3. Environmental Health Awareness**
- **Senate Bill 479 (Children's Environmental Health Day)**: Proposed designating the second Thursday in October as **Children's Environmental Health Day** to promote awareness of clean air, water, safe food, and consumer products for children’s health. The committee voted to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," citing a policy against adopting special days without a clear mechanism for promoting them.

### **4. Fire Safety and EV Technology**
- **Senate Bill 430 (EV and Lithium Battery Fire Safety)**: Established a council to study **electric vehicle (EV)** and **lithium battery** fire responses, public safety impacts, and building code updates. The council will also examine environmental impacts, fire department training, and infrastructure challenges. The bill received unanimous support, emphasizing the need for education and safety measures as EV adoption grows.
- **Senate Bill 599 (State Fire Code)**: Updated the state fire code to the **2021 edition** of the **National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)** standards, while maintaining certain 2018 standards to avoid unnecessary burdens on small businesses and homeowners. Key amendments included exemptions for restaurants, bars, daycares, and residential sprinkler requirements. The bill also addressed **solar panel installations** and **battery storage systems**, balancing safety with economic considerations.

### **5. Software Licensing and IT Procurement**
- **Senate Bill 210**: Aimed to prevent restrictive software licensing terms that limit state agencies’ ability to use software on their chosen infrastructure. The bill promotes competition, flexibility, and cybersecurity in IT procurement. Testimony from the **Coalition for Fair Software Licensing** highlighted the potential for cost savings and enhanced cybersecurity. The bill passed unanimously.

### **6. Foreign Policy and Free Speech**
- **Senate Bill 439**: Proposed codifying the governor’s executive order prohibiting state contracts with companies that boycott Israel. The bill sparked passionate debate, with opponents arguing it infringes on **free speech** and **economic expression**, particularly in the context of the **BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions)** movement. Testifiers, including **Jewish Americans** and **Palestinian activists**, emphasized the importance of nonviolent protest and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Supporters argued the bill is necessary to combat anti-Semitism and protect Israel from discriminatory boycotts. The bill moved forward in the legislative process despite opposition.

---

### **7. Licensing and Regulatory Issues**
- **Senate Bill 485 and House Bill 1385**: The committee worked to harmonize these bills, which address licensing reciprocity for **military spouses** and **veterans**. SB 485 included a provision for **digitally verifiable licenses**, which was seen as a valuable addition. The committee leaned toward amending SB 485 to align with HB 1385 while retaining the digitally verifiable licensing provision.
- **Senate Bill 318 (Social Work Licensure Compact)**: Briefly discussed, this bill relates to a **social work licensure compact**.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Building Codes and Fire Safety**: The committee emphasized the need for statewide consistency in building and fire codes while balancing local autonomy and economic considerations.
- **Mental Health and First Responders**: The continuation of the PTSD Commission’s work was highlighted as critical to supporting first responders and reducing suicide rates.
- **Environmental and Public Health**: While Children’s Environmental Health Day was not adopted, the committee acknowledged the importance of environmental health awareness.
- **Technology and Cybersecurity**: Bills addressing EV fire safety and software licensing reflected the state’s proactive approach to emerging technologies and IT procurement.
- **Foreign Policy and Free Speech**: The debate over SB 439 underscored the tension between combating anti-Semitism and protecting free speech and nonviolent protest.
