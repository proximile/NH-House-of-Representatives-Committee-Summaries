**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (04/24/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on April 24, 2024, to discuss **Senate Bill 543**, which proposes the establishment of a **State Environmental Adaptation, Resilience, and Innovation Council** (referred to as the **Resilience and Adaptation Council** in earlier discussions). The bill aims to address climate-related challenges, particularly severe weather impacts on infrastructure and environmental resilience. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points and discussions:

---

### **Purpose of the Bill**
The primary goal of Senate Bill 543 is to create a centralized council tasked with coordinating state agencies, developing resilience strategies, and prioritizing infrastructure planning to mitigate the effects of climate change. The council would focus on proactive planning to address environmental risks such as flooding, storm damage, and increased rainfall, ultimately saving taxpayer dollars by avoiding costly emergency repairs and budget overruns. The bill emphasizes adaptation and resilience, distinct from mitigation efforts like energy efficiency, which are handled by other entities.

### **Key Features of the Council**
1. **Composition and Function**:  
   - The council would include representatives from various state agencies, nonprofits, and climate science experts.  
   - It would meet at least twice annually (with some suggesting quarterly meetings) to coordinate planning efforts and issue recommendations.  
   - The council would not create policy but would advise the legislature on potential actions to address environmental risks.

2. **Funding and Coordination**:  
   - The bill does not include a fiscal note, relying on existing agency budgets and potential federal grants rather than new state appropriations.  
   - Nonprofits and federal grants could provide resources for staffing and operations.  
   - The Department of Environmental Services (DES) would call the first meeting, with the council electing its own leadership.

3. **Legislative Oversight**:  
   - The bill includes provisions for legislative oversight, requiring approval from the Joint Fiscal Committee for any funding decisions.  
   - The council’s recommendations would inform future legislation and budget priorities.

### **Support for the Bill**
- **John Evans** (NH Department of Transportation) highlighted the financial burden of severe weather on infrastructure and the need for proactive planning.  
- **Nick Cof** (Conservation Law Foundation) emphasized recent severe weather events that devastated small towns, stressing the importance of planning to prevent budget overruns and infrastructure damage.  
- **Kristen Cotch** (Business and Industry Association) supported the bill, noting its potential to foster collaboration between businesses, communities, and government agencies.  
- **Meredith Hatfield and Matt Thorne** (The Nature Conservancy) discussed the need for better coordination to address aging infrastructure, particularly culverts, and shared examples of costly delays in repairs due to lack of planning.  
- **Senator David Waters**, the bill's prime sponsor, emphasized cross-agency collaboration and leveraging existing studies, such as the 2016 Coastal Risk and Hazards Commission report, to address current and future risks.

### **Concerns and Clarifications**
- **Bureaucracy and Efficiency**: Some representatives questioned whether the council would add unnecessary bureaucracy.  
- **Meeting Frequency**: There was discussion about increasing the council’s meeting frequency from twice annually to quarterly.  
- **Infrastructure Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the feasibility of addressing infrastructure issues, such as the 21,000 culverts in NH, many of which are outdated or improperly sized.  
- **Staff Capacity**: **Ted Diers**, Assistant Director of DES, expressed support for the bill but raised concerns about staff capacity, as DES is already stretched thin.  

---

### **Examples of Infrastructure Challenges**
- **Matt Thorne** shared a case study of a culvert replacement project that took 15 years to complete, costing three times the original estimate due to delays and inflation.  
- **Ted Diers** highlighted DES’s ongoing efforts, such as vulnerability assessments for water infrastructure, culvert upgrades, and coastal resilience projects, emphasizing the importance of coordinating these efforts across agencies.

### **Next Steps**
The committee did not execute the bill during the meeting but will hold an executive session later to discuss it further. The chair noted that no additional Senate bills are expected, and the committee will schedule future meetings around House sessions.

---

### **Overall Takeaway**
Senate Bill 543 seeks to create a collaborative, forward-thinking approach to environmental resilience in New Hampshire. It aims to leverage existing resources and expertise while minimizing new financial burdens on the state. The bill has broad support for its potential to address climate-related infrastructure challenges but faces questions about implementation, bureaucracy, and operational feasibility. The committee’s discussions underscored the urgent need for coordinated planning to ensure community safety and fiscal responsibility in the face of environmental risks.
