**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Children and Family Law Meeting (April 2, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Children and Family Law convened on April 2, 2024, to address several critical bills aimed at improving child welfare systems, foster care, information sharing in child abuse cases, kinship care, and child marriage laws. The meeting highlighted bipartisan support for initiatives to protect vulnerable children and strengthen family systems.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Senate Bill 566: Foster Care System Study**
Prime sponsor **Senator Shannon Chandley** introduced SB 566, which proposes the establishment of a committee to study the foster care system. The study would address pressing issues such as the shortage of foster care placements, disparities between kin and non-kin fostering requirements, and challenges in recruiting and retaining foster families. The committee would assess regulations and identify solutions to improve the system. The bill received unanimous support (13-0) and was recommended for passage.

#### **2. Senate Bill 572: Information Sharing in Child Abuse Cases**
Introduced by **Senator Ward**, SB 572 seeks to establish a commission to study the sharing of confidential records between law enforcement, medical providers, and child protection services. The bill was prompted by cases where barriers to information sharing hindered effective intervention in severe child abuse cases. The commission would examine legal and procedural barriers and recommend solutions. The committee unanimously voted to recommend the bill for passage, with an amendment adjusting membership structure and setting a 2024 deadline for the final report.

#### **3. Kinship Care and Fictive Kin Placements**
The discussion emphasized the importance of kinship care and fictive kin (close non-relatives) as safe placement options for children in crisis. Key points included:
- **Licensing Process**: The organization "A Chance" licenses kinship care homes, enabling relatives and fictive kin to receive foster care payments and support. This change, implemented in 2022, addressed previous hurdles where such caregivers were vetted but unable to receive financial assistance.
- **Vetting**: The process involves applications, home studies, background checks, and emergency conditional placements while formal vetting (e.g., FBI fingerprinting) is completed.
- **Fictive Kin Example**: Representative **Betty Gay** shared a story of a 15-year-old child who found safety with a fictive kin caregiver after fleeing abuse, underscoring the importance of immediate, trusted placements.
- **S SP 498**: The committee unanimously voted (13-0) to advance this bill, which supports the Department of Children and Families (DCF) in facilitating kinship care.

#### **4. Senate Bill 359: Raising the Minimum Marriage Age to 18**
SB 359 proposes raising the minimum marriage age to 18 with no exceptions, aiming to protect minors from forced or coerced marriages linked to human trafficking, domestic violence, and other abuses. Key points included:
- **Current Law**: New Hampshire allows 16- and 17-year-olds to marry with parental consent and judicial approval. Since 2018, only nine minors have been married, but advocates argue this is still too many.
- **Advocatesâ€™ Arguments**: Child marriage is a human rights abuse, limits opportunities, and has severe long-term consequences, including higher risks of divorce, poverty, and health issues. Minors lack legal rights to escape abusive marriages or access resources.
- **Federal Loopholes**: Current federal law allows minors to be trafficked across state lines or internationally for marriage if legal in their state. Raising the marriage age would close this loophole.
- **Cultural and Religious Perspectives**: While some argued marriage is a religious sacrament, advocates emphasized the focus on the legal contract aspect of marriage.
- **Support**: The bill received strong backing from stakeholders, including survivors and advocacy groups like **Unchained at Last** and the **AHA Foundation**.

#### **5. Senate Bill 506: Juvenile Justice Statute Alignment**
SB 506 is a technical cleanup bill that aligns state statutes with the juvenile delinquency statute, raising the age of juvenile jurisdiction from 17 to 18. The bill passed unanimously after minimal discussion.

#### **6. Senate Bill 498: Placement Options and Child Protection**
SB 498 seeks to align placement options for children in the juvenile justice system with federal law, allowing kinship caregivers and certified residential or psychiatric placements. It also changes reporting dates for youth detention center logs and repeals the sunset provision for the rebuttable presumption of harm in child protection cases. Key concerns included:
- **Psychological Maltreatment**: Questions were raised about the broad interpretation of psychological maltreatment and its impact on families with mental illnesses.
- **Fictive Kin**: Representatives emphasized the need for thorough vetting to ensure the safety of children placed with fictive kin.
- **Vetting Process**: Clarity was requested on the vetting process for kinship placements to ensure safe environments.

### **Conclusion**
The committee demonstrated strong bipartisan support for initiatives aimed at improving child welfare systems, protecting minors from abuse, and strengthening family structures. Key bills addressing foster care, information sharing, kinship care, juvenile justice, and child marriage were advanced with unanimous or near-unanimous votes. The discussions underscored the importance of flexibility, safety, and immediate action in protecting vulnerable children while balancing family rights and ensuring thorough vetting processes.
