**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Municipal and County Government (04/23/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 23, 2024, to address a range of issues related to municipal and county governance. The meeting featured robust discussions on several bills, with a particular focus on local funding disputes, housing regulations, and public health ordinances. Below is a detailed summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **1. Woodsville Fire District and Funding Disputes (SB 448)**
The ongoing conflict between Woodsville, a village district within the town of Haverhill, and the town itself took center stage. Established in 1885, Woodsville manages its own fire, highway, and sewer systems but has faced funding challenges since 2019, when Haverhill discontinued a long-standing funding formula. This has led to legal disputes, with a Supreme Court decision pending.

- **Proposed Legislation**: Senate Bill 448 aimed to establish a standardized funding formula for Woodsville, addressing ambiguities in previous legislation and reducing reliance on warrant articles. However, Woodsville officials argued that the formula would not cover their expenses adequately, potentially forcing them out of road maintenance.
- **Community Impact**: The issue has deeply divided the community, with concerns about double taxation and historical tensions resurfacing. Some representatives suggested waiting for the Supreme Court decision before moving forward with new legislation.
- **Committee Decision**: The committee unanimously voted to indefinitely postpone SB 448, agreeing that the issue should be resolved locally or through the courts rather than by the legislature.

### **2. Zoning Procedures and Residential Housing (SP 538)**
Senator Rebecca Perkins Kwoka introduced SP 538 to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis. The bill proposed three main solutions:
   - **Tax Credits**: Local property tax credits for converting commercial/industrial spaces into residential units in downtown areas.
   - **Zoning Flexibility**: Allowing select boards to amend zoning ordinances more than once a year to facilitate greater public input.
   - **Parking Alternatives**: Enabling alternative parking arrangements for residential units to reduce costs.

- **Support and Testimonies**: Representatives from New Hampshire Housing, Stay Work Play NH, and the Business and Industry Association highlighted the bill’s potential to make housing more affordable and accessible, particularly for young people and workers.
- **Key Discussions**: Questions focused on the technical aspects, including the role of planning boards, parking requirements, and tax incentives. The bill was seen as enabling legislation, providing municipalities with tools to address housing shortages.

### **3. Public Health Ordinances (SB 63)**
Debate centered on the role of local municipalities in public health regulations, particularly during emergencies like COVID-19.

- **Proposed Amendments**: Amendments were proposed to limit local health officers' authority, but concerns were raised about the potential impact on public health preparedness.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with amendments, reflecting a balance between state oversight and local control.

### **4. Background Checks for Municipal Health Officers (SB 531)**
SB 531 aimed to remove the requirement for background checks to be submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services, leaving it to local municipalities.

- **Support**: The bill received broad support for streamlining the process and addressing privacy concerns.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed, emphasizing local control and efficiency.

### **5. Transparency in Municipal Funding (SB 532)**
SB 532 required municipalities to post information about state funding on their websites for transparency.

- **Proposed Amendments**: Amendments extended the posting duration and ensured accessibility.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with amendments, highlighting the importance of transparency while balancing state and local responsibilities.

### **6. Transportation Expenses in Default Budgets (SB 447)**
A committee was proposed to study the inclusion of transportation expenses in default budgets.

- **Proposed Amendment**: An amendment increased Senate representation on the committee to ensure diverse input.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with the amendment, reflecting a focus on comprehensive study and decision-making.
