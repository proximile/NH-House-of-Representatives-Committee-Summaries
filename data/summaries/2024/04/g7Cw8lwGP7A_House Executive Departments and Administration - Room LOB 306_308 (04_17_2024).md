**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Executive Departments and Administration (04/17/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 17, 2024, focused on several bills related to licensing, administrative processes, and personnel reforms. Key discussions centered on workforce development, state licensing operations, and benefits for injured law enforcement officers. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all segments of the meeting:

---

### **Licensing and Administrative Reforms**
1. **Pharmacy Technician Licensing (SB 600)**:
   - The bill proposes three types of pharmacy technician licenses: registered, certified, and advanced. Discussions clarified eligibility requirements and disciplinary processes. A significant point of debate was the inclusion of a pharmacy technician on the Board of Pharmacy, as technicians are currently unable to serve despite being regulated by the board. Concerns were raised about the 10-year experience requirement, with suggestions to reduce it to 5 years due to high turnover in the profession. The bill was sent to a subcommittee for further review.

2. **Real Estate Licensing (SB 480)**:
   - Representatives from the New Hampshire Association of Realtors testified about challenges with the Real Estate Commission, including customer service issues and the need for dedicated administrators for boards overseeing over 7,000 licenses. The committee considered an amendment to delete sections one and four, focusing on post-licensing education requirements and inactive license status.

3. **Plumbing Apprenticeship (SB 372)**:
   - Senator Murphy introduced a bill to increase the number of apprentices a master plumber can supervise from one to two. An amendment addressed concerns about federal regulations, clarifying that the change is optional for those not in a federal apprenticeship program.

4. **Digitally Variable Licenses and Military Qualifications (SB 485)**:
   - The bill defines **digitally variable licenses** and includes military training, education, and service as acceptable qualifications for certain occupational specialties. It also mandates rule-making requirements for relevant boards. The committee voted **3-0** to adopt the amendment.

### **Personnel Appeals Board Independence**
1. **Personnel Appeals Board (SB 487)**:
   - Senator Carson presented a bill to make the Personnel Appeals Board independent from the Division of Personnel, addressing potential conflicts of interest. The bill would create a new chapter for the board, repeal outdated statutes, and establish a fund for its operations. The fiscal impact was estimated at approximately $253,000 in 2025 and $35,000 in 2026.

2. **Senate Bill 1177**:
   - The committee reviewed efforts to make the Personnel Appeals Board fully independent, with collaborative input from unions and the Department of Administrative Services. Some substantive issues were reserved for future legislative sessions.

### **Benefits for Injured Law Enforcement Officers (SB 134)**
1. **Testimonies from Injured Officers**:
   - Several police officers injured in the line of duty shared their struggles with the current disability benefits system. Testimonies highlighted financial hardships, including limited pensions, earning caps, and inadequate healthcare coverage. Officers emphasized the need for reforms to allow them to work and earn more without losing their pensions.

2. **Violent Accidental Disability Retirement Benefit**:
   - The bill creates a new **violent accidental disability retirement benefit** for Group 2 employees (primarily law enforcement) permanently incapacitated due to a **purposeful, hostile, and violent attack** in the line of duty. The benefit provides **100% of the member’s annual earnable compensation** or **$75,000**, whichever is greater, and includes a **medical subsidy** for health insurance premiums. Recipients are not restricted from earning additional income through other employment.

3. **Fiscal Impact**:
   - The fiscal note was significantly reduced, as the benefit is expected to apply to a very limited number of individuals. The original estimate of an **$87.6 million increase** in liability was based on a broader interpretation of eligibility.

4. **Committee Response**:
   - Committee members acknowledged the sacrifices of injured officers and expressed support for addressing systemic issues in the retirement system. They discussed the specificity of the definition of a violent attack and the taxability of the benefit.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the need for reforms to support injured law enforcement officers, recognize the contributions of pharmacy technicians, and improve state licensing and administrative processes. Key bills, including SB 134 and SB 600, were sent to subcommittees for further review, with plans to address amendments and fiscal concerns in future sessions. The committee’s discussions underscored the importance of fairness, clarity, and efficiency in legislative efforts to address workforce challenges and support public servants.
