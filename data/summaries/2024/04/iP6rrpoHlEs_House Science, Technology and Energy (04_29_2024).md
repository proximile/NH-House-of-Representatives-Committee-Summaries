### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

#### **Senate Bill 451**
- **Purpose**: The bill focuses on repurposing qualified existing energy facilities.
- **Amendments**:
  - The committee reviewed **Amendment 1676 H**, which clarified that certain sections of the bill apply exclusively to repurposing qualified energy facilities.
  - A new section was added to allow agencies of jurisdiction to extend decision timelines for applications if the applicant submits a written request, addressing delays in permitting processes.
- **Outcome**: The committee unanimously adopted the amendment and voted to recommend the bill **“Ought to Pass as Amended.”** It was also placed on the **consent calendar** for expedited consideration.

#### **Senate Bill 595**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to reform the dispute resolution process for pole attachments by replacing the current six-factor test with a formula-based approach modeled after the FCC’s methodology. This change is intended to streamline the process, increase transparency, and ensure fairness in determining pole attachment rates.
- **Key Concerns**:
  - **Impact on Small Providers**: Smaller, local telecommunications providers and the New Hampshire Telephone Association expressed concerns that the new formula could reduce their revenue, particularly in rural areas, and hinder their ability to maintain poles.
  - **Cost-Shifting and Fairness**: Questions were raised about whether the bill shifts costs unfairly and whether it could lead to constitutional issues, such as government taking.
  - **Transparency and Process**: Committee members questioned the clarity of the proposed formula and its potential to expedite the pole attachment process.
  - **Fiscal Impact**: The bill may require the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Public Utilities Commission to hire consultants, raising concerns about costs and resource allocation.
- **Historical Context**: The issue of pole attachment disputes, often referred to as the "pole wars," has persisted since the early 2000s. The current system was designed for a time when fewer attachments (e.g., cable, internet) were needed, and the regulatory landscape has since evolved.
- **Amendment Discussion**: An amendment was proposed to phase in the new rates over 10 years to mitigate financial impacts on smaller providers. However, concerns remained about whether this would sufficiently address revenue losses.
- **Interim Study vs. Immediate Action**: Some committee members suggested sending the bill to interim study to gather more data on its potential impact, while others argued for immediate action or even killing the bill due to insufficient information.
- **Outcome**: The committee recessed the executive session to draft an amendment requiring the DOE to conduct an investigation before proceeding with statutory changes. The discussion on SB 595 will resume on **May 14th**.

### **Additional Notes**
- **Guest Representatives**: Several guest representatives filled in for absent members during the session.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **SB 451**: Passed with amendments and placed on the consent calendar, addressing repurposing of energy facilities and permitting delays.
- **SB 595**: The committee grappled with the bill’s potential to modernize the pole attachment dispute process while balancing the financial viability of both large and small telecommunications providers. Concerns about fairness, transparency, and fiscal impact led to a recess for further amendment drafting and a DOE investigation.
- **Next Steps**: The committee will reconvene on **May 14th** to continue work on SB 595 and finalize plans for the end-of-session lunch.

The meeting highlighted the complexity of addressing regulatory challenges in the energy and telecommunications sectors, particularly in ensuring equitable outcomes for all stakeholders.
