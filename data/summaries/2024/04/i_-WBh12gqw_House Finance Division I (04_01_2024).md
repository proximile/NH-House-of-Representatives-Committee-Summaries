**Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (04/01/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I convened on April 1, 2024, for a work session focused on several legislative bills, including House Bills (HB) 105, 318, 1633, 10005, and Senate Bill (SB) 252. The discussions centered on bail reform, judicial system enhancements, electronic monitoring, cannabis legislation, and related budgetary concerns. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points and outcomes from the meeting:

### **Bail Reform and Judicial System Enhancements**
1. **Combining Bills**: Representative Maguire proposed consolidating HB 105, HB 318, and SB 252 into a single comprehensive bill, HB 318, to streamline the legislative process and ensure a public hearing in the Senate. This approach aimed to address overlapping issues in bail reform and judicial efficiency.

2. **Magistrates and Bail Commissioners**:
   - **Number of Magistrates**: There was significant debate over the appropriate number of magistrates, with proposals ranging from 5 to 15. Chairman Roy argued that reducing the number from 15 to 5 would undermine the policy's goals, emphasizing magistrates' role in reducing court backlogs and county costs. Representative Maguire countered that five magistrates would suffice, citing workload analysis and budget constraints.
   - **Training and Compensation**: Discussions included training requirements for bail commissioners and compensation for their training time. Proposals to increase the training fee from $50 to $60 per eight-hour block were considered, though the committee ultimately settled on retaining the $50 fee.

3. **Bail Information System**:
   - Representative Maguire proposed allocating $200,000 to the Department of Information Technology to develop a standalone bail information system. However, Commissioner Dennis G highlighted the complexities and inefficiencies of a standalone system compared to an integrated approach. The original proposal included $1.736 million for a system integrated with existing judicial and safety department databases.
   - Budget concerns were raised regarding the ongoing maintenance costs of the proposed systems and the feasibility of implementation within current financial constraints.

### **Electronic Monitoring and County Responsibilities**
1. **Amendment Withdrawals and Discussions**: Representative Maguire withdrew Amendment 1179. The committee debated the standard of evidence for electronic monitoring, particularly the shift from "substantial evidence" to "clear and convincing evidence." Concerns were raised about creating a new evidentiary standard and its implications for court cases and training.

2. **Operational Control**: It was decided that counties, rather than the judiciary, would manage electronic monitoring, with provisions for reimbursement and operational control. A July 1, 2025, effective date was proposed to allow smaller counties time for budgeting and implementation.

### **Cannabis Legislation (HB 1633)**
1. **Amendments and Enforcement**:
   - The committee discussed amendments to HB 1633, focusing on public education campaigns, data collection, and enforcement. Penalties for public cannabis use were shifted from a misdemeanor to a class B violation.
   - Representative Leon proposed language to separate operational control from regulatory control in cannabis retail outlets, ensuring clarity in responsibilities.

2. **Data Collection and Funding**:
   - The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was tasked with data collection, requiring a new position and an appropriation of $109,000.
   - Funding for public education campaigns and the potential need for additional positions to manage data analysis were also discussed.

3. **Out-of-State Advertising**: Provisions were included to prohibit out-of-state cannabis advertising and impose fines for violations.

### **Final Votes and Next Steps**
The committee voted on various amendments and the bills themselves, finalizing language and funding for electronic monitoring, bail commissioner fees, and cannabis legislation. Decisions were made to ensure operational feasibility, regulatory clarity, and alignment with budgetary constraints. The meeting concluded with plans to present the finalized amendments the following day.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Bail Reform**: Efforts to streamline judicial processes and reduce backlogs were central, with debates over the number of magistrates, bail commissioner training, and the development of a bail information system.
- **Electronic Monitoring**: Counties were assigned responsibility for electronic monitoring, with provisions to address financial and operational challenges.
- **Cannabis Legislation**: Amendments focused on enforcement, public education, and regulatory controls, with significant attention to data collection and funding.
- **Budgetary Concerns**: Throughout the discussions, the committee grappled with balancing policy goals against financial limitations, particularly regarding system maintenance and new positions.

The session underscored the complexities of implementing judicial reforms and regulatory frameworks while navigating fiscal constraints and operational challenges.
