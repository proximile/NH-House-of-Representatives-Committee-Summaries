**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (04/23/2024):**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee meeting on April 23, 2024, focused on critical issues related to landfill operations, wastewater treatment, and proposed revisions to the state’s solid waste management rules. The discussions emphasized the need to balance environmental protection, public health, and industry interests while addressing regulatory clarity and enforcement. Key topics and outcomes from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Landfill Operations and Wastewater Management**
1. **Wastewater Treatment and Leachate Management**:  
   The Franklin wastewater treatment plant, which processes leachate from the Bethlehem landfill, was a focal point. Analysis indicated that the leachate’s impact on phosphorus concentrations in the effluent was minimal due to the high volume of regular wastewater flows. However, concerns were raised about sludge management, particularly the practice of returning sludge to landfills, which prompted questions about its efficiency and environmental implications.

2. **Incident Reporting and Enforcement**:  
   Ambiguities in incident reporting timelines were highlighted, with representatives stressing the need for clearer language to ensure timely reporting and follow-up actions. The 2021 leachate spill at NCS, one of the largest in the state, was cited as an example of inadequate enforcement, as no fines were imposed. This raised broader concerns about the sufficiency of current rules in addressing spills and accidents.

3. **Rule Revisions and Public Perception**:  
   Changes to landfill rules, including the relaxation of the hydraulic conductivity standard based on industry feedback, were scrutinized. Representatives questioned whether these revisions prioritized economic interests over environmental protection and public health, particularly in the context of a proposed landfill in Dalton. The committee emphasized the need to reassure constituents that the rule-making process is driven by public health and environmental concerns.

### **Proposed Revisions to Solid Waste Management Rules**
1. **Landfill Siting and Protection**:  
   Proposed changes aim to improve landfill siting by considering stormwater and landfill gas infrastructure, increasing setbacks from water bodies, and enhancing detection and remediation of potential contamination.

2. **Stormwater Management**:  
   The rules propose increasing the design capacity of stormwater systems to account for climate change impacts, moving from a 25-year to a 50-year storm event standard.

3. **Liner Systems**:  
   Composite liners would be required for municipal solid waste landfills to improve leak prevention and self-healing capabilities.

4. **Odor Control**:  
   Landfill operators would be required to conduct annual odor evaluations and implement plans to address persistent odor issues.

5. **PFAS Testing**:  
   The rules would mandate testing of landfill leachate for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to monitor concentrations and prepare for future regulations.

6. **Sludge Management**:  
   The discussion highlighted challenges in managing wastewater treatment sludge, particularly concerning PFAS contamination. The state is working on setting standards for PFAS levels in sludge to protect groundwater quality.

### **Rulemaking Process and Public Engagement**
1. **Public Input and Rulemaking Process**:  
   The committee emphasized the importance of public input during the rulemaking process, which includes a public hearing scheduled for May 20, 2024. The process is expected to extend beyond the July 1, 2024, expiration date of the current rules, with an extension anticipated.

2. **Technical and Professional Review**:  
   The rules rely on professional judgment and technical review by hydrogeologists and engineers to ensure compliance, especially regarding soil conditions and hydraulic conductivity during landfill siting.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to refining solid waste management rules based on stakeholder and public feedback, with a focus on balancing environmental protection with practical implementation. Key priorities included improving landfill siting and infrastructure, enhancing regulatory clarity, and addressing public health concerns related to leachate, sludge, and PFAS contamination. The committee reiterated its dedication to ensuring that the rule-making process prioritizes public health and environmental protection over economic interests.
