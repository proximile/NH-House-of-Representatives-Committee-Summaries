The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on April 16, 2024, addressed several key education-related bills, focusing on taxpayer transparency, emergency preparedness, and the expansion of the Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) program. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **1. Senate Bill 219: Taxpayer Transparency in School Spending**
- **Objective**: Introduced by Senator Keith Murphy, the bill aims to provide taxpayers with clear, accessible information about school district spending.
- **Key Points**:
  - Over the past 20 years, the cost per pupil has increased by 77% (adjusted for inflation), while teacher salaries have risen only 1%.
  - Non-teaching staff increased by 80%, and enrollment declined by 11.2%.
  - The bill requires school districts to produce annual charts detailing cost per pupil, average teacher salaries, and administrator salaries.
  - **Opposition**: Critics, including the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, argue that this information is already publicly available and that the bill imposes unnecessary administrative burdens.

### **2. Senate Bill 379: Emergency Action Plans for Sports-Related Injuries**
- **Objective**: Sponsored by Senator Suzanne Prentiss, the bill mandates the placement and maintenance of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in schools and requires CPR-trained individuals to supervise school-sponsored sports events.
- **Key Points**:
  - AEDs must be accessible within three minutes during sports events.
  - Schools must develop and drill emergency action plans, similar to fire drills.
  - The bill builds on previous legislation requiring emergency action plans for schools with grades 4-12.
  - **Support**: Emphasized the importance of preparedness, citing examples like the life-saving response to NFL player Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest.
  - **Concerns**: Practicality of ensuring AED accessibility, potential burden on schools, and whether the bill should extend to all school-sponsored events (e.g., theater performances).
  - **AEDs in Schools**: Legislators highlighted the critical role of AEDs in saving lives during sudden cardiac arrests, especially in schools. Testimonies included real-life incidents where AEDs and trained staff were crucial in reviving students.
  - **Training and Accessibility**: Strong emphasis on CPR and AED training for coaches, teachers, and staff, as well as strategic placement of AEDs.
  - **Cost and Funding**: Discussions on potential funding sources, including state appropriations and partnerships with organizations like the American Heart Association.

### **3. Senate Bill 442: Expansion of Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)**
- **Objective**: The bill proposes changes to the EFA program, including raising the income eligibility threshold and extending phase-out grants for public schools.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Eligibility Expansion**: Raise the income threshold from 350% to 400% of the federal poverty level, allowing more middle-income families to access funds for private or alternative education options.
  - **Cost Implications**: Estimated to increase EFA spending by approximately $25 million annually, with a potential total cost of $53.4 million if all eligible families participate.
  - **Phase-Out Grants**: Extend grants for public schools from 2026 to 2029, providing partial funding to schools even after students leave for EFAs.
  - **Reporting Requirements**: Introduce new reporting requirements for the Department of Education to track EFA-related expenditures.
  - **Academic Accountability**: Concerns about the lack of public data on student academic performance in EFAs.
  - **Debate on Public vs. Private Education**: Supporters emphasize parental choice, while opponents argue that expanding EFAs diverts funding from public schools.
  - **Concerns Over Oversight**: Criticism of the Children’s Scholarship Fund of New Hampshire for its lack of transparency and accountability.
  - **Political and Fiscal Context**: Discussions on the state’s education funding lawsuit and the recent failure of a bill to provide free school meals.
  - **Opposition from Educators**: Representatives from the American Federation of Teachers and NEA New Hampshire argue that expanding EFAs undermines public education.

### **4. Additional Discussions and Concerns**
- **Constitutional Concerns**: Questions about whether the EFA program meets the state’s obligation to provide an adequate public education.
- **Transparency and Audits**: Calls for a full legislative audit of the EFA program before further expansion.
- **Success Metrics**: Debate on defining success for public education programs, emphasizing student and parent engagement over test scores.
- **Implementation Challenges**: Concerns about the feasibility of having AEDs at all school events and the need for comprehensive emergency action plans and regular drills.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the importance of transparency in school spending, the necessity of improved emergency preparedness in schools, and the ongoing debate over the expansion of the EFA program. Legislators grappled with balancing fiscal responsibility, constitutional obligations, and the need for accountability and oversight in education policy. The future of these bills remains uncertain as lawmakers continue to weigh competing priorities and address concerns raised during the discussions.
