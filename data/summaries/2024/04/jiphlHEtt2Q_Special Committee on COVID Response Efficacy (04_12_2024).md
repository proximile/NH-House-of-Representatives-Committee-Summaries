**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (April 12, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened on April 12, 2024, to evaluate the state's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan, science-focused committee aimed to assess the efficacy of public health measures, including federal guidance implementation, vaccination efforts, and the impact on New Hampshire residents. The meeting featured presentations, public testimonies, and discussions on alleged misconduct, vaccine safety, and the broader implications of pandemic policies. Key themes and findings from the meeting include:

---

### **Allegations of Data Manipulation and Misconduct**
Multiple speakers accused government agencies and healthcare institutions of manipulating COVID-19 data. Claims included:
- **Inflated Death Counts**: States like Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey were alleged to have labeled non-COVID deaths (e.g., blunt force trauma, heart attacks) as COVID-related to inflate statistics.
- **Vaccine-Related Deaths**: Several cases were cited where individuals died shortly after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, including a 98-year-old woman who suffered a heart attack and a 27-year-old who died of a pulmonary embolism. Critics argued that the CDC and FDA failed to investigate these deaths adequately and altered death certificates to omit vaccine-related codes (e.g., ICD-10 code Y59.0).
- **Whistleblower Evidence**: Whistleblower data and death certificates were referenced as proof that vaccine-related deaths were underreported or hidden from the public.

### **Critique of Hospital Protocols and Federal Incentives**
Speakers criticized hospital protocols during the pandemic, particularly the use of ventilators and drugs like Remdesivir, which they claimed were overused due to financial incentives. They argued that these practices led to unnecessary deaths and were not based on sound medical science. Additionally, federal funding and incentives were accused of coercing medical professionals into improper practices, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability.

### **Vaccine Safety and Efficacy Concerns**
Concerns about COVID-19 vaccines were a central focus of the meeting:
- **Adverse Effects**: Testimonies highlighted severe adverse reactions, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), gastroparesis, and transverse myelitis. A mother shared her daughter’s experience of being hospitalized with severe tachycardia after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
- **mRNA Vaccines**: Critics described mRNA vaccines as "gene drug therapy" deployed on a mass scale without sufficient long-term safety data. They cited examples of individuals who suffered severe reactions or died following vaccination.
- **Suppression of Dissent**: Allegations were made that social media platforms and military intelligence silenced voices critical of vaccines, including individuals who experienced vaccine injuries.

### **Impact on Education and Students**
The committee examined the effects of COVID-19 policies on education:
- **School Closures and Remote Learning**: Parents expressed frustration with inconsistent guidelines, such as changes in social distancing rules, and the negative impact on students’ mental health and academic performance.
- **Vaccination Mandates**: Pressure on students to get vaccinated for college admission was criticized, with one parent sharing her daughter’s vaccine injury story. Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency regarding vaccine risks and the difficulty of obtaining medical exemptions.
- **Discrimination**: A controversial incident at a high school prom, where unvaccinated students were marked with numbers and tracked, highlighted concerns about discrimination and privacy violations.

---

### **Calls for Transparency and Accountability**
Speakers and committee members emphasized the need for greater transparency and accountability in public health actions:
- **Legislative Action**: Support was expressed for House Bill HB1 1661, which would require New Hampshire to investigate and report vaccine-related deaths. Calls were made for a special grand jury to investigate alleged crimes by the CDC and other agencies.
- **VAERS Reporting**: Challenges in reporting vaccine injuries to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) were highlighted, including incorrect data entries and systemic barriers.
- **Future Preparedness**: The committee discussed the need for better communication, support for vaccine-injured individuals, and improved preparedness for future public health crises.

---

### **Personal Testimonies and Motivation**
Several speakers shared personal stories to underscore their concerns:
- A parent whose son died after vaccination explained their motivation to advocate for transparency and accountability.
- A mother detailed her daughter’s severe health crisis following vaccination and the challenges she faced in seeking medical care and reporting the injury.
- Committee members shared their own experiences with vaccine adverse effects, including hypertension, neurological problems, and autoimmune issues.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted significant concerns about the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including allegations of misconduct, vaccine safety, and the impact on education and students. The committee emphasized the need for transparency, accountability, and improved public health policies to address these issues and ensure better preparedness for future crises. The testimonies and discussions underscored the importance of balancing public health measures with individual rights and well-being.
