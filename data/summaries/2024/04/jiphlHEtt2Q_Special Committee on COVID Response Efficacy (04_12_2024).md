On April 12, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' **Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy** convened to evaluate the state's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan committee focused on gathering comprehensive data, assessing the efficacy of public health measures, and addressing concerns raised by citizens and experts. The meeting featured detailed testimonies, discussions on federal funding, vaccine safety, educational impacts, and calls for accountability and transparency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **1. Vaccine Safety and Adverse Effects**
Several presenters raised significant concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, alleging that they have caused severe adverse reactions, long-term health issues, and even deaths. Specific cases were cited, including:
- **Severe Reactions**: Testimonies included an 18-year-old athlete who developed tachycardia, gastroparesis, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, leading to a three-day ICU stay and ongoing health struggles.
- **Deaths Linked to Vaccines**: Presenters claimed that vaccines have caused fatalities, particularly among the elderly and younger individuals, citing cases of heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolisms.
- **DNA Contamination**: Allegations were made about DNA contamination in vaccines and its potential link to cancer.
- **Reporting Challenges**: Families and individuals faced difficulties in reporting adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), with claims of underreporting, inaccurate logging, and lack of follow-up from healthcare providers and government agencies.

### **2. Allegations of Fraud and Mismanagement**
Presenters accused federal and state agencies of fraud, mismanagement, and suppression of critical data:
- **Inflated COVID-19 Deaths**: Claims were made that states like Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey inflated COVID-19 death numbers by labeling unrelated deaths (e.g., blunt force trauma, heart attacks) as COVID-19 fatalities.
- **Data Suppression**: Presenters alleged that the CDC, FDA, and NIH omitted or altered ICD-10 codes on death certificates to hide vaccine-related adverse effects and deaths.
- **Hospital Protocols**: Criticism was directed at hospitals for prioritizing financial incentives over patient care, particularly regarding the use of drugs like Remdesivir, vancomycin, and baricitinib, which were linked to complications such as kidney failure.
