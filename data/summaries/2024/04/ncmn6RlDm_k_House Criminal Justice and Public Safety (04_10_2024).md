The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 10, 2024, focused on several key bills, with detailed discussions on **Senate Bill 504** and **Senate Bill 564**. Here’s a summary:

### **Senate Bill 504**:
- **Purpose**: Addresses immigration and border security concerns along New Hampshire’s northern border. The bill aims to allow landowners in "current use" (tax-beneficial land classification) to post "no trespassing" signs while still permitting specific recreational activities (e.g., skiing, hiking, hunting). It also seeks to empower local law enforcement to arrest trespassers, particularly those crossing the border illegally.
- **Discussion**: Prime sponsor Senator Jeb Bradley explained that the bill was requested by the governor due to increasing illegal crossings in the remote northern border region. Critics questioned the necessity given low statistics, but Bradley argued that reduced border patrol resources and the area's remoteness make it a growing issue. The bill was recessed for further tweaking.

### **Senate Bill 564**:
- **Purpose**: Expands the definition of "child" in child exploitation laws to include AI-generated images or videos that are indistinguishable from real children. The bill aims to combat the proliferation of AI-generated child sexual abuse material.
- **Discussion**: Senator Deborah Altschiller highlighted the rise of AI in creating realistic child exploitation content and the need for updated laws. Testimony from Sergeant Holly Ray of the NH State Police emphasized the challenges law enforcement faces with AI-generated content. The bill passed with strong support, though concerns were raised about First Amendment implications and the exclusion of certain artistic depictions (e.g., cartoons, drawings).

### **Other Bills**:
- **Senate Bill 248** and **Senate Bill 425** (both related to bail reform) were recessed, as similar provisions were already addressed in a comprehensive bail package.
- **Senate Bill 418** (related to alcohol testing penalties) was also recessed pending further information.
- **Senate Bill 460** (regulating unmanned aircraft systems) passed with amendments, changing penalties for violations.

### **Key Themes**:
- **Border Security**: SB 504 reflects concerns about illegal crossings and the need for local law enforcement involvement.
- **Child Protection**: SB 564 addresses the growing threat of AI-generated child exploitation material, with strong bipartisan support.
- **Legislative Process**: Several bills were recessed for further review or to avoid redundancy with existing legislation.

The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene the following Wednesday.
