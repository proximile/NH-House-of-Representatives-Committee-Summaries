The NH House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on April 23, 2024, focused on **House Bill 396**. The session began with the chair opening the work session and briefly recessing for 10 minutes. Upon reconvening, the discussion centered on the bill, which appeared to address an issue where an unauthorized commitment was made by a state employee, resulting in unintended consequences for the Palmer Regional Center for Technical Education.

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Reliance on State Communication**: Representatives noted that the center acted in good faith based on official communication from the state, leading to an expense that was later deemed unauthorized.
2. **Legal Principle of Reliance**: It was argued that when reliance on official communication leads to harm, the law typically sides with the wronged party. In this case, the center was the affected party.
3. **Proposed Solution**: Representatives emphasized the need to correct the mistake by making the center whole and ensuring such errors do not recur. The Department of Education (DOE) reportedly took responsibility and implemented process changes to prevent similar issues.
4. **Unanimous Support**: The committee unanimously voted in favor of recommending **OTP (Ought to Pass)** for the bill, moving it forward to the full Finance Committee.

The meeting concluded with logistical discussions about the next steps, including a joint session scheduled for 1:00 PM. The tone of the session was collaborative, with a focus on rectifying the issue and preventing future miscommunications.
