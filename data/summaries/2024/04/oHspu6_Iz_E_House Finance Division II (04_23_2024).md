The NH House of Representatives Finance Division II convened a work session on **House Bill 396** on April 23, 2024. The session began with the chair opening the meeting and briefly recessing for 10 minutes. Upon reconvening, the focus was on addressing an issue where a state employee had authorized an action that was not officially approved, leading to financial detriment for the **Palmer Regional Center for Technical Education**. 

Representatives discussed how the center acted in good faith, relying on state guidance, and incurred expenses based on that reliance. It was noted that the **Department of Education (DOE)** had acknowledged the mistake, taken responsibility, and implemented process changes to prevent future occurrences. Representatives emphasized the importance of making the center whole for the damages caused by the miscommunication.

The committee unanimously moved to recommend **OTP (Ought to Pass)** for House Bill 396, signaling their support for rectifying the situation. The session concluded with plans to reconvene for a joint session later in the day.
