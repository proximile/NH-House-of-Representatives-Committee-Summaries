### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on the Effect of Recent Changes to Charitable Gaming Laws (04/15/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on April 15, 2024, to discuss the impact of recent changes to charitable gaming laws. The meeting was divided into three segments, each addressing key aspects of charitable gaming, including revenue trends, legislative updates, operational challenges, and future considerations. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

#### **Revenue Trends and Uncertainty**
The meeting began with concerns about the trajectory of charitable gaming revenues. While significant growth was noted, particularly in historic horse racing (HHR) machines, there was uncertainty about whether this trend would continue or align with the downward trajectory seen in other state revenues. The commission cautioned against making dramatic legislative changes without clearer data and emphasized the need for ongoing monitoring of the market.

---

#### **Legislative Updates and Temporary Regulations**
The commission addressed **Bill SP 472**, which has passed the Senate and is now under House consideration. The bill prioritizes charities over municipalities in gaming date allocations, granting charities the right of first refusal. Municipalities can participate only if slots remain available. The bill received unanimous Senate support, with a municipal component added based on feedback from non-profit organizations. Temporary regulations were also discussed, with concerns raised about their adequacy in meeting the commission’s needs.

#### **Operational Challenges and Revenue Allocation**
1. **Breakage and Revenue Models**: The commission explored the concept of "breakage" (unclaimed winnings) and its impact on charitable gaming revenues. One operator’s absence from the breakage model could double breakage if they adopted the same approach as others. The commission considered using breakage as a percentage of gross handle (total bets) for future revenue calculations. Operators expressed concerns about the costs and resources required to comply with new software models, suggesting flexibility between breakage and flat fee models.

2. **Charity Revenue Distribution**: Significant disparities in charity revenues were highlighted, with some charities receiving over $180,000 and others less than $5,000. The commission discussed potential measures to address these disparities, such as capping charity revenues or reducing the number of days allocated to each charity to allow broader participation.

#### **Survey Results and Feedback**
A 147-page survey on charitable gaming revealed dissatisfaction among charities regarding rent issues, which the legislature is addressing. The committee agreed to review the survey findings in detail at the next meeting. Feedback from non-profit organizations and gaming operators played a crucial role in shaping discussions and legislative proposals.

#### **Market Dynamics and Growth**
The charitable gaming market has experienced rapid growth, driven by legislative changes such as the $50 maximum bet and the introduction of HHR machines. The commission acknowledged the need to monitor this growth before making further changes. Discussions also touched on the seasonal nature of gaming facilities and the variability in charity performance, which makes revenue predictions challenging.

---

#### **Future Considerations**
The commission outlined several areas for future focus:
1. **Saturation of HHR Machines**: The committee discussed the potential saturation point for HHR machines and its impact on the market.
2. **Sports Betting and Market Competition**: The impact of sports betting on charitable gaming was noted as an area requiring further analysis.
3. **License Transfer and Ownership**: The committee clarified that licenses are not transferable, though businesses can be sold. New owners must apply for a license and undergo a suitability review. Concerns about monopolies and limits on the number of licenses one entity can hold were also raised.
4. **Problem Gaming Contributions**: Two vendors currently contribute to problem gaming initiatives. The committee is considering implementing a fair annual fee for non-contributing vendors.
5. **Moratorium on New Licenses**: A potential seven-year moratorium on new gaming licenses was discussed as a way to manage market growth.

---

#### **Next Steps**
A work session was planned for the following week to further discuss **Bill SP 472**, with a potential vote expected soon. The commission will evaluate whether the bill aligns with long-term goals for charitable gaming. The next meeting was scheduled for May 6th, with flexibility to include Spectrum consultants either in person or via the Lottery office.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of regulating charitable gaming in a rapidly evolving market. The commission emphasized the need to balance the interests of charities, gaming operators, and the state while ensuring fairness and sustainability. Key priorities included addressing revenue disparities, monitoring market growth, and refining legislative proposals to maintain the charitable focus of gaming laws. Future discussions will focus on gathering more data, addressing operational challenges, and making informed decisions to support the long-term success of charitable gaming in New Hampshire.
