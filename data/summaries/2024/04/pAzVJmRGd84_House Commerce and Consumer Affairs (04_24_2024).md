**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting - House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (04/24/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 24, 2024, focused on a range of bills addressing consumer protection, financial access, public safety, and ethical practices. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and legislative actions:

---

### **Financial Access and Consumer Protection**
1. **Senate Bill 333**:  
   - **Foster Care Minors' Bank Accounts**: Allows minors aged 16+ in foster care to open checking or savings accounts without an adult co-signer, promoting financial literacy and independence. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) oversees consent, ensuring alignment with Medicaid asset limits and the minor’s goals. Foster parents cannot access these accounts; DHHS acts as the guardian.  
   - **State-Chartered Banks**: Permits state-chartered banks to have a majority of directors residing in New Hampshire or neighboring states, addressing challenges in finding qualified directors, particularly in cybersecurity.

2. **Senate Bill 502**:  
   - **Real Estate Fraud Prevention**: Allows real estate brokers to scan and verify driver’s licenses or IDs to combat fraudulent property listings by scammers posing as out-of-state owners. The bill prohibits retaining scanned IDs beyond the transaction’s closing date, with exemptions for safety reasons during property showings.  

3. **Senate Bill 332**:  
   - **Mortgage Application Privacy**: Limits the pre-disclosure of consumer credit reports during mortgage applications to protect consumers from unsolicited calls and offers. The bill requires an opt-in process for sharing credit information with third parties, addressing concerns about predatory practices and consumer confusion.

### **Public Safety and Product Regulation**
1. **Senate Bill 365**:  
   - **Lithium-Ion Battery Safety**: Prohibits the sale or distribution of uncertified lithium-ion batteries and chargers for electric mobility devices (e.g., e-bikes, scooters). The bill aims to prevent fire hazards caused by counterfeit or uncertified products, inspired by similar ordinances in New York City.  

2. **Senate Bill 407**:  
   - **Ambulance Service Reimbursement**: Originally intended to address balance billing, the bill now focuses on increasing reimbursement rates for ambulance services. Representatives expressed concerns about deviating from the original goal and proposed conducting a study to gather data on ambulance service costs before implementing rate-setting measures.

### **Consumer Contracts and Ethical Practices**
1. **Senate Bill 515**:  
   - **Consumer Guarantee Contracts**: Updates regulations on extended warranties and service contracts to prevent deceptive practices, particularly those targeting vulnerable populations like seniors. The bill strengthens identification requirements, prohibits unbranded solicitations, and ensures transparency in contract terms.  

2. **Senate Bill 97**:  
   - **Animal Testing Regulations**: Prohibits animal testing for products when alternative methods are available, with exceptions for biomedical research and life-saving drug development. The bill includes a reporting mechanism for companies to disclose animal testing on their websites, promoting transparency without state surveillance. Dartmouth College and UNH requested exemptions for federally funded biomedical research, emphasizing its importance for medical advancements.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Consumer Protection**: Many bills focused on safeguarding consumers from fraud, predatory practices, and deceptive contracts, particularly targeting vulnerable populations like seniors and foster youth.  
- **Public Safety**: Legislation addressed safety concerns related to lithium-ion batteries and ambulance service funding, emphasizing the need for certified products and adequate financial support for emergency services.
