**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Criminal Justice and Public Safety (04/22/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 22, 2024, addressed two major topics: **ICE detainers and local law enforcement cooperation** and **Senate Bill 563 with a proposed non-germane amendment related to eviction and tenant rights**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **ICE Detainers and Local Law Enforcement Cooperation**

1. **ICE Detainers and Public Safety**:  
   The meeting focused on a bill concerning ICE detainers, which are requests from federal immigration authorities to hold individuals for potential immigration violations. Supporters argued that honoring detainers is essential for public safety, particularly for individuals with serious criminal backgrounds. Opponents raised concerns about potential overreach, the erosion of trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, and the risk of discouraging vulnerable populations from seeking help.

2. **Sanctuary Cities Debate**:  
   Representatives debated whether New Hampshire has "sanctuary cities" that prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE. While some argued that certain towns have such policies, others contended that there are no true sanctuary cities in the state.

3. **Legal and Financial Implications**:  
   Concerns were raised about the legal risks of enforcing ICE detainers, including potential lawsuits against municipalities. Discussions also highlighted the distinction between criminal warrants and civil immigration detainers, with some suggesting the bill should focus solely on criminal detainers.

4. **Community Impact**:  
   Opponents emphasized that the bill could create fear and discrimination in immigrant communities, potentially harming public safety by discouraging cooperation with law enforcement.

5. **Potential Amendments**:  
   Representatives proposed narrowing the bill to focus on prohibiting local law enforcement from ignoring ICE detainers, rather than addressing broader sanctuary city policies. Clarifying the language to distinguish between civil and criminal detainers was also discussed.

6. **Next Steps**:  
   The meeting concluded with plans to continue the discussion in an executive session, where potential amendments to the bill would be considered.

### **Senate Bill 563 and Eviction/Tenant Rights Amendment**

1. **Opening and Amendment Overview**:  
   The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by an announcement that a non-germane amendment to **Senate Bill 563** would undergo significant changes. The amendment initially aimed to address eviction processes, particularly for unauthorized occupants or "squatters," but concerns were raised about its broad scope and lack of due process.

2. **Public Testimony**:  
   Multiple stakeholders provided testimony:  
   - **Nick Norman** (housing advocate) highlighted the need to remove illegal occupants but criticized the requirement for written leases, which could exclude legitimate tenants.  
   - **Jessica Marison** (tenant organizer) opposed the amendment, arguing it removes due process and could lead to wrongful evictions, especially for tenants without formal leases.  
   - **Ben Kramer** (NH Youth Movement) emphasized the precarious housing situation for young people and the state’s rising homelessness rate.  
   - **Elliott Barry** (retired legal aid attorney) clarified that New Hampshire does not recognize squatters' rights except after 20 years of adverse possession and warned against stripping tenants of their rights without due process.  
   - **Grace Kandi** (AFSC) urged the committee to balance landlord interests with tenant protections.

3. **Amendment Withdrawal**:  
   The committee decided to withdraw the current amendment and draft a new non-germane amendment for a separate bill, with a public hearing scheduled for the following week.

4. **Underlying Bill (SB 563) Discussion**:  
   The committee discussed SB 563, which includes provisions requiring law enforcement to support federal immigration enforcement. Concerns were raised about the bill’s broad scope and potential for unfunded mandates on local law enforcement. Representative Sciacca proposed limiting the bill to prohibiting law enforcement from inquiring about citizenship status unless an ICE detainer is issued during an arrest for a state crime.

5. **Training and Enforcement Concerns**:  
   Representatives debated whether local law enforcement is adequately trained to handle immigration-related issues and evictions. Some argued that police are already trained for these tasks, while others expressed concerns about unintended consequences.

6. **Next Steps**:  
   The committee agreed to revisit SB 563 and the new non-germane amendment in future sessions, focusing on narrowing the scope and ensuring due process for tenants.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**

The meeting highlighted several key themes:  
- **Balancing Public Safety and Community Trust**: Discussions emphasized the need to ensure public safety while maintaining trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.  
- **Protecting Vulnerable Populations**: Concerns were raised about the potential harm to immigrants, tenants, and other vulnerable groups from both the ICE detainer bill and the eviction amendment.  
- **Legal and Financial Implications**: Representatives grappled with the legal and financial risks of enforcing ICE detainers and the unintended consequences of eviction policies.  
- **Need for Narrower Legislation**: Both segments of the meeting underscored the importance of narrowing the scope of proposed bills and amendments to address specific issues without overreach.  

The committee emphasized the need for careful deliberation, stakeholder input, and further discussion in future sessions to refine the legislation and balance competing interests.
