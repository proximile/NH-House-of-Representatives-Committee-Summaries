The NH House of Representatives' Election Law Committee meeting on April 24, 2024, focused on **Senate Bill 534**, which addresses campaign finance reform. The meeting began with procedural updates, including the scheduling of an executive session for the following week to vote on the bill. Senator James Gray (District 6) introduced the bill, emphasizing the Senate's involvement in campaign finance and the need for reform, particularly to improve the readability and accessibility of campaign finance reports. He highlighted the importance of combining candidate and committee filings and addressed challenges with electronic filing systems.

Representative Lane raised questions about the mandatory online filing requirement in the House version of the bill, which was not included in the Senate version. Senator Gray acknowledged concerns about accessibility for some filers but noted the benefits of electronic filing for transparency and efficiency.

Aaron Hennessy, Deputy Secretary of State, expressed support for both the House and Senate versions of the bill, advocating for a combined approach that incorporates the strengths of each. He emphasized the importance of accessibility compliance under new U.S. DOJ regulations and the need for clear definitions in the bill, such as those related to political advocacy organizations and campaign material disclaimers.

The public hearing concluded with no additional public comments, and the committee prepared for a brief executive session to recess the vote on SB 534 until the next meeting. The bill aims to streamline campaign finance reporting, improve transparency, and address practical challenges in filing and accessibility.
