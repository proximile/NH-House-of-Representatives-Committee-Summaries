### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (April 10, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 10, 2024, focused on discussions and decisions regarding several key bills, primarily **Senate Bills 507, 185, 435, 314, and 327**. The meeting highlighted the complexity of the issues addressed, the importance of stakeholder involvement, and the need for legislative clarity and modernization. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **1. Senate Bill 507: Extending Time Limits for New Trial Petitions**
**Purpose**:  
The bill aims to extend the current 3-year statute of limitations for filing petitions for a new trial in criminal cases based on newly discovered evidence or changes in scientific understanding. It addresses wrongful convictions by allowing more time for individuals to present new evidence, particularly in light of advancements in forensic science.  

**Key Discussions**:  
- **Testimony from Advocates**: Senator Becky Whitley and Cynthia Muso (New England Innocence Project) emphasized the importance of extending the time limit, citing cases where new forensic evidence led to overturned convictions.  
- **Concerns from Prosecutors**: Attorneys Step Anders and Paul Halverson supported the bill's intent but raised concerns about its application to an outdated 1842 statute originally meant for civil cases. They recommended clarifying the language to ensure it only addresses the statute of limitations.  
- **Scientific Advances**: The bill accounts for changes in forensic science (e.g., DNA testing, arson science, bite mark analysis) that could exonerate individuals.  
- **Amendments**: Prosecutors suggested revising the bill's language to make it clearer that it only extends the time frame for filing motions, not the criteria for granting new trials.  

**Outcome**:  
The hearing on SB 507 was closed after no further testimony was offered. The committee requested the researcher to compare New Hampshire's DNA testing requirements with those of other states.

### **2. Senate Bill 185: Study Committee on Hospital Discharge Barriers**
**Purpose**:  
The bill proposes the establishment of a study committee to address barriers preventing patients from being discharged from acute care hospitals, even when they no longer require acute care.  

**Key Discussions**:  
- **Barriers Identified**: Lack of community support, insufficient long-term care beds, guardianship issues, Medicaid eligibility challenges, and family refusals.  
- **Impact**: Patients face declining health due to prolonged isolation, while hospitals experience bed shortages, increased costs, and delays in admitting new patients. For example, at St. Josephâ€™s Hospital, five patients occupied beds for 756 days, with only 66 days being medically necessary.  
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: The committee would involve hospitals, disability rights organizations, AARP, adult protective services, and other stakeholders.  
- **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the need for a study committee, while others raised concerns about the aggressive timeline (November 1, 2024) for completing the work.  

**Outcome**:  
Despite reservations, the majority agreed to move forward with the bill, and it was passed.
