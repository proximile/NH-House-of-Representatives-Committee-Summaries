The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on April 23, 2024, focused on several key transportation-related bills and discussions, addressing issues ranging from speed limits and driver’s licenses to surveillance and funeral procession safety. Here is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Speed Limits on State Highways**
1. **Statutory Speed Limits**: The Department of Transportation (DOT) clarified that speed limits on state highways are governed by RSA 265:60, with specific limits for urban residential (35 mph), certain areas (30 mph), and rural regions (55 mph). The DOT Commissioner can adjust speed limits based on engineering and traffic investigations, though such changes rarely support lowering speeds.
2. **Legislative Intent**: A proposal aimed to establish a statutory speed limit of 45 mph for rural two-lane roads to ensure consistency. However, there is no plan to proactively review all speed limits. Examples like Route 120 and Route 12 highlighted the confusion caused by varying speed limits, with the goal of creating uniform limits based on road conditions.
3. **Enforcement Challenges**: Law enforcement faces difficulties enforcing speed limits that do not align with prevailing traffic speeds, leading to inconsistent enforcement.

### **Surveillance at Park-and-Ride Facilities**
1. **Senate Bill 469**: This bill proposes allowing surveillance at state-owned park-and-ride facilities managed by private entities, such as bus companies, to enhance security. It includes privacy protections, such as limiting video retention to 24 days unless required for legal purposes and restricting access to law enforcement for criminal investigations.
2. **Constitutional Concerns**: Questions were raised about potential conflicts with the state constitutional amendment protecting individuals from government intrusion. It was clarified that the bill applies to leased facilities operated by private entities, not directly by the state.

### **Driver’s Licenses and Identification Cards**
1. **Senate Bill 581**: This bill formalizes the issuance of temporary driver’s licenses and non-driver identification cards, clarifying that temporary credentials issued at the counter are valid for driving, while online renewals provide a receipt that must be used with the previous license.
2. **Senate Bill 501**: This bill clarifies driver’s license eligibility for non-citizens residing in New Hampshire, consolidating existing language to make the process clearer and removing the requirement for proof of foreign driving experience for temporary non-citizen drivers. Concerns about voter fraud were addressed, with assurances that voting eligibility is strictly tied to citizenship.

### **Senate Bill 358: Invalidating Out-of-State Licenses for Undocumented Immigrants**
1. **Purpose**: The bill aims to invalidate out-of-state driver’s licenses issued to undocumented immigrants, applying the same standards as New Hampshire does for its own licenses.
2. **Support**: Proponents cited safety and immigration concerns, including incidents involving undocumented immigrants.
3. **Opposition**: Critics argued the bill promotes racial profiling, is impractical, and could lead to legal challenges, potentially isolating New Hampshire from other states and harming its reputation.

### **Senate Bill 471: 45 MPH Speed Limit on Rural Highways**
1. **Purpose**: Introduces a 45 mph speed limit for rural highways, providing a middle ground between the current 35 mph and 55 mph limits.
2. **Support**: Proponents argued it would enhance road safety by allowing more flexibility in setting speed limits, particularly on roads with varying speed limits or safety concerns.
3. **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about the lack of data on crash fatalities and the potential costs of implementing the bill, arguing that the DOT already has the authority to adjust speed limits based on safety studies.

### **Senate Bill 598: Funeral Procession Lead Vehicles Obeying Yield Signs**
1. **Purpose**: Requires funeral procession lead vehicles to obey yield signs, addressing a technical gap in the current statute.
2. **Support**: The New Hampshire Funeral Directors Association supported the bill, emphasizing its importance for safety, especially with the increase in roundabouts and traffic circles.

### **Other Bills Discussed**
1. **Senate Bill 582**: Allows residents to use an alternate mailing address with the DMV when temporarily away from their residence for less than six months, formalizing an existing practice.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Safety**: Many bills focused on improving road safety, from setting appropriate speed limits to ensuring funeral processions obey traffic signs.
2. **Local Concerns**: Representatives highlighted specific roads in their districts where accidents and fatalities have occurred, emphasizing the need for legislative action.
3. **Practical Solutions**: The bills were described as straightforward, practical measures to address gaps in current statutes and improve road safety without requiring major infrastructure changes.

Overall, the meeting highlighted efforts to enhance transportation safety and security while balancing privacy concerns, legal considerations, and practical implementation challenges.
