The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee meeting on April 3, 2024, focused on several key bills and amendments related to professional licensing, maternal health, military families, and administrative processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Maternal Health and Licensing for Doulas and Lactation Providers (Senate Bill 337)**
Senate Bill 337 addressed technical issues in Medicaid coverage for doulas and lactation service providers, correcting oversights from a previous bill (SB 175). Introduced by Senator Becky Whitley, the bill ensures that these providers can be certified to bill Medicaid, with the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) determining the certification process. An amendment was proposed to remove specific credentialing requirements, allowing OPLC to set appropriate standards. Testimony from stakeholders, including lactation consultants and public health experts, emphasized the importance of improving access to maternal care while addressing concerns about credentialing. The bill also raised fiscal considerations, as voluntary certification programs may require additional OPLC staff and potentially higher licensing fees.

### **Digital Licensing for Military Families (Senate Bill 485 and House Bill 1385)**
Senate Bill 485, introduced by Senator Sharon Carson, aimed to streamline occupational licensing for military service members and their spouses, who often face challenges when relocating due to military assignments. The bill proposed a secure, pre-verified digital database to expedite license transfers, reducing the process from weeks or months to a few days. A representative from Merit International presented a digital platform designed to facilitate this process, highlighting its potential to reduce income loss for military families. The OPLC expressed support but noted the need to align SB 485 with House Bill 1385, which also addresses military licensing reciprocity. Both bills were discussed in the context of improving cross-state licensing efficiency and supporting military families.

### **Physician Assistant (PA) Licensure Compact (Senate Bill 486)**
Senate Bill 486 proposed joining the PA Licensure Compact, which would allow PAs to practice across multiple states without obtaining separate licenses. The compact, which requires seven states to join before a commission is established, aims to benefit military families, telehealth providers, and states facing healthcare workforce shortages. However, concerns were raised about whether the compact would override New Hampshire's requirement for PAs to have collaborative agreements with physicians. It was clarified that the compact would not alter state-specific scope-of-practice laws. Some representatives expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of compacts, citing a lack of data on their outcomes and concerns about potential increases in healthcare costs. Representative Groa moved to **ITL** (Inexpedient to Legislate) the bill, arguing that New Hampshire should wait to assess the compact's impact before joining. The committee ultimately voted to **ITL** the bill.

### **Other Licensing and Administrative Issues**
1. **Physician Assistant Regulations (Senate Bill 488)**: This bill addressed two regulatory issues for PAs: continuing medical education (CME) recordkeeping and exemptions from barbering/cosmetology licensing requirements for certain medical procedures. The bill received support from the PA community and the OPLC, with minor amendments proposed for clarity.

2. **Public Notice for Board Meetings (Senate Bill 369)**: This bill proposed a 14-day public notice requirement for OPLC board meetings, with flexibility for emergencies. The goal was to improve transparency and public participation, addressing concerns about short notice and cancellations. An amendment was suggested to clarify language regarding public comment periods.

3. **Resident Physician Licensing (Senate Bill 371)**: This bill sought to adjust licensing requirements for resident physicians, aligning licenses with the duration of their residency rather than requiring renewal every two years. Dartmouth Health supported the bill, citing administrative challenges and the need to maintain workforce pipelines. An amendment was proposed to address statutory inconsistencies.

4. **Manufactured Housing Dispute Resolution (Senate Bill 306)**: This bill shifted rulemaking authority for dispute resolution in manufactured housing from the Installation Standards Board to the OPLC. The goal was to align with federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requirements and avoid relying on the unpopular federal dispute resolution process.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Streamlining Processes**: Many bills aimed to simplify licensing and administrative procedures, particularly for military families, healthcare professionals, and maternal health providers.
- **Fiscal Considerations**: The committee frequently discussed the financial implications of these bills, including the need for additional OPLC staff and potential increases in licensing fees.
- **Stakeholder Input**: Public testimony and amendments played a significant role in shaping the discussions, with stakeholders emphasizing the importance of addressing specific challenges faced by vulnerable populations.
- **Skepticism Toward Compacts**: The committee expressed caution about joining interstate compacts, citing a lack of data on their effectiveness and concerns about unintended consequences.

Ultimately, the meeting highlighted the committee's focus on balancing efficiency, fiscal responsibility, and statutory alignment while addressing the needs of various stakeholders.
