**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Meeting (04/03/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on April 3, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on several bills related to professional licensing, healthcare, and administrative processes. The meeting focused on streamlining licensing procedures, addressing workforce needs, improving transparency, and expanding access to healthcare services. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Military and Occupational Licensing (Senate Bill 485)**
- **Purpose**: SB 485 aims to streamline the licensing process for military service members and their spouses by introducing digital occupational licensing. It addresses challenges faced by military families who frequently relocate, ensuring faster license approval and improved portability.
- **Support**: The bill received strong support from Senator Carson, the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA). It aligns with House Bill 1385 and emphasizes the need for a crosswalk between military occupational specialties and state licensing requirements.

#### **2. Physician Assistant Licensing Fixes (Senate Bill 488)**
- **Purpose**: SB 488 addresses minor regulatory issues for physician assistants (PAs), including exemptions from barbering and cosmetology licensing requirements and clarifying continuing medical education (CME) recordkeeping.
- **Support**: Introduced by Senator Pearl, the bill received unanimous Senate support and testimony from PAs highlighting its importance for consistency in healthcare regulations.

#### **3. Public Notice and Transparency (Senate Bill 369)**
- **Purpose**: SB 369 establishes a 14-day public notice requirement for OPLC board meetings, with exceptions for emergencies. It also ensures public comment opportunities and creates a new attorney position within OPLC to ensure compliance.
- **Support**: The bill, introduced by Senator Carson, addresses concerns from the governor’s previous veto and aims to improve transparency and public participation in board meetings. Stakeholders, including the Electrical Contractors Business Association, supported the bill.

#### **4. Resident Physician Licensing (Senate Bill 371)**
- **Purpose**: SB 371 proposes aligning resident physicians’ license renewals with the duration of residency programs (typically 3-4 years) to avoid mid-residency renewals, which can disrupt training.
- **Support**: Dartmouth Health and other hospitals emphasized the importance of this change for maintaining workforce pipelines. An amendment was proposed to clarify rulemaking authority for license durations.

#### **5. Manufactured Housing Dispute Resolution (Senate Bill 306)**
- **Purpose**: SB 306 shifts rulemaking authority for manufactured housing dispute resolution from the Installation Standards Board to OPLC, streamlining processes and ensuring compliance with federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requirements.
- **Concerns**: Some members raised issues about the lack of clarity in defining disputes to be resolved and suggested retaining or relocating statutory language for proper oversight.

#### **6. Medicaid Coverage for Doulas and Lactation Services (Senate Bill 337)**
- **Purpose**: SB 337 addresses a technical oversight in SB 175 (2023) by allowing OPLC to certify lactation service providers and doulas for Medicaid reimbursement, without mandating certification for all practitioners.
- **Amendment**: Senator Becky Whitley proposed removing specific credentialing requirements, allowing OPLC to determine certification standards through rulemaking.
- **Testimony**: Stakeholders debated which credentials (e.g., IBCLC vs. CLC) should qualify for Medicaid reimbursement, with most supporting the amendment to let OPLC set standards. The bill aims to expand access to maternal health services for Medicaid recipients.

#### **7. Physician Assistant Licensure Compact (Senate Bill 486)**
- **Purpose**: SB 486 proposes adopting a multi-state licensure compact for PAs to streamline licensing processes and increase healthcare provider mobility, particularly benefiting military families and border regions.
- **Concerns**: Some members questioned the necessity of the compact, citing existing reciprocity laws and expedited licensing processes. Others raised concerns about the lack of data on the compact’s effectiveness and its financial implications.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 11-0 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate," citing the need to allow existing licensing reforms to take effect and wait for more information on the compact’s outcomes.

### **Themes and Outcomes**
- **Streamlining Licensing Processes**: Several bills focused on reducing bureaucratic hurdles for military families, resident physicians, and healthcare providers, with a strong emphasis on digital licensing and alignment with federal requirements.
- **Transparency and Public Participation**: SB 369 highlighted the committee’s commitment to improving transparency in board meetings and ensuring public involvement in decision-making.
- **Healthcare Access and Workforce Needs**: Bills like SB 337 and SB 371 aimed to expand access to maternal health services and address workforce pipeline challenges in healthcare.
- **Financial and Operational Concerns**: Throughout the discussions, committee members expressed caution about the financial sustainability of new licensing programs and the potential burden on existing license holders.
- **Collaborative Practice Agreements**: The PA licensure compact (SB 486) raised important questions about supervisory agreements and the need for state-specific privileges.

### **Next Steps**
- Bills were referred to subcommittees for further review and amendments.
- The committee plans to monitor the implementation of existing licensing reforms and revisit certain compacts (e.g., PA licensure compact) in the future once more data is available.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a balanced approach to addressing professional licensing and administrative challenges, with a focus on improving efficiency, transparency, and support for military families and healthcare professionals. While many bills received broad support, the committee exercised caution in expanding compacts and new licensing programs, emphasizing the need for clarity, financial sustainability, and evidence-based decision-making.
