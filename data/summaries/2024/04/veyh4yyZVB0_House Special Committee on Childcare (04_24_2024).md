The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Childcare held its final meeting on April 24, 2024, to discuss **Senate Bill 404**, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services to submit a report on establishing a childcare workforce assistant program. The committee focused on **Amendment 2024-1571H**, which aimed to reintroduce provisions removed by the Senate Finance Committee, including removing the term "pilot" and adding a request for federal funding waivers.

Key points of discussion:
1. **Purpose of the Bill**: Addresses childcare workforce shortages by allowing childcare workers with young children to access state childcare scholarships, seen as a recruitment tool.
2. **Amendment Details**: The amendment reinstates elements from the Senate Health and Human Services Committeeâ€™s version, such as removing the word "pilot" and requesting federal permission to use funds for the program.
3. **Financial Impact**: The financial note remains unchanged, and the committee expressed confidence that federal approval for the waiver is likely.
4. **Support for the Amendment**: Committee members supported the amendment, noting it adds "guardrails" to the bill and mitigates concerns about shifting costs to New Hampshire taxpayers.
5. **Vote Outcome**: The amendment passed unanimously (10-0), and the bill was approved as amended with another unanimous vote (10-0).

The meeting concluded with the committee adjourning, as it had no further business. Representative Deon was tasked with preparing the report on the bill.
