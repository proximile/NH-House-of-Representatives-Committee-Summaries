### **Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: Criminal Justice and Public Safety (04/17/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on April 17, 2024, to discuss several key bills addressing immigration, public safety, criminal justice reform, and victim compensation. The meeting featured robust debates, stakeholder testimonies, and detailed discussions on the implications of each bill. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **1. Immigration and Sanctuary Policies (Senate Bill 563 and Senate Bill 653)**

#### **Senate Bill 563**:
- **Purpose**: Prohibits "sanctuary policies" in New Hampshire, mandating state and local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities (ICE). It requires compliance with ICE detainers and the use of "best efforts" to enforce federal immigration laws.
- **Support**: Proponents argued the bill is necessary for public safety, preventing criminal illegal immigrants from evading deportation. Organizations like the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) cited data suggesting illegal immigrants are more likely to commit crimes and burden taxpayers.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the ACLU and immigrant advocacy groups, argued the bill would foster fear and distrust in immigrant communities, reduce cooperation with law enforcement, and lead to racial profiling. They emphasized that undocumented immigrants contribute to the economy and that New Hampshire has no sanctuary cities.
- **Law Enforcement Concerns**: Several law enforcement leaders opposed the bill, stating it would undermine community trust and divert resources from public safety.
- **Outcome**: No immediate decision was made; the committee planned a full work session for the following Tuesday.

#### **Senate Bill 653**:
- **Purpose**: Prevents New Hampshire from becoming a sanctuary state by requiring law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities when encountering individuals with ICE detainers.
- **Key Provisions**: Law enforcement must make "best efforts" to contact ICE, such as holding individuals for up to 24 hours, but is not required to enforce federal immigration laws. The bill includes protections for crime victims and witnesses to ensure they are not targeted for deportation.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised issues of racial profiling, financial costs, and the impact on immigrant communities’ trust in law enforcement.

### **2. Criminal Justice and Public Safety Reforms**

#### **Senate Bill 315 (Bias Crimes Reporting)**:
- **Purpose**: Mandates law enforcement agencies to report bias-motivated crimes (hate crimes) to the Department of Safety to collect data, allocate resources, and address trends.
- **Collaboration**: Developed with input from the Attorney General’s office, State Police, and ACLU.
- **Support**: The ACLU and Attorney General’s office emphasized the importance of data collection for improving law enforcement responses and supporting affected communities.

#### **Senate Bill 321 (Bail Reform)**:
- **Purpose**: Modifies the rebuttable presumption for detaining individuals who fail to appear in court, shifting from three no-shows in five years to mandatory detention after three no-shows.
- **Goal**: Addresses issues with the bail system and ensures accountability for repeat offenders.

#### **Senate Bill 424 (Parole and Probation Reforms)**:
- **Purpose**: Provides clearer legal direction for parole and probation officers, incentivizing rehabilitation by considering factors like employment, treatment engagement, and compliance with parole conditions.
- **Key Changes**: Introduces an annual audit requirement to identify candidates for sentence reduction and reduces probation officers’ caseloads by rewarding rehabilitated individuals.

#### **Senate Bill 426 (Marijuana Transportation Regulation)**:
- **Purpose**: Regulates the transportation of marijuana in vehicles, requiring it to be stored out of reach of the driver, similar to alcohol.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised issues about the treatment of medical marijuana users and potential unintended consequences.

### **3. Victim Compensation and Justice**

#### **Senate Bill 591 (Youth Development Center Abuse Compensation)**:
- **Purpose**: Modifies the settlement fund for victims of abuse at the Youth Development Center (YDC), increasing compensation caps and expanding the scope of abuse covered.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Increases compensation caps: $2.5 million for egregious sexual abuse and $250,000 for other abuse (e.g., solitary confinement, unlawful restraint).
  - Extends the filing deadline to June 30, 2025.
  - Allows payments in installments to manage the state’s budget, with a $75 million annual cap and 5% interest on deferred payments.
- **Process Improvements**: Removes mandatory timelines, eliminates the Attorney General’s office requirement to take a position before hearings, and emphasizes a victim-centered, trauma-informed approach.
- **Support**: Both the Attorney General’s office and attorneys representing YDC victims praised the bill for its fairness and efficiency in addressing claims.

#### **Senate Bill 578 (Electronic Monitoring Costs)**:
- **Purpose**: Ensures indigent individuals are not required to pay for electronic monitoring if their case ends without a conviction.
- **Discussion**: Representatives debated the financial burden on low-income individuals and the administrative challenges of collecting fees post-conviction.

### **4. Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Immigration**: Deep divisions were evident over SB 563 and SB 653, with debates centering on public safety, community trust, and economic contributions of immigrants.
- **Criminal Justice Reform**: Bills like SB 315, SB 321, and SB 424 aimed to improve data collection, accountability, and rehabilitation within the criminal justice system.
- **Victim Compensation**: SB 591 represented a significant step toward justice for YDC abuse victims, balancing fair compensation with the state’s fiscal responsibility.
- **Collaboration and Compromise**: Many bills, including SB 591 and SB 315, were developed through collaboration with stakeholders, reflecting a commitment to fairness and efficiency.
