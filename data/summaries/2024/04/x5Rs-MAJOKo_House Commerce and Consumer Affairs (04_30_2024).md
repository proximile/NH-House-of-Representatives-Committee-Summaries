### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (04/30/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on April 30, 2024, to discuss several key bills related to healthcare, insurance, pharmaceuticals, and small business licensing. The meeting centered on efforts to address high prescription drug costs, insurance practices, and regulatory challenges faced by businesses. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and debates:

---

### **1. Senate Bill 555: Pharmaceutical Rebates and Consumer Savings**
**Objective**: To reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs by requiring insurers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) to pass through at least **50% of negotiated drug rebates** directly to consumers at the point of sale.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Proponents, including Senator Kevin Avard and **PhRMA**, argued that the bill would provide immediate savings to patients, particularly those on fixed incomes or high-deductible plans. Advocates highlighted that high out-of-pocket costs often lead to medication non-adherence, worsening health outcomes, and higher long-term costs. Examples from states like West Virginia and Arkansas showed similar laws implemented without significant premium increases.
- **Opposition**: Insurers and PBMs warned that diverting rebates from insurers to consumers could lead to **higher premiums**. Representative Spear cited a December 2023 analysis suggesting premiums could rise by **$40 per person per month**. Critics also noted that rebates apply to only about **3% of drugs**, primarily brand-name medications, and argued the bill does not address the root issue of high drug prices set by manufacturers.
- **Broader Implications**: The committee grappled with balancing immediate consumer relief against potential premium increases and the complexity of the pharmaceutical supply chain.

### **2. Senate Bill 354: Pharmaceutical Coupons and Co-Pay Assistance Programs**
**Objective**: To ensure that pharmaceutical coupons and co-pay assistance programs count toward patients’ insurance deductibles, preventing insurers from “double-dipping.”

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Advocates, including patients with chronic illnesses like cystic fibrosis and hemophilia, testified that high drug costs and **co-pay accumulator programs** leave patients financially burdened. The bill has broad support from organizations like the **American Cancer Society** and the **New England Hemophilia Association**. Nineteen other states have passed similar laws without significant premium increases.
- **Opposition**: Insurers and PBMs argued that the bill could incentivize the use of expensive brand-name drugs over generics, leading to higher overall drug costs and premiums. The NH Insurance Department expressed concerns that the bill might undermine efforts to promote generics and biosimilars.
- **Amendment Suggestions**: The Insurance Department proposed amendments to include biosimilars and address potential unintended consequences.

### **3. Senate Bill 557: 340B Drug Pricing Program Protections**
**Objective**: To prevent discriminatory practices against entities participating in the **340B drug pricing program**, which provides discounted drugs to healthcare organizations serving low-income and uninsured patients.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Testimonies highlighted the program’s importance in supporting critical healthcare services and the negative impact of restrictions imposed by pharmaceutical manufacturers on contract pharmacies.
- **Broader Impact**: The discussion emphasized the need to protect programs that support vulnerable populations and ensure access to affordable medications.

### **4. Senate Bill 325: Licensing of Insurance Appraisers**
**Objective**: To address discrepancies in auto insurance appraisals by licensing independent appraisers and ensuring fair compensation for auto body repairs.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Auto body shop owners and consumers testified about significant discrepancies between initial appraisals and final repair costs, advocating for impartial appraisers to ensure fairness.
- **Opposition**: Insurance industry representatives argued that existing regulations and licensed claims adjusters already oversee appraisals, making additional licensing unnecessary.
- **Study Committee**: The bill proposed forming a study committee to further explore the issue.

---

### **5. Senate Bill 137: Craft Brewery Licensing Reform**
**Objective**: To streamline New Hampshire’s brewery licensing system by creating a four-tier structure based on production volume and offering more flexibility in what breweries can sell.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: The **Craft Brewers Association** and brewery owners argued that the current rigid licensing system puts NH breweries at a competitive disadvantage compared to neighboring states. The reform would simplify regulations, reduce confusion, and boost economic growth.
- **Amendment**: The bill was amended to adjust the effective date and correct technical details.

---

### **6. Broader Themes and Challenges**
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Several bills, including SB 555 and SB 354, emphasized the need for greater transparency in pharmaceutical rebates, co-pay assistance programs, and insurance practices.
- **Balancing Consumer Relief and Systemic Costs**: The committee wrestled with the challenge of providing immediate financial relief to consumers while avoiding unintended consequences, such as higher premiums or increased drug prices.
- **Economic Growth and Fairness**: Reforms in brewery licensing and auto insurance appraisals aimed to promote fairness, simplify regulations, and support economic growth.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of addressing high healthcare costs, insurance practices, and regulatory challenges. While bills like SB 555 and SB 354 sought to provide immediate relief to consumers, concerns about premium increases, market dynamics, and systemic issues like high drug prices remained central to the debate. Similarly, reforms in auto insurance appraisals and brewery licensing aimed to promote fairness and economic growth. The committee’s deliberations underscored the need for careful consideration of policies that balance immediate benefits with long-term impacts on consumers, businesses, and the broader healthcare system.
