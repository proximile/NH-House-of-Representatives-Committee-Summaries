**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (April 29, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on April 29, 2024, addressed several key issues, including funding for shelter programs, property tax offsets, and efforts to reduce hunger among vulnerable populations. The discussions highlighted the challenges of balancing immediate needs with long-term financial sustainability, particularly in an off-budget year.

### Shelter Program Funding and Related Bills
1. **Shelter Program Funding**: Members debated the state’s contribution to shelter bed costs, noting that shelters rely on a mix of state funding, grants, and fundraising. Concerns were raised about the sustainability of increasing funding, especially given the rising demand for shelter beds and the state’s current 100% coverage of general funds (as shelters are ineligible for federal HUD funding). The need to ensure financial stability for existing programs was emphasized.

2. **Senate Bill 406**: This bill proposed increasing funding for shelter programs from $20 to $27 per bed per day, prioritizing veterans and addressing challenges in serving individuals without legal identification. A motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill was made, citing the recent funding increase from $8 to $20 and the lack of time to assess its impact. Supporters argued that the need is urgent, with shelters at capacity and homelessness rising. The motion to ITL passed with a 5-3 vote.

3. **Senate Bill 311**: This bill proposed a property tax offset for the town of Hampstead due to the state’s acquisition of Hampstead Hospital. Members debated whether this should be a one-time payment or an ongoing obligation, with concerns raised about setting a precedent for future state acquisitions. The bill passed with a 7-1 vote, recommending it to the full House Finance Committee.

### Senate Bill 499: Reducing Hunger Among Vulnerable Populations
**Senate Bill 499** aimed to reduce hunger among children, older adults, and people with disabilities. The bill was divided into two parts: an education portion handled by Division II and an elderly affairs portion handled by Division III.

1. **Amendment 2024-1650H**: Proposed by Representative Edwards, this amendment replaced the entire bill with a simplified elderly SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) application process, allocating $37,500 to streamline the process and reduce the need for frequent reapplication. The amendment excluded the education portion, which included a summer EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) program for children.
   - **Summer EBT Program**: This federal program provides $40 per child per month during the summer to families with children eligible for free or reduced meals during the school year. The state would need to fund the infrastructure (approximately $1.1 million in the first year) to implement the program.
   - **Division III’s Role**: Division III focused on the elderly portion, while Division II was responsible for the education portion. However, Division II did not meet to discuss their part of the bill, leading to concerns about the process and potential loss of the summer EBT program.

2. **Debate on the Amendment**:
   - **Supporters**: Argued that the elderly SNAP simplification is a critical and cost-effective measure that could save administrative costs in the long run. They expressed skepticism about relying on federal funding for the summer EBT program, given the federal government's financial instability.
   - **Opponents**: Criticized the amendment for gutting the entire bill, particularly the summer EBT program, which they argued is vital for 37,325 children in poverty. They also raised concerns about the process, as Division II had not yet reviewed their portion of the bill.

3. **Vote on the Amendment**: The amendment passed 5-3, with Division III recommending the bill’s passage as amended. The final decision will go to the full House Finance Committee.

### Process Concerns and Conclusion
A representative expressed frustration with the handling of Senate Bill 499, citing a lack of transparency and communication about the bill’s division and plan, which disrupted the expected workflow. The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the sensitive nature of the issues discussed and a commitment to diligent review of bills, especially in an off-budget year.

The meeting highlighted tensions between prioritizing immediate needs (elderly SNAP simplification) and broader social programs (summer EBT for children). The process raised concerns about coordination between divisions and the potential loss of critical services. The final decision on both bills will be made by the full House Finance Committee by May 16, 2024.
