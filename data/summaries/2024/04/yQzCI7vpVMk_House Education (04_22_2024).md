### **Key Bills Discussed:**

#### **1. Senate Bill 596: Child Care Scholarship Program and Disability Definition**
- **Purpose**: Expands the definition of "disability" under the Child Care Scholarship Program to include children at risk of developmental delays, even without a formal diagnosis, allowing childcare providers to access additional funding ($100 per week) for early intervention.
- **Key Points**:
  - Focuses on children showing signs of delays (e.g., speech, motor, or social-emotional issues) who may later be diagnosed with conditions like autism or ADHD.
  - Emphasizes the importance of early intervention for long-term outcomes.
  - Funding primarily from federal sources (Child Care Development Block Grant), with minimal state appropriation.
- **Concerns**:
  - Questions about how "at risk" would be defined and the potential for over-identifying children.
  - Worries about introducing interventions without formal diagnoses.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed with an "ought to pass" (OTP) recommendation after the motion for interim study failed.

#### **2. Senate Bill 341: Mandatory Disclosure by School District Employees to Parents**
- **Purpose**: Requires school employees to respond to parents' written requests for information within 10 days with "complete and honest" responses, except in cases where disclosure would put the child at risk of physical harm, abuse, or neglect.
- **Support**:
  - Advocates argue for parental rights and transparency, claiming schools have withheld critical information (e.g., gender identity or social transitions).
  - Emphasizes the need to rebuild trust between parents and schools.
- **Opposition**:
  - Concerns about forced outing of LGBTQ+ students to unsupportive parents, increasing risks of harm, abuse, or suicide.
  - Fear of eroding trust between students and teachers, discouraging students from seeking confidential support.
  - Criticisms of vague language and the burden placed on educators to navigate complex family dynamics.
- **Key Testimonies**:
  - Parents and educators shared personal stories, with some emphasizing the importance of parental rights and others highlighting the need for student privacy and safety.
  - LGBTQ+ advocates warned of the discriminatory impact and potential economic consequences for New Hampshire.
- **Outcome**: The bill sparked significant debate, with the committee tasked with weighing parental rights against student safety and autonomy.

#### **3. Senate Bill 375: Transgender Athlete Participation in Sports**
- **Purpose**: Seeks to restrict transgender students from participating in sports aligned with their gender identity, citing concerns about fairness and safety for cisgender female athletes.
- **Support**:
  - Arguments for fairness, claiming biological males (transgender girls) have inherent physical advantages over cisgender girls.
  - Concerns about privacy and safety in locker rooms.
- **Opposition**:
  - Emphasis on inclusivity and mental health, with sports providing critical social and emotional support for transgender youth.
  - Testimonies cited studies showing no consistent evidence of unfair advantages and highlighted the importance of treating transgender girls as girls.
  - Personal stories from transgender athletes and their families underscored the positive impact of sports participation.
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Balancing inclusivity with fairness in competition.
  - The potential for increased mental health challenges among transgender youth if excluded from sports.
  - Legal risks, including violations of Title IX and potential loss of federal funding.
- **Outcome**: The debate highlighted the deeply personal and complex nature of the issue, with the committee tasked with reconciling inclusivity with concerns about fairness and safety.
