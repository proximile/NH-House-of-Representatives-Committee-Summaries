The New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened on May 10, 2024, to evaluate the state’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting featured extensive discussions and testimonies on a wide range of topics, including patient rights, government accountability, the efficacy of public health measures, and the personal and societal impacts of pandemic policies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and insights from the meeting:

### **Patient Rights, Medical Freedom, and Informed Consent**
- **Patient Autonomy**: Committee members and testifiers emphasized the importance of protecting patients’ rights to try alternative treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, and doctors’ rights to prescribe off-label medications. Concerns were raised about government overreach and the suppression of these treatments during the pandemic.
- **Informed Consent**: There was a strong push for better public education on medical treatments, including the risks and benefits of vaccines and medications. Testifiers called for transparency in healthcare decisions, such as offering baseline health checks before vaccinations and ensuring patients are fully informed.
- **Medical Transparency**: Critics highlighted the lack of open communication about alternative treatments and the influence of pharmaceutical companies on public health decisions. Testifiers advocated for greater transparency in funding and decision-making processes to reduce bias.

### **Critique of the State’s COVID-19 Response**
- **Government Overreach**: Concerns were raised about the governor’s executive orders, which some argued infringed on personal freedoms, such as restrictions on non-essential travel and business operations. Testifiers criticized the lack of adherence to pre-existing pandemic plans and the reliance on fear-based messaging.
- **Vaccine Mandates and Public Messaging**: Legislators expressed frustration with the promotion of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for children, citing concerns about myocarditis risks in young boys and the lack of scientific evidence to justify mandates. They criticized the use of taxpayer money for vaccine advertising without clear benefits for certain demographics.
- **Impact on Children**: Testifiers shared personal stories about the negative effects of pandemic policies on children, including the lack of educational and social services during school closures and the long-term psychological impact on children with special needs.

### **Economic, Social, and Personal Impacts**
- **Business Closures and Harassment**: The expiration of mask mandates in Nashua and the challenges faced by local businesses, including harassment and legal threats, were discussed. Specific businesses, such as Wab Bagel and Simply Delicious, were highlighted as examples of those impacted by mask mandates and subsequent closures.
- **Job Losses and Discrimination**: Several individuals shared personal stories about losing their jobs or facing discrimination for refusing to get vaccinated. Testifiers noted the difficulty of seeking legal recourse in New Hampshire, an “at-will” employment state, and called for justice and resources for those affected.
- **Mental Health Toll**: The mental health impact of the pandemic, particularly on children and families, was a recurring theme. Testifiers expressed concern about the long-term effects of pandemic policies on education, relationships, and societal well-being.

### **Proposed Reforms and Future Preparedness**
- **Legislative Proposals**: Ideas for future legislation included mandating baseline health checks before vaccinations, encouraging physicians to report vaccine injuries, and promoting public health initiatives that focus on immunity and wellness rather than solely on pharmaceutical interventions.
- **Public Forums and Transparency**: The committee discussed the need for public forums to allow for open communication and debate on health policies. Testifiers called for greater transparency in funding and decision-making processes to ensure public health policies are in the best interest of the community.
- **Federal Funds and State Decisions**: There was a focus on the distribution of federal COVID relief funds, the conditions attached to them, and the decision-making process at the state level. Committee members expressed interest in understanding the economic impact on small businesses and the state’s overall economic recovery.

### **Scientific Evidence and Ethical Considerations**
- **Effectiveness of Public Health Measures**: While some testifiers, like Representative Horan, defended the necessity of interventions like social distancing, masks, and vaccines, others questioned their effectiveness and called for more evidence-based decision-making. The committee emphasized the importance of scientific data and open dialogue in evaluating the state’s response.
- **FDA and DHHS Accountability**: Skepticism was expressed about the FDA’s handling of vaccine approvals and the DHHS’s promotion of vaccines. Testifiers highlighted concerns about the lack of professionalism and transparency in these agencies’ actions during the pandemic.
- **Physician Autonomy and Off-Label Treatments**: The committee discussed the need to protect physicians’ autonomy in prescribing off-label treatments and the importance of decentralized decision-making in healthcare.

### **Public Trust and Community Engagement**
- **Rebuilding Trust**: Representatives emphasized the need to rebuild public trust in government agencies and ensure better preparedness for future health crises. They suggested forums and community-based discussions to gather public input and improve decision-making.
- **Censorship and Silencing**: Multiple speakers expressed concerns about censorship and the silencing of dissenting voices during the pandemic. They highlighted instances where individuals were penalized for speaking out against mandates or for not complying with mask policies.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing public health measures with individual freedoms and the need for evidence-based, transparent decision-making in crisis management. Committee members and testifiers called for a reevaluation of the state’s pandemic response, emphasizing the importance of patient-centered healthcare, increased transparency, and better preparedness for future public health crises. The testimonies highlighted the deep divisions and significant personal and societal consequences stemming from the COVID-19 response, with a strong emphasis on accountability, justice, and support for those affected.
