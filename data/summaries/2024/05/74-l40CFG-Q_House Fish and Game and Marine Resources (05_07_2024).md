**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Fish and Game and Marine Resources (05/07/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a meeting focused on the Fish and Game and Marine Resources Department, addressing critical funding challenges, legislative proposals, and regulatory updates. The discussions emphasized the department's financial struggles, the need for sustainable funding solutions, and the importance of modernizing regulations to ensure public safety and equitable representation.

### **Funding Crisis and Proposed Solutions**
A central theme of the meeting was the Fish and Game Department's ongoing funding crisis. Representatives and officials, including Colonel Kevin Jordan (Chief of Law Enforcement, NH Fish and Game), highlighted the department's financial shortfalls, particularly in funding search and rescue operations, wildlife management, and other essential services. Currently, sportsmen and women bear a disproportionate share of the costs through hunting and fishing licenses, despite the fact that all residents benefit from the department's services, such as wildlife conservation and outdoor recreation.

The **Hike Safe Card**, a voluntary program that helps fund search and rescue operations, was discussed as a successful initiative but insufficient to address the department's broader financial needs. Representatives stressed the importance of securing **general funding from the state budget** as a sustainable solution, arguing that funding should be more broadly shared to reflect the universal benefits of the department's work.

### **Legislative Bills and Amendments**
Several bills were discussed, with a focus on funding, regulatory updates, and public safety:

1. **SB 542**: This bill proposes the creation of a committee to study funding and partnerships for the Fish and Game Department. Amendments were proposed to remove language about the commissionâ€™s makeup, as a separate bill is already addressing that issue. The bill underscores the urgency of addressing the department's financial sustainability, especially in light of recent state-mandated raises.

2. **SB 310**: Initially introduced to allow boat registration agents to charge fees and enable digital confirmation of Federal duck stamp purchases, the bill was amended to create a **non-resident non-commercial lobster landing license** for personal use. This amendment addresses issues for individuals who fish in other states but moor their boats in New Hampshire.

3. **SB 544**: A housekeeping bill aimed at updating language in statutes to reflect the transition from physical deer seals to electronic registration systems for hunters.

4. **FN 503**: This bill requires first-time applicants for fishing and hunting guide licenses to undergo a **criminal background check**, including fingerprinting, to ensure public safety. It addresses gaps in the current system, which only checks in-state criminal records.

### **Commission Representation**
There was debate about the composition of the Fish and Game Commission, with some arguing that representation should be tied to funding contributions. However, it was agreed that this issue should be addressed separately from the funding discussions to ensure equitable representation of all stakeholders, including non-hunters and wildlife watchers.

### **Future Steps and Urgency**
Representatives emphasized the urgency of addressing the funding crisis, calling for a **unified approach** to secure general funding before exploring other revenue-generating ideas. The meeting concluded with votes on amendments and bills, most of which passed unanimously or with strong support. Committee members were reminded to submit reports promptly to ensure continued progress.

### **Key Takeaways**
- The Fish and Game Department faces significant financial challenges, with search and rescue operations and wildlife management underfunded.
- The Hike Safe Card has been successful but is insufficient to meet the department's broader needs.
- General state funding is proposed as a sustainable solution to share costs more equitably among all residents.
- Legislative efforts focus on modernizing regulations, improving public safety, and addressing funding issues.
- Equitable representation in commissions and broader funding mechanisms are critical for the department's future sustainability.

The meeting highlighted the need for immediate action to ensure the Fish and Game Department can continue to provide essential services and support New Hampshire's outdoor recreation and wildlife conservation efforts.
