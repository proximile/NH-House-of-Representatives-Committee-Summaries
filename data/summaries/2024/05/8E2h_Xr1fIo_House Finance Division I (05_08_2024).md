**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (05/08/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I convened on May 8, 2024, to address a range of critical financial, policy, and infrastructure issues. The meeting centered on funding mechanisms for settlements, the fiscal impacts of various bills, and the urgent need for infrastructure improvements. Key discussions and outcomes are summarized below:

---

### **1. Youth Detention Center (YDC) Abuse Settlements and Funding**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of managing financial settlements for victims of abuse at the Youth Detention Center (YDC). Key points included:
- **Claims and Settlements**: Many claims have been paid significantly less than the amounts requested, with an average payout of approximately half the claimed amounts. A recent case awarded $38 million, but the judgment is expected to be capped at $475,000.
- **Funding Mechanisms**: Representatives debated whether to use the education trust fund or bonding to cover settlement costs. Some opposed borrowing for non-capital expenses, while others considered accessing the rainy day fund, which is restricted to specific circumstances like revenue shortfalls.
- **Senate Bill 591**: This bill proposes replenishing the YDC settlement fund with $60 million to address ongoing claims. It increases caps for egregious sexual abuse claims from $1.5 million to $2.5 million and allows for annual installment payments to manage financial exposure. The fund has already settled 163 claims totaling $82 million, with an estimated 1,500 claims expected.

### **2. Legislative Bills and Fiscal Impacts**
Several bills were discussed, with a focus on their fiscal implications and policy goals:
- **Senate Bill 337**: A "cleanup" bill addressing Medicaid, including lactation doula services. Passed unanimously.
- **Senate Bill 369**: Revises provisions related to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) after a previous veto. Passed unanimously.
- **Senate Bill 403**: Extends the Commission on Primary Care Workforce, allows Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) to administer medication, and establishes voluntary certification for community health workers. Funded through federal grants, with no state cost. Passed 6-3.
- **Senate Bill 407**: Establishes a ground ambulance cost reporting program to address financial strain and balance billing. Passed unanimously.
- **Senate Bill 487**: Makes the Personnel Appeals Board (PAB) an independent agency, increasing its costs significantly. Passed unanimously.
- **Senate Bill 134**: Creates a new disability benefit for group two members (police and fire) who are violently attacked on the job. The fiscal impact was revised down from initial estimates, and eligibility criteria were discussed.

### **3. Police and Fire Disability Benefits**
The meeting addressed the need for additional support for police and firefighters who have been medically retired due to severe injuries. Currently, 340 police officers and 100 firefighters are receiving disability benefits. The bill under consideration is rare but critical for the individuals it directly impacts.

### **4. Prison Replacement and Infrastructure Needs**
The Department of Corrections emphasized the urgent need to replace the aging New Hampshire State Prison for Men, built in the 1800s. The facility faces severe infrastructure issues, including electrical and plumbing systems beyond repair. Key points included:
- **Senate Bill 476**: Requests $40 million for initial planning and design of a new prison, with an estimated total cost of $500 million. The bill aims to address infrastructure issues proactively to avoid future litigation and improve conditions for staff and inmates.
- **Debt Considerations**: The State Treasurer noted that while the state can accommodate the $40 million request, the overall project would significantly increase debt service payments. A longer repayment period (e.g., 30 years) was suggested given the prison's long useful life.

### **5. Amendment Proposals and Interim Studies**
An amendment was proposed to encourage (but not mandate) investing 30% of public deposit investment pool funds in New Hampshire. While some supported it as a compromise, others argued for an interim study to allow stakeholder input, particularly from municipalities. A motion for interim study was made to facilitate further discussion.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of proactive financial planning, careful consideration of funding mechanisms, and addressing long-standing issues such as YDC settlements, infrastructure needs, and support for public servants. The committee passed several bills unanimously or with majority support, reflecting a collaborative effort to balance fiscal responsibility with the need to address critical state priorities. Discussions highlighted the challenges of managing large-scale liabilities while ensuring the state's financial stability and meeting the needs of its residents.
