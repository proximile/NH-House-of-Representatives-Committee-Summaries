**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (05/07/2024)**

The NH House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on May 7, 2024, focused on a wide range of legislative bills, primarily addressing healthcare, child welfare, and fiscal responsibility. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the session:

---

### **Healthcare Initiatives**
1. **Firefighter Cancer Screening Programs**:
   - **Senate Bill 352**: Proposed an early cancer detection pilot program for active and retired firefighters, emphasizing the high cancer risk due to exposure to carcinogens like PFAS and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The program would include multi-cancer early detection blood tests and chest CAT scans, with a $5 million fiscal note. Discussions highlighted the cost-effectiveness of early detection, with amendments proposed to reduce costs, such as removing skin cancer screenings.
   - **Firefighter Testimonies**: A firefighter’s personal story underscored the need for early detection, with data showing 75% of fallen firefighters die from occupational cancer. The program aims to save lives and reduce treatment costs by detecting cancers at earlier stages.

2. **Newborn Screening for CMV**:
   - **Senate Bill 355**: Focused on screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in newborns, a common cause of birth defects. The bill was amended to prioritize education and reporting over mandatory screenings, with a fiscal impact of $26,000 annually for additional staffing.

3. **Nursing Workforce Support**:
   - **Senate Bill 456**: Expanded the State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP) to include nurses working in underserved areas, with $300,000 allocated for FY25 to support 6-10 nurses. The bill aims to address nursing shortages in rural areas.

4. **Medication Access**:
   - **Senate Bill 567**: Directed the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to compile a report on the availability of mifepristone and misoprostol, medications used for abortion and other medical purposes. Concerns were raised about DHHS’ inability to fund the report and privacy issues related to data collection.

### **Child Welfare and Child Care**
1. **Child Placement and Custody**:
   - **Senate Bill 417**: Focused on improving placement protocols for children in state custody, prioritizing family-like settings and reducing trauma. The bill emphasized keeping siblings together, ensuring regular visits, and addressing the unique needs of children with developmental or medical conditions. Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact ($1.2 million in 2025, increasing to $1.8 million by 2027) and the need for clearer definitions, such as “fictive kin.”
   - **HB 1573 and SB 417 Overlap**: Discussions highlighted the potential duplication of efforts between SB 417 and HB 1573, which allocates $1 million for improving residential treatment and placement policies for youth.

2. **Child Care Workforce Support**:
   - **Senate Bill 404**: Expanded eligibility for child care scholarships to include more child care professionals, addressing workforce shortages. The bill was amended, resulting in a projected cost of over $2 million annually starting in 2025.
   - **Senate Bill 596**: Expanded the definition of disability or special needs under the Child Care Scholarship Program, allowing screening tools (rather than formal diagnoses) to identify children with developmental delays. The fiscal impact was estimated at $372,000 in FY2025 and $744,000 in subsequent years.

### **Fiscal Updates and Concerns**
1. **State Financial Status**:
   - Mr. Ripple provided a fiscal update, noting a $109.4 million positive variance compared to the budget assumption of $3.2 million. However, uncertainties such as revenue fluctuations and pending litigation were highlighted.

2. **Fiscal Impact of Bills**:
   - Many bills faced scrutiny over their fiscal notes, with concerns raised about the necessity of additional staff and funding. For example:
     - **Senate Bill 463**: Expanded access to court-appointed counsel for children in dependency proceedings, requiring additional attorneys and child protective service workers at an estimated cost of $1.2 million.
     - **Senate Bill 409**: Adjusted Medicaid reimbursement rates for ambulance services, with a fiscal note of $1 million annually but lacking an appropriation clause.

### **Amendments and Next Steps**
- **Amendments**: Several amendments were proposed to clarify language, reduce costs, and align bills with Senate recommendations. For example, amendments to SB 355 focused on education and opt-out options for CMV screenings, while amendments to SB 352 removed skin cancer screenings to reduce costs.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned to revisit key bills, including SB 352, SB 417, and SB 596, on Friday, May 10, 2024, for further discussion, amendments, and final votes.
