The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee convened on May 13, 2024, to address a wide range of legislative matters, focusing on amendments to key bills, funding allocations, and policy decisions. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance constitutional principles, financial considerations, and public welfare. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

---

### **Key Legislative Actions and Amendments**

1. **Senate Bill 553 (Public Deposit Investment Pool)**  
   - An amendment removed the requirement that funds must be invested or deposited within New Hampshire but emphasized that funds must still be insured or collateralized. Other investments, such as commercial paper or money market funds, were disallowed. The amendment passed 25-23.  
   - A second amendment encouraged the Public Deposit Investment Pool (PDIP) to invest up to 30% of its funds in New Hampshire, framed as aspirational rather than mandatory, with a sunset clause in December 2030. Concerns were raised about potential impacts on investment returns, but the amendment was supported.  
   - Some members suggested sending the bill to interim study for further review, but the committee opted to act on it immediately to promote local investment.

2. **Senate Bill 591 (Youth Development Center Settlement Fund)**  
   - The bill allocates an additional $60 million to the YDC settlement fund, bringing the total to $160 million. It sets limits on annual state payments and introduces an installment plan for victims with a 5% interest rate on unpaid funds.  
   - Representative Maguire proposed an amendment to eliminate the state’s ability to borrow money for the settlement, arguing that borrowing should be reserved for capital expenses, not operating expenses. The amendment passed 13-12.  
   - Representative Mooney proposed closing the filing window for claims in December 2024 instead of extending it to June 2025, but this amendment was defeated 8-17.

3. **Senate Bill 604 (Death Benefit for Security Officer)**  
   - The bill provides a death benefit for Bradley Hos, a security guard murdered on the job. Concerns were raised about its constitutionality, as it named a specific individual.  
   - Representative McGuire proposed amendments to generalize the benefit policy, but these were defeated. The committee ultimately voted 22-2 to pass the bill without amendments, sending it to the governor.  
   - Ongoing discussions emphasized the intent to honor Hos without complicating the legislation.
