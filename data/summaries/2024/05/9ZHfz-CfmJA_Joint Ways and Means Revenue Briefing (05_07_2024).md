**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Joint Ways and Means Revenue Briefing (05/07/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a Joint Ways and Means Revenue Briefing on May 7, 2024, to discuss the state’s fiscal outlook, revenue performance, and key policy challenges. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including revenue trends, tax policy, economic indicators, and budget concerns. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points discussed across all segments:

---

### **Revenue Overview and Economic Conditions**
- **Revenue Performance**: April revenues exceeded the plan by $38 million, but year-to-date general fund revenues were $68.84 million below plan, and the education trust fund was $26.4 million below plan. Combined, revenues were $142.4 million ahead of plan due to strong performance in certain areas.
- **Economic Indicators**: The state’s economy remains stable, with forecasted GDP growth of 2.5% in 2024 and 1.9% in 2025. Unemployment is expected to rise slightly, and inflation is projected to decrease.

---

### **Business Taxes**
- **Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**: Business taxes were 3% below plan year-to-date, with $38.3 million below the prior year, largely due to refunds from credit carryforward limitations. The credit carryforward cap, which refunds amounts exceeding 500% of liability, is set to decrease to 250% in two years.
- **Single Sales Factor**: The adoption of a single sales factor for apportioning business income across states has positively impacted revenues by approximately $150 million for tax year 2022, though future impacts remain uncertain due to sales volatility.
- **Diversity of Tax Base**: New Hampshire’s reliance on business taxes, particularly BPT, was discussed, with concerns about volatility mitigated by the diversity of industries (e.g., retail, hospitality, manufacturing, healthcare).

### **Other Tax Revenues**
- **Meals and Rentals Tax (M&R)**: The M&R tax is 5.3 million (2%) ahead of plan and 7 million (2.6%) ahead of the prior year, with 80% coming from meals, 17% from hotel rooms, and 3% from motor vehicle rentals. Inflation and weather conditions impacted revenues, and the tax supports the Education Trust Fund and municipal revenue transfers.
- **Tobacco Tax**: Tobacco tax revenues were down 10.1% from the plan and 11.2% from the prior year, driven by a shift from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes, which are taxed at a lower rate. A study committee was proposed to review e-cigarette taxation.
- **Interest and Dividends Tax (IND)**: The IND tax is performing ahead of plan due to increased real estate distributions and higher interest income. However, it is being phased out, with repeal set for 2025, raising concerns about future revenue.
- **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Revenue is below plan and prior year levels due to a housing inventory shortage, high building costs, and rising mortgage rates. Median home prices in New Hampshire have surpassed $500,000, and affordability is a major issue.
- **Communication Services Tax**: Revenue has remained stable, but there are concerns about declining liabilities due to reduced use of traditional communication services like VoIP and video conferencing.
- **Utility Property Tax**: The plan for fiscal year 2024 was revised upward by 99.8%, driven by increased valuations and credit carryovers. However, future property values may decline due to economic conditions.

### **Housing and Economic Development**
- **Affordable Housing**: Rising mortgage rates (e.g., 7%) are making homes unaffordable for many, even with median incomes. The Invest NH program has invested $110 million in housing development, but high costs of materials, labor, and interest rates continue to hinder affordable housing construction.
- **Housing Inventory**: A shortage of housing inventory and high building costs are limiting real estate transactions, with lawmakers suggesting increased funding for affordable housing to address the issue.

---

### **Education Trust Fund and Budget Challenges**
- **Education Trust Fund**: The fund is underperforming, with a $24 million shortfall, but strong lottery revenues are helping to offset this. It is projected to close with a balance of $197.4 million, though future funding adequacy is a concern due to rising costs and legislative appropriations.
- **Budget Projections**: Legislators expressed concerns about managing future budgets, particularly with the elimination of the IND tax in 2026, which could result in a $150–200 million revenue loss. Significant appropriations in active bills could further strain the budget.

---

### **Policy and Legislative Considerations**
- **Credit Carryforward**: The credit carryforward policy, which mandates refunds for taxpayers exceeding certain thresholds (e.g., 500% of their tax liability), was discussed. Legislators are considering delaying further reductions in these thresholds to avoid significant revenue impacts.
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Accurate revenue estimates and the state’s ability to weather economic fluctuations were emphasized, given the diverse economy and volatile tax base.
- **Legislative Process**: Bills with fiscal impacts are carefully analyzed, and fiscal notes are prepared to estimate their revenue effects. Legislators stressed the importance of understanding these impacts when making budgetary decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of managing state revenues and budgets amid rising costs, changing economic conditions, and legislative priorities. Key challenges include the volatility of business taxes, the shift from traditional tobacco products to e-cigarettes, housing affordability, and the impending repeal of the IND tax. Legislators emphasized the need for accurate data, diversified revenue strategies, and careful planning to ensure fiscal stability in the face of these challenges.
