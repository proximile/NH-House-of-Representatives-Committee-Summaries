The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Ways and Means Revenue Briefing on May 7, 2024, provided a detailed analysis of the state’s revenue streams, fiscal performance, and economic challenges. The discussions covered a wide range of topics, including revenue trends, budgetary amendments, housing affordability, and future fiscal projections. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **Revenue Overview and Trends**
1. **April and Year-to-Date Performance**: April revenues exceeded the plan by $38 million, but year-to-date revenues for the general fund and education trust fund were below plan by $68.84 million and $26.4 million, respectively. Combined revenues, however, were $142.4 million ahead of plan.
2. **Business Taxes**:
   - **Business Profits Tax (BPT)**: Accounts for 76.4% of business taxes, with refunds impacted by credit carry-forward caps. A 500% cap on credit carry-forwards was implemented for tax years 2022 and beyond, with plans to reduce it to 250% in two years.
   - **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**: Makes up 23.6% of business taxes. The shift to a single sales factor for apportioning business income has positively impacted revenues, contributing $15 million in FY2022.
3. **Meals and Rentals Tax**: Performing well, with year-to-date revenues 2% ahead of plan. Inflation has driven higher meal costs, but weather conditions and the solar eclipse may have affected hotel and rental revenues.
4. **Other Revenue Streams**:
   - **Property Taxes**: Variability based on location, with some areas experiencing flat rates despite differences in property values.
   - **Tobacco Tax**: Significant decline due to a shift from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes, which are taxed at a lower rate. A potential national ban on flavored tobacco products was also discussed.
   - **Interest and Dividends Tax**: Increased revenue due to higher interest rates, but the tax is set to be phased out by 2025, with projections indicating a gradual decline.
   - **Communication Services Tax**: Relatively stable, with shifts in usage patterns as more people return to offices.
   - **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: Below plan due to a shortage of housing inventory, high building costs, and lower affordability.
   - **Insurance Tax**: Performing better than expected, driven by increased premiums in property, casualty, and medical insurance.
   - **Liquor Commission**: Revenue trending downward, possibly due to shifting consumer preferences towards cannabis.
   - **Lottery Revenue**: Ahead of plan by $30 million, helping to offset shortfalls in the Education Trust Fund.

### **Housing Affordability and Real Estate Market**
1. **Housing Affordability Index**: The median income in New Hampshire is only 59% of what is needed to qualify for a median-priced home, which has crossed $500,000 for single-family homes and $410,000 for condos.
2. **Mortgage Rates**: The 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached 7.51% in April, significantly impacting affordability.
3. **Inventory Issues**: Low housing inventory is a major problem, with many potential buyers waiting due to high prices and mortgage rates. This has also affected the real estate transfer tax revenue.

### **Fiscal Projections and Challenges**
1. **Fiscal Year 2024**: Revised estimates show the state is $10.8 million ahead of plan, with a 0.5% increase.
2. **Fiscal Year 2025**: Projections indicate a potential $57.2 million shortfall, a 2.6% decrease from the plan.
3. **Education Trust Fund**: Expected to have a balance of $197.4 million by the end of FY2025, but there has been a $40 million variance due to increased expenditures.
4. **General Fund**: Projected surplus is $112.6 million, but this could be affected by legislative appropriations.
5. **Legislative Appropriations**: Concerns were raised about the potential impact of $138 million in General Fund appropriations and $82.9 million in Education Trust Fund appropriations currently under consideration.
6. **Interest and Dividends Tax Elimination**: The phase-out of this tax by 2026 is expected to create a significant revenue shortfall, necessitating creative fiscal solutions.

### **Budgetary Amendments and Decision-Making**
1. **Credit Carry-Forward Caps**: A proposal to delay the implementation of mandatory refunds related to the Business Profits Tax credit carry-forward to avoid further revenue impacts.
2. **Cautious Decision-Making**: The speaker emphasized the need for flexibility and cautious decision-making, suggesting pushing certain budgetary decisions out by two budget cycles (four years) to assess revenue impacts fully.

### **Economic Indicators and Taxpayer Behavior**
1. **Economic Indicators**: The discussion included GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation forecasts, with expectations of stable revenues in FY2025. The state’s diverse tax base and industries help mitigate economic volatility.
2. **Taxpayer Behavior**: Businesses are proactively managing their tax liabilities, and the state is refining its methods for allocating payments between BPT and BET to improve accuracy.

### **Future Fiscal Challenges**
1. **2026 and Beyond**: The state faces significant fiscal challenges, including potential revenue shortfalls and the need for careful budget management. The new governor and legislature will need to make tough decisions to balance the budget.
2. **Revenue Monitoring**: The committee highlighted the importance of monitoring the diversity of revenue sources and the potential long-term impact of declining revenues in certain areas.
