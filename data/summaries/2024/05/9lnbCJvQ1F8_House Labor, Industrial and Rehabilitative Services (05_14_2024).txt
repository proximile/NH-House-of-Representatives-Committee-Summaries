The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on May 14, 2024, to address a range of labor-related issues, focusing on unemployment benefits, employment status, and fiscal responsibility. The meeting was marked by collaborative discussions, bipartisan agreement on key issues, and thoughtful deliberation on proposed amendments and bills. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **Key Discussions and Actions**

#### **Amendments and Fiscal Concerns**
1. **Opposition to an Amendment**: The Hampshire Association of Counties opposed a specific amendment, warning it could strain smaller counties’ budgets and potentially lead to increased county taxes.  
2. **Unemployment Benefit Table Update**: An amendment to update the unemployment benefit table, which has remained unchanged since 2007, was proposed. While the amendment passed in committee, it is expected to fail on the full House floor due to fiscal concerns.  

#### **Unemployment Benefits and Economic Context**
- **Proposed Increase in Benefits**: Representative Mark McKenzie introduced an amendment to raise the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $427 to $672, adding new tiers to ensure consistent wage replacement rates across income levels. This proposal aims to address disparities, particularly for higher earners.  
- **Economic Justification**: McKenzie highlighted that New Hampshire’s unemployment trust fund is robust, with over $400 million, and the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates and employer tax rates in the country. He argued that now is an opportune time to modernize the system to ensure fairness for unemployed workers.  
- **Concerns from Business and Industry**: Dave Juvet of the Business and Industry Association (BIA) expressed concerns that the amendment could deplete the trust fund during an economic downturn, potentially leading to higher employer taxes.  
- **Public Sector Impact**: Municipal, state, and nonprofit employers, who reimburse the fund directly when their employees claim benefits, could face increased costs if the amendment passes.  
- **Deputy Commissioner’s Analysis**: Richard Lers, Deputy Commissioner of New Hampshire Employment Security, provided a detailed analysis, noting that the amendment could reduce the trust fund balance by $40 million over three years but would not deplete it, even in a severe recession.  

#### **Legislative Bills**
- **Senate Bill 517**: The committee debated a bill addressing the employment status of resident advisors (RAs) in university residence halls. A subcommittee recommended that the bill be deemed “inexpedient to legislate” (ITL), arguing that the Department of Labor’s rule changes had already resolved the issue. The motion to ITL the bill passed.  
- **Senate Bill 330**: The committee supported a bill preventing the denial of unemployment benefits for individuals seeking work-from-home opportunities. The bill, which aligns with modern employment trends, was passed with an amendment.  

#### **Committee Dynamics and Acknowledgments**
- The committee emphasized its collaborative spirit, with bipartisan agreement on several issues. Members also humorously discussed organizing a communal lunch to celebrate their work.  
- The contributions of state employees and staff were acknowledged for their support in facilitating the committee’s efforts.
