**Summary of NH House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (April 30, 2024)**

On April 30, 2024, the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened to discuss and amend several key bills, focusing on medical technician oversight, professional licensing, and administrative reforms. The meeting highlighted the legislative process of addressing inefficiencies, ensuring alignment between House and Senate proposals, and refining statutory language for clarity and effectiveness. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 1410**:  
   - This bill, which passed the House, proposes changes to the registration and oversight of medical technicians.  
   - Originally, a board was established to handle rule-making and adjudication for medical technicians, but it has been non-functional due to a lack of quorum.  
   - The Senate plans to amend the bill to eliminate the board structure and instead grant the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) direct authority over registration, complaints, and rule-making.  

2. **Senate Bill 318**:  
   - Initially focused on a social work compact, SB 318 was amended to address broader issues, including the merging of advisory boards and the regulation of medical technicians.  
   - The committee discussed removing sections 24 and 25 from the amendment, which would have repealed medical technician registration, to avoid conflicting with the Senate’s plans for HB 1410.  
   - The committee also addressed technical language omissions and inconsistencies in the amendment, ensuring alignment with the original legislative intent.  

3. **Senate Bill 488**:  
   - This bill addresses two main issues:  
     - **Continuing Medical Education (CME) Requirements for Physician Assistants (PAs)**: It grants the Board of Medicine authority to define CME requirements for PAs, as they are no longer required to maintain certification from the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA).  
     - **Barbering Exception for PAs**: It exempts PAs from needing a barbering license when performing medical procedures involving hair cutting, such as treating scalp wounds.  
   - The committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill for passage, emphasizing the need for clear statutory language to avoid unintended legal requirements.  

4. **Senate Bill 600**:  
   - This bill proposes expanding the Pharmacy Board from five to seven members by adding an additional pharmacist and a pharmacy technician.  
   - The committee discussed the importance of including pharmacy technicians on the board, given their expanding role in pharmacies.  
   - Concerns were raised about the eligibility pool for pharmacy technicians (requiring 10 years of licensure and 5 years of in-state practice), but it was noted that 42 technicians meet these criteria.  
   - The committee amended the bill to include both licensed and certified pharmacy technicians and set an effective date of January 1, 2025, before recommending it for passage.  

### **Process and Next Steps**
- The subcommittee chair proposed drafting revised amendments for SB 318 and HB 440, incorporating fixes for technical issues identified by OPLC.  
- Members were reminded to provide feedback directly to the chair rather than discussing amendments via email to avoid violating procedural rules.  
- The goal was to finalize amendments by the next session (Wednesday) and proceed with votes.  

### **Additional Discussion**
- **House Bill 440** was briefly mentioned, with plans to draft and review an amendment addressing technical issues identified by OPLC.  

### **Conclusion**
The committee worked through detailed statutory language, addressed potential conflicts between House and Senate proposals, and made amendments to ensure the clarity and effectiveness of the bills. The meeting concluded with motions to recommend the bills for passage, pending final amendments. The discussions underscored the committee’s focus on streamlining professional oversight, addressing inefficiencies, and ensuring alignment across legislative proposals.
