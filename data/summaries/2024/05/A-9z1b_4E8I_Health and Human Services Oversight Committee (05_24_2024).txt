The meeting emphasized collaboration, strategic planning, and addressing critical health challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and initiatives covered across the three segments:

---

### **1. Public Health Coordination and Messaging**
- **Unified Public Health Efforts**: The committee focused on streamlining public health messaging within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to avoid duplication and ensure alignment across departments. Efforts included consolidating materials and integrating initiatives like brain health, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia into broader public health campaigns.
- **Concerns About Fragmentation**: Members highlighted the need for a department-wide approach to public health issues, such as Lyme disease, to prevent isolated initiatives and silos.
- **Pharmacy Community Engagement**: Pharmacies were identified as key touchpoints for patient interaction, with suggestions to involve them more actively in awareness campaigns, such as those for bone health and Alzheimer’s.
- **Leadership Role**: Associate Commissioners were emphasized as critical to ensuring alignment and coordination across DHHS programs.

### **2. Mission Zero and Emergency Department (ED) Boarding**
- **Progress on ED Boarding**: **Mission Zero**, an initiative to eliminate ED boarding, has reduced waiting times by 50%. A **Care Traffic Control** system was implemented to manage patient flow and bed availability across hospitals.
- **Capacity Expansion**: New Hampshire Hospital added 12 beds, increasing capacity to 170, with plans to add 14 more by year-end.
- **Landlord Incentive Program**: This program aims to transition patients from hospitals to supported housing, with a goal of moving 25 patients by year-end.
- **Court Extension**: The department received an extension until December 31, 2024, to meet the 6-hour ED boarding deadline.

### **3. Developmental Disabilities (DD) and Acquired Brain Disorder (ABD) Waiver Report**
- **Financial Waitlist**: The waitlist for DD and ABD services remains at zero, with all eligible individuals funded.
- **IT System Updates**: Progress is being made on IT systems to track service start dates and delays, with updates expected by June 28, 2024.
- **Workforce Shortages**: Workforce grants ($16 million awarded, with an additional $6.5 million planned) aim to recruit and retain staff. A pilot program is testing direct access to service authorization data for providers.

### **4. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)**
- **Increased Usage**: PDMP usage has risen due to **Gateway integration**, which allows access within electronic health records. Less than 30% of eligible facilities are currently connected.
- **Opioid Trends**: Opioid prescriptions have decreased across all age groups, while sedatives and stimulants have risen. The CDC’s change in morphine milligram equivalent calculations caused a temporary data spike.
- **Interstate Data Sharing**: Agreements allow prescribers and pharmacists in other states to access New Hampshire’s PDMP data, ensuring continuity of care for residents who spend time in other states.
- **Data Privacy**: Discussions emphasized compliance with state laws and privacy concerns, particularly regarding data storage and accessibility.

### **5. Suicide Prevention**
- **2022 Suicide Prevention Report**: In 2021, 229 individuals died by suicide in New Hampshire, making it the second leading cause of death for ages 15-34. The report stressed collaboration between healthcare providers, educators, policymakers, and community leaders.
- **Prevention Strategies**: Efforts include increasing access to mental health services, promoting the 988 crisis hotline, and addressing barriers like affordability and accessibility of care. Focus areas include youth, LGBTQ+ individuals, and rural populations.
- **Gender and Geographic Disparities**: Men are more likely to die by suicide due to the use of more lethal means, while women are more likely to attempt suicide. Rural areas face higher suicide rates due to workforce shortages, lack of access to healthcare, and higher firearm ownership.

---

### **6. Social Media and Youth Mental Health**
- **Impact of Social Media**: The committee discussed the dual role of social media in connecting individuals and increasing feelings of isolation and bullying. Efforts to educate youth on responsible social media use and provide resources like the 988 hotline were emphasized.
