**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (May 7, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Consumer Affairs convened on May 7, 2024, to discuss and amend several bills related to healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and insurance. The meeting was marked by extensive debates, amendments, and decisions aimed at refining legislation to address high-cost drugs, insurance coverage, and patient affordability. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

**Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Legislation**  
1. **High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs)**:  
   The committee addressed the unique nature of HDHPs, which require patients to meet their deductible before benefits are activated. Due to IRS regulations, HDHPs were exempt from certain provisions. An amendment allowed patients enrolled in HDHPs to accept financial assistance from independent charity patient assistance programs without tax complications, particularly benefiting those with high-cost medications.

2. **Drug Tiering and Exclusivity**:  
   The committee debated drug tiering, focusing on Tier 5 drugs, which are often high-cost medications. Concerns were raised about patented drugs or those with exclusivity rights that, while not classified as Tier 5, remain expensive. The amendment sought to address these unique, high-cost drugs lacking generic or biosimilar alternatives.

3. **Pharmaceutical Rebates (Bill 555)**:  
   The renewal of legislation mandating pharmaceutical rebates sparked controversy. The committee removed the mandate requiring all companies to participate, opting for market flexibility. The insurance department agreed to issue a bulletin to guide implementation.

4. **Clarifications and Amendments**:  
   Representatives proposed language clarifications, such as specifying "lower cost" alternatives, but these were ultimately deemed unnecessary and withdrawn. Several motions related to amendments passed with unanimous or near-unanimous support.

**Insurance Legislation**  
1. **Bill 173**:  
   An insurance department request that passed without issues. The motion was made by Representative Burrows and seconded by Representative Kry.

2. **Pelvic Floor Therapy**:  
   The committee decided to conduct an interim study on insurance coverage for pelvic floor therapy, as the department had already generated a report. The motion was made by Representative Hunt and seconded by Representative Burrows.

3. **Autism Spectrum Disorder and Down Syndrome**:  
   The bill was recommended for an interim study due to identified issues, including the repeal of an incorrect paragraph and concerns about the therapy's acceptance by Medicare and Medicaid. The motion was made by Representative Hunt and seconded by Representative Burrows.

4. **Blood Testing for Elevated Lead Levels**:  
   The bill passed without discussion. The motion was made by Representative Burrows and seconded by Representative Hunt.

5. **Payment or Reimbursement Provisions for Nurse Practitioners**:  
   The committee extensively debated a bill prohibiting health carrier firms from establishing payment or reimbursement provisions solely based on participating providers. Concerns about unintended consequences and impacts on physician salaries were raised. An amendment clarified that the bill only applies to nurse practitioners, and the bill was ultimately approved. The motion was made by Representative Spear and seconded by Representative Hunt.

6. **Infertility Treatment**:  
   The committee decided to conduct an interim study on insurance coverage for infertility treatment. Concerns included the definition of infertility and the potential for future, more expensive bills. The motion was made by Representative Hunt and seconded by Representative Burrows.

7. **Prior Authorizations for Healthcare**:  
   The bill passed without discussion. The motion was made by Representative M and seconded by Representative Hunt.

8. **Co-pay Accumulators**:  
   An amendment was proposed to narrow the scope of the bill, allowing discounts to count towards out-of-pocket maximums only when no alternative treatment options are available. Michelle Heat from the New Hampshire Insurance Department explained the amendment.

**Conclusion**  
The meeting concluded with the committee adjourning and planning to reconvene to address further amendments and bills. The discussions reflected a focus on refining healthcare and pharmaceutical legislation to address high-cost drugs, HDHPs, and pharmaceutical rebates, while ensuring clarity and flexibility in implementation. Additionally, the committee made significant progress on various insurance-related bills, addressing coverage for pelvic floor therapy, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, elevated lead levels, infertility treatment, and prior authorizations.
