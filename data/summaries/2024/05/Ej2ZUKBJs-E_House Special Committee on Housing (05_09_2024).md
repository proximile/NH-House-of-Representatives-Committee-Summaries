The New Hampshire House Special Committee on Housing convened on May 9, 2024, to discuss several bills and amendments related to housing issues. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **HB 1168**: The committee discussed a Senate amendment to HB 1168, which addresses the housing crisis for people with disabilities. The Senate proposed extending the reporting deadlines for the study committee, with an interim report due by November 1, 2024, and a final report by November 1, 2025. The committee agreed to concur with the Senateâ€™s amendments.

2. **SB 408**: The committee moved to concur with SB 408, which also focuses on studying the impact of the housing crisis on people with disabilities. The bill was deemed similar to HB 1168, with minor adjustments from the Senate.

3. **SP 527**: The committee debated SP 527, which pertains to student housing. Representative Reed introduced Amendment 1752, which adds language from a non-germane amendment to the bill rather than replacing it. The amendment aims to address occupancy restrictions and prevent discrimination against students and renters. After extensive discussion, the amendment passed with an 8-2 vote. The bill, as amended, was then approved with an 8-2 vote.

4. **Discussion on Discrimination and Zoning**: The committee discussed the discriminatory nature of some local ordinances that restrict the number of unrelated individuals living together, particularly targeting students. Representatives argued that such ordinances unfairly discriminate against students and renters, and that behavioral issues should be addressed through noise and trash ordinances rather than occupancy restrictions.

5. **Commercial Zoning and Student Housing**: There was a brief discussion on how some student housing is zoned as commercial, which may provide additional leverage for addressing behavioral issues through commercial property regulations.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to move the bills forward, with SP 527 being placed on the regular calendar rather than the consent calendar to avoid being scheduled at the end of the legislative day.

Overall, the meeting focused on addressing housing challenges for vulnerable populations, preventing discriminatory practices in housing regulations, and ensuring that student housing issues are thoroughly studied and addressed.
