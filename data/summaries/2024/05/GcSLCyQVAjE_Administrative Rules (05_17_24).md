**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (05/17/24)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on May 17, 2024, to address a range of administrative and emergency rule changes across various departments. The meeting highlighted concerns about rule expirations, due process, and the alignment of rules with current statutes and public needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Snow Boss Name Change**
- A representative expressed disappointment over the Department's decision to rename "Snow Boss" to "Green Snow Pro Coordinator," arguing that "Snow Boss" had a positive connotation and should be reinstated. Despite this sentiment, the motion to approve the rule change passed without objection.

### **Nursing Emergency Rule**
- Concerns were raised about an emergency rule from the Board of Nursing regarding Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs). The rule, based on outdated 2022 regulations, inadvertently prevented experienced military medical personnel and EMTs from using their experience to fulfill LNA licensing requirements. The committee moved to request the Board of Nursing to repeal the rule and adopt a corrected version.

### **Commercial Driver Licensing Rules**
- The Department of Safety presented an emergency rule for commercial driver licensing, as the regular rules had expired in mid-February. The discussion highlighted a recurring issue of rule expirations and interim rule adoptions. The Department acknowledged the problem and outlined steps to improve oversight, including monthly reviews of rule sets with the Department of Safety legal unit.

### **General Administrative Oversight**
- The committee expressed frustration over lapses in keeping rules updated and emphasized the importance of using current versions of rules and statutes. The meeting concluded with a motion to cancel the committee's continued meeting, which passed without objection.

### **First Responders Memorial Ceremony**
- The meeting began with a reminder about the First Responders Memorial ceremony, with the chair hoping to finish the session in time to attend.

### **Attendance and Quorum**

### **Board of Education Rules (Rule 511)**
- The primary discussion focused on **Rule 511**, which governs investigations and disciplinary proceedings related to the **Educator Code of Conduct**. Key points included:
  - **Conditional Approval**: The rule was under conditional approval, with concerns raised by the **NEA (National Education Association)** about due process and notification requirements for educators under investigation.
  - **Investigation Process**: The NEA argued that the Department of Education (DOE) should conduct its own investigations rather than relying on school district reports, which are often focused on employment policies rather than the Code of Conduct.
  - **Summary Statements**: The NEA expressed concerns that summary statements provided to educators were too vague and did not meet due process standards.
  - **Departmentâ€™s Response**: The DOE defended its reliance on school district reports, citing practicality and the need to avoid subjecting children to multiple interviews. They emphasized that they review and analyze district reports before applying them to the Code of Conduct.

### **Debate on Investigation Process**
- Representatives debated whether the DOE should conduct its own investigations or rely on school district reports. Concerns were raised about consistency, due process, and the potential for errors when relying on external reports.
- The DOE clarified that while they often rely on school district reports, they do not simply "rubber stamp" them and will request additional information if necessary.
