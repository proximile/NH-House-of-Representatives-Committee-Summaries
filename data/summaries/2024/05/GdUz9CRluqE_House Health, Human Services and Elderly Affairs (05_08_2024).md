The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee meeting on May 8, 2024, covered a wide range of legislative issues, including the regulation of hemp-derived THC products, pharmacy licensing, vaccine programs, abortion statistics, therapeutic cannabis, and mental health services. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Hemp-Derived THC Products and Cannabis Regulation**
The committee debated **Amendment 17398**, which proposed a regulatory framework for hemp-derived THC products, such as Delta-8 and Delta-9 THC, instead of an outright ban. The amendment aimed to allow the sale of these products through tobacco outlets while enforcing labeling and testing requirements. However, concerns were raised about synthetic THC products ("Frankenweed"), which are lab-created and pose unknown health risks. Critics argued that the amendment contradicted **HB 1633**, which seeks to legalize and regulate cannabis with stricter standards. Some representatives advocated for prioritizing natural cannabis over synthetic THC, emphasizing public health and safety. The discussion also highlighted challenges in regulating out-of-state products and the potential impact on New Hampshire’s cannabis industry. The debate underscored a divide between those supporting stricter regulation and those favoring a more permissive approach with oversight.

### **Pharmacy Licensing and Clinic-Based Pharmacies**
The committee discussed **Amendment 2024-H 1725H** to **Senate Bill 458**, which aimed to clarify pharmacy licensing regulations for "mini pharmacies" within clinics, such as oncology practices. The amendment proposed removing the term "retail" from the statute to allow clinics to dispense medications without being open to the general public. While the amendment received support for streamlining patient care, concerns were raised about potential overregulation and ethical issues related to physician dispensing. Testimony from stakeholders, including oncologists and pharmacy representatives, emphasized the need for legislative clarity and oversight by the Board of Pharmacy.

### **Vaccine Programs and Healthcare Legislation**
The committee addressed several bills related to vaccines and healthcare, including:
- **Senate Bill 419**: An amendment allowing home cultivation of therapeutic cannabis passed overwhelmingly (19-1), though broader concerns about the bill’s reception in the Senate were noted.
- **Senate Bill 554**: This bill, allowing the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to share information for Medicaid certification, passed unanimously.
- **Senate Bill 559**: A contentious amendment to expand the state’s universal vaccine program, particularly for the RSV vaccine, passed 16-4, but the bill itself narrowly passed 11-10. Debate centered on the state’s role in vaccine procurement, liability concerns, and the need to rebuild public trust in vaccines. A minority report was filed to reflect dissenting views.

### **Abortion Statistics and Privacy Protections**
The committee discussed an amendment to gather abortion statistics while protecting patient privacy. The amendment included provisions to prevent data misuse and allow women to opt out of data collection. Concerns were raised about potential misuse of data, particularly regarding state residency and gestational periods. While the amendment passed 15-5, the underlying bill failed 7-13, leading to a motion to deem it "inexpedient to legislate," which passed 13-7.

### **Medical Record Requests and Fee Caps**
The committee debated **Amendment 2024-1739H** to **Senate Bill 505**, which aimed to cap fees for medical record requests at $100 for electronic copies and $150 for paper copies. Concerns were raised about the impact on third-party providers and the sustainability of such caps. Ultimately, the amendment was withdrawn, and the committee recommended an interim study to further explore the issue. Similar discussions occurred around **Senate Bill 400**, which also focused on medical record requests.

### **Mental Health Services and Pediatric Care**
The committee addressed:
- **Senate Bill 411**: This bill proposed establishing a committee to study access to mental health services for children. While some members supported the study, others argued it was redundant. The bill passed with a split vote, indicating a minority report would be filed.
- **Senate Bill 412**: The bill temporarily lifted a moratorium on pediatric Intermediate Care Facility beds to address a shortage. It passed almost unanimously, with members acknowledging it as a short-term solution to a larger systemic issue.

### **Overall Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted several recurring themes:
1. **Regulation and Oversight**: Debates over the regulation of hemp-derived THC products, pharmacy licensing, and vaccine programs emphasized the balance between public health, safety, and industry interests.
2. **Privacy and Data Collection**: Discussions on abortion statistics and medical record requests underscored the importance of protecting patient privacy while ensuring transparency.
3. **Patient Access**: Proposals related to therapeutic cannabis, vaccine programs, and mental health services focused on improving patient access while addressing safety and ethical concerns.
4. **Legislative Strategy**: Frustration was expressed over the Senate’s practice of significantly altering bills, leading to strategic amendments in the House.

The committee’s decisions reflected a cautious approach to complex issues, with interim studies frequently proposed to further explore contentious topics. The meeting also highlighted significant divisions among members on key issues, particularly vaccines and cannabis regulation, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving consensus on healthcare and public health policies.
