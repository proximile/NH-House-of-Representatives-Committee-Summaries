The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on May 14, 2024, addressed a wide range of critical issues, including child welfare, healthcare access, legal representation, education, and public safety. The discussions and decisions reflected a balance between immediate action and cautious planning, with debates often centering on fiscal responsibility, program effectiveness, and implementation strategies. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

### **Child Welfare and Legal Representation**
1. **Child Placement and Welfare**:
   - Representative Hule proposed an amendment to prioritize placing children in safe, in-state family environments rather than facilities or out-of-state placements. The amendment also addressed parental fitness and firearm safety in homes. Concerns were raised about the removal of educational needs and the potential risks of not addressing unique circumstances like domestic violence.

2. **Court-Appointed Counsel for Children**:
   - **Senate Bill 463** aimed to expand access to court-appointed lawyers for children in state custody. The discussion focused on a phased implementation to ensure legal representation for children in out-of-state placements. Technical corrections were made, and the amendment was adopted with adjustments.

### **Healthcare and Workforce Development**
1. **Ambulance Services Reimbursement**:
   - **Senate Bill 409** provided reimbursement for ambulance services that do not result in patient transport, addressing financial stress on providers and ensuring coverage for essential services. The amendment was adopted unanimously.

2. **Nursing Workforce Loan Repayment**:
   - **Senate Bill 456** offered loan repayment for nurses working in underserved areas. While some representatives supported the bill to address workforce shortages, others questioned its economic impact and effectiveness. The bill passed with a 15-10 vote.

3. **Reproductive Healthcare Access**:
   - **Senate Bill 567** aimed to study increased access to mifepristone and misoprostol, medications used in medical abortions. Supporters emphasized the importance of reproductive healthcare, while opponents argued the bill was premature due to ongoing federal legal challenges. The bill was deemed "inexpedient to legislate" with a 13-12 vote.

### **Child Care and Early Education**
1. **Child Care Scholarship Expansion**:
   - **Senate Bill 596** sought to expand the definition of disability or special needs under the child care scholarship program to include children at risk for future special needs. An amendment proposed a study committee to define eligibility criteria and integrate services with Medicaid and public schools. The bill passed with a 13-12 vote.

2. **Summer EBT Program**:
   - **Senate Bill 499** included **Amendment 1917** to implement a Summer EBT program, providing $120 per child for summer meals. **Amendment 1957** proposed delaying the program and allocating $50,000 for a study, citing concerns about costs and redundancy with existing programs like SNAP. The latter amendment passed (13-12), delaying the Summer EBT program.

### **Education and Workforce Retention**
1. **Rural Teacher Retention Program**:
   - **Senate Bill 217** aimed to provide retention payments for rural and underserved area educators. The motion for "ought to pass" failed 12-13, and the bill was deemed "inexpedient to legislate" in a 13-12 vote.

2. **Culinary Arts Ventilation Funding**:
   - **Senate Bill 396** sought funding for ventilation systems in culinary arts teaching kits. An amendment shifted funding from ARPA to the Education Trust Fund, and the motion for "ought to pass" passed 21-4.
