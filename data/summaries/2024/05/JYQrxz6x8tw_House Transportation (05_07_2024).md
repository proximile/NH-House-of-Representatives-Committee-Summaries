**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (05/07/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on May 7, 2024, to address several transportation and motor vehicle-related bills. The meeting began with a procedural discussion about submitting a report for the calendar, where a member requested the report be delivered either as a hard copy or electronically to their legislative account by the end of the day. The tone of this segment was casual and cooperative, with acknowledgments and thanks exchanged before the committee moved on to substantive discussions.

The committee reviewed and made decisions on the following key bills:

1. **Senate Bill 429**: The committee unanimously recommended passage of this bill, which clarifies that Executive Council members can retain their traditional blue license plates, addressing an issue where the color was not explicitly defined in statute.

2. **Senate Bill 465**: This bill, which requires drivers to yield and give wide berth to stopped or standing vehicles on highways, sparked debate over enforceability and potential safety concerns. The initial motion to recommend passage resulted in a tie (10-10), but the committee later voted unanimously to send the bill to interim study for further review.

3. **Senate Bill 467**: The committee unanimously recommended passage of a bill authorizing the Injury Prevention Center to issue motor vehicle decal plates to raise funds for their cause.

4. **Senate Bill 581**: Discussion on this bill, related to temporary driver’s licenses and non-driver ID cards, was recessed due to questions about the use of temporary licenses for voting purposes. The committee agreed to revisit the bill after gathering additional information from the Secretary of State’s office.

5. **Senate Bill 469**: The committee recommended passage (16-4) of a bill allowing private entities leasing state-owned park-and-ride facilities to manage surveillance systems. Supporters argued it would enhance safety and efficiency, while opponents raised privacy concerns and questioned the role of private entities in managing surveillance.

6. **Senate Bill 582**: The committee unanimously recommended passage of a bill allowing individuals to provide an alternate address to the Department of Motor Vehicles, a measure particularly beneficial for "snowbirds" who spend part of the year out of state.

7. **Senate Bill 598**: The committee unanimously recommended passage of a bill requiring lead vehicles in funeral processions to obey yield signs, clarifying existing laws to ensure safety and consistency.

The committee adjourned with plans to revisit several bills, including SB 510, 581, 501, and 358, in the following week’s session. The meeting concluded with a sense of agreement and readiness to proceed on both procedural and substantive matters.
