The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on May 15, 2024, to discuss several bills and amendments. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Opening and Pledge of Allegiance**: The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and an introduction of the agenda, which included executive sessions and Senate bills with amendments.

2. **Senate Bill 458**: The committee voted unanimously (20-0) to recommend an interim study for this bill. Representative Merchant motioned for the interim study, citing discussions with the Pharmacy Board and the OPLC director, who confirmed that the board has the authority to issue permits, rendering the bill unnecessary. However, concerns were raised about potential delays in rulemaking, prompting the recommendation for further study.

3. **Senate Bill SP505**: The committee debated this bill, which deals with synthetic derivatives of hemp. Representative Weber moved to pass the bill, emphasizing the need to maintain the prohibition on these substances to give law enforcement authority. The motion passed 15-5, with some members expressing concerns about the urgency and the need for a three-year sunset clause. A straw poll indicated mixed support for a three-year sunset amendment, which may be introduced on the floor.

4. **House Bill 1609**: The committee unanimously agreed to concur with the Senate’s amendment to this bill, which changes the specified direct primary care provider from the New England Direct Primary Care Alliance to Direct Primary Care Frontier. This change ensures that nurse practitioners are included in the primary care model.

5. **Other Bills and Interim Studies**: The committee discussed several other bills, including House Bill 1568 and Senate Bill 409, which are related to Medicaid reimbursement for non-transport emergency medical service calls. Concerns were raised about conflicting language between the bills, and the committee plans to address this when the bills come up for final consideration.

6. **Closing Remarks**: Committee members expressed appreciation for the collaborative and respectful nature of the discussions. Representative Weber thanked the chair for his leadership, and the chair acknowledged the hard work of the committee members, particularly Representative Weber and Representative Leon, for their contributions.

7. **Future Meetings**: The committee plans to meet again in early October to finalize interim study reports and discuss further legislative actions.

Overall, the meeting focused on careful consideration of various health-related bills, with an emphasis on collaboration and thorough analysis.
