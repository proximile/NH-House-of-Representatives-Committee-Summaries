The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on May 1, 2024, to discuss a range of bills addressing critical health, human services, and elderly affairs issues. The meeting highlighted significant debates on privacy, healthcare access, mental health services, and regulatory improvements. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Senate Bill 461: Abortion Data Collection and Reporting**
- **Overview**: The bill, amended in the Senate, mandates the collection and reporting of detailed abortion-related data to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
- **Privacy Concerns**: Strong opposition was voiced over potential privacy violations, as the bill could expose personally identifiable information of patients and providers. Advocates, including the ACLU, warned of risks in a post-Roe environment where abortion data has been weaponized in other states.
- **Purpose and Necessity**: Critics questioned the bill’s necessity, noting the CDC does not request such data and that voluntary reporting by providers (e.g., to the Guttmacher Institute) already exists. Proponents argued the data is essential for public health analysis.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included aggregating data, prohibiting personally identifiable information, and granting DHHS rule-making authority to ensure HIPAA compliance.
- **Outcome**: The committee emphasized the need for robust privacy protections and continued discussions on balancing data collection with patient safety.

#### **2. Senate Bill 411: Children’s Mental Health Services**
- **Overview**: The bill creates a study committee to examine gaps in emergency mental health services for individuals aged 20 and younger, particularly focusing on insurance coverage.
- **Testimony**: Advocates shared personal stories of inadequate access to mental health care, long wait times, and disparities between Medicaid and private insurance coverage.
- **Insurance Issues**: The study committee would focus on addressing coverage gaps for non-clinical intensive care coordination services, which are often excluded by private insurance.
- **Call for Action**: The discussion underscored the urgent need for systemic changes to improve access to timely and effective mental health care for children.

#### **3. Senate Bill 349: Postpartum Care Study**
- **Overview**: The bill proposed studying postpartum care access and barriers in New Hampshire.
- **Debate**: Supporters emphasized the need to identify unmet needs for postpartum support, while opponents argued existing studies and commissions already address the issue.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 10-10 on both ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) and Ought to Pass (OTP), sending the bill to the floor with no recommendation.

#### **4. Senate Bill 357: Therapeutic Cannabis Certification**
- **Overview**: The bill clarifies which medical professionals can certify patients for therapeutic cannabis by removing the term "primarily responsible."
- **Amendment**: An amendment streamlined the process, allowing any provider treating a patient’s qualifying condition to issue certifications.
- **Outcome**: The committee unanimously supported the amendment and voted 20-0 to recommend OTP.

#### **5. Senate Bill 402: Pharmacist Vaccine Administration**
- **Overview**: The bill allows pharmacists to administer vaccines licensed by the FDA and recommended by the CDC.
- **Amendment**: Discrepancies between the Senate’s amended version and the House’s interpretation led to the bill being continued for further review.

#### **6. Senate Bill 458: In-House Pharmacy Permits**
- **Overview**: The bill expands in-house pharmacy permits for clinics, allowing them to dispense medications directly to patients.
- **Discussion**: Concerns about oversight and scope were raised, but the committee generally supported the concept. The bill was continued for further refinement.

#### **7. Senate Bill 412: Cedar Crest Expansion**
- **Overview**: The bill requests a temporary expansion of two additional beds at Cedar Crest, a facility for children with complex medical and developmental needs.
- **Rationale**: The expansion aims to address a growing demand for respite and long-term care services, particularly during peak periods like summer.
- **Outcome**: The bill was supported as a necessary step to meet immediate needs, despite concerns about the long-term care moratorium and Medicaid costs.

#### **8. Senate Bill 554: Licensing Data Sharing**
- **Overview**: The bill streamlines the process for verifying provider licenses by allowing DHHS and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to share data.
- **Goal**: The aim is to reduce redundancy and ensure Medicaid providers are properly licensed, as required by federal law.
- **Outcome**: The bill was supported for its efficiency improvements.
