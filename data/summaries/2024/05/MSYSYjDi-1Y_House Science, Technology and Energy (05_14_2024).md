On May 14, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened to discuss **Senate Bill 595 FN**, which focuses on **pole attachment rate cases and disputes**. The bill seeks to replace the existing **multi-part test** for resolving disputes with a **single formula** for determining rates. The committee engaged in extensive debate, particularly around proposed amendments, stakeholder inclusion, transparency, and the division of authority between state agencies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### Key Discussions:

1. **Amendment to the Bill**:
   - The committee proposed and debated an amendment requiring the **Department of Energy (DOE)** to conduct an **investigation** before developing a formula for pole attachment rates. This investigation would ensure transparency, fairness, and stakeholder involvement.
   - The amendment also stipulated that the DOE deliver a report to both the House and Senate energy committees by **January 1, 2026**, allowing legislative review of the proposed formula.

2. **Stakeholder Inclusion and Transparency**:
   - There was significant debate about whether the bill explicitly required the DOE to include stakeholders in its investigation. Some members argued for explicit inclusion to ensure fairness, while others believed stakeholders would naturally participate if it was in their interest.
   - The language around transparency was also scrutinized. Members noted that transparency alone does not guarantee stakeholder input, which could lead to legal challenges if parties feel excluded.

3. **Division of Authority**:
   - The committee discussed the division of labor between the legislature, the DOE, and the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**. While the legislature sets the intent, the DOE and PUC are responsible for implementation.
   - Concerns were raised about the PUC’s independence, with some members questioning whether the DOE should dictate the formula or if the PUC should retain full authority over rulemaking.

4. **Current vs. Proposed Process**:
   - The current **multi-part test** for resolving disputes was criticized for being ineffective. The proposed formula aims to simplify the process, though some members questioned whether it would adequately address all concerns.
   - The **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** formula was mentioned as a widely used standard, but the committee emphasized the need for a process tailored to New Hampshire’s specific needs.

5. **Costs and Rulemaking**:
   - The committee discussed the costs of the DOE’s investigation and how they would be assessed to the parties involved.
   - The PUC would conduct a **formal rulemaking process** to incorporate the formula developed by the DOE, ensuring a structured and accountable implementation.

### Key Outcomes:

1. **Amendment Adoption**:
   - The committee voted **17-0** to adopt the new amendment, which incorporated Representative Harrington’s suggestion to remove a clause mandating the PUC to use a specific formula. Instead, the PUC would consider the DOE’s report.
   - The amendment also added language to ensure the DOE’s report is delivered to both the House and Senate energy committees.

2. **Bill Passage**:
   - The bill, as amended, was unanimously passed by the committee (**17-0**) with a recommendation of **"ought to pass."**

3. **Next Steps**:
   - The bill will proceed to the **consent calendar** for final approval.
   - The committee adjourned with members expressing satisfaction with the progress made.

### Summary:

The committee’s discussion of **Senate Bill 595 FN** highlighted the complexities of addressing pole attachment rate disputes. By adopting the amendment, the committee ensured a more transparent, inclusive, and structured process for developing and implementing a formula. The bill’s passage reflects a balanced approach that considers stakeholder input, agency independence, and legislative oversight, paving the way for a more effective resolution of pole attachment rate disputes in New Hampshire.
