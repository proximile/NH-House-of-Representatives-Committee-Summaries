The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) convened on May 13, 2024, to address ongoing issues related to DCYF procedures, due process, and the intersection with family court. The meeting focused on several key concerns:

1. **Meeting Logistics and Attendance**: The chair noted lower attendance due to the legislative session's timing and emphasized the importance of ensuring bills progress smoothly. The committee discussed challenges in coordinating with agencies, some of which were not ready to attend or provided written responses instead.

2. **DCYF and Family Court Overlap**: The chair highlighted the blurred lines between DCYF and family court responsibilities, noting that some issues had been referred to the Special Committee on Family Court for resolution.

3. **Research and Future Meetings**: The committee received research materials to facilitate more productive discussions in future meetings. The chair expressed hope for progress before the summer legislative break in July and August.

4. **Public Testimony**:
   - **David Kylie**: A constituent shared his concerns about DCYF's handling of cases, citing personal experiences with family loss due to DCYF actions in other states. He emphasized the importance of protecting citizens' rights and holding agencies accountable.
   - **Donald Gilbert**: Gilbert detailed his family’s lengthy and complex legal battles with DCYF, including issues with record transparency, court delays, and alleged misconduct by DCYF workers. He criticized DCYF for failing to follow court orders, violating protective orders, and inadequately addressing child safety concerns.

5. **Accountability and Policy Concerns**: Committee members raised questions about DCYF's adherence to policies, the lack of accountability for employees who violate procedures, and the need for legislative reforms to ensure compliance with existing laws.

6. **Title IV Funding**: The committee discussed the implications of federal Title IV funding on DCYF operations and its influence on state policies. They considered requesting clarity on how these funds are allocated and their impact on DCYF’s structure and family court interactions.

7. **Future Actions**: The chair committed to scheduling follow-up meetings with the Office of the Child Advocate and other relevant parties to address unresolved issues. The committee also planned to explore policies around child removals and safety plans.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue addressing systemic issues within DCYF and ensuring accountability and transparency in its operations.
