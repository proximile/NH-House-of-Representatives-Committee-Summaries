The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee meeting on May 7, 2024, primarily focuses on the administrative rulemaking process. Michael Moral, the Director of the Administrative Rules Office, provides an in-depth overview of how rules are developed, adopted, and enforced by state agencies. Key points include:

1. **Definition and Purpose of Rules**: Rules are requirements adopted by agencies to implement, interpret, or enforce statutes. They have the force of law if validly adopted and filed.

2. **Rulemaking Process**: The process involves drafting, public hearings, and review by the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR). Agencies must follow specific steps, including public notice and fiscal impact statements.

3. **Legislative Oversight**: The legislature grants rulemaking authority to agencies, and JLCAR oversees the process to ensure compliance with legislative intent and statutory authority. JLCAR can object to rules on specific grounds, but agencies can still adopt rules over objections.

4. **Public Involvement**: Public hearings are a crucial part of the rulemaking process, allowing for input from affected parties. Agencies are required to consider public comments but are not obligated to make changes based on them.

5. **Legislative Intent**: Determining legislative intent can be challenging, especially with older statutes. Agencies must ensure that rules align with the intent of the legislation they are based on.

6. **Transparency and Accessibility**: There are ongoing efforts to improve transparency in the rulemaking process, including making public comments and agency responses more accessible.

7. **Challenges and Recourse**: Legislators expressed concerns about agencies not incorporating feedback from the legislature or the public. The primary recourse for legislators is to pass new legislation or use the JLCAR process to object to rules.

8. **Specific Concerns**: The committee discussed specific issues with the Department of Environmental Services' rulemaking, particularly the adequacy of public hearing time and the incorporation of public and legislative feedback.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexities of the rulemaking process, the importance of legislative oversight, and the need for greater transparency and public involvement.
