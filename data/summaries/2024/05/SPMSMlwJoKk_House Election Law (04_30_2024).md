The New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Committee held a public hearing on **Senate Bill 537**, which proposed allowing the **pre-processing of absentee ballots** before Election Day. The bill aimed to improve efficiency for city and town clerks, particularly in handling large volumes of absentee ballots, and to give voters an opportunity to correct errors (e.g., unsigned envelopes) before Election Day. 

### Key Points from the Hearing:
1. **Senator Donna Susi (Sponsor)** explained the bill’s goals:  
   - Pre-processing would reduce Election Day workload and allow voters to "cure" defective ballots.  
   - The bill was amended to mandate two pre-processing dates (originally one) and make the process optional for municipalities.  
   - Concerns were raised about uniformity in curing procedures and potential costs for larger cities like Manchester.

2. **Supporting Testimony**:  
   - **Linda Bundy** and **Tina Guilford** (town clerks) supported the bill, citing its benefits during the 2020 elections, where pre-processing helped voters correct errors and improved efficiency.  
   - **Olivia Zinc** (Open Democracy) emphasized the importance of pre-processing for election workers and voters, particularly those with disabilities.

3. **Opposing Testimony**:  
   - **Dan Healey** (NH City and Town Clerks Association) opposed mandating pre-processing, arguing it should remain optional. He also highlighted the need for clear guidelines on curing defective ballots.  
   - Concerns were raised about the bill’s potential to create unequal treatment of voters across municipalities and its relevance post-2020, as absentee ballot numbers have returned to normal levels.

4. **Committee Discussion**:  
   - Some representatives argued that pre-processing is unnecessary now that absentee voting has normalized post-COVID.  
   - Others expressed concerns about the costs and logistical challenges of pre-processing, especially for smaller towns.  
   - The issue of voter privacy and the need for uniform curing procedures were also debated.

5. **Vote Outcome**:  
   - The committee was evenly split (10-10) on both the **"ought to pass"** and **"inexpedient to legislate"** motions, resulting in no clear recommendation.  
   - The bill will proceed to the full House without a committee recommendation.

### Next Steps:
The bill will move to the House floor for further debate and a final vote. The committee will also hold a brief executive session to address **Senate Bill 534** (campaign finance) at a later time.
