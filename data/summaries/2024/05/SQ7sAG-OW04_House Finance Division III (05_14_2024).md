**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Finance Division III Meeting (05/14/2024)**

The NH House Finance Division III convened on May 14, 2024, for a detailed work session focused on legislative amendments and bills, particularly addressing child welfare, food assistance programs, Medicaid reimbursement rates, and other critical issues. The meeting was marked by extensive discussions, amendments, and a commitment to ensuring proper oversight and implementation of proposed policies.

### Key Discussions and Decisions

#### **Summer EBT Program**
The Summer EBT program, which supplements the SNAP program by providing additional funds to families during summer months when children are not receiving school meals, was a major topic of discussion. Concerns were raised about oversight, effectiveness, and the timing of fund availability. 
- **Amendment 1917**: A proposed amendment aimed to reinstate the summer EBT program, providing $120 per child for food during the summer. Questions about administrative costs and the feasibility of distributing funds during the summer were addressed by the Department of Health and Human Services.
- **Representative H’s Proposal**: An amendment to allocate $50,000 for planning and implementation, delaying full execution until the 2025 budget cycle, was discussed.

#### **Child Welfare and Parental Rights**
- **Amendment 1923 (SB 417)**: This amendment focused on child welfare, changing the evidentiary standard from "preponderance of the evidence" to "clear and convincing evidence" in cases involving child removal due to abuse or neglect. It also addressed firearm ownership in parental fitness assessments. The amendment passed unanimously (9-0).
- **HB 463 (Court-Appointed Counsel for Children)**: A new amendment (20249) was introduced to phase in attorney appointments for children in residential care. Concerns about prescriptive language and feasibility led to further drafting and a recess to refine the amendment.

#### **Medicaid Reimbursement Rates**
- **Amendment 1924 (SB 355)**: Discussions centered on adjusting effective dates to accommodate hospital associations. The committee agreed to push the effective date and address it in the full Finance Committee.
- **HB 455 (Medicaid Reimbursement Rates for Devices)**: Concerns about permanently setting rates at 90% of Medicare rates led to the proposal of Amendment 1942, which locked the rate to a specific date. This amendment was approved.

#### **Other Bills and Amendments**
- **SB 352 (Firefighters Cancer Screening)**: Amendment 1915 was accepted without objections.
- **HB 404 (Child Care Professionals Eligibility)**: Amendment 19218, which adjusted income thresholds and effective dates, was accepted after confirming it met prior agreements.
- **SB 596 (Child Care and Special Needs)**: The committee debated the bill’s lack of clarity on assessment tools, funding, and obligations. Amendment 1933, proposing a study committee to address these issues, passed. Amendment 1864, which aimed to add federal funding for summer EBT, failed.
- **Amendment 1948 (SB 463)**: This amendment involved technical corrections and the replication of "notwithstanding" language in the bill. It passed unanimously (9-0).
