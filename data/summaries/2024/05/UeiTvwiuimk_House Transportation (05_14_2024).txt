The NH House of Representatives meeting on May 14, 2024, focused on several transportation-related bills during an executive session. Key discussions and outcomes included:

1. **Senate Bill 510**: The committee debated and adopted an amendment to the bill, which incorporated provisions from House Bills 1391 and 1638 related to vehicle inspections. The amendment passed 19-0, and the bill was recommended to pass as amended with a 16-3 vote.

2. **House Bill 581**: The committee moved to recommend an interim study for this bill due to concerns about wording that might invalidate the temporary use of expired driver’s licenses as IDs. The motion passed 19-0.

3. **Senate Bill 501**: The committee reconsidered a previous vote on this bill, which deals with driver’s licenses for non-citizens. After reconsideration, the bill was recommended to pass with a 10-9 vote.

4. **Senate Bill 358**: The committee debated a bill that would invalidate out-of-state driver’s licenses issued to undocumented immigrants. A motion to pass the bill failed 9-10, and a subsequent motion to recommend it as inexpedient to legislate passed 10-9.

5. **House Bill 1222 and House Bill 1550**: The committee reviewed Senate amendments to these bills, which involved minor clarifications related to vehicle lighting systems and seasonal speed limits. The committee agreed to concur with the Senate’s changes.

Throughout the session, committee members engaged in detailed discussions on the implications of each bill, particularly focusing on public safety, legal considerations, and the impact on various stakeholders. The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the committee’s efforts and the support staff’s contributions.
