The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on May 14, 2024, centered on critical discussions and proposed amendments related to special education and school accountability. The meeting highlighted significant debates, particularly around **SB 340**, **House Bill 378**, and other education-related bills. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points:

### **Special Education Focus: SB 340 and Amendments**
1. **Amendment to SB 340**:
   - The proposed amendment aimed to address special education rules, parental rights, and communication between parents and school districts.
   - **Sections 1-4** received broad support for enhancing transparency and accountability, including:
     - Parental access to Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) in electronic, searchable formats.
     - Improved reporting requirements for special education revenues and expenditures.
     - Streamlined communication via email unless parents opted for US mail.
   - **Section 5** faced strong opposition. It would limit special education rules to state or federal minimum requirements unless explicitly authorized by statute. Critics argued this would strip critical protections for students with disabilities, such as parental consent, communication, and safeguards against harmful practices like aversive therapies.
   - Parents and advocates, including Bonnie Dunham and Karen Rosenberg, emphasized the importance of maintaining New Hampshire’s higher standards, which often exceed federal requirements and provide essential protections for students and families.
   - Concerns were raised about the impact on the Office of the Special Education Advocate, including potential burdens from additional paperwork and unclear access to student records.
   - The March 2024 audit report on special education was frequently referenced, with some arguing the amendment addressed its findings, while others cautioned against rushing legislation before the full audit report’s release in December 2024.

2. **Data Sharing and Oversight**:
   - The amendment proposed expanding data sharing between the Department of Education and the Special Education Advocate’s office. However, concerns were raised about the handling of personally identifiable information (PII) and the need for parental consent.
   - Kristen Manon, from the Office of the Advocate for Special Education, supported parts of the amendment but recommended removing Section 5 to focus on improving collaboration between parents and school districts.

3. **Parental Concerns and Trust**:
   - Parents shared personal stories about their children’s reliance on New Hampshire’s special education standards, emphasizing the importance of clear timelines, parental consent, and communication with schools.
   - Representatives acknowledged the need for trust and engagement with parents in the legislative process to address concerns effectively.

4. **Calls for Further Review**:
   - Many participants urged the committee to reject the amendment and conduct a deeper review of the issues, emphasizing the need to preserve New Hampshire’s high standards for special education and ensure that students and families are adequately supported.

### **Performance-Based Accountability System: House Bill 378**
1. **House Bill 378**:
   - The bill establishes a **task force** to develop and review the **Performance-Based Accountability System (PBAS)** for schools, ensuring they provide adequate education opportunities.
   - The task force will consist of **10 to 15 members**, including superintendents, principals, teachers, and educational experts, and will deliver recommendations by **June 30, 2026**.
   - The Department of Education (DOE) will provide technical support and host public comment sessions to gather feedback on PBAS proposals.
   - **Amendment 1898 H** was incorporated, clarifying the task force’s composition and refining the responsibilities of the DOE and the task force. It also removed Section 5, which had been a point of contention.
   - The committee voted **18-1** to pass the bill with the amendment, and it will proceed to the regular calendar for further discussion.

### **Other Education-Related Bills**
1. **SB 1107 (Frameworks Bill)**:
   - Recommended for **concurrence** with the Senate’s addition of a requirement to update public school standards every 10 years.
2. **SB 1165 (Public School Infrastructure Funding)**:
   - Recommended for **concurrence**, despite concerns about the process for approving funds.
3. **SB 1305 (Freedom of Speech and Association in Higher Education)**:
   - Recommended for **concurrence**, with minor changes to definitions and harassment provisions.
4. **SB 1665 (Technical Amendment)**:
   - Recommended for **concurrence** with a minor wording change.
5. **SB 1695 (Student Data Notification)**:
   - The committee **requested a committee of conference** to resolve differences in the notification timeline (14 days before vs. within 14 days of release).

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Special Education Protections**: Strong opposition to Section 5 of the SB 340 amendment, with calls to preserve and strengthen New Hampshire’s higher standards for special education.
- **Accountability and Transparency**: Support for measures that enhance accountability, transparency, and parental involvement in education, particularly in special education and the PBAS.
- **Data Privacy**: Concerns about the handling of personally identifiable information and the need for parental consent in data-sharing processes.
- **Legislative Process**: Criticism of the late introduction of amendments and calls for a more deliberate and inclusive approach to addressing complex education issues.
- **Future Steps**: Emphasis on the need for comprehensive reviews, such as the special education audit, to inform future legislative actions and ensure effective support for students and families.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexities of special education policies, the importance of data privacy, and the need for clear and effective legislation to support students with disabilities and their families. The committee’s decisions reflected a balance between addressing immediate concerns and advocating for more thoughtful, long-term solutions.
