**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee Meeting (May 28, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee convened on May 28, 2024, to discuss a wide range of topics related to wildlife, fisheries, marine resources, and land management. The meeting highlighted the state’s commitment to conservation, communal land use, and the balance between state and federal authority. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

### **Law Enforcement and Resource Management**
- **Enforcement Authority**: Fish and Game officers are empowered to enforce state laws, including checking licenses, inspecting catches, and issuing citations for violations. The community takes pride in protecting natural resources, and officers play a critical role in maintaining compliance with regulations.
- **Search and Rescue**: The Fish and Game Department is responsible for search and rescue operations, particularly in challenging terrains like mountainous areas.
- **Innovations in Wildlife Management**: The department has been proactive in reintroducing species such as moose and turkeys to New Hampshire and supporting sustainable practices like oyster farming along the coast.

### **Land Use and Property Rights**
- **Communal Land Model**: New Hampshire follows a communal property model, where private land is generally open for public recreation (hunting, fishing, hiking) unless posted otherwise by the landowner. This contrasts with some Midwestern states, where written permission is required.
- **Current Use Program**: Landowners who keep their property open for recreational use can receive tax breaks through the "Current Use" program, incentivizing public access.
- **Technology and Privacy Concerns**: The use of trail cameras on private property has raised privacy issues, leading to new regulations requiring landowners' permission for camera placement.

### **State vs. Federal Laws**
- **Conflicts and Collaboration**: New Hampshire has occasionally passed laws in conflict with federal mandates, such as refusing to enforce federal gun control measures. Similarly, states like Colorado and Oregon have resisted federal marijuana laws. However, the committee emphasized collaboration between state and federal laws, particularly in fisheries management, where state laws govern state waters and federal laws regulate international waters.
- **Checks and Balances**: Mechanisms are in place to hold state agencies accountable, including escalating concerns to department heads, the governor, or the executive council. Funding control also serves as a check on agency behavior.

### **Fishing, Hunting, and Marine Resources**
- **Regulation and Licensing**: Fishing and hunting are regulated through licensing and permitting, with restrictions on gear and catch limits to protect resources. Enforcement officers address issues like poaching, illegal gear use, and commercial fishing activities.
- **Conservation and Food Security**: While hunting and fishing contribute to food security, the state primarily addresses food insecurity through aid programs rather than subsidizing fishing activities. The committee stressed the importance of balancing commercial interests with conservation and animal rights concerns.
- **Scientific Data and Rule-Making**: Biologists play a key role in providing scientific data to inform rule-making and law-making decisions, ensuring that regulations are based on sound ecological principles.

### **Legislative Process and Public Involvement**
- **Volunteer Legislature**: New Hampshire’s legislature is largely volunteer-based, with representatives earning minimal compensation. This fosters a sense of pride and community service but also leads to a high turnover rate and lack of term limits.
- **Bipartisan Cooperation**: The committee highlighted the bipartisan nature of their work, with Republicans and Democrats collaborating on wildlife management issues.
- **Public Input**: Public involvement is critical in shaping laws, and the legislative process includes committee hearings, house and senate votes, and the governor’s approval.

### **International Exchange and Community Pride**
- **International Visitors**: The meeting included international visitors, and representatives expressed appreciation for the opportunity to share New Hampshire’s legislative and resource management practices.
- **Community Pride**: The state’s volunteer legislature and communal approach to land use reflect a deep sense of pride in protecting natural resources and fostering public access.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored New Hampshire’s dedication to conservation, sustainable resource management, and the balance between public access and private property rights. By fostering collaboration between state and federal authorities, leveraging scientific data, and encouraging public involvement, the Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee continues to play a vital role in preserving New Hampshire’s natural heritage for future generations.
