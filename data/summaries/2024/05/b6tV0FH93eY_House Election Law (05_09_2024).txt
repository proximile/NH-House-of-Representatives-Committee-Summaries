The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 9, 2024, focused on several legislative items, primarily centered around **CACR 22** and **Senate Bill 534**. Here’s a summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **CACR 22: First-in-the-Nation Presidential Primary**
- **Purpose**: CACR 22 aimed to enshrine New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary in the state constitution.
- **Voting and Debate**:
  - The committee reconsidered CACR 22, which had previously been voted as "inexpedient to legislate" (20-0).
  - After a motion to reconsider passed, the committee voted again on the "inexpedient to legislate" motion, which failed (11-9).
  - A subsequent motion of "ought to pass" also failed, leaving the bill without a recommendation.
  - **Key Arguments**:
    - **Supporters** argued that it would solidify New Hampshire’s primary status and protect it from being usurped by other states.
    - **Opponents** raised concerns about the rigidity of a constitutional amendment, potential risks of voter rejection, and the lack of flexibility in adjusting primary dates.
  - An interim study motion was proposed but failed on a tie vote (10-10).

### **Senate Bill 534: Campaign Finance**
- **Amendment**: Representative Lane proposed Amendment 2024-1856h, which was adopted unanimously (20-0).
- **Outcome**: The committee voted in favor of the bill as amended with a unanimous "ought to pass" recommendation (20-0). The bill was placed on the consent calendar for further consideration.

### **Key Themes**:
- **Bipartisanship**: Several representatives expressed frustration over the handling of CACR 22, which they felt damaged the bipartisan relationship built over two years.
- **Procedural Concerns**: Some members objected to the parliamentary procedures used during the CACR 22 reconsideration, particularly the timing of the vote and the lack of full committee participation.
- **Trust in Voters**: Supporters of CACR 22 emphasized trusting voters to decide on the constitutional amendment, while opponents highlighted the high threshold (66% voter approval) and potential risks of failure.

### **Conclusion**:
The meeting concluded with the committee wrapping up its work on CACR 22 and Senate Bill 534, with no further bills to consider. The session highlighted the complexities and differing perspectives on constitutional amendments and campaign finance legislation.
