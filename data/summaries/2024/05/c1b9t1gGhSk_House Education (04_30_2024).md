### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Education Committee Meeting (04/30/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Committee meeting on April 30, 2024, centered on two key topics: the formation and structure of a **Task Force on Education Accountability and Performance-Based Assessment Systems** and the discussion of **SB 378**, a bill related to the **Performance-Based School Accountability System (PBASS)**. The discussions emphasized the need for a well-structured, inclusive, and effective approach to evaluating school performance and accountability, particularly for charter schools and alternative education models.

#### Task Force on Education Accountability and Performance-Based Assessment Systems

1. **Task Force Composition and Membership**:  
   - The task force is proposed to have between 9 and 15 members, including elementary and secondary teachers, superintendents, curriculum administrators, and other educational stakeholders.  
   - There was debate over the flexibility in appointing members, with some advocating for specific organizations to be included and others preferring the commissioner’s discretion.  
   - Ensuring the task force includes members with expertise in performance-based accountability and practical experience in curriculum development was emphasized.  

2. **Expert Involvement and Public Input**:  
   - The task force will rely on experts, including educators and national assessment organizations, to advise on performance-based accountability systems.  
   - Public comment and consultation with stakeholders, such as educational organizations, parents, and community members, will be incorporated to ensure broad representation.  

3. **Scope of Work**:  
   - The task force will investigate and make recommendations on the applicability of performance-based accountability systems, including for charter schools and alternative education models.  
   - It will consider existing data indicators collected by schools and explore additional metrics to better align accountability measures with the unique missions of alternative programs, such as those serving at-risk students.  

4. **Funding and Logistics**:  
   - The Department of Education (DOE) will provide stipends, mileage reimbursement, and logistical support for task force members.  
   - Unused funds from the current budget may be carried forward to support the task force’s work.  

5. **Reporting and Legislative Action**:  
   - The task force will submit a report with findings and recommendations to the State Board of Education and the legislative oversight committee.  
   - The oversight committee may then move forward with legislation based on the task force’s recommendations.  

6. **Timeline and Chair Selection**:  
   - The original deadline of September 2025 for the task force’s report was extended to June 2026 to allow adequate time for organization, consultation, and thorough work.  
   - The commissioner will call the first meeting, and the task force will elect its chair. The DOE will provide support but will not be a voting member.  

#### Discussion of SB 378 and the Performance-Based School Accountability System (PBASS)

1. **Task Force Establishment and Role**:  
   - SB 378 proposes establishing a task force to develop and review the PBASS.  
   - There was debate over whether the task force should be a permanent body or disband after completing its task. The task force would review accountability results annually to ensure the system reflects adequate education measurements.  

2. **Charter Schools and Accountability**:  
   - The current PBASS system does not apply to charter schools, leading to confusion and inconsistencies in accountability.  
   - The task force could explore extending PBASS to charter schools, but this would require changes to state law. The unique missions of charter schools, particularly those serving at-risk populations, complicate accountability measures, as traditional metrics may not align with their goals.  

3. **Alternative Programs and Accountability**:  
   - Programs like Bud Carlson Academy, which serve at-risk students, often struggle to meet traditional accountability standards.  
   - The discussion highlighted the need for an accountability system that aligns with the specific missions of alternative programs, rather than penalizing them for not meeting conventional metrics.  

4. **Public Input and Department Role**:  
   - The task force may hold listening sessions or public hearings to gather input from stakeholders, ensuring the accountability system reflects the needs of New Hampshire’s diverse educational landscape.  
   - The DOE would provide technical support and advice to the task force, but the task force would consist primarily of external experts to ensure independence and practical insights.  

#### Key Themes and Objectives

The discussions underscored a collaborative effort to refine the PBASS system to better serve all public schools, including charter and alternative programs, while ensuring accountability measures are fair, relevant, and effective. The task force’s recommendations would ultimately require legislative approval before implementation. The committee aimed to balance inclusivity, expertise, and practicality in addressing the complexities of educational accountability and assessment in New Hampshire.
