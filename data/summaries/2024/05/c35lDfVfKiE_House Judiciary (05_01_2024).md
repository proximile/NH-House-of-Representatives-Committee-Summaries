### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting (05/01/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on May 1, 2024, to discuss and vote on several bills, addressing a range of legal, procedural, and societal issues. The meeting was marked by detailed debates, procedural motions, and close votes, reflecting the complexity of the topics and the diverse perspectives of the committee members. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Civil vs. Criminal Cases and Post-Conviction Relief**
The committee engaged in extensive discussions about the interplay between civil and criminal cases, particularly in the context of new evidence and exoneration. Key points included:
- **Fairness in Judgments**: Concerns were raised about the fairness of civil judgments when individuals are exonerated in criminal cases. Members debated the differing burdens of proof in civil and criminal cases and the implications of allowing new evidence to impact both types of cases.
- **Senate Bill 462 (New Trial Motions)**: The committee debated removing time limits for filing motions for new trials based on newly discovered evidence in criminal cases. Proponents argued it would ensure justice, while opponents highlighted potential financial impacts, such as increased insurance rates, and the availability of habeas corpus as an alternative. An amendment to extend this provision to civil cases was proposed but rejected. The bill ultimately passed **11 to 9**, with a minority report to be drafted by Representative Trip.
- **Interim Study Motion**: A motion to send the issue of post-conviction relief to an interim study committee passed **11 to 9**, with the goal of developing a more comprehensive approach.

---

#### **2. Voter Records and Death Notifications**
- **Senate Bill 576 (Dead Voter Records)**: The committee debated a bill requiring funeral homes to notify the state of deaths to prevent deceased individuals from remaining on voter rolls. Supporters viewed it as a precautionary measure, while opponents argued it was redundant and created unnecessary paperwork. The bill failed, and a motion for "inexpedient to legislate" passed **11 to 9**.

---

#### **3. Name Changes for Incarcerated Individuals**
- **House Bill 103 (Name Change Bill)**: A minor amendment was noted, requiring notification to both the Department of Corrections and the Department of Safety for background checks when a name change occurs while someone is incarcerated. The Senate planned to expedite the bill to accommodate victims' families.

---

#### **4. Hospital Discharge Barriers**
- **Senate Bill 185**: The committee discussed barriers to discharging patients from hospitals, such as Medicaid enrollment, housing, and guardianship issues. Representative Alexander moved to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill, arguing that these barriers are already well-known and that a study committee is unnecessary. Others, including Representative Oregon, countered that a study could still explore actionable solutions. The motion to ITL passed **11 to 9**.

---

#### **5. Landlord-Tenant Issues**
- **Senate Bill 413**: The committee debated a bill addressing landlord-tenant issues and termination of tenancy. An amendment to incorporate provisions from House Bill 1115 (a previously passed landlord-tenant bill) was proposed but failed **10 to 10**. A subsequent motion to pass the bill (OTP) without the amendment also failed **10 to 10**, sending the bill to the floor without recommendation.

---

#### **6. Terminology for Mothers in Legal Contexts**
- **Senate Bill 462**: The committee discussed changes to the term "birth mother" to "mother" in certain legal contexts to include surrogates and gestational carriers. Representative Katab proposed an amendment to make the language more inclusive while retaining "birth mother" where medically necessary, which passed **20 to 0**. Representative Alexander proposed a second amendment to add provisions from other House-passed bills, but it failed **10 to 10**. The bill will go to the floor with two competing OTP motions.

---

#### **7. Committee Reports and Procedural Issues**
- Members assigned responsibilities for drafting reports on various bills, with deadlines set for the same day.
- The committee debated procedural issues, including the speaker’s role in deciding which OTP motions would be considered first for Senate Bill 462.
- Several votes resulted in **10 to 10** ties, highlighting partisan divides and the need for strategic maneuvering to advance bills.

---

#### **Overall Themes and Takeaways**
- **Study Committees**: There was skepticism about the effectiveness of study committees, with some members arguing they often delay action rather than solve problems.
- **Legislative vs. Executive Roles**: Frustration was expressed that the legislature is being asked to solve issues that should be handled by executive agencies or stakeholders.
- **Bipartisan Challenges**: Close votes and partisan divides underscored the challenges of advancing legislation in a divided committee.
