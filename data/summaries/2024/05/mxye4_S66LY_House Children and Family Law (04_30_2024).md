The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Children and Family Law convened on April 30, 2024, to discuss several bills and amendments. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

### **Senate Bill 574**
- **Topic**: Appointment of a temporary agent for a minor child or incapacitated person.
- **Discussion**: Representative Nelson shared that she had researched how other states handle similar statutes and found that the structure is consistent across states. The bill aims to provide legal weight to temporary guardianship agreements, especially in cases like military deployment or vacations, where parents may need to delegate caregiving responsibilities.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 13-0 to move the bill forward with a recommendation to pass.

### **Senate Bill 459**
- **Topic**: An amendment to the bill was introduced, which involved replacing certain sections (e.g., Section 5) and adding new sections (e.g., Section 6).
