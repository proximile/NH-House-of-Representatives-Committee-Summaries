**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Meeting on May 1, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on May 1, 2024, centered on **Senate Bill 440**, which proposes to expand the scope of practice for optometrists, particularly regarding their ability to perform certain surgical and laser procedures. The discussions emphasized balancing professional collaboration, public safety, and access to care, with significant attention given to training, certification, and oversight. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

---

### **Scope of Practice Expansion**
The bill seeks to allow optometrists to perform specific procedures, including certain laser surgeries (e.g., YAG capsulotomy, SLT, and YAG iridotomy) that are currently performed by ophthalmologists. Proponents argued that this expansion would improve access to eye care, especially in rural areas facing workforce shortages. However, concerns were raised about whether optometrists have the necessary training and hands-on experience to perform these procedures safely, given the lack of accredited surgical residency programs for optometrists comparable to those for ophthalmologists.

---

### **Training, Certification, and Competency**
A major focus of the discussion was the need for rigorous training and certification standards to ensure patient safety. The bill proposes that the **Board of Optometry** establish criteria for education, training, and live clinical experience before optometrists can perform advanced procedures. Concerns were raised about the limited opportunities for optometrists to gain live patient experience in states where certain procedures are not permitted. Ophthalmologists emphasized the importance of competency beyond minimum requirements and questioned how safety outcomes would be monitored and reported.

---

### **Rulemaking and Oversight**
The bill shifts detailed training and procedural requirements from statute to rulemaking by the Board of Optometry, allowing for flexibility and updates as practices evolve. The board would categorize procedures, establish certification processes, and set minimum training standards. The **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** would provide oversight to ensure compliance. The rulemaking process will include public comment and input from stakeholders, including ophthalmologists.

---

### **Exclusions and Limitations**
The bill includes an **exclusionary list** of procedures that optometrists are explicitly prohibited from performing, such as those requiring general anesthesia or involving the retina. The Board of Optometry will further define and limit the procedures optometrists can perform based on their training and accreditation. This approach aims to prevent overreach while allowing optometrists to practice within their capabilities.

---

### **Collaboration Between Optometrists and Ophthalmologists**
The importance of maintaining collaborative relationships between optometrists and ophthalmologists was emphasized, particularly for pre- and post-operative care. Examples were given of existing practices where optometrists assist with care for procedures like cataract surgery, highlighting the value of teamwork in patient care. The bill aims to enhance this collaboration while ensuring that each profession operates within its scope of practice.

---

### **Malpractice Insurance and Liability**
Questions were raised about whether optometrists would be able to obtain malpractice insurance for advanced procedures. It was noted that major malpractice insurance providers, such as the OMC (which covers ophthalmologists), do not currently support extending surgical coverage to optometrists. However, optometrists in other states have reportedly secured coverage for similar procedures, suggesting that this may not be a significant barrier.

---

### **Continuing Education and Workforce Retention**
The bill proposes changes to continuing education requirements for optometrists, increasing the minimum hours and allowing the Board of Optometry to set additional requirements for specific procedures. This is seen as a way to ensure that optometrists remain up-to-date with advancements in their field. Additionally, the bill is viewed as a tool to attract and retain optometrists in New Hampshire by allowing them to practice to the full extent of their training.

---

### **Amendment and Final Vote**
An amended version of the bill was proposed, incorporating technical language changes and clarifications requested by stakeholders. The amendment addressed the responsibilities of the Board of Optometry versus the OPLC in enforcing the billâ€™s provisions. The subcommittee voted in favor of the amended bill, with the understanding that it would enhance collaboration between optometrists and ophthalmologists while ensuring public safety. The bill will proceed to the full committee for further discussion and voting.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of expanding the scope of practice for optometrists, balancing the need for improved access to care with the imperative to ensure patient safety. The bill seeks to achieve this balance through rigorous training, certification, and oversight, while fostering collaboration between optometrists and ophthalmologists. As the bill moves forward, further rulemaking and public input will refine the details to address concerns and ensure its effective implementation.
