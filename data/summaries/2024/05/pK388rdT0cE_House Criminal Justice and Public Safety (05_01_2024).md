**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on May 1, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on May 1, 2024, to address several critical issues related to criminal justice and public safety, focusing on anti-Semitic discrimination, tenant squatting, and property rights.

### **1. Anti-Semitic Discrimination and Senate Bill 508**
The first segment of the meeting centered on **Senate Bill 508**, which aims to combat anti-Semitic discrimination. Key highlights included:
- **Definition of Anti-Semitism**: The bill clarified that criticism of Israel is not inherently anti-Semitic but outlined three criteria—demonization, double standards, and delegitimization of Israel’s right to exist—that could indicate discriminatory behavior. It emphasized that the bill does not restrict free speech but provides a framework for identifying discriminatory actions.
- **Amendments**: Two amendments were adopted:
  - Inclusion of **Certified Recovery Workers** within the bill’s scope.
  - Standardization of the definition of anti-Semitic behavior for legal purposes, with assurances that it does not criminalize speech but aids in identifying hate crimes or discrimination.
- **Fiscal Concerns**: One representative opposed the bill due to concerns about **unfunded mandates** potentially increasing county expenditures, citing Article 28a of the state constitution.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed as amended with a vote of **19-1** and moved forward for further consideration.

### **2. Tenant Squatting and the 540A Petition Process**
The second segment addressed **tenant squatting**, where individuals occupy properties without legal authorization. Discussions focused on:
- **540A Petition Process**: Representatives proposed using the existing 540A petition process to expedite the removal of unauthorized occupants. This process allows property owners to file a petition, with a hearing held within 48 hours to determine the occupants’ legal right to stay.
- **Due Process**: There was a strong emphasis on ensuring fairness and due process for both property owners and occupants.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Amendments were suggested to streamline the process, reducing the timeline to two days for resolving squatting cases.

### **3. Adoption of the IHRA Definition of Anti-Semitism**
The committee also discussed codifying the **International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism** into New Hampshire law. Key points included:
- **Support for the IHRA Definition**: Testimonies from representatives, Jewish community leaders, and organizations highlighted the importance of a clear, objective definition to address rising anti-Semitic incidents in the state and nationally.
- **Free Speech Concerns**: Concerns were raised about potential infringement on free speech, particularly regarding criticism of Israel. Supporters clarified that the bill does not criminalize speech but provides a framework for identifying unlawful discrimination or hate crimes.
- **National Context**: The discussion referenced the increase in anti-Semitic incidents across the U.S., including on college campuses, and the need for consistent definitions to address hate crimes effectively.

### **4. Senate Bill 315 and the Non-Germane Amendment on Squatting**
The final segment focused on **Senate Bill 315** and its proposed **non-germane amendment**, which aimed to address squatting more effectively. Key discussions included:
- **Purpose of the Amendment**: The amendment seeks to protect property owners from individuals illegally occupying properties without authorization, while balancing due process rights.
- **Concerns and Scenarios**:
  - **College Subletting**: Concerns were raised about college students subletting properties without proper documentation, potentially leading to wrongful evictions.
  - **Landlord Rights**: Landlords expressed frustration over tenants subletting without their knowledge, leaving them unable to vet occupants.
  - **Homelessness and Housing Crisis**: Opponents argued that the amendment could criminalize homelessness, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations during a severe housing crisis.
- **Legal Process**: Critics highlighted the need for a clear civil process to avoid bypassing due process rights or overburdening law enforcement.
- **Proposed Changes**: Stakeholders suggested refining the amendment to ensure it targets only true squatters without harming lawful occupants, including defining clear proofs of residency and ensuring fair legal processes.
