**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (05/17/2024)**

On May 17, 2024, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened to evaluate the stateâ€™s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan, science-focused committee aimed to assess the administration of federal guidance, emergency use authorizations, vaccination efforts, and the broader impact on public health, the economy, and civil liberties. The meeting highlighted significant concerns about transparency, accountability, and ethical practices, while also discussing lessons learned and recommendations for future public health crises.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Vaccine Safety, Liability, and Transparency**  
   - The committee raised concerns about the lack of liability for vaccine manufacturers under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which shields them from damages.  
   - Members emphasized the need for informed consent and transparency, particularly regarding potential adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines.  
   - Issues with clinical trials were discussed, including the failure to report severe adverse events and the lack of independent oversight.  
   - Testimonies, such as that of legislator Joanie, highlighted personal experiences with vaccine injuries and the challenges of obtaining medical recognition and support.  

2. **Government and Industry Conflicts**  
   - Criticism was directed at the revolving door between pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies like the FDA, raising concerns about bias and industry influence on regulatory decisions.  
   - The committee called for independent oversight to ensure unbiased evaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy.  

3. **Data Access and Reporting**  
   - The committee stressed the importance of access to raw data from vaccine safety monitoring systems like VAERS and V-Safe.  
   - Questions were raised about when safety signals were first identified and why certain data was not made public.  

4. **Misinformation, Censorship, and Public Trust**  
   - The role of government agencies and social media platforms in censoring information about vaccine injuries and alternative treatments was criticized as undermining public trust.  
   - Members expressed concern that the mishandling of the pandemic, including misinformation and lack of transparency, has eroded trust in institutions and could have long-term consequences.  

5. **Impact on Civil Liberties and Governance**  
   - The committee discussed the potential infringement on civil liberties through vaccine mandates and restrictions.  
   - Concerns were raised about the shutdown of the judiciary system during the pandemic and its impact on access to justice.  

6. **Economic and Business Response**  
   - New Hampshire businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, were praised for their proactive role in supporting public health efforts, such as producing essential supplies and adapting operations.  
   - Challenges included the rapid closure and reopening of businesses, workforce shortages due to enhanced unemployment benefits, and the distribution of federal relief funds like the CARES Act and ARPA.  

7. **Federal Funding and Recovery Efforts**  
   - The Governor's Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery (GOFER) effectively managed $1.25 billion in CARES Act funds and $994 million in ARPA funds, focusing on emergency response, economic stabilization, and long-term recovery.  
   - Investments were made in infrastructure, housing, mental health services, and broadband expansion, with minimal instances of fraud reported.  

8. **Lessons Learned and Future Preparedness**
