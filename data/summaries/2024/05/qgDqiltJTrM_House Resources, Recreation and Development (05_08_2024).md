1. **Senate Bill 547**:
   - The committee discussed and passed an amendment to Senate Bill 547, which removed the term "historic preservation project" from the easement interest definition.

2. **Senate Bill 431**:

The amendment was contentious, with arguments for and against. The amendment passed (11-9), and the bill passed as amended (11-9). The discussion highlighted concerns about environmental impacts, the need for compromise, and the importance of protecting New Hampshire’s lakes.

3. **House Bill 398**:
   - The committee considered Senate amendments to House Bill 398, which removed the word "home" from "home buyers" in the bill’s language. The committee unanimously concurred with the Senate’s version, as it aligned with other property notification practices.

4. **House Bill 1060**:
   - The committee reviewed Senate amendments to House Bill 1060, which clarified the appointment process for a public member of the Geologic Resources Committee and specified meeting procedures. The committee unanimously concurred with the Senate’s version.

5. **Committee Business**:
