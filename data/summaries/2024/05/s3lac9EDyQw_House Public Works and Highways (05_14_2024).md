The New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee held an executive session on May 14, 2024, to discuss Senate Bill 543, which aims to establish a State Environmental Adaptation, Resilience, and Innovation Council. The session began with acknowledgments of Representatives Brennan and Newman for their presence. A motion was made and seconded to auto-pass SB 543, with no discussion raised. The clerk conducted a roll call vote, with most representatives voting in favor, though a few, like Representatives Fidi and Melvin, voted against it. The motion passed.

The committee also noted that four bills were slated for interim study, with plans to distribute the list of these bills to members later. The meeting concluded with no objections to the consent agenda and no additional questions or notifications about Senate amendments or committee plans. The chair thanked the members for their time and participation.
