The New Hampshire House Public Works and Highways Committee convened an executive session on May 14, 2024, to discuss Senate Bill 543, which proposes the establishment of a State Environmental Adaptation, Resilience, and Innovation Council. Representative Brenen and Newman were thanked for their attendance. A motion was made and seconded to pass the bill, and after no discussion, a roll call vote was conducted. The majority voted in favor, with only a few representatives voting against it. The motion to pass SB 543 was approved.

Following this, the committee addressed procedural matters, including consent items and the notification of four bills slated for interim study. The committee concluded its business for the day, with the chair expressing appreciation for the members' time. There was a brief mention of potential Senate amendments or committee plans for conference, though no specific notifications were available at the time. The session ended with no further questions.
