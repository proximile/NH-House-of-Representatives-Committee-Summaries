**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting on May 17, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on May 17, 2024, to address a wide range of fiscal and operational issues. The meeting covered key discussions, decisions, and updates across various state departments and programs. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

1. **Hospital Transition and Communication**  
   Commissioner Lori Weaver of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided updates on the transition of a hospital, emphasizing efforts to ensure a seamless transition for patient care and staff. She highlighted ongoing communication with town officials to address concerns and fears.

2. **Perimeter Fence Installation**  
   The committee discussed plans to install a perimeter fence, with diagrams to be presented to the town. The project is expected to proceed within the next 3 to 6 months, pending state government paperwork and funding.

3. **Pay and Benefits for Transitioning Employees**  
   The committee addressed questions about pay and benefits for employees transitioning to state systems. It was confirmed that employees would receive equal pay and comparable benefits without pay raises or losses.

4. **Port Authority Leadership**  
   Miles Greenway, the acting Port Director, provided updates on the administrative leave of the current Port Director, Guy Marconi, pending an investigation. The committee expressed concerns about the lack of public information regarding the investigation.

5. **Homeless Shelter Funding**  
   The committee approved additional funding for homeless shelters, addressing concerns about potential closures and the need for increased shelter bed rates. Discussions emphasized the importance of maintaining transition services and case management for homeless individuals.

6. **ARPA Funds and Budgeting**  
   The committee discussed the availability of ARPA funds for various projects, including homeless services. Reallocations of funds will be clearer by the end of the fiscal year, with some projects potentially lapsing back to general funds.

7. **Youth Development Center (YDC) Capacity**  
   Concerns were raised about the capacity of the new YDC replacement center, with discussions on whether the initial sizing was underestimated. The committee acknowledged ongoing efforts to address systemic issues and trends in juvenile justice.

8. **Newborn Navigator Program**  
   The committee discussed the Newborn Navigator Program, a state initiative funded by federal TANF funds. The program supports families with newborns by providing services like safe sleep education, lead prevention, and nutrition referrals. Eligibility is open to both single and two-parent families.

9. **Trail Accessibility**  
   The committee addressed concerns about trail accessibility in state parks. While many trails, especially in urban areas, are accessible, some, like hiking trails on mountains, cannot be made fully accessible due to terrain. The Bureau of Trails encourages accessibility where feasible but does not mandate it for all trails.

10. **Travel Costs**  
    The committee questioned the high travel costs for 17 staff members attending a conference in Albuquerque, which amounted to nearly $3,000 per person. The HHS explained the costs were due to extended travel days and the need for reimbursement.

11. **Bathroom Renovations**  
    The Department of Administrative Services requested $1 million in ARPA funds for bathroom renovations, with the total project cost being $2.1 million. The committee discussed why the full amount was not requested and the timeline for project completion.

12. **Economic Development**  
    The committee discussed the status of the White Mountain Paper Company in Gorham, which is expected to operate profitably this year and expand its production line. The company has invested $9 million in revitalization efforts.

13. **Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)**  
    The committee addressed the PILOT to the town of Hampstead for property taxes lost due to state-owned facilities. The department plans to bring forward a related item in June and will consider long-term policy implications during the next budget process.

14. **Provider Transition**  
    The committee discussed the transition from WellSense to Dartmouth as a service provider, which is set to occur by June 30th. The focus was on ensuring a smooth transition for staff and service continuity.

### **Administrative Matters**

- **Approval of Minutes**: The committee unanimously approved the minutes from the April 19th meeting, with one abstention.  
- **Audits and Recommendations**: Two audits were discussed and unanimously adopted by the Joint Performance Audit Oversight Committee. These audits focused on the interplay between the Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the Bureau of Children's Behavioral Health, as well as a performance audit of the Doorways program.  
- **Consent Calendar**: The committee approved items on the consent calendar, with a few exceptions removed for further discussion. These included items related to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.  

### **Next Meeting**

The committee set the next meeting for Thursday, June 20th, at 10 AM, contingent on quorum availability.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, thanking attendees for their participation.
