**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (05/17/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on May 17, 2024, to address a wide range of fiscal and policy issues, with a particular focus on juvenile justice trends, program funding, and state service transitions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the meeting:

### **Juvenile Justice System Review**
1. **Trends in Juvenile Justice**: The committee examined recent trends in the juvenile justice system, noting a significant increase in the number of committed children (those placed in long-term facilities) compared to detained children (short-term stays) in 2023. Over 50% of cases now involve committed children, a stark contrast to earlier years, where the average was around 12, with flexibility to go up to 18.  
2. **Systemic Analysis and Diversion Strategies**: The committee is collaborating with stakeholders, including the courts, to understand the reasons behind the rise in commitments and explore alternative diversion strategies to reduce reliance on long-term placements.  
3. **Overall Trends**: While there has been a 50% decrease in the number of children entering the juvenile justice system over the past two years, the increase in commitments remains a concern.  
4. **Capacity Concerns**: Discussions highlighted potential capacity issues within the system, which has a range of 12 to 18 placements. The committee emphasized the need for timely communication with the legislature if adjustments are required.  

### **Fiscal and Program Updates**
1. **Minutes Approval**: The committee approved the minutes from the April 19th meeting.  
2. **Legislative Performance Audits**: Two audits were unanimously adopted by the Joint Performance Audit Oversight Committee, focusing on the interplay between the Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the Bureau of Children's Behavioral Health, as well as a performance audit of the Doorways program.  
3. **Consent Calendar**: Several items were approved on the consent calendar, with specific items removed for further discussion.  
4. **Newborn Navigator Program**: Representative F inquired about the Newborn Navigator program, which supports families with newborns through home visiting services. The program is funded by federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds but is not federally regulated.  
5. **Trails Accessibility**: Senator Rosemal raised concerns about the accessibility of new trails for people with disabilities, particularly those in wheelchairs. The Bureau of Trails explained that while many trails are accessible, not all can be due to terrain, but they prioritize accessibility where feasible.  
6. **Health and Human Services (HHS)**: Discussions included funding for homeless shelters, with a focus on increasing bed rates to prevent closures during the summer months. The committee also addressed the use of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for these services.  
7. **Port Authority**: The committee discussed the status of the Port Authority director, who is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The acting director provided updates on ongoing projects, including the dredging project.  
8. **Transition of Services**: The transition of services from Wellsense to Dartmouth Health was discussed, with assurances that staff pay and benefits would remain comparable.  
9. **YDC Replacement Center**: Concerns were raised about the capacity of the new Youth Development Center (YDC) replacement facility, with questions about whether it was undersized given current usage trends.  
10. **Informational Items**: The committee reviewed informational items, including statistics on the average daily census at the YDC, which showed periods of overcapacity.  

### **Meeting Logistics**
The committee addressed scheduling, moving their next meeting to Thursday, May 20, at 10 AM due to potential quorum issues. The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn.  

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted the committeeâ€™s focus on addressing systemic issues within the juvenile justice system, ensuring adequate funding for critical programs like homeless shelters and the Newborn Navigator program, and improving accessibility and capacity for state services. The discussions underscored the importance of collaboration with stakeholders, timely communication, and strategic use of federal and state funds to meet the needs of New Hampshire residents.
