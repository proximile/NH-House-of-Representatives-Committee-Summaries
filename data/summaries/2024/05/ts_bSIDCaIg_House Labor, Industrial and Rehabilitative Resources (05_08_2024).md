**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Resources Committee Meeting (05/08/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Resources Committee convened on May 8, 2024, to address critical labor and industrial issues, with a particular focus on the classification and treatment of student workers, especially Resident Assistants (RAs). The meeting explored the implications of these classifications for labor rights, minimum wage compliance, and broader labor policies, including unemployment benefits and remote work eligibility. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **1. Classification and Treatment of Student Workers (RAs)**
The central issue of the meeting was whether RAs and other student workers should be classified as employees. Currently, institutions vary in their approach: some classify RAs as student employees (temporary, part-time), while others do not consider them employees at all, compensating them with non-monetary benefits like room, board, or meal plans instead of wages. Notably, most institutions do not track the hours worked by RAs, raising concerns about minimum wage compliance and labor rights violations.

- **Federal vs. State Guidelines**: A discrepancy exists between federal (U.S. Department of Labor) and state (NHDOL) guidelines. Federal guidelines generally do not consider RAs in educational programs as employees if they receive non-monetary compensation, while state rules may differ. This creates potential conflicts, though no significant practical issues have been reported yet.
- **Universities’ Concerns**: Institutions like the University of New Hampshire (UNH) and Dartmouth expressed concerns about the administrative burden of tracking RA hours and ensuring compliance with minimum wage laws. They prefer compensating RAs with non-taxable benefits, aligning with federal guidelines but complicating state compliance.

### **2. Labor Rights and Minimum Wage Compliance**
The lack of time tracking for RAs makes it difficult to determine if they are earning minimum wage, a key issue highlighted in the discussion. There was a suggestion that institutions might seek waivers to avoid paying minimum wage, but this could lead to labor rights violations, as seen in past cases like Plymouth State University.

- **Waiver Process**: The NHDOL recently amended its administrative rules (Lab 805) to address concerns raised by universities. The rule change allows students in practical experience programs, such as RAs, to hold both unpaid or sub-minimum wage positions and regular paying jobs simultaneously. A waiver process was introduced to exempt institutions from paying minimum wage for such roles, but it does not automatically classify RAs as employees. The process is program-based rather than individual-based, reducing administrative burden but leaving questions about its practical implementation.
- **Labor Rights Concerns**: Some committee members opposed legislative changes that would remove labor protections from RAs, arguing that it could create a class of overworked workers without recourse. Others suggested that the recent rule changes might already address the issue, making legislative action unnecessary.

### **3. Interim Study and Legislative Proposals**
Given the complexity of the issue, the committee leaned toward further study rather than immediate legislative action. A proposal for an interim study was discussed to explore labor rights coverage for student workers, particularly RAs, and to assess the effectiveness of current administrative processes. This study would involve gathering more information and potentially recommending legislative changes in the future.

- **Legislative Proposal**: The bill under discussion would remove the employment definition from several sections of state law, potentially exempting RAs from certain labor protections. However, concerns were raised about unintended consequences, the removal of employee rights, and the lack of input from all affected colleges and universities in the state.

### **4. Broader Labor Issues**
The meeting also touched on broader labor issues, including unemployment benefits and remote work eligibility.

- **Unemployment Benefits**: The Senate and House versions of a bill to increase unemployment benefits were compared, with the House version proposing a larger increase but phased over three years. The impact of proposed legislative changes on employer tax rates and fund balances was also discussed.
- **Remote Work Eligibility**: Concerns were raised about the eligibility for unemployment benefits when individuals limit their job search to remote work, especially in industries where remote work is not prevalent. The department was granted rulemaking authority to define when remote work searches are reasonable.

### **5. Need for Further Study and Careful Consideration**
The committee emphasized the importance of understanding the current landscape and allowing the waiver process to play out before making changes to the law. The complexity of aligning federal and state labor laws, coupled with the potential for unintended consequences, highlighted the need for careful consideration and further study.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of labor classifications for student workers, particularly RAs, and the need for clearer labor rights protections. The discussions highlighted the challenges of balancing the needs of universities to manage RA programs efficiently with the rights and protections of RAs as potential employees. The committee’s focus on further study and cautious approach to legislative changes reflects a commitment to ensuring fair labor practices while addressing the practical concerns of institutions.
