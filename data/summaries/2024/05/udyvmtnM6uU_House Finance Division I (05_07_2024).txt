**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Finance Division I Meeting (May 7, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Finance Division I meeting on May 7, 2024, addressed a range of critical issues, including municipal investment policies, infrastructure funding, water projects, and public investment strategies. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing financial safety, flexibility, and returns while addressing pressing state needs.

### **Municipal Investment Policies and Public Deposit Investment Pool**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on bills related to municipal investment policies, particularly the state’s pooled investment program. Key points included:

1. **Safety and Revenue Goals**: Members emphasized the importance of prioritizing safety in investments while ensuring good returns and maximizing tax revenue impacts. Suggestions were made to set investment targets rather than rigid floors, allowing for greater flexibility.

2. **Advisory Committee Dynamics**: The Treasurer noted that while discussions had become contentious, the advisory committee overseeing the fund generally collaborates effectively. Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Bankers Association and pool participants, sought compromises to address concerns.

3. **Investment Security and Insurance**: Concerns were raised about the bill’s language regarding "insured or collateralized" investments. Members debated the limitations of FDIC insurance and the use of alternative collateral forms, such as U.S. Treasuries, as well as the associated costs and impact on interest rates.

4. **Interim Study Proposal**: Representative McGuire proposed an interim study to further examine the bill, citing conflicting stakeholder feedback. Some members expressed concerns about encouraging investments in private companies without sufficient safeguards, while others highlighted the existing flexibility for towns to choose between the pooled investment program and banks.

5. **Public Deposit Investment Pool (Senate Bill 553)**: The original bill required 100% of funds in the Public Deposit Investment Pool (PDIP) to be invested in New Hampshire-based financial institutions. An amendment scaled this back to a goal of 30% investment in local institutions while maintaining safety and flexibility. State Treasurer Monica Meepil cautioned against limiting investment options, which could reduce returns and drive municipalities to private firms. The committee continued discussions on balancing local investment goals with the pool’s financial stability.

6. **Delay in Voting**: The committee delayed voting on the bill to allow for further discussion and potential agreement on amendments, reflecting the high level of interest and concern on both sides of the issue.

### **Infrastructure Funding**
The meeting also addressed infrastructure funding, with debates centering on state versus developer responsibility, particularly in failed development projects:

1. **Senate Bill 347: Infrastructure Appropriations for Reimbursement to the City of Lonia**: The bill proposed $3 million for infrastructure reimbursements related to a property in Lonia intended for affordable housing. However, the sale of the property fell through, raising questions about the necessity of the funding. Representatives debated whether the state should cover infrastructure costs typically borne by developers. The committee voted 7-0 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), effectively killing it.

### **Water Projects**
Significant attention was given to regional drinking water infrastructure, with an emphasis on engineering and federal funding:

1. **Senate Bill 393: Appropriation for Regional Drinking Water Infrastructure**: The bill sought a $25 million general fund appropriation for regional drinking water projects. An amendment by Representative Sweeney reduced this to $2 million, leveraging federal funds and the state’s trust fund for water projects. Senator Chuck Morris highlighted ongoing water projects in Southern New Hampshire, stressing the need for engineering and infrastructure improvements to support housing and economic development. The Department of Environmental Services supported the projects but did not take a position on the funding. The committee unanimously passed the amended bill.

### **Other Key Bills**
The meeting also addressed several other bills, blurring the lines between policy decisions and financial considerations:

1. **Senate Bill 453: Appropriation for the Statewide Voter Registration System**: The bill proposed funding for the statewide voter registration system. While deemed a worthwhile initiative, some members questioned its priority given budget constraints. The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill.

2. **Senate Bill 604: Death Benefits for Security Officers**: The bill aimed to extend death benefits to security officers, including a $100,000 benefit for families of officers who die in the line of duty. It also addressed eligibility for suicide-related deaths, limiting benefits to full-time officers. The amendment was seen as a way to provide benefits to the Hos family while creating a broader policy for future cases. The committee unanimously passed the bill with the amendment.

### **Key Themes**
- **Infrastructure Funding**: Debates centered on state versus developer responsibility for infrastructure costs, particularly in failed development projects.
- **Water Projects**: Significant focus was placed on regional water infrastructure, with an emphasis on engineering and leveraging federal funding.
- **Investment Policies**: Discussions highlighted the tension between local investment goals and maintaining the financial stability and returns of public investment pools.
- **Policy vs. Finance**: Several bills blurred the lines between policy decisions and financial considerations, leading to debates about committee jurisdiction and the appropriateness of certain funding mechanisms.

Overall, the meeting underscored the challenges of balancing financial prudence, policy objectives, and stakeholder interests in addressing the state’s most pressing needs.
