The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy meeting on May 16, 2024, provided a comprehensive examination of the state's pandemic response, with a particular focus on the efficacy, safety, and ethical implications of COVID-19 vaccines. The meeting, led by a bipartisan committee, included expert testimonies and discussions that highlighted key concerns about vaccine development, regulatory oversight, public health policies, and individual rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and findings from the meeting:

### **1. Vaccine Development and Efficacy**
- **mRNA Vaccine Technology**: The development of mRNA vaccines, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, was rooted in decades of research, accelerated by the availability of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. However, the rapid development and emergency use authorization (EUA) raised concerns about the robustness of long-term safety data.
- **Clinical Trials**: While clinical trials involved 30,000 to 40,000 participants, the placebo control group was vaccinated shortly after EUA, limiting the ability to assess long-term safety. Efficacy was primarily measured by symptom reduction rather than mortality or serious harm.
- **Efficacy and Transmission**: Studies indicated that vaccinated individuals could still contract and transmit COVID-19, challenging the rationale for vaccine mandates. Concerns were raised about the vaccines' ability to prevent transmission, despite public health claims to the contrary.

### **2. Vaccine Safety and Adverse Events**
- **Adverse Events**: Reports of adverse events, including cardiovascular issues and deaths, were highlighted. In Pfizer’s trial, more cardiovascular deaths occurred in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and v-safe system were criticized for underreporting and failing to capture delayed adverse reactions.
- **Case Studies**: Specific cases, such as Maddie Deary, a young participant in a Pfizer trial who suffered severe neurological effects, were cited as examples of inadequate responses to adverse events by pharmaceutical companies and regulators.
- **Transparency Concerns**: The CDC and FDA were accused of withholding or downplaying adverse event data, with lawsuits necessary to obtain critical information. The shift from Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) to Empirical Bayesian (EB) methods for safety signal detection was questioned.

### **3. Regulatory Oversight and Liability**
- **Legal Immunity**: The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 and the PREP Act provide vaccine manufacturers with immunity from liability for injuries caused by vaccines. This lack of accountability was criticized as creating a "moral hazard," potentially compromising the thoroughness of clinical trials and safety monitoring.
- **FDA and Industry Practices**: The FDA was accused of allowing pharmaceutical companies to influence the assessment of adverse events and failing to respond substantively to safety concerns. Conflicts of interest within FDA advisory committees, with ties to the pharmaceutical industry, were also highlighted.

### **4. Ethical and Legal Issues**
- **Informed Consent**: Concerns were raised about the lack of informed consent during mass vaccination events, with pediatricians sometimes failing to provide Vaccine Information Sheets (VIS) as required by law. Mandates were criticized as coercive and infringing on individual rights.
- **Religious and Medical Exemptions**: The importance of protecting religious and medical exemptions was emphasized, with references to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which requires employers to accommodate religious beliefs. Legal cases involving healthcare workers fired for refusing vaccines on religious grounds were discussed.
- **Aborted Fetal Cells**: Ethical concerns were raised about the use of aborted fetal cell lines in vaccine development and testing, particularly among religious groups. While mRNA vaccines do not contain these cell lines, fetal cells were used in their development.

### **5. Public Health Policies and Mandates**
- **Mandate Criticisms**: Vaccine mandates and restrictions (e.g., mask mandates, military dismissals) were criticized for infringing on civil liberties without a clear public health imperative, especially given evidence that vaccines do not stop transmission.
- **Historical Context**: Historical data on diseases like measles and pertussis were discussed, noting that mortality rates had declined significantly before vaccines were introduced. Questions were raised about whether the benefits of vaccines outweigh potential long-term health risks, such as increased rates of chronic diseases.
- **Future Implications**: The meeting warned against expanding vaccine mandates and adding more products to the vaccine schedule without proper scrutiny or consent. The potential for annual COVID-19 vaccines, similar to flu shots, was also discussed.

### **6. Transparency and Accountability**
- **Data Suppression**: Concerns were expressed about the suppression of unfavorable data and the lack of transparency in vaccine-related information held by regulatory agencies and insurance companies.
- **Legal Challenges**: Ongoing lawsuits challenging vaccine injury compensation programs and the constitutionality of mandates were highlighted, with calls for greater accountability and due process.

### **7. Balancing Public Health and Individual Rights**
- **Civil Liberties**: The meeting emphasized the importance of protecting civil liberties, arguing that mandates set a dangerous precedent for government overreach. The tension between public health needs and individual freedoms was a recurring theme.
- **Informed Choice**: Advocates called for informed parental and individual choice in medical decisions, arguing that no government should mandate vaccines without conclusive evidence of their safety and efficacy.

### **Conclusion**
The NH House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy meeting underscored the complexity of vaccine development, the challenges of regulatory oversight, and the ethical dilemmas surrounding mandates and individual rights. The discussions highlighted the need for greater transparency, rigorous safety assessments, and a balanced approach that respects both public health and individual freedoms. The committee’s findings reflect a deep skepticism of current vaccine policies and a call for more accountability and informed decision-making in future public health responses.
