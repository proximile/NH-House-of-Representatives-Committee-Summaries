The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee held an executive session on **SB 585** on May 7, 2024. The session focused on an amendment to the bill, **Amendment 2024-1796H**, which addresses the application of property liens for unpaid meals and rooms taxes. Representatives **Ames** and **Spilsbury** worked on the amendment to clarify who would be subject to such liens, moving away from the vague concept of "managerial capacity" to focus on individuals with **actual or constructive managerial or custodial responsibility** for tax collection and transmission. The amendment ensures that **passive owners** (e.g., those with mere ownership interests) and **hired employees without financial responsibility** are not subject to liens.

Key points from the discussion:
1. **Clarification of Responsibility**: The amendment specifies that only those directly responsible for tax collection and transmission can be subject to liens, excluding passive owners and frontline employees.
2. **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) Authority**: The DRA is granted rule-making authority to further define criteria for determining responsibility.
3. **Support for the Amendment**: Both the DRA and the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association expressed support for the amended language, noting it addresses their concerns.
4. **Unanimous Vote**: The committee voted **17-0** in favor of the amendment and the bill, with no objections. The bill will proceed to the consent calendar.

The session concluded with updates on other Senate bills and plans for future committee work, including updates from the DRA.
