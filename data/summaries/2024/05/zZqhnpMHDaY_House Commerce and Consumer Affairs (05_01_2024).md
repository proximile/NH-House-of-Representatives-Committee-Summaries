#### **Senate Bill 366: Land Purchases Near Military Bases**
- **Sponsor**: Senator Regina Birdsell (District 19).  
- **Purpose**: To ban the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from purchasing land near military bases, National Guard facilities, or critical infrastructure in New Hampshire. This bill responds to national security concerns, particularly following a case in North Dakota where a Chinese company purchased land near Grand Forks Air Force Base.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - The bill is bipartisan and passed the Senate unanimously.  
  - Critics argue it is overly broad, potentially banning Chinese nationals from purchasing any land within 10 miles of infrastructure, raising concerns about discrimination and enforcement challenges.  
  - The New Hampshire Farm Bureau opposes the bill, citing its potential negative impact on agricultural research and land use.

#### **Senate Bill 423: Auto Insurance Policy Limits Disclosure**
- **Sponsor**: Senator Sharon Carson (District 14).  
- **Purpose**: To mandate the disclosure of insurance policy limits in motor vehicle accidents, enabling injured parties to know the coverage available without filing a lawsuit.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - **Support**: Proponents argue it promotes transparency, reduces litigation, and expedites settlements, especially for underinsured motorist claims.  
  - **Opposition**: Insurers and independent agents oppose the bill, citing concerns about privacy violations, "fishing expeditions" by attorneys, and potential misuse of policy limits to inflate claims.  
  - The NH Insurance Department opposes the bill, stating the current system already ensures fair settlements.  
  - The debate centered on balancing consumer rights with the risk of increased litigation and insurance costs.

#### **Senate Bill 556: Payment Parity for Nurse Practitioners**
- **Purpose**: To ensure nurse practitioners (NPs) are reimbursed equally for the same services as physicians, addressing a nationwide primary care provider shortage.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - **Support**: NPs argue they provide the same level of care as physicians and deserve equal reimbursement, particularly in underserved areas.  
  - **Amendments**: The bill was revised to clarify that licensure alone cannot be the sole factor in determining reimbursement rates, allowing for negotiated rates based on experience, geographic location, and other factors.  
  - **Opposition**: Insurers initially opposed full payment parity but supported the amended version.  
  - Testimonies highlighted the financial challenges NPs face due to lower reimbursement rates, emphasizing the need for fair compensation to sustain their practices.

#### **Senate Bill 558: Insurance Coverage for Fertility Treatments**
- **Sponsor**: Senator Rebecca Perkins Kwoka.  
- **Purpose**: To expand insurance coverage for infertility treatments, including intrauterine insemination (IUI), and provide protections against discrimination during IVF treatments, parental leave, and adoption.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - **Support**: Advocates argue that same-sex couples and single women face significant financial and logistical barriers to accessing fertility treatments, as insurance often does not cover these procedures unless infertility is diagnosed.  
  - **Coverage Details**: The bill would cover up to six cycles of IUI, which is now deemed medically necessary by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.  
  - **Cost Concerns**: The fiscal impact is estimated to be minimal (5 cents per member per month), but stakeholders expressed concerns about bypassing medical necessity and potential long-term cost increases.  
  - **Personal Testimonies**: Individuals shared the emotional and financial toll of fertility treatments, emphasizing the need for equitable access to family-building resources.
