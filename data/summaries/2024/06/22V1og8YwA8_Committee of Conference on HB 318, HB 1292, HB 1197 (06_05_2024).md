**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference on HB 318, HB 1292, and HB 1197 (06/05/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference, chaired by Representative Terry Roy, convened to discuss and reconcile differences in several key bills: **HB 318**, **HB 1292**, and **HB 1197**. The meeting highlighted a collaborative effort between the House and Senate to address complex issues ranging from criminal justice reform to immigration policies and healthcare mandates. Below is a detailed summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Discussions and Agreements**

#### **HB 318: Criminal Justice and Bail Reform**
1. **Funding for Bail Tracking System**:  
   - The committee revisited the allocation of $1.6â€“1.7 million for a bail tracking system, which had initially been removed. A compromise was reached to include contingency language ensuring funding through either the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) or the general fund.

2. **Standards for Holding Individuals**:  
   - The Senate had proposed lowering the standard for holding someone from "clear and convincing evidence" to "preponderance of the evidence." The committee agreed to maintain the higher standard for dangerous individuals but apply the lower standard for flight risks.

3. **Victim Notification**:  
   - Language requiring police to notify victims when an offender is released on bail, particularly in cases of violent crimes, was reinstated. The committee settled on a "reasonable effort" standard rather than imposing a strict timeframe.

4. **Number of Magistrates**:  
   - The House initially requested 15 magistrates, which was reduced to 3. The final agreement authorized 3 magistrates but allowed for a request of up to 5 through the fiscal committee.

5. **Indigency and Cash Bail**:  
   - The committee emphasized protecting indigent individuals from being held solely due to an inability to afford bail. Language was included to ensure cash bail is set at an amount the defendant can meet, aligning with the original intent of bail reform.

6. **Effective Dates**:  
   - Provisions such as victim notifications were set to take effect in July 2024, while others requiring judicial training and form changes were delayed until January 2025.

#### **HB 1292: Sanctuary Cities and Immigration Policies**
1. **Concerns About Sanctuary Policies**:  
   - Senators expressed strong concerns about sanctuary policies, citing examples from Massachusetts, which spends nearly a billion dollars annually on housing and caring for migrants. They argued that such policies incentivize illegal immigration, increase risks of drug trafficking, human trafficking, and potential security threats, including individuals on terror watch lists entering the state.

2. **Preventing Sanctuary Policies in New Hampshire**:  
   - The Senate supported a bill to prohibit sanctuary policies in New Hampshire, emphasizing the financial and security implications observed in other states. They also highlighted the allocation of $1.4 million to assist local law enforcement on the northern border, which is described as remote and easily accessible from Canada.

3. **Opposition from Law Enforcement and Immigrant Rights Groups**:  
   - Opponents, including law enforcement leaders from Manchester and immigrant rights groups, argued that the bill would harm community relations and undermine progress in integrating immigrant populations. They noted that current policies already ensure cooperation with federal immigration enforcement when individuals are arrested for crimes.

4. **Racial Profiling and Due Process Concerns**:  
   - Critics raised concerns about the potential for racial profiling and due process violations if the bill were implemented. They argued that the state should not enforce civil immigration detainers unless individuals are arrested for violations of New Hampshire law.

#### **HB 1197: Insurance Coverage for Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)**
1. **Medical Necessity Debate**:  
   - The committee discussed amendments to HB 1197, which mandates insurance coverage for intrauterine insemination (IUI). A key point of contention was whether the procedure should be labeled as a "medical necessity."

2. **Final Agreement**:  
   - The "medical necessity" language was removed, ensuring that all women have access to the procedure without restrictions based on specific groups. The amendment also clarified cost-sharing provisions, such as deductibles and copays.

### **Next Steps**
The committee recessed with an agreement in principle on most issues. They planned to reconvene the following day to finalize the language of the amended bills and sign off on the agreements. The session underscored the importance of collaboration between the House and Senate, with both sides acknowledging the extensive work invested in the legislation over several years.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Collaboration and Compromise**: The meeting highlighted the willingness of both the House and Senate to work together and find common ground on contentious issues.
- **Balancing Security and Community Relations**: Discussions on sanctuary policies reflected the tension between addressing security concerns and maintaining trust within immigrant communities.
- **Protecting Vulnerable Populations**: Provisions in HB 318 emphasized protecting indigent individuals and ensuring victim notifications, while HB 1197 focused on expanding access to reproductive healthcare.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Funding discussions, particularly for the bail tracking system and northern border enforcement, underscored the need to balance fiscal constraints with policy priorities.

The Committee of Conference demonstrated a commitment to addressing complex legislative issues while striving to balance competing interests and priorities.
