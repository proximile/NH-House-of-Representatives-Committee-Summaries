**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference on HB 318, HB 1292, HB 1197 (06/05/2024)**

On June 5, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference convened to discuss and reconcile key aspects of several bills, including **HB 318**, **HB 1292**, and **HB 1197**. The meeting focused on clarifying language, addressing funding mechanisms, and resolving contentious issues related to medical necessity, bail reform, sanctuary cities, and insurance coverage.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes:**

1. **HB 318 (Bail and Pretrial System)**:
   - **Funding for Bail Tracking System**: The committee agreed to allocate $1.6–$1.7 million for a bail tracking system, with costs split between courts and law enforcement. Contingency language was included to ensure funding through either the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) or the general fund.
   - **Evidentiary Standards**: The committee settled on a **preponderance of evidence** standard for determining flight risk and a **clear and convincing evidence** standard for assessing danger to the community.
   - **Victim Notification**: Provisions were finalized to require law enforcement to make reasonable efforts to notify victims of violent crimes when an assailant is released on bail.

2. **Magistrates and Judicial Resources**:
   - Concerns about the number of magistrates were addressed, with the committee authorizing **three magistrates** initially. The fiscal committee was granted the option to approve up to **five magistrates** in the next budget year to meet judicial needs.

3. **HB 1292 (Sanctuary Cities)**:
   - The Senate had added language from **SB 563**, which prohibits sanctuary cities, to HB 1292. The House had previously tabled this bill, and the committee revisited the issue amid significant debate.
   - **Opposition**: Law enforcement officials and immigrant rights groups opposed the bill, citing concerns about strained community relations and the potential negative impact on immigrant communities.
   - **Outcome**: The committee did not reach an agreement and recessed to reconvene the following day to continue discussions.

4. **HB 1197 (Uterine Insemination Coverage)**:
   - The bill mandates insurance coverage for uterine insemination. The committee debated whether to classify the procedure as a **medical necessity** or as a benefit available to all women.
   - **Language Clarification**: To streamline the mandate and avoid redundancy, the committee agreed to remove specific language (starting from line 28 on page 11) that referenced medical necessity. This change ensures the procedure is covered without restrictions.
   - **Deductibles and Copays**: Discussions also touched on the implications for deductibles and copays, with agreement that the revised language would be acceptable on the House floor.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting concluded with gratitude for the collaborative efforts and approval of the proposed changes to HB 318 and HB 1197. However, discussions on HB 1292 remained unresolved, and the committee planned to reconvene the next day to finalize agreements on this and other pending issues. The session highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing clarity, fairness, and practicality in legislative language while addressing complex and often contentious policy matters.
