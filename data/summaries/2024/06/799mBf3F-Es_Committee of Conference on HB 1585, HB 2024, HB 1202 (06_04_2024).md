The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference meeting on June 4, 2024, addressed several key bills: **HB 1585**, **HB 2024**, and **HB 1202**. Here’s a summary of the discussions:

### **HB 1585**
- The focus was on clarifying the definition of **non-injectable medication administration** in the Senate version of the bill. Representatives debated whether the Senate's more restrictive language was preferable, with some agreeing to adopt it to move the legislation forward.
- The main sticking point was the **$300,000 appropriation** for a nursing program. While the House had previously rejected this funding, some representatives expressed support for it, emphasizing the importance of addressing the nursing shortage, especially in underserved areas. The Senate insisted on keeping the $300,000, and the House ultimately conceded, agreeing to roll the dice on its passage in the full House.

### **HB 2024**
- The discussion centered on the **transfer of Continental Boulevard in Merrimack** from state to town control. The House initially supported the transfer, while the Senate opposed it, arguing that the road serves a broader population and should remain a state responsibility.
- A **compromise** was proposed by Senate President Bradley: the state would maintain the road for **five years** (until July 1, 2029), after which it would be reclassified as a Class 5 highway under town control. This compromise aimed to avoid an impasse over the 10-year highway plan. The House agreed to this amendment, which also included other provisions like a **45 mph speed limit** and capital appropriations for the **New Hampshire State Prison**.

### **HB 1202**
- This bill, originally focused on streamlining **driveway permits** to aid housing development, was amended by the Senate to include provisions for **child care scholarships for at-risk children**. The Senate argued that early intervention for children showing developmental delays is crucial and that expanding the definition of disability in the scholarship program would benefit both children and child care providers.
- The House concurred with the Senate’s amendment, noting that the estimated cost of **less than $400,000** was manageable and that the program could be funded through discretionary federal funds under ARPA.

### **Key Outcomes**
- **HB 1585**: The House agreed to adopt the Senate’s language on non-injectable medication and retain the $300,000 appropriation for nursing, despite concerns about its passage in the full House.
- **HB 2024**: The House accepted the Senate’s compromise on Continental Boulevard, agreeing to a five-year state maintenance period before transferring control to Merrimack.
- **HB 1202**: The House concurred with the Senate’s amendment to include child care scholarships for at-risk children, recognizing the importance of early intervention and the manageable cost of the program.

The meeting concluded with agreements on all three bills, with sign-offs tentatively scheduled for Thursday.
