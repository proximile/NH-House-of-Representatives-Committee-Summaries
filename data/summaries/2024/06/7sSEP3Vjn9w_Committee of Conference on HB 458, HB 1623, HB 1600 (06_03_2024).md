The transcript from the NH House of Representatives meeting on June 3, 2024, details discussions and decisions made during a Committee of Conference on three bills: **HB 458**, **HB 1623**, and **HB 1600**. Here’s a summary:

### **HB 458**  
- The bill originally aimed to reestablish a commission to study power generation assessment.  
- The Senate amended the bill to address issues with multiple assessment points for power generators, which caused confusion and lawsuits.  
- The House proposed a slight amendment to the Senate’s language, changing "recommend a solution" to "create recommendations" to allow the commission to analyze various methodologies for a single assessment point.  
- Both the House and Senate agreed to this change, and the bill was finalized.  

### **HB 1623**  
- The Senate removed significant portions of the original bill, including language related to New Hampshire’s energy policy and changes to RSA 378:37.  
- The House proposed adding language emphasizing energy reliability, affordability, and price stability, citing constituent concerns about power outages and costs.  
- The Senate rejected the House’s amendment, stating the existing bill language was sufficient and that the proposed changes were too vague.  
- The House ultimately agreed to accept the Senate’s version of the bill, acknowledging the importance of the lawfare provisions in the bill.  

### **HB 1600**  
- The original House bill allowed municipal hosts to participate in community aggregation programs.  
- The Senate amended the bill to remove this provision and instead proposed a study committee to examine legislative options for aggregation regulation.  
- The House initially supported the original bill but acknowledged concerns raised by the Department of Energy about potential unintended consequences.  
- After discussion, the House agreed to accept the Senate’s amendment, preserving only the technical housekeeping changes (Section 2) from the original bill.  

### Key Themes:  
- **Power Generation Assessment (HB 458):** Streamlining assessment processes to reduce confusion and lawsuits.  
- **Energy Policy (HB 1623):** Balancing reliability, affordability, and price stability in energy policy.  
- **Community Aggregation (HB 1600):** Addressing concerns about municipal participation in aggregation programs and opting for further study.  

The meeting concluded with agreements on all three bills, reflecting compromises between the House and Senate positions.
