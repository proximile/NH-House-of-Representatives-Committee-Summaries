The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on three bills: **HB 1195**, **HB 1695**, and **HB 1278**. Here's a summary of the discussions:

### **HB 1195: Apportionment Methods for School Administrative Unit Costs**
- **Issue**: The bill addresses how costs are apportioned among school districts within a School Administrative Unit (SAU). The House and Senate versions differ in how voting is conducted for apportionment changes.
- **Key Debate**: The Senate version allows cumulative voting across the entire SAU, potentially enabling larger districts to dominate decisions. The House version requires a majority affirmative vote in each district, ensuring smaller districts have a say.
- **Outcome**: The committee agreed to adopt the Senate version with an amendment requiring a majority affirmative vote in each district for apportionment changes.

### **HB 1695: Release of Student Personally Identifiable Information**
- **Issue**: The bill mandates that parents be informed before their child's data is released to a third party. The House and Senate versions differ on the timing of notification ("within 14 school days" vs. "14 school days before").
- **Key Debate**: The Senate version emphasizes notifying parents **before** data release to allow time for objections, while the House version could allow notification **after** release.
- **Outcome**: The committee agreed to the Senate version with an amendment changing "was" to "is" and reducing the notification period to **at least 7 school days before** release.

### **HB 1278: Therapeutic Cannabis and School Nutrition Programs**
- **Issue**: The bill aims to streamline therapeutic cannabis certifications and includes provisions from **SB 499** (Feed Our Kids) related to school nutrition programs and emergency funding for towns.
- **Key Debate**: The Senate added a third section to the bill expanding school nutrition programs, which the House had not supported. The House questioned whether the Senate would drop this section if **SB 499** passes.
- **Outcome**: The committee recessed to reconvene the next day after further discussions on **SB 499**, as the Senate wanted to consider all provisions together.

The meeting highlighted the need for compromise on voting mechanisms, parental notification, and school nutrition funding, with further discussions scheduled for the next day.
