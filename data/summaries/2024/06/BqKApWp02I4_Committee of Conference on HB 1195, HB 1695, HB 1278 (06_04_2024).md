The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on June 4, 2024, focused on three bills: **HB 1195**, **HB 1695**, and **HB 1278**, with detailed discussions and negotiations among representatives and senators.

1. **HB 1195 (Apportionment Methods for School Administrative Unit Costs)**:
   - The committee discussed differences between the House and Senate versions, particularly how voting on apportionment methods would work within School Administrative Units (SAUs). The Senate version allowed cumulative voting across districts, which raised concerns about larger districts overpowering smaller ones. The House version required a majority affirmative vote in each district to adopt any apportionment change, ensuring smaller districts' voices were heard. After debate, the committee agreed to a compromise: the Senate version would be amended to require majority approval in each district, addressing the issue of disproportionate influence by larger districts.

2. **HB 1695 (Release of Student Personally Identifiable Information)**:
   - The debate centered on whether parents should be notified **within** 14 school days or **before** 14 school days of the release of student data to third parties. The House version used "within," while the Senate version used "before," which was seen as more definitive. Concerns were raised about the redundancy of the bill, as existing laws already addressed student privacy. The committee ultimately agreed to the Senate version, with a minor amendment to clarify the language and ensure parents are notified **at least seven school days before** the data release.

3. **HB 1278 (Therapeutic Cannabis and School Nutrition Programs)**:
   - This bill aimed to expand therapeutic cannabis certifications and included provisions from the "Feed Our Kids" initiative. The Senate added a third section related to school food and nutrition programs, which the House had not previously supported. The committee debated whether to retain this section, especially given ongoing discussions on **SB 499**, which also addressed disaster relief and school nutrition. The committee decided to recess and reconvene the next day to align HB 1278 with the outcomes of SB 499, aiming for a compromise that addresses both disaster relief and school nutrition.

Overall, the meeting highlighted efforts to reconcile differences between House and Senate versions of the bills, with a focus on protecting smaller districts' interests, ensuring parent notification for student data release, and addressing school nutrition and disaster relief.
