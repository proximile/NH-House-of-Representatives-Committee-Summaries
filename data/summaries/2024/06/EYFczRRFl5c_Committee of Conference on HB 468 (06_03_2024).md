The transcript from the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference on **HB 468** (June 3, 2024) centers on a debate over proposed changes to education laws, specifically the recodification of Title 15. The original House bill aimed to allocate $100,000 to hire expert lawyers to identify and resolve contradictions in education statutes, focusing on minor fixes rather than a full overhaul. However, the Senate version expanded the scope, making the commission permanent and adding provisions that some House members criticized as overly broad and poorly defined, particularly the ability to add individuals to an advisory panel without clear criteria.

Key points of contention include:

1. **Scope of Work**: House members argued the Senate version unnecessarily expanded the project from minor fixes to a full recodification of education laws, which they deemed excessive and politically driven.
2. **Advisory Panel**: House representatives criticized the Senate’s inclusion of an advisory panel with vague language about who could be added, calling it "not good law."
3. **Role of OS (Office of Legislative Services)**: House members emphasized that recodification falls under OS's purview, not the Department of Education, and expressed concern that the Senate version blurred these responsibilities.
4. **Process and Timeline**: The Senate version included a prospective repeal in 2026, giving the commission two years to complete its work. House members questioned the feasibility and necessity of such a lengthy process.
5. **Political vs. Practical Approach**: House members favored a streamlined approach where a single lawyer would identify conflicts and propose fixes, with minimal back-and-forth, while the Senate version involved more extensive committee involvement.

The discussion revealed a stark divide between the House and Senate visions for the bill. House members argued the Senate version was overly complex and political, while Senate representatives defended it as necessary for comprehensive reform. Ultimately, the House representatives indicated they would not agree to the Senate’s version, leading to an impasse and the likely death of the bill. The meeting ended with frustration and a lack of resolution, highlighting the challenges of reconciling differing legislative approaches.
