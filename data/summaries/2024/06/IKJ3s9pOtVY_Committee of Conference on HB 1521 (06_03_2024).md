The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference met to discuss **House Bill 1521**, focusing on the distribution and regulation of recovery houses across the state. The key points of debate included:

1. **Recovery House Limitations**: The House proposed an amendment to limit the number of recovery beds in certain municipalities, particularly in **Manchester and Nashua**, which currently host a disproportionate share of recovery facilities (approximately 1,000 beds combined, compared to 300 in the rest of the state). Proponents argued that this would distribute the burden more evenly across the state, while opponents claimed it would hinder access for those without transportation in rural areas.

2. **Location and Accessibility**: Recovery houses need to be in walkable, urban areas with access to jobs and public transportation. Critics argued that placing recovery houses in rural areas without such infrastructure would set the program up for failure.

3. **Impact on Communities**: Manchester and Nashua have faced significant quality-of-life challenges due to the concentration of recovery houses. Some representatives emphasized the need for other municipalities to step up and share the responsibility.

4. **Zoning Issues**: The bill aimed to ease zoning restrictions to encourage the establishment of recovery houses in other municipalities. However, concerns were raised that capping the number of beds and requiring legislative approval could create unnecessary barriers.

5. **Potential Compromise**: While some members expressed openness to compromise on the bed limits or zoning requirements, others remained firm in their positions. The House and Senate representatives ultimately failed to reach an agreement, with the House position being that the proposed limits were intolerable and would lead to unregulated recovery homes.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgment that the issue would likely be revisited in the future, as no consensus was reached.
