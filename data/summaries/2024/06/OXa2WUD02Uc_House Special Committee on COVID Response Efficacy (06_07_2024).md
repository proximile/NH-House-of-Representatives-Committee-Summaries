**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (June 7, 2024)**

On June 7, 2024, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened to evaluate the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This bipartisan committee, tasked with conducting a science-based, fact-finding review, focused on various aspects of the state’s handling of the crisis, including federal guidance, funding, emergency use authorizations, vaccination efforts, and broader policy impacts. The committee’s work aims to inform future public health emergency preparedness and response. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and findings from the meeting:

### **Operational Framework and Unified Command Structure**
Rob Buckton, Director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management for New Hampshire, provided testimony emphasizing the state’s operational approach during the pandemic. The unified command structure, which included the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Homeland Security, and the National Guard, was instrumental in managing the crisis. This structure, aligned with the National Incident Management System (NIMS), allowed for coordinated decision-making under the governor’s emergency powers, as outlined in RSA 21-P. The state’s emergency operations plan, last updated in 2019 and currently under review, was designed to be flexible and adaptable to various disasters, including pandemics.

### **Federal Assistance and Funding**
The committee discussed the significant financial assistance provided by the federal government, including programs like the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the Public Assistance Program, which offered 100% reimbursement for eligible COVID-19-related expenses. Funds flowed from the federal government to the state, which then distributed them to hospitals, EMS, fire departments, and other local entities. The committee acknowledged the logistical success of resource distribution but noted the challenges of managing project approvals and paperwork.

### **After-Action Reviews**
New Hampshire is conducting a comprehensive after-action review of its COVID-19 response, led by a contracted company, Title Basin. This review, expected by the end of June 2024, will assess areas such as preparedness, command, communication, financial management, and public-private partnerships. The federal government is also conducting its own after-action review, with states providing feedback to improve future public assistance programs. The committee expressed interest in comparing New Hampshire’s response with other states to identify strengths and weaknesses.

### **Policy Evaluation and Lessons Learned**
The committee debated the scope of its inquiry, with some members advocating for a focus on specific issues like internal decision-making processes or vaccination of control groups in clinical trials, while others emphasized the need for a broader evaluation of policies and their impacts. Key concerns included the accuracy of pandemic advice, the effectiveness of masking and mandates, and the broader societal harms caused by policies, such as educational setbacks, business closures, and increased suicide rates. The committee highlighted New Hampshire’s achievement of the second-lowest COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 in the country, second only to Hawaii, as a notable success.

### **Communication and Misinformation**
Challenges in managing information and misinformation during the pandemic were a significant focus. The state worked closely with federal agencies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to ensure accurate information dissemination. The Joint Information Center (JIC) played a critical role in coordinating messaging, and the state’s emphasis on local control allowed municipalities to make decisions based on state-provided information. However, policy implementation at the local level was sometimes contentious.

### **Staffing and Future Preparedness**
The committee noted significant turnover in the Homeland Security and Emergency Management department post-pandemic, with 75% of staff being new within the last three years. This turnover, attributed to retirements, career changes, and opportunities in federal agencies like FEMA, underscores the need for ongoing training and exercises to ensure the state remains prepared for future emergencies. The committee emphasized the importance of integrating new science and technology into emergency management plans.

### **Financial Impact**
Over $300 million in public assistance has been allocated for COVID-19 response in New Hampshire, with $8 million distributed in a single month for various disaster recovery projects. The committee stressed the need for continued financial oversight and transparency.

### **Next Steps and Future Meetings**
The committee plans to reconvene in the fall to continue its work, with a target to finalize recommendations by early November 2024. Key next steps include seeking clarification on the committee’s scope from the House Speaker, refining requests for information from federal agencies, and reviewing the Title Basin after-action report. The committee also aims to develop mechanisms for better evaluating federal guidance and policies in future emergencies, ensuring the state can make informed, science-based decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of New Hampshire’s pandemic response, the importance of comprehensive reviews, and the need for continuous improvement in emergency management practices. The committee’s work will inform future preparedness efforts, ensuring the state is better equipped to handle public health crises while minimizing societal and economic impacts.
