**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (06/07/2024)**

On June 7, 2024, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened to evaluate the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan committee, tasked with conducting a science-based, fact-finding review, focused on understanding the state's emergency management structure, coordination efforts, and the effectiveness of its policies and decisions during the crisis. The meeting also explored lessons learned and potential improvements for future public health emergencies.

### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Committee Mission and Scope**:
   - The committee's primary goal is to assess the state's COVID-19 response, focusing on federal guidance, funding, vaccination efforts, emergency use authorizations (EUAs), and the decision-making process.
   - There was debate over whether the committee should evaluate operational aspects only or also scrutinize the policies and decisions made during the pandemic. Some members argued that understanding the decision-making process is essential for future preparedness.

2. **Emergency Management Framework**:
   - Rob Buckton, Director of the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM), provided an overview of the state's emergency management structure. He emphasized the importance of unified command and collaboration with agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the National Guard.
   - The state's emergency operations plan, last updated in 2019, was designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for adjustments during unprecedented events like COVID-19.

3. **After-Action Review**:
   - New Hampshire is conducting an after-action review of its COVID-19 response, led by contractor Title Basin. This review, expected to be completed by the end of June, will identify strengths and areas for improvement in the state's response.

4. **Communication and Misinformation**:
   - The committee discussed the challenges of managing information and misinformation during the pandemic. The Joint Information Center (JIC) played a key role in disseminating accurate information, but questions were raised about how decisions on what information to release were made.

5. **Local Control and State-Federal Coordination**:
   - New Hampshire's emergency management system emphasizes local control, with decisions often made at the community level based on state guidance. This approach was both a strength and a challenge, as different communities responded differently to evolving information.
   - The committee explored the relationship between state and federal agencies, particularly in terms of policy implementation and resource allocation. While federal guidance was followed, the state retained significant autonomy in its response.

6. **Organizational Adaptability and Recommendations for Improvement**:
   - The committee discussed whether the state's organizational structure was sufficiently nimble to adapt to changing circumstances during the pandemic. Training, exercises, and partnerships with local communities and public health networks were emphasized as critical components of future preparedness.
   - Recommendations included improving the state's ability to incorporate new scientific information rapidly and enhancing coordination with federal agencies like FEMA, CDC, and FDA. The committee considered requesting additional data, such as vsafe data, to better understand the effectiveness of policies like vaccination and masking.

7. **Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and Federal Guidance**:
   - Questions were raised about whether DHHS thoroughly reviewed data before accepting federal EUAs. Concerns were expressed about potential gaps in information and whether state agencies had access to all necessary data to make informed decisions.
   - The committee debated the extent to which New Hampshire relied on federal guidance and whether the state exercised independent judgment in its response. Some representatives highlighted the need for the state to critically assess federal directives rather than relying solely on them.

8. **Lessons Learned and Future Preparedness**:
   - The committee expressed interest in comparing New Hampshire's response to that of other states and in understanding the cost and scope of the after-action review. They also sought clarity on how the state's response might inform future pandemic preparedness.

### Conclusion:
The meeting concluded with Representative Belcher’s remarks and a brief opportunity for additional comments. The chair adjourned the session at 12:36 PM, marking the end of the committee’s discussions for the day. The tone was formal and procedural, reflecting the committee's commitment to a thorough and objective evaluation of New Hampshire's COVID-19 response.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the complexity of managing a large-scale public health crisis and underscored the importance of continuous evaluation, adaptability, and collaboration in emergency management practices. The insights gained from the after-action review and committee deliberations are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the state's preparedness for future emergencies.
