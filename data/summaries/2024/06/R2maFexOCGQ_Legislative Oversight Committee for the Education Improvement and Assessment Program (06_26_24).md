### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program (06/26/24)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program convened on June 26, 2024, to discuss and refine proposed rules related to academic standards, competencies, and educational practices. The meeting focused on ensuring clarity, consistency, and legislative oversight in the state’s educational framework. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Graduation Competencies and Academic Standards**
The committee engaged in a detailed debate on the definition and implementation of **graduation competencies**, noting discrepancies between schools like ConVal High and Woodsville High. Concerns were raised about the **individualization of standards** and the clarity of these competencies. The committee also reviewed the **distinctions between "proficiency," "mastery," and "competencies,"** with some members advocating for a higher standard for mastery (e.g., 100% rather than 85%). The need to align these terms with state statutes and ensure consistency across educational settings was emphasized.

---

#### **2. Instruction and Instructional Time**
The committee scrutinized the **definition of instruction**, particularly the shift from "teaching" to "facilitating." Members expressed concerns that this change might **diminish the role of teachers**, citing examples like online speech therapy facilitated by non-local providers. Additionally, the definition of **instructional time** was examined, with questions about who qualifies to offer instruction (e.g., substitutes or custodians) and whether study hall periods should count as instructional time.

---

#### **3. Learning Level and Readiness**
The concept of **learning level** and student readiness to receive instruction was discussed, with references to educational psychology theories such as the **Zone of Proximal Development**. The committee explored how these concepts should be integrated into competency-based education to ensure students are appropriately challenged and supported.

---

#### **4. Content Areas and Statutory Definitions**
The committee expressed concerns about proposed changes to the **statutory definitions of educational content areas**, such as Arts, Health, and Social Studies. Members emphasized the need to maintain **legislative control** over these definitions to ensure they align with state goals and provide clear guidance for educators.

---

#### **5. School Approval and Educational Pathways**
The committee reviewed the **criteria for public school approval**, particularly for elementary and middle schools. There was a discussion on whether schools that do not meet certain criteria should still be approved and the implications of such decisions. Additionally, the structure of **educational pathways**, especially in Career and Technical Education (CTE), was examined. The committee considered how competencies are integrated into these pathways and the flexibility for students to earn credits through **extended learning opportunities (ELOs)**.

---

#### **6. Key Terminology and Definitions**
The committee reviewed and revised definitions of key terms such as **"educator," "equity," and "differentiation."** The focus was on ensuring these definitions align with state statutes and provide clarity for implementation in schools. This included discussions on how these terms impact the practical application of competency-based education.

---

#### **7. Implementation and Teacher Role**
Concerns were raised about the **practical implementation of competency-based education** and the potential burden on teachers to manage and assess competencies. The committee discussed the balance between **ensuring high standards** and allowing teachers the flexibility to meet individual student needs. The role of teachers in facilitating learning and assessing mastery was a recurring theme throughout the meeting.

---

#### **8. Next Steps**
The committee acknowledged the **complexity of the issues** discussed and the need for further deliberation, particularly on terms like competency, proficiency, and mastery. They agreed to **reconvene in September** after a summer break to continue refining the proposed rules and standards.

### **Overall Focus and Outcomes**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to **ensuring clarity, consistency, and legislative oversight** in New Hampshire’s educational standards and practices. Key themes included the need to align definitions with state statutes, support teachers in implementing competency-based education, and maintain high academic standards while allowing flexibility for individual student needs.
