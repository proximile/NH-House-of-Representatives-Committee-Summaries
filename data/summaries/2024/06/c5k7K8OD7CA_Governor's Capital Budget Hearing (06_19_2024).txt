The hearing spanned multiple segments, addressing a wide range of priorities across various departments. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and presentations:

---

### **1. Infrastructure and Technology Upgrades**
   - **Legacy System Replacement**: A $500,000 request to transition from outdated project development software (originally coded in 2014) to a new system, supporting over 1,700 contractors and subcontractors.
   - **Right-of-Way System Software Replacement**: A $2 million request to replace a 20-year-old Visual Basic-based system that is increasingly difficult to maintain.
   - **Federal Billing System**: The Department of Transportation (DOT) highlighted the need to replace an outdated and unsupported federal billing system.

### **2. Transportation and Rail Infrastructure**
   - **Rail Replacement**: A proposal to purchase four track miles of 115lb rail to replace 100-year-old, 85lb rail prone to derailments, ensuring the safety of over 450 track miles of rail infrastructure.
   - **Railroad Tie Replacement**: A request to replace 16,000 railroad ties, many of which were installed in the 1920s-1940s and are well past their useful life.
   - **Rail Trail Maintenance**: A $600,000 request to address critical repairs for rail trails, including bridges and culverts damaged by age and weather events. Rail trails lack a dedicated funding stream for maintenance.
   - **Transit Facility Upgrades**: Funding for safety-related upgrades at three transit facilities, including the Manchester Transit Authority and a bus storage facility.
   - **Emergency Response Mobile Command Vehicle**: A request for a mobile command vehicle to support drone operations for rapid inspection and repair during natural disasters.

### **3. Water and Dam Infrastructure**
   - **Clean Drinking Water Program**: Discussions focused on the state’s need to match federal funds for community water system upgrades, with concerns about meeting the 20% match requirement.
   - **Dam Repairs**: DES highlighted structural issues at several state-owned dams, including Lakeport Dam and Murphy Dam. DES manages 274 state-owned dams, with 64 classified as high-hazard dams.
   - **Pawtuckaway Lake Dams**: Significant rehabilitation is needed, particularly for Doll Dam, which has a wooden gate that hasn’t been repaired in over 40 years. A full drawdown of the lake is necessary for the project.
   - **Winnipesaukee River Basin**: Plans to replace aging sewer lines in the Franklin area.

### **4. Military and Veterans’ Facilities**
   - **New Hampshire Veterans Home**: Operational since 1890, the Veterans Home faces challenges such as staffing shortages and aging infrastructure. Key capital requests include roof and air handler replacements, diesel tank removal, tub and shower upgrades, elevator repairs, and ADA-compliant doorway updates.
   - **Military Affairs**: The department manages over 50 buildings and prioritizes federal funding matches for projects such as the Milford Readiness Center expansion, Manchester Armory land replacement, Plymouth Readiness Center addition, and statewide readiness center roof replacements. An aviation hangar expansion is also planned to accommodate new helicopters.

### **5. Safety and Emergency Services**
   - **Road Toll System**: Upgrading the automated fuel tax system to a cloud-based platform.

### **7. Federal Funding and State Matches**
   - **FAA and FTA Funding Matches**: Requests for state matches to access federal funding for airport improvements ($4.7 million for FAA projects) and ADA-compliant transit vehicles ($390,000 for FTA projects).
   - **Federal-State Collaboration**: Significant reliance on federal funding, with state matches critical for project execution. Projects are prioritized based on federal funding availability and state matching requirements.
   - **Groundwater Well Expansion**: Enhancing monitoring capabilities to better manage drought conditions.

### **8. Budgetary Context and Challenges**
   - **Budget Overview**: The governor noted that this year’s capital budget requests totaled $1.3 billion, with $1.1 billion coming from general funds. However, 90% of these projects are unlikely to be approved due to current guidelines.
   - **Economic Context**: Despite a strong state economy, recent high spending and tax cuts necessitate tough decisions in both the capital and operating budgets.
   - **Debt Service Implications**: Discussion of the repayment structure for general obligation bonds, which fund highway projects over a 20-year schedule at 5% interest.

### **9. General Themes**
   - **Infrastructure Aging**: Many facilities and systems are outdated, requiring systematic replacement or upgrades.
   - **Safety and Compliance**: Projects aim to address safety violations, ADA compliance, and modern building codes.
   - **Federal Funding Leveraging**: The state is actively seeking to leverage federal funds for various projects, particularly in water infrastructure, but matching state funds are required to access these federal dollars.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the need for careful budgeting and prioritization of critical infrastructure projects across the state. With aging infrastructure, increasing reliance on federal funding, and budgetary constraints, agencies were urged to lower their expectations and focus on the most pressing needs. The discussions highlighted the importance of sustained investment in infrastructure to maintain safety, efficiency, and compliance with regulatory standards.
