**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference on HB 1127, HB 518, HB 1079, and HB 1622 (06/06/2024)**

The Committee of Conference meeting focused on reconciling differences in several key bills: **HB 1127**, **HB 518**, **HB 1079**, and **HB 1622**. The discussions highlighted the complexities of legislative language, the importance of bipartisan collaboration, and the need to address policy concerns effectively.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes:**

1. **HB 1079: Addressing Teacher Shortages in Rural Areas**  
   The committee debated amendments to **HB 1079**, which aims to recruit and retain educators in rural and underserved areas. The Senate version framed the initiative as a grant program, while the House version proposed a loan repayment program. Concerns were raised about unrelated components, such as a substance abuse program, which could jeopardize the bill’s passage. The committee agreed to retain the education-focused provisions while removing contentious sections. The final decision on funding was deferred to the Finance Committee in the next budget cycle.

2. **HB 1622 and HB 518: Administrative Rules and Licensing**  
   The committee worked to reconcile language between **HB 518** and **HB 1622**, both of which address licensing and administrative rules. Key amendments included:  
   - Removing duplicative language from **HB 518** and adopting clearer provisions from **HB 1622** regarding public comments on administrative rules, based on input from the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR).  
   - Reducing the frequency of inspections for barber shops and salons from twice a year to once a year, reflecting resource constraints.  
   - Restructuring the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC), including creating a Chief of Staff position to assist the executive director.  
   - Removing language related to digitally verifiable licenses due to a lack of infrastructure and implementation clarity.  

3. **HB 1127: Driver’s Licenses for Non-Permanent Residents**  
   The committee addressed legal concerns raised about **HB 1127**, particularly anomalies in recognizing out-of-state driver’s licenses for individuals with different immigration statuses. Legal counsel highlighted inconsistencies, and the committee debated the feasibility of amendments. Ultimately, they considered reverting to the original language of **HB 1127** to avoid further complications.

4. **Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Oversight**  
   The committee discussed the lack of oversight for outpatient substance abuse treatment providers, noting that only nine out of 65 Medicaid-registered organizations receive state funding. They debated the need for certification and regulatory mechanisms to ensure quality care and protect vulnerable patients. The bill proposes adding a Behavioral Health position within the DHHS Ombudsman’s office to address complaints, though this position would be subject to available funding.

5. **Senate Bill 495: Interim Study Work**  
   The committee discussed the potential for interim study work on **Senate Bill 495** by the House Health and Human Services (HHS) committee. Both Democratic and Republican representatives committed to ensuring the bill is thoroughly vetted and improved.

### **Themes and Collaborative Efforts:**
Throughout the meeting, representatives emphasized the importance of bipartisan cooperation, clear communication, and careful review of legislative language to avoid unintended consequences. The committee worked diligently to reconcile differences, address legal and procedural issues, and ensure consistency across related bills. Their goal was to craft legislation that would be successful when returned to the full House and Senate for final approval.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting underscored the complexities of the legislative process, particularly in reconciling different versions of bills and addressing diverse policy concerns. By focusing on collaboration and compromise, the committee aimed to advance legislation that effectively addresses critical issues such as teacher shortages, substance abuse treatment oversight, and licensing reforms.
