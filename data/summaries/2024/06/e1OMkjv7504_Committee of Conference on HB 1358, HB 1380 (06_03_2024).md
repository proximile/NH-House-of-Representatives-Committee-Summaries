The transcript captures a meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference discussing **HB 1358** and **HB 1380**, with a focus on legislation related to restricting Chinese entities, particularly the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), from owning or leasing property near military bases in the state. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Concerns About the Bill**: Several representatives expressed concerns that the bill was overly broad and could have unintended consequences, such as targeting Asian-Americans or creating legal conflicts with federal regulations. They argued that the bill could be seen as xenophobic and might not effectively address the intended security concerns.

2. **Security vs. Practicality**: Proponents of the bill emphasized national security risks, particularly the potential for espionage if Chinese entities own property near military installations. However, opponents pointed out that the bill’s 10-mile restriction was insufficient and conflicted with federal guidelines, which require a 100-mile buffer.

3. **Economic Impact**: Representatives noted that the bill could harm industries like agriculture and logging, which rely on Chinese investment and trade. Additionally, there were concerns about how the bill might affect individual property transactions, such as Chinese students or families purchasing homes.

4. **Legal Challenges**: The discussion referenced similar legislation in Florida, which is currently being challenged in court for potential discrimination and conflicts with federal supremacy. Some members suggested waiting for the outcome of these legal cases before proceeding.

5. **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions were made to narrow the bill’s scope, such as limiting restrictions to property within 100 miles of military bases or explicitly targeting CCP-owned entities. However, there was no consensus on how to address the concerns raised.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee decided to recess and reconvene on June 5th to further discuss the bill and potentially propose amendments. Some members advocated for a study committee to develop more precise language.

Overall, the meeting highlighted significant disagreements about the bill’s scope, effectiveness, and potential unintended consequences, with no immediate resolution reached.
