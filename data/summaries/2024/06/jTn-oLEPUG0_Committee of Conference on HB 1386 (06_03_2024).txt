The transcript is from a Committee of Conference meeting for **HB 1386**, which aims to prohibit the disposal of lithium-ion batteries in solid waste landfills, composting facilities, or incinerators. The meeting focused on resolving discrepancies between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The primary issues stemmed from drafting errors in the Senate version, which resulted in duplicate definitions of "computer" and missing repeal language. 

Representative Eil, the billâ€™s prime sponsor, explained the necessary corrections: removing the old definition of "computer," adding the word "or" in specific sections, and reinstating the repeal language. The Senate acknowledged the errors and supported the proposed amendment. 

The committee unanimously agreed to adopt the amendment, resolving the discrepancies. The meeting concluded with the committee preparing a report to finalize the amended version of the bill. The entire process was completed efficiently in nine minutes.
