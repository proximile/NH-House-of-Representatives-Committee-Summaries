**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (06/11/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on June 11, 2024, to address critical issues within the family court system, with a particular focus on guardianship cases, procedural fairness, and broader systemic improvements. The meeting highlighted the need for enhanced communication, procedural safeguards, and compassionate approaches in handling sensitive family matters.

### Key Discussion Points and Outcomes:

1. **Guardianship Cases and Electronic Notifications**:
   - The committee examined a case where a grandmother lost guardianship of her granddaughter due to missing an electronic hearing notice, which was sent via email but went unread. This led to the child being abruptly removed by police, raising concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of electronic notifications.
   - **Electronic vs. Paper Notifications**: Members acknowledged the shift from paper to electronic notifications but identified significant challenges, such as emails going to spam or being overlooked. Suggestions included implementing additional safeguards, such as sending physical letters or using certified mail if electronic notifications remain unopened.
   - **Procedural Improvements**: The committee recognized the need for procedural changes, such as reservice of notices in critical cases and improving court processes to prevent similar situations.
   - **Role of Police vs. Social Workers**: Questions were raised about the involvement of police rather than trained social workers in removing children, emphasizing the need for a more compassionate and trauma-informed approach.

2. **Subcommittee Formation**:
   - A subcommittee was proposed to further investigate issues related to guardianship notifications and broader family court processes. Several representatives volunteered to participate, with a focus on developing recommendations for procedural improvements and better communication practices.

3. **Broader Family Court Concerns**:
   - The discussion expanded to include other systemic issues, such as foster care transitions and ensuring foster parents are adequately informed when children are moved. The committee emphasized the importance of protecting the rights and well-being of all parties involved, particularly children.

4. **Interim Report and Committee Continuation**:
   - The committee had previously completed work on four items and submitted an interim report. It was decided to keep the committee active until October 31, 2024, to address any new issues that might arise.

5. **Subcommittees for Specific Issues**:
   - **Title IV of the Social Security Act**: A subcommittee was formed to research child support payments and federal reimbursements to the court system, with Representative Lynn as chair.
   - **Perjury in Family Court**: Another subcommittee was established to address concerns about perjury allegations in family court cases, with Representative Lynn also chairing this group. The discussion highlighted the difficulty in proving perjury and the need for better communication and process clarity for litigants.
   - **Trial by Jury in Family Court**: The committee considered the feasibility of implementing jury trials in family court but decided not to pursue this further due to practical challenges and the rarity of such practices in other states.

6. **Guardianship and Electronic Filings**:
   - Representative Greg presented a case involving guardianship and the transition to electronic filings, prompting the committee to consider the implications and potential improvements in handling such cases.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the need for systemic improvements in the family court process, with a focus on enhancing communication, ensuring procedural fairness, and addressing broader concerns such as perjury and guardianship cases. The formation of subcommittees reflects the committeeâ€™s commitment to in-depth research and the development of actionable recommendations. The committee plans to continue its work through October 31, 2024, with the goal of creating a more equitable and compassionate family court system.
