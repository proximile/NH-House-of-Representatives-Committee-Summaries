The transcript captures a Committee of Conference meeting on **House Bill 1069**, which addresses the handling of electronic records requests under New Hampshire's Right-to-Know law (Article 91-A). Key points of discussion include:

1. **Electronic Delivery Charges**: The committee debated whether towns should be allowed to charge for processing electronic records requests. The Senate version of the bill states that no charge shall be made for electronically delivered records, but concerns were raised that this could be interpreted to prohibit any charges, even for extensive processing work. A proposed amendment clarified that while no charge should be made for the delivery itself, towns could charge for the time necessary to process the request if authorized by law (e.g., for requests exceeding 250 electronic communications).

2. **Citizen vs. Person**: The Senate version changed the term "citizen" to "person" in the bill, broadening who can make records requests. Some members expressed concerns that this could lead to excessive requests from non-residents, burdening municipalities. Supporters argued that the change ensures access for legal residents and out-of-state entities like media outlets.

3. **Municipal Burden**: Several members highlighted the significant costs and workload some towns face when fulfilling large or complex records requests, citing examples of requests costing thousands of dollars. There was a call for mechanisms to allow municipalities to negotiate or narrow overly broad requests.

4. **Concerns About Pandora's Box**: Some Senators expressed reservations about the bill's potential unintended consequences, particularly the financial and administrative burdens on towns, and suggested delaying further action until more comprehensive revisions to Article 91-A could be considered.

5. **Outcome**: The committee ultimately agreed to disagree, with the Senate conferees indicating they would recommend non-concurrence with the House version. The bill is expected to be revisited in the next legislative session, potentially alongside **House Bill 1002**, which addresses related issues and is awaiting the governor's signature.

The meeting underscored the tension between ensuring public access to records and mitigating the burden on municipalities, with no consensus reached on the proposed changes.
