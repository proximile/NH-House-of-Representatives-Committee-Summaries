The discussions focused on pilot programs, recruitment and retention initiatives, Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs), retirement system exemptions, school expenditure transparency, and Medicaid to Schools program requirements. Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of the proceedings:

---

### **HB 1274: Recruitment and Retention Programs**
1. **Pilot Program for Youth Facilities**:
