**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (June 20, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Fiscal Committee convened on June 20, 2024, to address a range of fiscal matters impacting state agencies and services. The meeting involved detailed discussions on budget issues, healthcare funding, energy costs, and operational challenges across various departments. Key highlights from the meeting include:

### **Committee Business and Consent Calendar**
The session began with the approval of minutes from the previous meeting and the introduction of Senate replacements. The committee adopted the consent calendar, with specific items removed for further deliberation.

### **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**
1. **Medicaid and Eligibility Systems**: Discussions focused on the New Heights eligibility system, with questions about its functionality and costs. It was noted that a previously free component now incurs a $1 million expense due to federal changes.
2. **Nursing Home Reimbursement Rates**: Concerns were raised about reimbursement rates for nursing homes, particularly the impact of administrative costs and challenges in hiring clinical staff. The committee emphasized the need to revisit the cost-based reimbursement system in light of inflationary pressures and frequent ownership changes in nursing homes, which have also led to significant back billing issues.
3. **Opioid Abatement Funds**: Questions were raised about the appropriate allocation of opioid abatement funds, with concerns about whether these funds were supplementing or supplanting general funds.
4. **New Budget System**: DHHS introduced a new budget system aimed at improving expenditure tracking and identifying federal and other funding sources. This system is expected to enhance financial management and reduce the lapsing of unspent funds.

### **Consumer Advocate Office**
The Office of the Consumer Advocate requested additional funding from the special utility assessment fund. The Consumer Advocate clarified that the fund does not hold money but authorizes contracts, with costs ultimately passed on to utility customers.

### **Energy and Transmission Costs**
A significant portion of the discussion focused on high transmission costs for electricity in New England. Concerns were raised about unchecked spending on transmission projects and the lack of rigorous oversight by federal regulators. The committee also highlighted the need to address the burden of energy costs on consumers, particularly issues related to poles and wires in the state.

### **Department of Corrections (DOC)**
The committee reviewed the DOC’s budget, focusing on high overtime costs and vacancy rates. The DOC reported improvements in recruitment and retention, including hiring 50 new officers and reducing the vacancy rate from 50% to 46%. A relief pool system was implemented to reduce forced overtime, which has been effective in alleviating staff pressure.

### **Medicaid Enhancement Tax (MET) and Hospital Funding**
The expiration of the six-year MET settlement, which affects hospital funding, was a major topic of discussion. The committee expressed concern over a potential $35 million annual cut to hospitals, which could severely impact healthcare services. The governor’s directive to the commissioner to develop a new plan was discussed, but there was frustration over the legislature’s lack of involvement in the process. Members stressed the need for a solution, possibly through a special session or veto day, to address the funding gap and avoid negative consequences for hospitals and patients.

### **Hamstead Hospital and YDC**
Issues related to Hamstead Hospital were discussed, including the need for better data tracking and the potential impact of the Youth Development Center (YDC) on local services. Concerns were also raised about the hospital’s security and the need for a clear plan to address these challenges.

### **Meeting Schedule**
The committee tentatively decided to skip the July meeting and set a tentative date for August 16th, with the possibility of canceling if no pressing issues arise. The next meeting is likely to be in September, after the primary elections.

### **Motions and Decisions**
Several items were moved, seconded, and adopted, including budget adjustments and funding requests. A motion to table an item related to DHHS funding was approved.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with further discussions on utility-related issues and preparations for the upcoming fiscal year. Overall, the session highlighted ongoing fiscal challenges in healthcare, corrections, and energy, with a focus on finding solutions to ensure adequate funding for critical services and addressing the financial burden on consumers.
