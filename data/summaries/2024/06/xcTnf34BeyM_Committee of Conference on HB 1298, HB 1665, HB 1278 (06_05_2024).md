**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee of Conference on HB 1298, HB 1665, HB 1278 (June 5, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee of Conference convened on June 5, 2024, to discuss and reconcile differences on three key bills: HB 1298, HB 1665, and HB 1278. The meeting focused on education policy, funding, and administrative flexibility, with significant debate over part-time teacher certification, Education Freedom Accounts, and school and roads funding. Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of the discussions:

### **HB 1298: Part-Time Teachers and Dual Enrollment**
1. **Part-Time Teacher Definition and Flexibility**:
   - The committee reviewed differences between the House and Senate versions of HB 1298, which addresses part-time teacher employment in public schools.
   - The Senate version emphasizes local control, allowing school boards to hire qualified individuals (e.g., artists, mechanics, veterans, industry experts) for part-time roles without state certification, provided they pass background checks. This aims to address teacher shortages and leverage community expertise.
   - The House expressed concerns about maintaining educational standards, proposing a more structured approach with "adjunct authorization" and a 20-hour weekly limit for part-time teachers. The Senate countered with a 30-hour limit, citing federal guidelines and the need for flexibility, especially for teachers working across multiple districts.

2. **Dual Enrollment and Community College Instructors**:
   - The House proposed allowing faculty from the University System of New Hampshire and community colleges to teach in public schools without additional state teaching credentials, provided they pass background checks. This would support dual enrollment and concurrent programs.
   - Concerns were raised about ensuring only qualified faculty, not teaching assistants or graduate students, are eligible for such roles.

### **HB 1665: Education Freedom Accounts**
1. **Phaseout Grant Extension**:
   - The Senate proposed reducing the phaseout grant extension from three to two years, ending in 2028 instead of 2029.
   - The House initially non-concurred but later agreed to the change after further discussion.

2. **ADMA Language Removal**:
   - The Senate also proposed removing a section related to ADMA (Average Daily Membership Attendance) language, which the House eventually accepted.

### **HB 1278: Roads and School Funding**
1. **School Funding**:
   - The Senate sought to retain certain policies related to school funding (Senate Bill 499) in HB 1278, including an additional $500,000 in funding.
   - The House opposed this addition, as it had been previously defeated, and urged the Senate to concur with the House position to avoid complicating the bill.

2. **Disaster Relief and Roads Repair**:
   - The House emphasized the importance of disaster relief for small towns and roads repair, which they supported as part of HB 1278.

### **Therapeutic Cannabis**
- The House sought to move forward with the therapeutic cannabis provision, asking the Senate to recede from their amendment to avoid relitigating issues and complicating the bill.

### **Recess for Further Discussion**
- Due to the complexity of the issues and the absence of some Senate members, the committee agreed to recess until the next day to allow further consultation and negotiation.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Local Control vs. State Oversight**: The Senate prioritized local control in hiring part-time teachers, while the House emphasized the need for state oversight to maintain educational standards.
- **Flexibility in Education Policy**: Both sides acknowledged the need for flexibility to address teacher shortages and support dual enrollment programs but differed on the extent of that flexibility.
- **Funding Disputes**: The House and Senate clashed over school funding provisions, with the House opposing additional funding that had been previously defeated.
- **Collaborative Negotiations**: The committee demonstrated a willingness to compromise, as seen in the agreement on the Education Freedom Accounts phaseout extension and the decision to recess for further discussion on unresolved issues.

Overall, the meeting highlighted ongoing negotiations between the House and Senate on key education, funding, and policy issues, with both sides seeking alignment while addressing concerns about specific provisions. The discussions underscored the challenges of balancing local autonomy, educational standards, and fiscal responsibility.
