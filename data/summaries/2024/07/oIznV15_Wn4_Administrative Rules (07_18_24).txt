The NH House of Representatives meeting on Administrative Rules (07/18/24) was chaired by a senior member due to the unavailability of both the chair and vice chair. The meeting began with attendance and substitutions, followed by the approval of minutes and the consent agenda. Several items were postponed at the request of agencies, requiring waivers for items B, C, and D from the Installation Standards Board and the Department of Energy, as further work was needed on the rules.

The committee then addressed item 202-2467 from the Department of Business and Economic Affairs regarding the Housing Champion Program. The discussion centered on whether agreements with awardees constituted rules or contracts. The committee ultimately approved the item, viewing the agreements as contracts rather than rules.

Next, the committee reviewed item 202-2449 concerning school nurse rules for the Board of Education, which had expired on June 12, 2024. No applications or renewals had been processed during the expiration period, and the committee approved the item unanimously.

The final item discussed was an expired rule from the Pharmacy Board, which had not taken any disciplinary actions during the expiration period. The committee also unanimously approved this item.

The meeting concluded with a motion to cancel the continued meeting, which was passed unanimously.
