The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on August 15, 2024, focused on administrative rules and several key issues:

1. **Quorum and Meeting Minutes**: The meeting began with the confirmation of a quorum and the acceptance of previous meeting minutes without discussion.

2. **Consent Agenda**: Two items mistakenly placed on the regular agenda were moved to the consent agenda and adopted without discussion.

3. **Installation Standards Board**: Rules for the Installation Standards Board expired in 2022, and there was a gap before new rules took effect in 2023. No fees were collected during this period, and no disciplinary actions were taken. The board's necessity was questioned due to inactivity.

4. **Department of Energy**: The discussion centered on the Underground Utility Damage Prevention Program and procedural rules. The department is using existing rules until new ones are adopted, with stakeholder sessions planned for November.

5. **Board of Medicine**: Rules for physician examination requirements expired in May 2022. The new rules are essentially the same as the old ones, and no fees are involved. The board is working on other expired rules.

6. **Opioid Abatement Trust Fund**: The agency filed a conditional approval request addressing most comments. There was a clarification on reporting requirements, and the agency agreed to amend their request to address remaining concerns.

7. **Youth Recreation Camps**: An emergency rule was introduced to prohibit restraint and seclusion practices at youth camps. The rule aims to clarify existing statutory prohibitions, with permanent rulemaking expected by September.

8. **Equalization Manual**: A letter was drafted to address concerns about the Department of Revenue Administration's compliance with the Equalization Manual. The committee decided to send the letter to notify the commissioner of the issue and seek a response.

The meeting concluded with the cancellation of a continued meeting due to no further business.
