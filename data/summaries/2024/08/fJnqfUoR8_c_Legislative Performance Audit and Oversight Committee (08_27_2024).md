The New Hampshire Legislative Performance Audit and Oversight Committee meeting on August 27, 2024, focused on several key audit updates and discussions:

1. **Approval of April Meeting Minutes**: The committee unanimously approved the minutes from the April meeting.

2. **Audit Updates**:
   - **New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights**: The audit is paused due to the executive director’s unavailability until late August.
   - **Special Education**: The audit is complex, with over 50 observations expected. A draft report is anticipated by early 2025.
   - **Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)**: The scope statement for the EFA program audit was presented and approved. The audit will focus on the Department of Education’s oversight during fiscal years 2022-2024, with a final report expected in spring 2025. However, access to certain documents held by the scholarship organization (CSF) is restricted, limiting the audit’s scope.

3. **Concerns and Limitations**:
   - Committee members expressed concerns about the lack of transparency and access to data, particularly regarding the EFA program, which involves significant public funds managed by a private nonprofit.
   - The Department of Education’s interpretation of the contract limits the Legislative Budget Assistant’s (LBA) ability to independently verify certain aspects of the program.

4. **DHHS Out-of-State Placements Audit**:
   - The audit was suspended due to a federal lawsuit against DHHS officials, which could interfere with the audit process.

5. **Future Audit Topics**:
   - The committee discussed potential future audits, including DHHS contract management and the Doorways program, which is set to begin soon.
   - Members considered bringing forward additional topics for the next committee to address after the reorganization in January 2025.

6. **Adjournment**:
   - The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene in early December to finalize the Doorways program audit scope and discuss new audit topics before the committee’s reorganization. 

Overall, the meeting highlighted ongoing challenges with audit transparency and access to data, particularly in programs involving significant public funds managed by private entities. The committee emphasized the need for legislative oversight to ensure accountability in the use of public dollars.
