**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives' Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program Meeting (08/22/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program convened on August 22, 2024, to discuss critical aspects of the state's education standards, curriculum frameworks, and assessment programs. The meeting focused on ensuring alignment between state academic standards, local curricula, and statewide assessments, while addressing stakeholder concerns and maintaining flexibility for school districts. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

### **1. Academic Standards and Compliance**
The committee emphasized the importance of school districts developing competencies based on **state academic standards**, ensuring alignment with curriculum frameworks and statewide assessments. Academic standards define what students should know and be able to do, while curriculum development remains a local responsibility. The committee stressed the need for clarity and consistency in academic frameworks to support effective teaching and assessment.

### **2. Review of 306 Administrative Rules**
The committee reviewed the final proposal for the **306 administrative rules**, which govern education standards, curriculum, and assessment programs. Key points included:
- **Distinction Between Standards and Curriculum**: Academic standards are set by statute, while curriculum development is locally controlled but must align with state standards.
- **Achievement of Competencies**: The committee debated the inclusion of "a collection of evidence" as a method for demonstrating proficiency, a change requested by stakeholders like the NEA and NHSAA.
- **Equity Language**: The committee adjusted language from **equity** to **equitable** based on grammatical feedback, ensuring consistency without altering the definition.
- **Social Studies and Holocaust Education**: The committee reviewed the inclusion of social studies, civics, and Holocaust and genocide education, concluding that changes to these sections would not impact statutory requirements.
- **Alignment with RSA 193-E**: The rules were reviewed to ensure alignment with state statutes defining adequate education and learning areas.

### **3. Curriculum, Instructional Time, and Flexibility**
The committee discussed the proposed changes to **minimum school approval standards**, focusing on curriculum, instructional time, and academic standards:
- **World Language Requirements**: Offering World Languages in K-8 is encouraged but not mandatory. Schools that choose to offer these languages must have clear policies in place.
- **Instructional Time**: The committee emphasized the effective use of instructional time rather than rigid mandates, ensuring students make progress toward proficiency.
- **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**: The committee reviewed CTE program requirements, including the need for industry advisory councils and alignment with industry standards. Discussions also addressed increasing student access to CTE programs and budget constraints.
- **Mathematics Credits**: A proposal to increase required mathematics credits from three to four was considered but not adopted.
- **Arts Education**: Concerns were raised about the removal of specific references to arts education in the proposed rules, prompting the committee to seek clarification on how arts education would be ensured.

### **4. Rule Amendments and Oversight**
The committee debated the implications of removing cross-references to academic standards in the rules. Some members argued that this effectively changes the technical standard, while others maintained that it does not alter the underlying standards. The committee clarified its oversight role, noting that it has authority over academic standards but not direct oversight over curriculum or operational aspects like instructional time distribution.

### **5. Public Comment and Stakeholder Input**
The committee acknowledged the significant impact of **public testimony and stakeholder feedback** on the final proposal. Key additions, such as language regarding competency-based learning, were influenced by stakeholder input.

### **6. Collaborative Approach and Future Steps**
Despite differing opinions on technical aspects, the committee maintained a **collaborative approach**, agreeing to continue working toward clear and consistent academic standards. Plans were made to reconvene for further discussion, underscoring the committee's commitment to improving education standards in New Hampshire.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of aligning state academic standards with local implementation while ensuring flexibility for school districts. The committee focused on maintaining rigorous standards, addressing stakeholder concerns, and providing clarity and consistency in the rules governing education in New Hampshire. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing state oversight with local autonomy to ensure all students receive a comprehensive and adequate education.
