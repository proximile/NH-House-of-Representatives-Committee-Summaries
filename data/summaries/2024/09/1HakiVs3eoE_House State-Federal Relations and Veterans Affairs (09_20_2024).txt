The New Hampshire House of Representatives' State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee held a work session on September 20, 2024, discussing two key bills:

1. **HB 1485**: This bill proposes the establishment of a study committee to examine the totality of circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including interactions between federal and state governments, non-governmental organizations (such as pharmaceutical companies and the World Health Organization), and their influence on policy decisions. The committee discussed potential areas of focus, including censorship efforts by big tech, federal influence on state policies, and funding coercion. The subcommittee unanimously recommended the bill for further study and future legislation, acknowledging the challenges in gaining transparency from the federal government.

2. **HB 1041**: This bill aims to establish a commission to investigate the 1967 USS Liberty incident, where the U.S. Navy ship was attacked by Israeli forces, resulting in significant casualties. The committee expressed concern over the inadequate federal investigation at the time and the lack of accountability. Members emphasized the importance of documenting the survivors' stories while they are still alive and recommended involving the stateâ€™s federal delegation to push for a proper investigation. The subcommittee unanimously recommended the bill for future legislation, with a focus on generating a report to be sent to the federal delegation for further action.

The session concluded with a motion to adjourn. Both bills were advanced for further legislative consideration, with a strong emphasis on addressing historical injustices and ensuring transparency in government actions.
