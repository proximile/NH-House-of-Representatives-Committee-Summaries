**Summary of the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee Meeting (September 18, 2024)**

On September 18, 2024, the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened to discuss several bills referred to interim study, focusing on issues related to PFAS contamination, housing, and environmental regulation. The meeting also included an in-depth discussion of the state’s environmental appeals process, highlighting its challenges, recent improvements, and potential legislative reforms. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills Discussed**

1. **House Bill 1089 – PFAS Contamination and Statute of Limitations**  
   This bill proposed eliminating the statute of limitations on civil actions involving PFAS contamination. Representative Vallone, the bill’s sponsor, acknowledged the complexity of the issue and stressed the need for further input to determine an appropriate timeframe for seeking remedies. The committee debated whether to recommend further legislative action or to take no further action. Ultimately, the committee voted **12-6** to recommend further legislative action on PFAS contamination, but without endorsing the elimination of the statute of limitations.

2. **House Bill 1602 – Housing Appeals Board Authority**  
   This bill sought to grant the Housing Appeals Board the authority to review decisions by state agencies related to housing. While housing was recognized as a critical issue, Representative Smith and others argued that this bill was not the right solution. The committee voted **17-0** to recommend no further action on the bill.

3. **House Bill 1614 – Judicial Review of DES Decisions**  
   This bill aimed to allow judicial review of Department of Environmental Services (DES) decisions, particularly focusing on the standard of review (arbitrary and capricious vs. legal). Representative McWilliams, the sponsor, emphasized the need for a fair appeals process, especially in cases involving scientific evidence like PFAS contamination. The committee discussed the complexities of the bill and concerns raised by DES. Ultimately, the committee voted **19-1** to recommend further legislative action, recognizing the need for a more robust appeals process but not endorsing the specific changes proposed in the bill.

### **Environmental Appeals Process Discussion**

The meeting also included a detailed discussion of New Hampshire’s environmental appeals process, focusing on its structure, challenges, and recent improvements:

1. **Evolution of the Appeals Process**  
   The appeals process has transitioned from record-based reviews to evidentiary hearings, where new information can be introduced. A significant improvement noted was the recent appointment of a permanent hearing officer to streamline the process.

2. **Arbitrary and Capricious Standard**  
   There was extensive discussion on the legal standard for reviewing agency decisions, particularly the difference between "unreasonable" and "arbitrary and capricious." It was concluded that these terms are essentially interchangeable in practice, and changing the standard could lead to unnecessary litigation.

3. **Council Structure and Expertise**  
   Councils such as the Wetlands Council and Air Resources Council are composed of members with specific expertise relevant to their respective areas. These councils handle appeals and ensure that agency decisions comply with statutes and rules.

4. **Challenges and Improvements**  
   The meeting highlighted challenges in staffing and the time-consuming nature of the appeals process. Recent improvements include assigning a single hearing officer and moving the appeals clerk position to the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enhance efficiency.

5. **Public and Expert Testimony**  
   The councils accept testimony from various experts during hearings, allowing for a thorough review of both legal and factual issues. The councils have the authority to overturn agency decisions if they find them unreasonable or unlawful.

6. **Future Directions**  
   The committee acknowledged that while the current system has its flaws, it is improving. They decided to recommend further legislative consideration rather than immediate action, allowing future legislatures to decide on potential reforms based on the performance of the new system. A motion was made to consider creating an environmental appeals board, but no immediate action was taken.

- **Judicial Review of DES Decisions**: Further legislative action recommended to improve the appeals process, but without endorsing specific changes.
