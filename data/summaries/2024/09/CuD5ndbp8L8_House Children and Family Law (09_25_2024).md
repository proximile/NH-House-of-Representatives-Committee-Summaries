### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee Meeting (September 25, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee convened on September 25, 2024, to address critical issues related to **student safety**, **surveillance**, and the **use of restraint and seclusion in schools**. The meeting focused on **House Bill 1269**, which proposed the use of **visual and auditory recordings** to monitor restraint and seclusion incidents for students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). The discussion also explored broader themes of **student dignity**, **oversight**, **training**, and **legislative considerations**. Here’s a detailed summary:

---

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

#### **1. Surveillance and Student Dignity**
- **Concerns Raised**: Representatives emphasized the need for clear guidance on surveillance in schools, particularly its impact on **student dignity** and **privacy**. The long-term effects of students’ **digital footprints** were highlighted, especially when incidents involving young children are recorded and shared. Questions were raised about the **intent of surveillance**—whether for accountability or decision-making.
- **Cameras in Schools**: Toby Islen, a professional working with students with emotional and behavioral disabilities, noted that some students feel **relief when cameras are absent** due to feelings of **shame or trauma**. While cameras can document incidents, they may not capture the full context of why a situation escalated.

#### **2. Restraint and Seclusion Practices**
- **Challenges and Concerns**: Islen shared insights on the use of **restraint and seclusion**, stressing the importance of **minimizing these practices** through **trauma-informed training** and **de-escalation techniques**. He warned that overly restrictive policies could lead to students being placed in **out-of-district or out-of-state facilities**, removing them from their communities.
- **Oversight and Reporting**: Current oversight includes **administrative reviews**, **nurse assessments**, and **staff debriefings** to improve practices. Islen welcomed **legislative oversight** but cautioned against measures that could hinder schools’ ability to handle extreme behaviors safely.

#### **3. House Bill 1269: Video Monitoring of Restraint and Seclusion**
- **Bill Overview**: The bill, sponsored by Representative MCU, proposed requiring **video cameras in classrooms** to record incidents of restraint and seclusion. Concerns were raised about **privacy invasion**, **cost**, and the **feasibility** of statewide implementation.
- **Comparative Analysis**: The committee compared New Hampshire’s laws with **Maine’s statute**, which **prohibits** the use of restraint and seclusion except in extreme cases. New Hampshire’s current law permits **limited use** of restraint but prohibits **dangerous techniques**.
- **Proposed Alternatives**: **Body cameras** for teachers were suggested as a **cost-effective alternative**, though concerns about **reliability** (e.g., teachers forgetting to turn them on) were noted.

#### **4. Parental and Advocate Testimony**
- **Advocacy for Accountability**: Parents and advocates, including **Miss Moren Tracy**, a disability and civil rights advocate, expressed **heartfelt concerns** about the **safety and accountability** of students with disabilities. Tracy referenced **Maine’s law** as a model for New Hampshire to consider.

#### **5. Training and Best Practices**
- **Existing Programs**: Islen detailed training programs such as the **Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI)** and **Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI)**, which focus on **trauma-informed care**, **de-escalation**, and reducing the need for physical restraint. These programs emphasize **proactive strategies** and **post-incident learning**.
- **Dr. Ross Green’s Methodology**: The committee discussed **Collaborative Proactive Solutions (CPS)**, an evidence-based approach to addressing behavioral challenges, as a potential intervention.

#### **6. Documentary and Historical Context**
- **“The Kids We Lose”**: The committee watched a documentary highlighting the **challenges faced by children with behavioral issues** and the **inhumane practices** of restraint and seclusion. This underscored the need for **humane and effective alternatives**.
- **Evolution of School Discipline**: Representatives shared **personal anecdotes** about the transition from **corporal punishment** in the past to more **humane practices** today.

#### **7. Legislative Options and Funding**
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  1. **Maintain New Hampshire’s current statute**, allowing limited use of restraint and seclusion, with **cameras in designated areas** and **enhanced teacher training**.
  2. **Adopt Maine’s approach**, which prohibits restraint and seclusion but requires **significant teacher training**.
- **Pilot Programs and Funding**: Suggestions were made to explore **pilot programs** using evidence-based interventions like Dr. Green’s CPS methodology. **Federal funding** from grants, as used in Texas for surveillance cameras, was also discussed.

#### **8. Office of Child Advocate**
- **Awaiting Recommendations**: The committee is awaiting **recommendations** from the Office of Child Advocate on potential legislation.

#### **9. Surveillance Cameras vs. Body Cameras**
- **Pros and Cons**: **Surveillance cameras** in classrooms were seen as **invasive and costly**, while **body cameras** for teachers were considered a **more targeted solution** but with challenges in implementation. The existing **13-page reporting form** for restraint and seclusion incidents was noted as already providing detailed documentation.

#### **10. Future Steps**
- **Continued Exploration**: The committee plans to **continue exploring** legislative options, focusing on **teacher training**, **data collection**, and **accountability measures** to ensure the safety and well-being of students.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the **complexity** of balancing **student safety**, **privacy concerns**, and **financial constraints**. The committee acknowledged the progress made in improving student safety but stressed the need for continued efforts to refine policies and practices. While open to **legislative oversight**, participants emphasized the importance of avoiding overly restrictive measures that could hinder schools’ ability to ensure safety. The committee is leaning toward **enhancing New Hampshire’s current statute** with **targeted interventions**, **teacher training**, and **potential pilot programs**, while awaiting further input from the Office of Child Advocate.
