**Comprehensive Summary of NH House Children and Family Law Committee Meeting (09/04/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Committee convened to address critical issues related to child welfare and safety in educational settings, focusing on two key topics: the use of audio and video recordings in classrooms and the regulation of restraints and seclusion in schools. The discussions highlighted the need for transparency, accountability, and improved training while balancing financial, logistical, and privacy concerns.

### **1. Audio and Video Recordings in Educational Settings**
The committee began by examining the use of audio and video recordings, particularly in special education classrooms. The primary focus was on ensuring parents are informed about incidents involving their children, especially those with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) who may struggle to communicate. Recordings were seen as a tool to provide clarity and comfort to parents, offering an objective account of events. However, concerns were raised about broader implications, such as equipping teachers with body cameras. 

Representative Raymond expressed discomfort with the idea of body cameras, arguing that it could blur the line between educators and law enforcement. Instead, she emphasized adhering to existing statutes, such as those governing recordings on school buses. The committee agreed to refine the proposed legislation, focusing on specific scenarios, particularly for non-verbal children in special education settings. Representative Long was tasked with drafting a report summarizing the discussions and recommendations for future review. The committee also stressed the importance of staff training and clear policies for notifying families in cases of incidents. The meeting concluded with a reminder about an upcoming documentary screening and panel discussion on child advocacy, which could inform future legislation.

### **2. House Bill 1269: Restraints and Seclusion in Schools**
The committee then turned to **House Bill 1269**, which addressed the use of restraints and seclusion in schools, particularly for students with IEPs or accommodation plans. The bill proposed requiring visual and auditory recording of such incidents, sparking a robust debate.

#### **Key Points of Discussion:**
1. **Concerns About the Bill**: Representative Peter Patrino initially considered recommending the bill be **"inexpedient to legislate" (ITL)** due to concerns about cost and feasibility. However, after hearing emotional testimony from parents, he reconsidered.
   
2. **Parent Testimony**: Marin Tracy, a concerned citizen, shared her advocacy work with families whose children had been restrained or secluded. She emphasized the need for **accountability** and **transparency**, suggesting that cameras or monitoring systems could provide a voice for children who cannot communicate their experiences.

3. **Training and Support**: Several representatives highlighted the importance of **training** for school staff to prevent the need for restraints and seclusion. The lack of proper training for paraprofessionals and the need for evidence-based interventions to de-escalate situations were discussed.

4. **Body Cameras and Surveillance**: The committee debated the use of **body cameras** for staff or **surveillance cameras** in schools. While some members supported body cameras as a tool for accountability and training, others raised concerns about **privacy**, **cost**, and practicality. Representative Raymond noted the **high expense** of body cameras, while Representative Long suggested cameras with **limited ranges** to protect privacy.

5. **Legal and Financial Considerations**: The committee reviewed **statutes from other states**, such as Maine and Texas, for guidance. There was discussion about **unfunded mandates** and the potential for **grants or donations** to offset costs. Representative Nelson proposed a **step-up plan** to gradually implement any new requirements.

6. **Notification and Reporting**: The committee discussed the need for **parental notification** when restraints or seclusion are used. Representative Long questioned the feasibility of notifying parents **prior** to an incident, suggesting that notification should occur **immediately after**.

7. **Future Legislation**: The committee acknowledged that **HB 1269** had expired and discussed whether to propose new legislation. While there was no clear consensus, members agreed on the need for **further research** and **collaboration** to address the complex issues surrounding restraints and seclusion in schools.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committeeâ€™s commitment to **protecting children** and improving **training and accountability** in schools. Both segments highlighted the importance of balancing transparency and safety with financial and logistical challenges. The committee left the discussion open for further exploration, with plans to reconvene soon to finalize recommendations and potentially draft new legislation. The upcoming documentary screening and panel discussion on child advocacy were noted as valuable resources to inform future efforts.
