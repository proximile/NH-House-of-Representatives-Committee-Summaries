The transcript is a guided tour of the New Hampshire State House, led by tour guides Virginia Drew and Margaret Waterhouse. The tour highlights the history, architecture, and significance of the State House, which has stood for over 200 years and undergone several changes, including the addition of a third floor, granite columns, and a golden dome during the Civil War. The tour covers various rooms and features, including:

1. **Exterior and Statues**: The State House’s exterior features statues of notable figures like Daniel Webster, John Stark (associated with New Hampshire’s motto "Live Free or Die"), and John Parker Hale (an abolitionist senator). Franklin Pierce, New Hampshire’s only U.S. president, is also commemorated.

2. **Memorial Hall of Flags**: This room, originally called Doric Hall, houses Civil War and other military flags, many of which are damaged from battle. It honors New Hampshire’s veterans and includes a role of honor listing those who sacrificed their lives.

3. **Representatives Hall**: This room, where the House of Representatives meets, has undergone changes over the centuries. It features portraits of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, John Parker Hale, Franklin Pierce, and Daniel Webster. The golden dome above the hall was added during the Civil War.

4. **House Chamber**: The chamber accommodates 400 representatives, who are paid $100 annually. Voting methods include voice votes, division votes, and electronic voting. The public can observe sessions from the visitors’ gallery.

5. **Senate Chamber**: Smaller than the House Chamber, it seats 24 senators. Voting methods include voice votes, division votes (where senators stand to be counted), and roll call votes. The chamber features murals by artist Barry Faulkner, depicting significant New Hampshire figures and events.

6. **Governor’s Office and Executive Council Chamber**: The governor’s office, located in the newer part of the building, features portraits of recent governors. The Executive Council, a unique feature of New Hampshire’s government, consists of five elected counselors who work with the governor to approve appointments and decisions.

7. **Visitors Center**: The tour concludes in the visitors center, which welcomes guests from around the world, including presidential candidates and New Hampshire school children.

Throughout the tour, the guides emphasize the historical and cultural significance of the State House, its role in New Hampshire’s governance, and its dedication to honoring the state’s veterans and leaders.
