The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Environment and Agriculture Committee meeting on September 4, 2024, centered on fostering the growth of local food production, particularly for small-scale farmers and home-based food businesses, while addressing food safety concerns. The discussions revolved around **House Bill 1685**, which aims to redefine **Homestead Foods as Artisan Foods** and expand production capabilities for local producers. Key themes and proposals from the meeting include:

### **Support for Small-Scale and Home-Based Food Producers**
1. **Market Expansion**: Representatives emphasized the need to help small farmers and home-based producers diversify their income by allowing them to sell **value-added products** such as pumpkin pies, beef casseroles, and other prepared foods. This would provide consumers with more local food options and support economic mobility for families.
2. **Artisan vs. Homestead Labeling**: There was debate over whether to use the term "Artisan" or "Homestead" to describe home-based producers. While "Artisan" highlights quality and craftsmanship, "Homestead" evokes a traditional, rustic image.
3. **Commercial Equipment in Home Kitchens**: A significant discussion focused on whether home-based producers should be allowed to use **commercial-grade equipment** (e.g., refrigerators, mixers) to increase production capacity and safety. Some raised concerns about potential issues like septic system strain, while others supported the idea as a way to professionalize small operations.

### **Food Safety and Regulatory Challenges**
1. **Temperature-Controlled Foods (TCS)**: The **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)** expressed concerns about expanding homestead food operations to include TCS foods (e.g., cheesecakes, soups, dips) due to the limitations of home kitchens and enforcement challenges. However, producers and representatives argued that the current regulations are overly restrictive and hinder growth.
2. **Double Standards**: A notable inconsistency was highlighted, where nonprofits and community events can serve homemade TCS foods without regulation, while individual producers face strict restrictions. This was seen as unfair, especially given the low incidence of foodborne illnesses from such events.
3. **Labeling Requirements**: There was extensive discussion about **labeling**, with concerns about ingredient lists, weight measurements, and the requirement to include home addresses. Suggestions included allowing email addresses or producer numbers instead of physical addresses for safety reasons.

### **Proposed Solutions and Next Steps**
1. **Education and Training**: Representatives proposed **online courses** through UNH Extension or DHHS to educate producers on food safety and labeling requirements. This would help ensure compliance without mandating standardized labels.
2. **Voluntary Certifications**: Suggestions included creating a **voluntary seal of quality** or food safety certification to help consumers identify safe, high-quality products.
3. **Regulatory Reform**: There was a call to **simplify and streamline** current statutes to make them easier to understand and comply with, while still ensuring food safety. Proposed changes included allowing TCS foods under specific conditions (e.g., using commercial-grade refrigeration or coolers) and implementing a **"24-hour rule"** for selling TCS foods within a short window of preparation.
4. **Insurance and Liability**: The discussion touched on the challenges of obtaining insurance for farmers' market vendors, with suggestions to revisit insurance requirements to make it easier for small producers to participate.

### **Economic and Community Impact**
1. **Economic Mobility**: Supporting home-based food businesses was seen as a pathway to **economic mobility**, particularly for families looking to generate income without incurring significant debt. Growing these businesses could also lead to the development of more commercial kitchens.
2. **Rural and Tourism Benefits**: Allowing small producers to expand their offerings would benefit rural areas by increasing access to locally made, high-quality food and supporting tourism through unique, artisanal products.

### **Commitment to Further Action**
The committee acknowledged the complexity of the issues and the need for **further discussions** and **potential legislative changes**. They expressed a commitment to finding solutions that balance food safety, economic opportunity, and the growth of New Hampshire's local food economy.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting underscored the importance of supporting small-scale and home-based food producers while addressing food safety concerns and fostering economic growth. By revisiting regulations, providing education, and exploring innovative solutions, the committee aims to create a more equitable and sustainable environment for local food production in New Hampshire.
