**Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Resources, Recreation and Development (09/25/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on September 25, 2024, focused on key issues related to state park management, water resource protection, and legislative recommendations. Discussions highlighted the challenges of balancing environmental stewardship, economic considerations, and local autonomy, with a preference for non-legislative solutions and strategic planning. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key topics covered:

---

### **State Park Fees and Management**
1. **Reservation System and Revenue**:  
   - The state park reservation system, implemented in 2019, has improved fee compliance and visitor experience.  
   - Concerns were raised about verifying residency for preferential reservations, with potential challenges in preventing system abuse.  
   - While the parks department has seen increased revenue, significant expenses—such as workforce development and operational costs—remain a focus.

2. **Legislative Oversight vs. Autonomy**:  
   - **Senate Bill 345**, which proposed changes to state park fees, was not recommended (14-1). Members preferred leaving fee decisions to the parks department rather than legislative intervention.  
   - Representatives debated whether Granite Staters should receive discounts or preferential treatment, emphasizing the need for a strategic, business-like approach to fee structures.  
   - Logistical concerns, such as proving residency at park entrances and potential traffic backups, were also discussed.

### **Legislative Recommendations**
1. **House Bill 1229: Shoreline Water Quality Protection Act**:  
   - The bill aimed to require notification to buyers of properties within shoreline protection zones about their responsibilities under the Shoreline Water Quality Protection Act.  
   - Concerns about limited space on property sale forms led to discussions about alternative solutions, such as creating pamphlets or educational materials for buyers.  
   - Environmental organizations like the Lake Winnipesaukee Association and New Hampshire Lakes were praised for their educational efforts.  
   - The bill was not recommended (15-0), with a focus on non-legislative solutions, broader education for all shoreline property owners, and local enforcement through ordinances.

2. **House Bill 1483: Water Supply Studies for Subdivisions**:  
   - The bill would allow local planning boards to require water supply studies for new subdivisions to ensure adequate water resources.  
   - Concerns were raised about the high cost of hydrological studies and their potential impact on workforce housing development.  
   - Some argued that towns already have the authority to require such studies, making the bill unnecessary, while others supported it to protect water resources and address impacts on neighboring properties and farms.  
   - The bill was narrowly recommended (8-7) and refiled (LSR 2025-0049) for further discussion in future sessions.
