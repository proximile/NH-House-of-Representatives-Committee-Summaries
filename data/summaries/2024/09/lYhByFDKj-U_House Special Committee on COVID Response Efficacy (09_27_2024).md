**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (09/27/2024)**

On September 27, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened to evaluate the state's and federal agencies' handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the efficacy of measures, transparency in vaccine safety monitoring, and recommendations for future preparedness. The meeting was divided into three segments, each addressing distinct but interconnected aspects of the pandemic response.

### **Overview and Report Drafting**
The committee began by discussing the drafting of a report assessing New Hampshire's COVID-19 response. Representative Belgum presented a rough draft of the introduction, outlining the committee's purpose and the evidence gathered. The report will examine the state's actions, including mandates, vaccines, and other measures, and their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of the virus and reducing morbidity and mortality. Key findings included the lack of a clear, overriding goal in the state's response and the ineffectiveness of measures like masking and business closures in preventing COVID-19 from becoming endemic. The committee emphasized the need for controlled studies to evaluate individual measures and recommended future responses focus on engineering solutions (e.g., improved air filtration) and targeted protection for vulnerable populations rather than broad restrictions.

### **Vaccine Efficacy and Transparency**
The committee delved into the efficacy and transparency of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly the handling of data by federal agencies like the FDA and NIH. Concerns were raised about the FDA's delays in releasing vaccine-related records, with some FOIA requests taking up to 24-36 months to process. The committee highlighted the lack of public access to safety monitoring data, such as adverse event reports, and criticized the FDA's reliance on VAERS and other systems that have identified safety signals but remain inaccessible to the public. The NIH was also scrutinized for its slow release of communications, which revealed that reports of severe adverse events were forwarded to top officials but not adequately followed up.

The discussion also addressed the differences between emergency use authorization (EUA) and full licensure, noting that EUA vaccines were widely promoted as safe and effective despite limited clinical trial data on transmission prevention and long-term safety. Ethical concerns were raised about the NIH holding patents for vaccine technology while regulating and funding studies, as well as the potential influence of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 on public opinion and data disclosure.

### **Testimony on Safety Monitoring and FOIA Challenges**
Risa Evans, a staff attorney at Children's Health Defense, provided testimony on her efforts to obtain safety monitoring data through FOIA requests. She highlighted the challenges of accessing records from the CDC, FDA, and NIH, including delays, denials, and heavy redactions. Evans emphasized the importance of post-authorization safety monitoring, particularly for populations excluded from clinical trials, such as pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and children. She detailed the three types of monitoring: passive (VAERS), active (FDA's use of large healthcare databases), and unofficial (individual reports to agencies like the NIH).

Evans also discussed legal challenges to compel the release of records, noting that the CDC produced heavily redacted daily priority reports and PRR data but withheld critical information on safety signals. The FDA's backlog of documents related to Pfizer and Moderna licensing cases further delayed transparency efforts. Evans criticized the lack of transparency, arguing that public access to safety monitoring data is essential for informed decision-making and trust in public health initiatives.

### **Key Recommendations and Future Preparedness**
The committee concluded with a focus on future preparedness, emphasizing the need for better decision-making processes, collaboration with diverse viewpoints, and clear, consistent messaging to counteract misinformation and fear. Recommendations included:
- Prioritizing engineering solutions over reliance on personal protective equipment.
- Implementing targeted protection for vulnerable populations rather than broad restrictions.
- Advocating for greater transparency and accountability from federal agencies.
- Improving the state's ability to analyze and respond to data in real time during future pandemics.

### **Next Steps**
The committee plans to refine the report further and hold additional discussions on specific topics, including the state's After Action Report and potential testimonies from healthcare professionals. The next meeting is scheduled for October 4, 2024.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities and challenges of New Hampshire's COVID-19 response, particularly regarding the efficacy of measures, vaccine transparency, and safety monitoring. The committee's findings and recommendations aim to inform a more effective and transparent approach to future public health crises.
