### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (09/27/2024)

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened on September 27, 2024, to evaluate the state’s and federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan committee focused on science-based fact-finding, examining issues such as federal guidance, funding, emergency use authorizations (EUAs), vaccination efforts, transparency, and the efficacy of public health measures. The meeting highlighted significant concerns about transparency, accountability, and the unintended consequences of pandemic response strategies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and findings from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Transparency and Access to Vaccine Safety Data**
A central theme of the meeting was the lack of transparency in accessing critical data related to COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring. Risa Evans, a staff attorney at Children's Health Defense, testified about her efforts to obtain records through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests from federal agencies such as the CDC, FDA, and NIH. She highlighted systemic challenges, including denials, delays, and excessive redactions, particularly under exemptions like the B5 (deliberative process) clause. Despite the urgent public need for transparency, agencies often failed to meet deadlines or provided heavily redacted documents.

Key safety monitoring systems discussed included:
- **Passive Monitoring (VAERS)**: Captures adverse event reports but lacks causal analysis.
- **Active Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of healthcare databases to identify safety signals.
- **Unofficial Monitoring**: Communications from vaccine-injured individuals to agencies like the NIH.

Litigation was often necessary to compel agencies to release data, and even then, critical information remained inaccessible. The committee raised concerns about the abandonment of pre-determined safety monitoring criteria and advocated for a federal data transparency statute to ensure public access without requiring FOIA requests or litigation.

#### **2. Vaccine Efficacy and Safety Concerns**
The committee questioned the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly regarding their ability to prevent transmission, reduce morbidity and mortality, and the lack of robust clinical trials supporting these claims. Testimony highlighted concerns about adverse events and the absence of detailed safety data from preclinical studies. The FDA’s reliance on Bayesian data mining (EB mining) for safety monitoring was noted, but the results were not disclosed, further undermining transparency.

Additionally, the NIH’s handling of adverse event reports was scrutinized. Emails revealed that individuals reported severe reactions, but some studies to investigate these reactions were never completed. High-level officials, including Dr. Peter Marks, were aware of these reports but continued to publicly assert vaccine safety.

#### **3. Federal and State Response Evaluation**
The committee evaluated the efficacy of state and federal responses to the pandemic, concluding that many measures, such as mask mandates, social distancing, and business closures, lacked clear evidence of significantly slowing the spread of the virus or reducing hospitalizations. The cumulative impact of these measures was deemed ineffective.

The federal government’s role in influencing public opinion through grants and media campaigns was also discussed. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, which repealed prohibitions on government propagandizing, was highlighted as a factor enabling this influence. The committee expressed concerns about potential censorship of information that conflicted with the official narrative, further eroding public trust.

#### **4. Adverse Effects of Pandemic Measures**
Representatives discussed the unintended consequences of pandemic measures, particularly stay-at-home recommendations, school closures, and the psychological toll on the public. The impact on education, children’s mental health, and the economy was significant. Mixed messages from federal and state authorities contributed to public confusion and mistrust.

School district responses were inconsistent, with some misallocating funds for COVID mitigation, such as purchasing Chromebooks that were never distributed instead of investing in air filtration systems or other health-focused upgrades.

#### **5. Recommendations for Future Pandemics**
The committee emphasized the need for a unified, science-based approach to future pandemics. Key recommendations included:
- **Prioritizing Engineering Solutions**: Focus on improving air quality in buildings rather than relying solely on reactive measures like PPE.
- **Transparency and Public Access to Data**: Ensure that safety monitoring data and decision-making processes are accessible to the public.
- **Bipartisan Collaboration**: Address the political divisiveness that plagued the COVID-19 response by fostering bipartisan cooperation.
- **Targeted Measures**: Identify vulnerable populations and implement tailored interventions rather than broad, one-size-fits-all mandates.

#### **6. Final Report and Next Steps**
The committee outlined the structure of its final report, which will include a summary of evidence, factual analysis, and actionable recommendations for improving New Hampshire’s preparedness for future public health crises. The report will aim to be balanced, credible, and focused on lessons learned. The meeting adjourned with plans to reconvene on October 4, 2024, to finalize the report.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the challenges in accessing critical data, the unintended consequences of pandemic measures, and the need for greater transparency and accountability in public health decision-making. The committee’s findings and recommendations aim to inform a more effective, transparent, and science-based response to future public health crises, while rebuilding public trust in government institutions.
