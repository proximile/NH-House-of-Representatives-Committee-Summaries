**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: JLCAR Administrative Rules (09/19/24)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) convened on September 19, 2024, to discuss and review a wide range of administrative rules across various state departments. The meeting addressed critical issues related to education, public safety, natural resources, revenue, and health, among others. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **1. Medicaid and Health and Human Services Rules**
- **Protective Income Level Rules**: The committee discussed the implementation of Medicaid rules tied to protective income limits. While the law was enacted in 2023, formal rulemaking was delayed due to internal processes. The committee viewed the rules as the final step in codifying the chapter law.
- **Health and Human Services**: The committee questioned the delay in implementing rules related to a 2020 statute that was temporarily suspended and reinstated in 2023. They sought clarification from the department on the timeline and process.

---

### **2. Passenger Tramway Safety Rules**
- The committee reviewed **Proposal 2024-145**, which updates passenger tramway safety rules. Some discrepancies in citations and definitions were noted, but the Department of Safety clarified these were editorial errors. The committee conditionally approved the rule with necessary editorial changes.

---

### **3. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources**
- **Emergency Rules**: The committee questioned the necessity of emergency rules, given the department had seven years to update rules through regular rulemaking. The department admitted to being behind and unaware of the interim rule process. The committee strongly recommended interim rulemaking to address the lack of rules and continue regular updates.
- **Petitioning Emergency Rules**: While there was discussion about petitioning to repeal the emergency rules, the committee opted to focus on encouraging the department to proceed with interim and regular rulemaking rather than burdening it with a formal petition.

---

### **4. Department of Revenue: Equalization Manual**
- The committee reviewed a letter from the Department of Revenue regarding the **equalization manual**. The department acknowledged it should be treated as a rule rather than guidance. The committee noted that while some parts are indeed guidance, this is an internal matter for the department to address.

---

### **5. Transition in Administrative Roles**
- It was announced that the current director of administrative roles is retiring at the end of November, and **Douglas Osterhout** has been hired as the new director. The outgoing director will remain for six weeks to assist with the transition.

---

### **6. Department of Education Rules**
The committee focused on proposed administrative rules related to public school approval, class sizes, educator-student ratios, and instructional programs. Key points included:
- **Class Size and Educator Ratios**: Concerns were raised about shifting from specific class size caps to educator-student ratios, which some feared could lead to larger class sizes in underfunded schools. The Department of Education clarified that class size recommendations remain, and the changes aim to provide flexibility based on student needs.
- **Definition of "Educator"**: The new definition expands to include paraprofessionals and other staff, which critics argued could dilute instruction quality. The department maintained this aligns with statutory requirements.
- **Instructional Programs vs. Learning Opportunities**: Replacing "instructional programs" with "learning opportunities" sparked debate over accountability for structured, teacher-led instruction. The department argued the changes align with statutory language and emphasize competency-based learning.
- **Public Input**: Educators and advocates testified, raising concerns about the potential negative impact on student learning, particularly in underfunded districts. They argued the rules do not adequately address diverse learning needs or incorporate public feedback.
- **Legal and Statutory Alignment**: The department emphasized the rules align with existing statutes and aim to provide clarity. The committee decided to review the latest version and consider further public input before finalizing.

---

### **7. Agriculture Rules (Animal Population Control)**
- The rules lacked a public comment summary and had clarity issues, particularly around undefined terms like "checks and award letters." Concerns were also raised about requiring Social Security numbers without clear statutory authority. The committee postponed the rule for further clarification.

---

### **8. Solid Waste Facility Requirements**
- The committee approved rules for a **permit-by-notification system** for non-select recyclable materials, deeming it voluntary and not in violation of Article 28a of the state constitution.

---

### **9. Manufactured Housing Installation Standards**
- The rules had expired, and there were issues with citation accuracy. The department agreed to make necessary changes, and the committee granted conditional approval pending updates.

---

### **10. Alteration of Terrain Rules**
- The rules, which expired in 2008, included a new schedule of fines for stormwater regulation violations. Concerns were raised about subjective terms like "moderate" and "major" potential harm, but the committee approved the rules with noted issues.

---

### **11. Cyanobacteria Mitigation Fund Rules**
- The rules had recently expired, and the department was working to adopt new rules to continue funding projects. The committee approved the rules to ensure timely decision-making on grant applications.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee's emphasis on clarity, fidelity to statutory authority, and timely rule updates. Many rules were conditionally approved or postponed to address outstanding issues. The committee also stressed the importance of public input and the need for departments to prioritize interim and regular rulemaking to avoid reliance on emergency rules. The next continued meeting was canceled, with plans to reconvene after further review and public consultation.
