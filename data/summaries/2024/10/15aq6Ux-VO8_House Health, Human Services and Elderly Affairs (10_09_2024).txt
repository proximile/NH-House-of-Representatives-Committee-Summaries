### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (October 9, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on October 9, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on several bills. The meeting, which included both work and executive sessions, focused on evaluating the merits, concerns, and potential recommendations for future legislation across a range of healthcare and social service issues. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

#### **Key Bills Discussed and Outcomes**

1. **HB 1347 (Immigration Bill)**  
   The committee agreed that while immigration legislation is important, this bill was not the appropriate platform for addressing such issues. Concerns were raised about its unamendability and inability to effectively address immigration. The committee found the bill inadvisable and unworkable, particularly in its attempt to restrict state funds for the refugee resettlement program until all social determinants of health were met for citizens. The committee voted not to recommend it for future legislation.

2. **HB 1661 (Immunization Reporting Requirements)**  
   Representatives expressed concerns about the bill's burdensome requirements, such as including vaccination history on death certificates, potential privacy breaches, and unnecessary bureaucracy. The committee ultimately voted not to recommend it for future legislation, citing privacy issues and the burden on healthcare providers.

3. **HB 1663 (Confidentiality of Medical Records)**  
   This bill aimed to enhance patient privacy protections, but some members felt it needed refinement. Concerns were raised about the repeal-and-replace approach. The committee recommended future legislation to address medical record confidentiality more effectively.

4. **SB 95 (Certification of Alcohol and Drug Treatment Facilities)**  
   The subcommittee recommended further legislation to establish oversight for outpatient substance use disorder programs. Members emphasized the need to protect vulnerable patients while allowing for program innovation.

5. **HB 1706 (Notice Required Prior to Circumcision)**  
   The bill sparked debate about informed consent in medical procedures. While some members opposed its specificity to circumcision, others highlighted broader issues with the current informed consent process in healthcare. The committee decided not to recommend it for future legislation but emphasized the importance of informed consent in medical procedures.

6. **SB 400 (Patient Access to Medical Records)**  
   No significant discussion occurred during the meeting, but the committee later recommended future legislation to improve patient access to medical records, focusing on reducing costs and ensuring patients can access their information without excessive fees.

7. **SB 458 (Dispensing of Certain Medications)**  
   Similarly, no major discussion took place, and the committee proceeded without further comments.

8. **Psychedelics for Therapeutic Use (HB 1693)**  
   Members supported allowing clinical trials for psychedelics in New Hampshire, particularly for PTSD and end-of-life care, but opposed broader legalization without further research. The committee recommended future legislation to permit the use of psychedelics in clinical trials and therapy.

9. **Senate Bill 495 (Substance Abuse Treatment)**  
   The committee debated the bill, with some members supporting it for its importance in recovery programs and protecting vulnerable individuals in Manchester. Others opposed it, citing concerns about stifling innovation and impacting recovery ecosystems. The motion to recommend the bill for future legislation passed with an 11 to 4 vote.

10. **HB 1067 (Endometriosis and Hysterectomy Advocacy)**  
    Lindsay Taylor Jackson and Maggie K shared personal stories of suffering from endometriosis and the challenges they faced in obtaining hysterectomies. The committee discussed the bill, which focuses on ensuring women have access to necessary medical treatments without being denied due to potential future fertility concerns.

11. **HB 554 FN (Alternative Therapies for Opioid Crisis)**  
    The bill aims to increase access to alternative therapies for pain management to address the opioid crisis. Representative Nagel highlighted its importance, but concerns were raised about legislating medical practice and ensuring insurance companies are involved in the process.

12. **HB 580 FN (Child Vision Screening Initiative)**  
    The bill proposes establishing a child vision screening initiative within the State Medicaid Program. The committee recognized the importance of children's vision health and recommended future legislation, emphasizing early intervention to save costs and improve lives.

13. **HB 608 FN (Bureau of Developmental Services Redesign)**  
    The bill aimed to support the redesign of the Bureau of Developmental Services through a pilot program. The committee discussed that the department has already addressed many aspects of the redesign, making the bill unnecessary.

14. **HB 1010 (Expanding Maternity Options and Midwifery Access)**  
    The bill seeks to expand midwifery access and maternity options, particularly for certain types of deliveries. Concerns were raised about the scope of practice for midwives and the potential risks involved. The committee recommended future legislation, balancing patient choice with ensuring safe medical practices.

#### **Themes and Priorities**
Throughout the meeting, several recurring themes emerged:
- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: The committee emphasized the importance of protecting patient privacy, particularly in medical records and vaccination reporting.
- **Reducing Bureaucratic Burdens**: Members expressed concerns about adding unnecessary bureaucracy to healthcare processes, as seen in discussions on immunization reporting and medical record access.
- **Informed Consent**: The committee highlighted the need for meaningful informed consent in medical procedures, particularly in the context of circumcision and other surgeries.
- **Innovation and Oversight**: Balancing innovation in treatment programs with the need for oversight was a key concern, especially in discussions on substance abuse treatment and alternative therapies.
- **Early Intervention and Prevention**: The committee recognized the value of early intervention and prevention, as seen in the discussions on children's vision screening and alternative therapies for pain management.

#### **Closing Remarks and Adjournment**
The committee concluded by acknowledging the collaborative efforts of its members and the leadership of the committee chair for running a fair and inclusive process. Gratitude was extended to members, including those not seeking re-election, for their contributions. The meeting ended with final thanks and adjournment.

Overall, the committee's discussions reflected a thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing immediate healthcare needs while ensuring that future legislation is well-considered, practical, and respectful of patient rights and privacy.
