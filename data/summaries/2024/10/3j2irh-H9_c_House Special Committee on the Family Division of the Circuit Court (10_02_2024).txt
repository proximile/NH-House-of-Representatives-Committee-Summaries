The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on October 2, 2024, to address critical issues impacting the fairness and efficiency of family court proceedings. The committee’s discussions centered on the judicial selection process, the prevalence and challenges of perjury in family law cases, and potential legislative and systemic reforms to improve outcomes for families. Here is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### Judicial Selection Process
The committee acknowledged the robust and refined process for selecting judges, which has evolved since Governor Shaheen’s tenure. Members noted that the current system is more rigorous than the process for selecting administrative officials, ensuring that qualified and capable judges are appointed to the bench.

### Perjury in Family Law Cases
A significant portion of the meeting focused on the issue of perjury and false statements in family court cases. Key challenges identified included:
- **Difficulty in Prosecuting Perjury**: Proving false statements beyond a reasonable doubt is a high legal standard, making perjury cases difficult and time-consuming to prosecute. Judges often address false testimony by disregarding it rather than pursuing criminal charges, as criminal proceedings can exacerbate family conflict.
- **Impact on Families**: False claims, particularly those made to authorities like the Department of Children and Families (DCF) or police, can lead to prolonged legal battles, reputational harm, and extended separation of children from a parent. These issues often retraumatize families and undermine trust in the judicial system.
- **Credibility Determinations**: Judges face challenges in assessing credibility, especially in cases involving neurodivergent individuals. Better training for judges and attorneys was emphasized to improve fairness in these determinations.

### Judicial Practices and Discretion
The committee discussed the role of judicial discretion in addressing false statements:
- **Judicial Oversight**: Judges have the authority to address false testimony within family court proceedings, often by disbelieving statements rather than referring cases for criminal prosecution. This approach is seen as more practical and less harmful to families.
- **Inconsistencies Across Courts**: Concerns were raised about varying practices in different courtrooms, with calls for greater uniformity in handling perjury and ensuring fairness statewide.
- **Support for Judges**: The committee highlighted the need for additional resources, such as clerks and support staff, to help judges manage complex cases effectively.

### Legislative and Systemic Reforms
The committee explored potential legislative and systemic solutions to address the identified issues:
- **Educational Initiatives**: Proposals included creating informational materials, such as booklets or videos, to educate pro se litigants about the legal consequences of perjury and the family court process. Public education campaigns were also suggested to increase awareness.
- **Training and Resources**: Improved training for family court judges and attorneys was emphasized, along with increased funding for support staff to enhance court efficiency and fairness.
- **Alternative Dispute Resolution**: The committee considered whether mediation or administrative tribunals could reduce conflict and improve outcomes in family court cases.
- **Legislative Recommendations**: Potential actions included statutory changes to better protect parental rights, funding for judicial training and support staff, and initiatives to ensure consistent judicial oversight of cases.

### Committee Report
The committee plans to compile a comprehensive report summarizing its findings and recommendations. This report will include educational and aspirational elements, serving as a reference for future committees. A draft is expected to be circulated to members for feedback, with the final report ready by October 22, 2024.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the complexities of addressing perjury in family court and the need for systemic reforms to ensure fairness and protect families. The committee’s discussions highlighted the importance of judicial discretion, better training and resources, and public education to improve the family court system. By focusing on these areas, the committee aims to reduce the emotional and legal toll on families and enhance the integrity of the judicial process.
