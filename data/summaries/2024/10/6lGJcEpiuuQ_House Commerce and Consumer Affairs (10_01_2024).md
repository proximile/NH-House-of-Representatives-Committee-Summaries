The New Hampshire House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on October 1, 2024, to discuss two significant bills: **House Bill 1674**, which proposed making gold and silver legal tender in the state, and **House Bill 225**, which aimed to prohibit the use of currency that could infringe on privacy rights. Both discussions highlighted the complexities of modernizing monetary systems while addressing practical concerns and protecting individual freedoms.

### House Bill 1674: Gold and Silver as Legal Tender
The committee reviewed **House Bill 1674**, originally a multifaceted proposal that included declaring gold and silver as legal tender, establishing a state bullion depository, and issuing digital tokens backed by gold. The sponsor later narrowed the focus to the legal tender aspect. Key points from the discussion included:

1. **Municipal Concerns**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Municipal Association raised logistical challenges, such as fluctuating commodity prices, storage of precious metals, and the complexity of converting gold and silver into usable funds for daily operations. They emphasized the burden this could place on municipalities.

2. **Legal Tender Debate**: There was debate over whether gold coins should be accepted at their face value (as legal tender) or their commodity value. Currently, municipalities are required to accept legal tender, but gold coins are typically valued at their face value, which is significantly lower than their market value.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The committee noted that several states, including Arizona, Texas, and Utah, have passed similar legislation. They suggested studying how these states have implemented such laws and whether they are actively being used.

4. **Recommendation and Motion**: The subcommittee voted 2-0 to recommend **not** advancing House Bill 1674 for future legislation but suggested studying the legal tender amendment (2024-25 3H) and learning from other states' experiences. The goal is to ensure that any future legislation does not burden municipalities and is carefully crafted.

### House Bill 225: Prohibiting Privacy-Infringing Currency
The committee also discussed **House Bill 225**, introduced by Representative Mike Belcher in the previous year and sent to interim study due to concerns about its wording. Belcher submitted written testimony emphasizing the need to protect New Hampshire residents from digital control mechanisms that threaten freedom and privacy, while acknowledging the bill’s shortcomings and requesting further study.

1. **Expert Testimony**: The committee invited **Nicholas Anthony**, a policy analyst from the Cato Institute and an expert on digital currency, to provide testimony. Anthony explained the concept of **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**, which are digital national currencies issued by central banks. He highlighted the risks CBDCs pose to financial privacy, freedom, and markets, citing examples from countries like Nigeria, the Bahamas, and Thailand where CBDCs have been implemented with limited success and significant restrictions on citizens.

2. **Legislative Approaches**: Anthony outlined four legislative approaches states can take regarding CBDCs:
   - **Prohibit their use entirely**, though this raises enforcement and privacy concerns.
   - **Exclude CBDCs from the definition of money** in state statutes, which leaves users without legal protections.
   - **Prohibit state agencies from using or participating in CBDC programs**, which he considered the most balanced approach.
   - **Raise awareness and advocate against CBDCs** through education and outreach to federal lawmakers.

3. **Committee Inquiry**: Committee members asked questions about the practical implications of CBDCs, their invasive nature, and the potential for state-level action. Anthony emphasized that while CBDCs are not widely used, they pose significant threats to privacy and freedom, and states should take proactive measures to limit their adoption. He also noted that states like North Carolina have already passed legislation to restrict state involvement with CBDCs, demonstrating bipartisan concern over the issue.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the complexities of integrating gold and silver as legal tender and the need for careful consideration to avoid burdening municipalities. Simultaneously, it highlighted the growing concerns over digital currencies, particularly CBDCs, and their potential threats to privacy and freedom. The committee expressed interest in exploring legislation to protect New Hampshire residents’ privacy rights and recommended further study of both issues to inform future legislative actions.
