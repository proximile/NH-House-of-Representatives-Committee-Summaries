**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (10/01/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on October 1, 2024, to address procedural matters and deliberate on two significant bills: **House Bill 225** and **House Bill 1674**. The meeting began with a procedural segment, during which the committee referenced "d373" as a starting point and discussed researching practices from other states. The committee proceeded to a vote, resulting in a unanimous decision of "two to zero," before concluding the segment with thanks.

### **House Bill 225: Prohibiting Currency Detrimental to Privacy Rights**
Introduced by Representative Mike Belcher, **House Bill 225** aims to protect New Hampshire residents from digital control mechanisms that threaten privacy and liberty. The bill specifically targets Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which are seen as a potential risk to financial privacy and freedom. 

**Nicholas Anthony**, a policy analyst from the Cato Institute, provided expert testimony on the dangers of CBDCs. He explained how these digital currencies could centralize financial transactions under government control, leading to potential misuse of data and restrictions on financial freedom. Anthony suggested three legislative approaches for states to address CBDCs, with the third option—prohibiting state agencies from using CBDCs—being the most balanced.

The committee acknowledged the importance of protecting privacy rights but felt the bill was not yet ready for prime time due to wording issues. Representative Belcher requested further study to develop better language for a future session. The committee also referenced similar bills passed in other states, such as North Carolina, as examples of proactive legislation in this area.

### **House Bill 1674: Legal Tender for Gold and Silver**
**House Bill 1674** originally proposed making gold and silver legal tender, establishing a bullion depository, and issuing digital tokens backed by gold. However, the committee narrowed its focus to the legal tender aspect, excluding the depository and digital tokens.

**Katherine Hack**, representing the Municipal Association, raised concerns about the practicality of mandating municipalities to accept gold and silver. She highlighted several logistical challenges, including fluctuating commodity prices, storage issues, and the complexity of converting precious metals to cash.

The committee recognized the intent behind the bill to protect against federal monetary policy risks but expressed reservations about its feasibility. They discussed the need to study how other states, such as Arizona, Texas, and Utah, have implemented similar laws and whether they have faced practical challenges. The subcommittee recommended **not advancing** the bill for future legislation but suggested studying the issue further, particularly focusing on the legal tender amendment (2024-25 3H) as a potential starting point.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **House Bill 225**: The committee recognized the importance of protecting privacy from digital currency threats but agreed the bill needed refinement. They recommended further study and referenced expert testimony on CBDCs.
2. **House Bill 1674**: The committee acknowledged the intent to protect against federal monetary policy risks but expressed concerns about the practicality of mandating gold and silver as legal tender for municipalities. They recommended studying other states' experiences before moving forward.

Both discussions emphasized the need for careful consideration and proactive legislation to address emerging financial and privacy concerns. The committee's approach reflected a commitment to balancing innovation with the protection of individual rights and practical governance.
