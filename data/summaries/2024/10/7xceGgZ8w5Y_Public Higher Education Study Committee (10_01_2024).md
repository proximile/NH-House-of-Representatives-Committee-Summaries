**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Higher Education Study Committee Meeting (10/01/2024)**

On October 1, 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Public Higher Education Study Committee convened to address critical issues and initiatives aimed at enhancing the state’s public higher education system. The meeting focused on improving accessibility, affordability, and alignment with workforce needs, while fostering collaboration between the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH) and the University System of New Hampshire (USNH). Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and initiatives:

---

### **Committee Goals and Context**
The committee’s overarching mission is to:
- Increase educational attainment and accessibility for New Hampshire students.
- Minimize program duplication and create economies of scale between CCSNH and USNH.
- Address demographic shifts, rising costs, and workforce demands.
- Ensure seamless educational pathways to retain students in-state and meet the needs of an aging workforce.

### **Key Initiatives and Progress**

1. **Transferability and Pathways**:
   - The committee reviewed progress on transfer pathways established under House Bill 1530, with approximately 100 pathways now in place. These pathways allow students to seamlessly transfer credits from community colleges to universities, reducing redundant coursework and bureaucratic hurdles.
   - Efforts are underway to implement a **transfer equivalency system** and **direct admission**, which would automatically admit students who complete community college programs into university programs without additional application fees or steps.

2. **Early College Programs**:
   - Early College programs, which enable high school students to earn college credits, were highlighted as a success. These programs anchor students in New Hampshire, saving over $10 million in tuition costs last year. However, funding constraints limit students to two courses annually, despite statutes allowing up to four.
   - The state invests $2.5 million annually in these programs, which are tied to pathways from community colleges to universities, increasing the likelihood of students staying in-state for higher education.

3. **Affordability and Tuition Freezes**:
   - The committee acknowledged the challenge of maintaining affordability while freezing tuition rates for six years. With shrinking demographics and tuition as a primary revenue source, USNH is exploring cost containment measures and potential tuition adjustments to avoid deficits.

4. **Three-Year Bachelor’s Degrees**:
   - Plymouth State University has proposed five bachelor’s degree programs that can be completed in three years with fewer than 120 credits. These programs, including criminal justice, cybersecurity, and outdoor adventure leadership, are pending approval from the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

5. **Shared Administrative Offices and Unified Accreditation**:
   - CCSNH and USNH are collaborating to share administrative offices on the NHTI campus, expected to save USNH $250,000 annually in rent.
   - The committee discussed ongoing efforts to explore **unified accreditation** for the state’s public higher education institutions, aiming to streamline administrative processes and create a more seamless experience for students.

6. **Technology and ERP System**:
   - USNH is implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to modernize HR, finance, and student management processes. The HR and finance components are set to go live in December 2024, with the student system expected by 2027.

### **Challenges and Barriers**

1. **Data and Communication**:
   - A significant barrier identified was the lack of access to student contact information, limiting the ability to directly communicate with high school students about college opportunities. Legislative solutions were discussed to address these data-sharing issues.

2. **Program Costs and Workforce Alignment**:
   - The increasing cost of delivering vital programs like nursing and advanced manufacturing was emphasized, particularly as student interest shifts away from liberal arts and business programs. Balancing affordability with program quality remains a challenge.

3. **Faculty and Advisor Training**:
   - Ensuring faculty and advisors are well-trained to guide students through pathway requirements, particularly in competitive fields like engineering and healthcare, is critical to the success of transfer and early college initiatives.

4. **Guidance Counselors**:
   - The role of guidance counselors has shifted more toward mental health support, creating gaps in career and college advising. This has limited students’ ability to navigate postsecondary opportunities effectively.

### **Workforce Development and Non-Traditional Students**

1. **Industry-Recognized Credentials**:
   - The committee emphasized incorporating industry-recognized credentials and prior learning into degree programs, particularly for adult learners and those with military or work experience. This approach aims to make higher education more accessible and cost-effective for non-traditional students.

2. **Internships and Workforce Connections**:
   - Both CCSNH and USNH are working to connect students with businesses and nonprofits through internships, externships, and clinical placements. These experiences are vital for preparing students for the workforce and increasing retention in New Hampshire.

---

### **Reporting and Accountability**
The chancellors of CCSNH and USNH are required to submit quarterly progress reports and an annual report to the committee, governor, and other stakeholders, starting in November 2024. This ensures transparency and accountability in implementing the discussed initiatives.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of collaboration, innovation, and investment in public higher education to address New Hampshire’s workforce needs, demographic challenges, and rising costs. Key initiatives like transfer pathways, early college programs, and industry credential recognition are designed to improve accessibility, affordability, and efficiency. However, challenges such as data-sharing barriers, program costs, and faculty training must be addressed to ensure the success of these efforts. The committee remains committed to fostering a cohesive and forward-thinking higher education system that benefits students, the workforce, and the state as a whole.
