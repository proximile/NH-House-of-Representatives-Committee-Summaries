**Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (October 22, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on October 22, 2024, to discuss the finalization of an interim report and address key issues within the Family Division. The meeting focused on subcommittee findings, legislative impacts, and recommendations for improving court processes. Key discussions and decisions included:

1. **Interim Report Finalization**:  
   The committee deliberated on adopting an interim report, which incorporates three subcommittee reports and a memo summarizing new legislation influenced by the committee’s work. While some members suggested immediate finalization, the committee opted to reconvene the following Tuesday to incorporate additional input. Vice Chair Representative Smith was tasked with compiling and organizing suggestions for the final draft. The subcommittee reports were unanimously accepted and will be included in the final report.  

2. **Legislative Impact and Collaboration**:  
   The committee acknowledged its role in the passage of new laws, particularly in family court reforms. Members debated including a self-congratulatory section in the report but ultimately chose modest language, crediting the committee’s efforts as part of a broader collaborative initiative. Historical context and past contributions were emphasized to ensure proper recognition of all stakeholders.  

3. **Judicial Support Recommendations**:  
   A significant discussion centered on the need for additional resources for family court judges, such as law clerks or judicial assistants, to enhance efficiency and reduce case resolution delays. This recommendation was proposed for inclusion in the final report.  

4. **Subcommittee Reports and Recommendations**:  
   - **Court Communication**: The subcommittee, chaired by Representative Greg, reviewed improvements in court communication practices, including a pilot program for text notifications in Rockingham County. The committee praised the judiciary’s proactive approach and recommended continued collaboration.  
   - **Perjury in Family Law Cases**: Representative Lynn presented findings on perjury, concluding that existing legal remedies are sufficient but challenging to prove. The subcommittee suggested improving public awareness of these remedies through judicial publications and highlighted the importance of judicial consistency.  
   - **Title IV and Social Security Act**: Representative Kab discussed the subcommittee’s findings on Title IV funding and its impact on the Family Division. The report noted that wage garnishment for child support is federally mandated and that New Hampshire complies with these requirements. While acknowledging potential negative impacts on employment, the committee recommended monitoring the implementation of recent legislation (HB 564) before considering further changes.  

5. **Wage Garnishment and Background Checks**:  
   The committee debated the implications of wage garnishment for child support appearing on background checks, particularly for sensitive jobs like law enforcement. Some members suggested legislative action to mitigate potential biases, while others called for further research before making recommendations.  

6. **Committee Motions and Votes**:  
   The committee accepted the subcommittee reports on court communication and perjury, incorporating them into the final report. The Title IV subcommittee report was also accepted without recommending immediate legislative changes.  

The meeting concluded with plans to finalize the interim report the following week, ensuring all recommendations and inputs were adequately addressed. The committee’s discussions underscored its commitment to improving the Family Division’s processes, addressing systemic challenges, and ensuring compliance with federal mandates while considering the broader implications for individuals and families.
