The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Fish and Game and Marine Resources held a meeting on October 15, 2024, to discuss four interim study bills. The committee reviewed and voted on recommendations for future legislation for each bill. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **HB 1024 (Air Rifles for Hunting Game)**: The committee unanimously recommended pursuing future legislation based on guidelines from the Department of Fish and Game and the Commission. A summer work session with stakeholders supported this recommendation.

2. **HB 1148 (Fishing Game Commission)**: The committee voted not to recommend this bill for future legislation.

3. **HB 1530 FN (Body Cameras for Fish and Game Officers)**: The committee recommended future legislation, emphasizing the need for funding and a clear policy framework for body camera use.

4. **HB 1532 (Landowner Rights for Game Cameras and Tree Stands)**: The committee recommended future legislation to clarify landowners' rights to remove unauthorized game cameras or tree stands without involving law enforcement.

The committee chair highlighted the ceremonial nature of the votes, noting that their recommendations do not bind future legislatures. Members were tasked with submitting brief reports on their motions by the end of the week. The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the committee's work and farewells to members not returning next term.
