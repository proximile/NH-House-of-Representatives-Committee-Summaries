**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program (10/29/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Legislative Oversight Committee convened on October 29, 2024, to review and discuss proposed changes to the **Education Improvement and Assessment Program**, focusing on **Rule 30614** and broader issues related to academic standards, student-teacher ratios, and curriculum frameworks. The meeting highlighted key concerns, debates, and recommendations across three main areas:

---

### **1. Student-Teacher Ratios and Class Sizes**
The committee extensively discussed **Rule 30614**, which addresses **student-teacher ratios** and **class sizes**. Key points included:
- **Concerns About Class Size Variability**: Members raised alarms over the wide disparity in class sizes across schools, grades, and subjects, even when overall student-teacher ratios are met. This variability was seen as particularly problematic for families seeking consistency in class sizes.
- **Funding Implications**: The discussion emphasized how funding formulas based on student-teacher ratios impact local school boards and town legislatures, which ultimately decide whether to allocate resources to address these issues.
- **Rule Changes**: The proposed rule removes existing "guardrails" on class sizes, which some members viewed as problematic. However, it was noted that local boards retain the authority to address class size concerns independently.
- **Definition of Educator**: A key recommendation was to align the **definition of educator** in the rule with the **statutory definition (RSA 21:8)**. This issue remained contentious, as the final language had not yet been reviewed.
- **Motion and Vote**: A motion by **Representative Cordelli**, seconded by **Senator Ward**, recommended the **30614 rule** to the **State Board of Education**, contingent on updating the definition of educator to reflect the RSA statute. The motion passed with a **4-2 vote**.

### **2. Educator Credentials, Extended Learning Opportunities, and Instructional Time**
The committee delved into several related topics:
- **Educator Credentials**: Debates centered on ensuring educators are credentialed in their specific content areas and how this affects class size calculations, particularly in middle and high schools.
- **Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs)**: The committee reviewed the definition of ELOs, aiming to streamline rules while ensuring clarity and consistency with existing statutes.
- **Instructional Time and School Facilities**: Discussions included the definition of instructional time across grade levels and rules ensuring clean, healthy, and safe learning environments.
- **Policy Mandates for School Boards**: The committee questioned whether school boards should be mandated to adopt specific policies, such as those related to culture and climate, and whether such mandates align with statutory references.
- **Library and Curriculum Resources**: The committee debated the organization and cataloging of library resources, considering whether to retain references to the American Library Association or allow more flexibility for schools.

### **3. Academic Standards and Curriculum Frameworks**
The committee reviewed the location and definition of **academic standards** and **curriculum frameworks**:
- **Location of Academic Standards**: The committee concluded that academic standards belong in **curriculum frameworks**, not administrative rules. Historical context, including the passage of **HB 1075 (1998)** and **HB 1107 (2024)**, reinforced this decision.
- **Proposed Rule Changes**: Concerns were raised about proposed changes to **ED 306**, which would require public schools to align curricula with curriculum frameworks. Members noted that some frameworks, such as the 2001 Arts framework, are outdated and need updating before mandating compliance.
- **Department of Education’s Role**: The absence of Department of Education representatives at the meeting was criticized, as it hindered technical clarity and public confidence. The committee chair defended the commissioner, noting prior discussions and input.
- **Legislative Oversight**: The committee emphasized its role in reviewing and recommending changes to academic standards, ensuring the state board does not unilaterally amend or approve new standards without legislative oversight.
- **Flexibility and Local Control**: The discussion highlighted the importance of flexibility for local schools in implementing instructional approaches, balancing local control with the need for consistent, updated state standards.

---

### **Outcomes and Next Steps**
- The committee finalized its recommendation to the **State Board of Education**, supporting **Rule 30614** with the condition that the definition of educator aligns with the RSA statute.
- Further discussions on proposed rule changes and their alignment with statutory language were deferred, with plans to address specific concerns in subsequent meetings.
- The committee acknowledged the need for periodic reviews and updates to curriculum frameworks to ensure their relevance and effectiveness.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the tension between maintaining local control in education and ensuring consistent, updated standards across the state. Key themes included the importance of clarity in rules, alignment with statutory requirements, and flexibility for local school boards. The committee emphasized the need for collaboration between the legislature and the Department of Education to address these complex issues effectively.
