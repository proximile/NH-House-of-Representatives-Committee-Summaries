**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds Meeting (October 2, 2024)**

The Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds convened on October 2, 2024, to discuss the management, allocation, and potential reforms of various dedicated funds in New Hampshire. The meeting focused on ensuring efficient and transparent fund management, addressing legal and financial concerns, and preparing for legislative actions in the upcoming session. Key discussions and decisions included:

1. **Endowments and Funding Sources**:  
   The committee examined the creation and management of endowments, particularly those established with contributions from organizations like the Nature Conservancy and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Concerns were raised about ensuring donor intent and proper fund usage. Specific attention was given to three endowments for the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters tract—monitoring, stewardship, and road maintenance—which have grown significantly since their inception. The committee debated whether to combine these funds for greater flexibility, particularly to address road maintenance needs, but noted that such changes would require revising state law.

2. **Road Maintenance and Public Access**:  
   Road maintenance was highlighted as critical for public access and property monitoring. The committee emphasized the importance of discerning between the different functions of funds to ensure resources are allocated effectively.

3. **Legal and Political Considerations**:  
   Members acknowledged the need to review legal and political pathways for fund management, including potential legislative changes. The committee planned to conclude negotiations with Aurora for a 10-year management plan, aligning with broader funding discussions.

4. **Fee Adjustments and Fund Reviews**:  
   Several funds were reviewed for potential fee adjustments, including developer fees and fees for private postsecondary career schools. The committee discussed the necessity of updating fees to adequately cover expenses.

5. **Historical Sites and State Parks**:  
   Improvements to historical sites funded by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) were noted. The committee also debated separating the accounting for Cannon Mountain Ski Area and Franconia Notch State Park from the broader state park system to improve management. Questions arose about the allocation of interest earned on $18 million set aside for tram replacement at Cannon Mountain, with the treasurer clarifying that the law does not specify how to allocate this interest, leaving it in the general fund.

6. **Off-Book Accounts and Cleanup**:  
   The treasurer outlined plans to integrate off-book accounts into the state’s accounting system to ensure proper recording and management, enhancing transparency and accountability.

7. **Specific Funds and Programs**:  
   Various funds were discussed, including those for the blind, robotics teams, and coastal resilience. The committee considered the future of these funds, with some recommended for deletion or reorganization.

8. **Revenue Information System Management Fund**:  
   The committee reviewed Fund 337, established to pay for a new information system. The treasurer explained that while the fund accumulates money, it cannot be used to pay off bonds early due to bond terms and the state’s broader bonding strategy. The state earns more interest on the accumulated funds than it pays on the bonds, making early payoff unfavorable.

9. **Legislative Actions**:  
   The committee planned to draft legislation to address identified issues, including repealing outdated laws and updating sections of the Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA). This legislative effort aims to streamline fund management and address legal and financial concerns.

10. **Public Comment and Stewardship**:  
    The committee emphasized the importance of adhering to the terms of conservation easements and the need for careful stewardship of public lands, particularly in the context of the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters tract. The ongoing public comment process was discussed as a critical component of ensuring community input in land management decisions.

**Next Steps**:  
The committee scheduled a follow-up meeting for October 16, 2024, to finalize a draft report and continue discussions on fund management and legislative recommendations. The meeting underscored the complexities of managing dedicated funds and the need for greater clarity and flexibility in resource allocation to better address state needs.
