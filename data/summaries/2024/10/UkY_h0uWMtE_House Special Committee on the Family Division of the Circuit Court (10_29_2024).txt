The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on October 29, 2024, to review and finalize a comprehensive report. The chairman opened the meeting by outlining the purpose: to examine the final report, address any factual errors, and make a decision on its acceptance. The report, which had been emailed to committee members the previous day, was largely approved earlier, with only minor updates needed. The chairman emphasized that the committee would not be adding new content but would correct any factual inaccuracies or clerical errors.

During the meeting, minor corrections were identified, such as a misspelled judge's name and inconsistent punctuation in the document. The committee agreed to these changes without objection. The chairman highlighted the collaborative and non-partisan nature of the committeeâ€™s work, praising the Judiciary for its cooperation and the committee members for their dedication. The report aimed to address key issues in the Family Division, with the understanding that some unresolved matters could be tackled in the future if the committee is reconstituted.

A motion to accept the report, incorporating the agreed-upon grammatical and spelling corrections, was made and seconded. The vote passed 8-1, with one member absent. The chairman concluded the meeting by thanking the committee for its efforts and adjourned the session.
