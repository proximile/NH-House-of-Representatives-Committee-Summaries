The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Children and Family Law Committee meeting on October 22, 2024, focused on two interim study bills: **House Bill 1269** and **House Bill 1590**. The committee discussed whether to recommend future legislation on these topics.

### **House Bill 1269: Restraints and Timeout Rooms in Schools**
- **Discussion**: The committee reviewed a report on the use of restraints and timeout rooms in schools, prepared by Representative Petrino. The report highlighted the need for further study, particularly on the use of cameras in seclusion areas to balance privacy and accountability. 
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **10-0** to recommend further legislation on this topic, emphasizing the importance of addressing best practices and potential pilot programs in school districts.

### **House Bill 1590: Child Abuse and Neglect Training for Medical Professionals**
- **Discussion**: This bill proposed mandatory training for physicians, nurses, and physician assistants on identifying and reporting child abuse. The committee debated the necessity of legislation versus relying on existing regulatory boards. Testimony from a retired child abuse pediatrician highlighted the need for more training, as many providers lack understanding of abuse indicators and state laws.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **10-0** to recommend further legislation, with some members suggesting the training be incorporated into existing continuing education requirements. Concerns were raised about overburdening medical professionals, but the committee emphasized the importance of protecting children.

### **Key Points from the Discussion**:
- **Cameras in Schools**: Some members supported cameras in seclusion areas to protect both students and teachers, while others raised privacy concerns.
- **Child Abuse Training**: Members agreed that medical professionals need updated training on child abuse, but there was debate on whether legislation was the best approach or if regulatory boards should handle it.
- **Time Constraints for Medical Professionals**: Concerns were raised about the time burden on already overworked medical professionals, with some suggesting broader training for other individuals who interact with children, such as coaches.

### **Final Votes**:
- **House Bill 1269**: 10-0 to recommend future legislation.
- **House Bill 1590**: 10-0 to recommend future legislation.

The meeting concluded with members thanking each other for their service, especially those not returning to the House.
