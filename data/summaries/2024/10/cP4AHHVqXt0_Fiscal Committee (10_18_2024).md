**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting (October 18, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on October 18, 2024, to address a range of critical fiscal and budgetary issues, with a particular focus on the allocation and management of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, infrastructure needs, and program oversight. The meeting underscored the urgency of meeting federal deadlines, addressing audit findings, and ensuring accountability in state spending.

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

#### **1. ARPA Funds Allocation and Reallocation**
- **Housing Crisis**: The committee debated the allocation of ARPA funds to address New Hampshire’s affordable housing crisis. Proposals included directing funds to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, though some members advocated for guardrails to ensure funds were not disproportionately allocated to housing.
- **Mental Health Initiatives**: Governor Chris Sununu emphasized the urgency of allocating returned ARPA funds, proposing $15 million be redirected to mental health projects. This included:
  - $2 million for transitional housing for individuals with mental health conditions.
  - $3 million to renovate Hampstead Hospital’s psychiatric residential treatment facility, increasing bed capacity.
  - $2.7 million for security and infrastructure improvements at the Youth Development Center (YDC).
- **Deferred Maintenance**: Discussions included using ARPA funds for deferred maintenance projects, such as State House bathrooms, ADA compliance upgrades, and roof repairs at the Strafford County Courthouse. However, tight timelines and contract complexities posed challenges.

#### **2. Judicial Council Audit**
- The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) presented an audit of the Judicial Council, identifying 14 observations and recommendations. Key issues included:
  - Timely legal assistance for indigent defendants.
  - Replacement of the outdated case management system.
  - Strengthening financial controls and addressing conflicts of interest.
- The Judicial Council concurred with all findings and outlined plans to address recommendations, including securing funding for a new database and improving contract monitoring. Some findings required legislative action, such as setting fees for indigent defense counsel and requiring financial disclosure statements from council members.

#### **3. Youth Development Center (YDC) and Hampstead Hospital**
- The committee approved a $5 million ARPA funding request for YDC construction, despite concerns about project costs and scope. Discussions highlighted the need for a covered walkway between the YDC and Hampstead Hospital to facilitate resource sharing and improve safety.
- Concerns were raised about security integration, drone use for contraband delivery, and reimbursement for Hampstead’s emergency response costs related to the YDC.

#### **4. Other Funding Requests and Programs**
- **Manchester Animal Shelter**: A $500,000 request for the Manchester Animal Shelter sparked debate, with some members advocating for prioritizing mental health services. The request was ultimately approved.
- **Summer EBT Program**: The committee discussed the delayed implementation of the Summer EBT program, which missed the 2024 summer due to late federal approval. The $150 benefit will be distributed in November 2024, with plans to ensure timely distribution in future years.
- **Medicaid to Schools Program**: Questions were raised about parental consent and oversight in the Medicaid to Schools program, which supports Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and 504 plans. The committee emphasized the importance of keeping parents central to their children’s care.

#### **5. Renewable Energy Fund**
- The committee addressed a request to fund the Office of Energy Innovation from the Renewable Energy Fund, including a nuclear project analyst, despite nuclear energy not being classified as renewable under state statutes.

#### **6. Audit Oversight and Contract Bidding**
- Concerns were raised about the lack of follow-up on audit findings. The committee stressed the need for regular progress reports and a structured approach to addressing recommendations.
- Discussions highlighted challenges in securing bids for large state projects, with only one bid received for the YDC construction. Members emphasized the complexity of state contracts and the need to manage costs effectively.

#### **7. Lead Levels and Transparency**
- A question was raised about the number of properties found to have excessive lead levels in 2023, with a focus on transparency and accountability in spending.

### **Next Steps**
The committee scheduled its next meeting for November 15, 2024, to continue discussions on pending fiscal items, audit pre-releases, and the effective management of remaining ARPA funds. The meeting concluded with votes on several funding requests, reflecting the committee’s commitment to addressing infrastructure, mental health, and housing needs while ensuring accountability and alignment with state priorities.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of managing federal funds, the importance of addressing audit findings, and the need for timely legislative action to support state programs and infrastructure. The discussions underscored the urgency of meeting federal deadlines, ensuring transparency, and prioritizing critical needs such as mental health, housing, and deferred maintenance.
