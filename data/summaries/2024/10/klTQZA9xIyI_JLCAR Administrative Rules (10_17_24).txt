The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting, held on October 17, 2024, focused on administrative rules and legislative updates. Key highlights include:

1. **Legislative Updates**: The committee acknowledged the overturning of the veto on House Bill 1622, making it law. Substitutions for absent members were also noted.

2. **Administrative Rules**:
   - **Lottery Commission**: The committee reviewed a conditional approval request from the Lottery Commission regarding rule changes, particularly around bingo game regulations. Some discrepancies in forms and rule text were identified, and the commission requested an oral conditional approval to address these issues. Valerie King, Director of Investigations and Compliance, explained delays in implementing legislative changes due to a high volume of recent law changes and internal process updates.
   - **Department of Energy**: The committee discussed energy rules (EN 306), with the department submitting a revised amended conditional approval to address substantive comments. The changes included clarifications on reporting requirements for utility accidents and inconsistencies between forms and rules. The department is also working on new rulemaking (EN 20115) to address procedural issues.
   - **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**: Sarah Fuller from the PUC clarified the timeline for submitting their final proposal for procedural rules, aiming for December approval with a January effective date to align with the Department of Energy's rulemaking process.

3. **Meals and Rentals Tax**: The committee reviewed a proposal related to meals and rentals tax, with no further comments after initial concerns were addressed.

4. **Emergency Rule for Child Care Providers**: The Department of Health and Human Services presented an emergency rule requiring interstate criminal background checks for license-exempt child care providers. This rule is mandated by federal law and the new state plan, with a 5% penalty for non-compliance. The department acknowledged oversight in not realizing the need for this rule earlier.

5. **Committee Business**: The committee discussed upcoming meetings and the transition of leadership, as the current chair is retiring. They also noted the need to appoint a new JLCAR committee quickly to ensure continuity for the December meeting.

The meeting concluded with thanks to the committee members and a reminder of the next meeting in November.
