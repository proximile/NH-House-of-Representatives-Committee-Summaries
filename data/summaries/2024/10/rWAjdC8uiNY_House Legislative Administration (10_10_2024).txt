The New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Administration Committee held a meeting on October 10, 2024, to address the remaining bills on their docket. The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance and was described as the last and "least consequential" meeting of the legislative term. The primary task was to vote on whether to recommend two pieces of future legislation: **House Bill 157** and **House Resolution 25**. The votes were ceremonial, as they did not preclude anyone from filing similar legislation in the future.

1. **House Bill 157**: The committee unanimously voted **not to recommend** this bill for future legislation. The decision was based on the fact that the House and Senate were finalizing a joint sexual harassment policy, making the bill redundant. The joint policy is in its final stages and will be reviewed by the Ethics Committee.

2. **House Resolution 25**: The committee also unanimously voted **not to recommend** this resolution for future legislation. The resolution aimed to tighten absentee ballot voting laws, but the committee decided to wait for the outcome of a related Supreme Court case addressing equal protection issues. Additionally, as a House resolution, it would not impact the Senate, limiting its effectiveness.

The meeting concluded with the chair and committee members expressing gratitude for their collaborative work throughout the term. The retiring Clerk was also thanked for their service. The session was adjourned early, allowing attendees to participate in festivities.
