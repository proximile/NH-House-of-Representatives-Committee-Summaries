**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (October 25, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened on October 25, 2024, to evaluate the state’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting addressed a wide range of issues, including vaccine safety and efficacy, public health policies, trust in medical institutions, and recommendations for future pandemic preparedness. The discussions were marked by critical reflections on the pandemic response and calls for greater transparency, scientific rigor, and systemic reforms.

### **Key Themes and Findings**

#### **1. Vaccine Safety, Efficacy, and Long-Term Effects**
- **Safety Concerns**: Significant concerns were raised about the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for children. Questions were posed about the presence of SV40 sequences in vaccines and their potential as cancer promoters, as well as the lack of robust studies on the effects of vaccines and masking on child development.
- **Efficacy and Side Effects**: The efficacy of mRNA vaccines, particularly Pfizer’s, was questioned, with discussions on cardiovascular events, the production of IgG4 antibodies (potentially acting as immunosuppressants), and reports of severe illnesses in vaccinated children. Testimonies highlighted the potential for vaccine-related vascular issues, such as microvascular clotting and myocarditis.
- **Natural Immunity vs. Vaccination**: The committee debated the effectiveness of natural immunity post-infection, criticizing the push for vaccination in recovered individuals without sufficient evidence of its necessity or safety.

#### **2. Public Health Policies and Decision-Making**
- **Censorship and Dissent**: The committee criticized the silencing of dissenting scientific opinions during the pandemic, which was seen as antithetical to scientific inquiry. Concerns were raised about the influence of pharmaceutical companies on institutions like the NIH and FDA.
- **Treatment Protocols**: The top-down approach to treatment protocols was criticized for limiting physicians’ autonomy and adaptability. Financial incentives tied to specific treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies, were also scrutinized.
- **Masking and Public Health Measures**: The efficacy of masks in preventing COVID-19 transmission was questioned, with some experts arguing that layered public health measures did not significantly improve outcomes.

#### **3. Vaccine Injuries and Compensation**
- **Challenges for Vaccine-Injured Individuals**: Testimonies highlighted the difficulties faced by individuals with vaccine injuries, including limited access to treatment and compensation. The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) was criticized for being underfunded and inefficient.
- **Calls for Reform**: The committee emphasized the need for better support systems and compensation mechanisms for those adversely affected by vaccines.

#### **4. Healthcare System and Monopolies**
- **Hospital Consolidation**: The negative impact of hospital system consolidation on patient care and competition was discussed. Regulatory burdens on smaller medical practices were identified as barriers to innovation and patient care.
- **Healthcare Worker Shortages**: The pandemic exacerbated healthcare worker shortages, with vaccine mandates contributing to the loss of first responders and other professionals.

#### **5. Trust in Medical Institutions**
- **Erosion of Trust**: A significant decline in public trust in physicians and public health institutions was noted, with trust levels dropping from 71% to 40% in three years, according to a JAMA study.
- **Rebuilding Trust**: The committee emphasized the need for transparency, inclusivity, and accurate communication to restore public confidence.

#### **6. Long COVID and Future Pandemic Preparedness**
- **Addressing Long COVID**: The committee highlighted the need to support individuals with long COVID, ensuring access to healthcare and financial resources.
- **Recommendations for Future Pandemics**: Proposals included diversifying public health decision-making, integrating responses across agencies, and addressing metabolic health and ultra-processed foods as part of broader public health strategies.

#### **7. Federal vs. State Response**
- **Challenges of Federal Guidance**: The reliance on federal data and recommendations was criticized for creating confusion and conflicting narratives at the state level.
- **State Independence**: The committee acknowledged the tension between New Hampshire’s emphasis on independence and the need to align with federal mandates during the pandemic.

#### **8. Fear, Polarization, and Public Behavior**
- **Impact of Fear**: Fear and polarization were identified as significant drivers of public behavior during the pandemic, leading to divisions within families and communities.
- **Mitigating Misinformation**: The committee stressed the importance of accurate and timely public health messaging to combat fear and misinformation.

### **Conclusion and Recommendations**
The meeting underscored the need for a comprehensive review of the COVID-19 response, with a focus on addressing vaccine safety, improving public health policies, and rebuilding trust in medical institutions. Key recommendations included:
- Conducting more rigorous studies on vaccine safety and long-term effects.
- Supporting vaccine-injured individuals through improved compensation programs.
- Promoting transparency and inclusivity in public health decision-making.
- Addressing healthcare system inefficiencies and supporting independent medical practices.
- Preparing for future pandemics with integrated, data-driven responses and mechanisms to mitigate fear and misinformation.

The committee aimed to finalize its report by November 1, 2024, with a commitment to constructive criticism and a focus on improving public health outcomes for New Hampshire citizens.
