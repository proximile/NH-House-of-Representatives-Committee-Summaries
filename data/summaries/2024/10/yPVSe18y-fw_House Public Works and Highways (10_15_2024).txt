The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened for its final work session on October 15, 2024, to deliberate on four house bills. The session was marked by procedural motions and discussions on each bill, with committee members voting on recommendations for future legislation.

1. **House Bill 110**: This bill aimed to prohibit the use of state funds for new passenger rail projects. Representative Jack moved to not recommend the bill for future legislation, citing concerns about blanket prohibitions. The motion passed with 15 votes in favor.

2. **House Bill 606**: This bill required the construction of state buildings or state-funded projects to include electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. While some members supported the principle, they found the bill too broad, particularly regarding its application to apartment buildings and state projects. Representative Boyd moved to not recommend the bill, and the motion passed with 15 votes in favor.

3. **House Bill 488**: This bill proposed hazard mitigation funding. Representative Mills moved to not recommend it, but some members, including Representative Cluder, argued in favor of addressing recurring flood issues in their districts. The motion to not recommend passed with 14 votes in favor.

4. **House Bill 1547**: This bill required mileage-based exit numbers on tier-one highways. Representative Boyd moved to not recommend the bill, citing concerns about costs and timing, as the bill lacked a fiscal note and deferred implementation until 2035. The motion passed with 16 votes in favor.

The session concluded with acknowledgments and farewells to several committee members who would not be returning, including Representative Peterson and Representative Makoni. The committee chair expressed gratitude for the nonpartisan collaboration and the privilege of serving on the committee, while the vice chair praised the committeeâ€™s ability to resolve disagreements amicably and set an example for the rest of the House.
