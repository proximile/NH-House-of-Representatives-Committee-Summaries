The New Hampshire House of Representatives Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program convened on October 17, 2024, to address critical issues related to academic standards, Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs, and administrative rules governing public school approval. The meeting emphasized the need for clarity, consistency, and alignment between educational standards and workforce readiness. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **Waivers, Compliance, and CTE Program Assessments**
The committee addressed concerns about the expiration of waivers and the need to ensure compliance with educational standards in the coming year. Questions were raised about the number of waivers granted and the status of programs currently out of compliance. Discussions also focused on whether all CTE programs in the state implement third-party assessments, as required by proposed rules. While many programs align with industry-recognized credentials, there was uncertainty about universal adherence to this requirement.

### **Career Clusters and Industry Relevance**
The committee debated the inclusion of nationally recognized career clusters in CTE program rules. While these clusters provide valuable skills for students, there was concern about being overly prescriptive, given the dynamic nature of industry needs. Updates to outdated programs, such as marketing and horticulture, were highlighted to ensure relevance and alignment with modern industry demands.

### **Academic Standards and Administrative Rules**
The committee reviewed **Ed 306**, the administrative rule governing academic standards and public school approval. They identified challenges with legacy content from pre-2000, which sometimes duplicates or conflicts with the rigorous academic standards adopted post-No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Proposed solutions included categorizing legacy content into four buckets: incorporating rule language into new sections, modifying existing standards, condensing instructional best practices, and removing unnecessary content. The committee emphasized the need to clearly tether curriculum frameworks and academic standards to the minimum standards for school approval.

### **Curriculum Updates and Integration**
The committee reviewed updates to various educational programs, including business education, digital literacy, and CTE. They noted the absence of academic standards in some areas, such as business education, and proposed incorporating competencies from CTE programs to guide curriculum development. Personal finance literacy was also discussed, with the committee affirming that while it is a graduation requirement, it can be embedded in other courses rather than being a standalone subject.

### **Class Sizes, Educator Definitions, and Lab Safety**
The committee addressed misconceptions about class size limits, clarifying that current rules recommend class sizes of 25 or less for K–2 and 30 or less for grades 3–12, with efforts to maintain lower ratios. A lengthy discussion ensued about the definition of "educator" and its impact on student-teacher ratios, with the committee clarifying that only licensed educators can facilitate learning in specific content areas. Lab safety rules were also revisited, with discussions about whether the previous cap of 24 students in laboratory classes should be updated to accommodate larger lab spaces.

### **Arts Education and Curriculum Frameworks**
The committee used arts education as a case study to illustrate discrepancies between legacy standards in Ed 306 and current academic standards. They emphasized the need to align arts education programs with the K-12 curriculum framework for the arts, ensuring clarity and consistency. The committee also referenced recent legislation, **HB 1107**, which defines curriculum frameworks and their role in guiding academic standards.

### **CTE Program Coordination and Policy Development**
The committee stressed the importance of coordinating calendars and schedules between sending and receiving school districts to maximize student access to CTE programs. They discussed the need for cohesive policies that integrate various educational components, such as dual and concurrent enrollment, to ensure students have access to diverse learning opportunities.

### **Next Steps**
The committee decided to reconvene on Monday, October 21, to finalize recommendations regarding academic standards and public school approval. These recommendations may include changes to the proposed rules and address concerns raised during the meeting.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting underscored the importance of flexibility, responsiveness to industry needs, and alignment between educational standards and CTE programs to better prepare students for the workforce. The committee aimed to streamline and clarify administrative rules to ensure that New Hampshire’s academic standards are rigorous, consistent, and aligned with the state’s educational goals.
