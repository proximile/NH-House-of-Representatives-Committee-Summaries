**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (November 22, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on November 22, 2024, to address a wide range of issues impacting health and human services in the state. The meeting focused on progress, challenges, and updates across multiple areas, including long-term care and aging services, Medicaid programs, prescription drug affordability, developmental services, and data management. Key discussions and updates are summarized below:

### **Long-Term Care and Aging Services**
1. **Progress and Priorities**: The committee reviewed advancements in nursing facilities and public policy changes, emphasizing the need to diversify Medicaid funding streams to support low-income individuals requiring long-term care.
2. **Demographic Challenges**: New Hampshire faces a growing older adult population and increasing poverty among seniors, compounded by a shortage of home healthcare workers relative to the national average.
3. **Strengthening Care Systems**: House Bill 2 (2023) established a healthy aging system of care, shifting focus from costly facility-based care (e.g., nursing homes) to home and community-based care. This approach aims to reduce hospitalizations, improve quality of life, and lower costs.
4. **Direct Care Workforce**: The state is addressing a critical shortage of direct care workers through initiatives like the Workforce Omnibus Bill and programs such as "New Hampshire Needs Caregivers."
5. **Support for Caregivers**: The Choices for Independence program allows family members or friends to be paid as caregivers, while additional funding for home modifications (e.g., ramps, bathroom upgrades) supports aging in place.
6. **Multi-Sector Plan on Aging**: The committee advocated for a 10-year vision to address aging-related challenges, similar to the state’s Mental Health Plan, to ensure sustainable care systems and strategic investments.
7. **Public Engagement**: Lawmakers were encouraged to engage constituents and stakeholders in planning for aging services to make New Hampshire a better place to age.

   - **Medicaid in Schools**: Updates on the Medicaid to Schools program included discussions on parental involvement, transparency in care plans, and privacy concerns for students aging out of the program.

   - **HB 49 (Sen Services Center Replacement)**: Construction has begun on the new facility, with ongoing community and stakeholder engagement.
