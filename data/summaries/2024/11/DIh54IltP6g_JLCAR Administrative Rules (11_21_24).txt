**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (11/21/24)**

The NH House of Representatives meeting on November 21, 2024, focused on the review, discussion, and voting of various administrative rules, with significant attention on education, solid waste management, child support payments, and other state department regulations. The meeting highlighted widespread concerns about transparency, public engagement, fiscal impacts, and alignment with legislative intent. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Education Rules (Ed 306 and Related Regulations)**
1. **Proposed Changes and Concerns**:
   - **Instructional Standards**: The proposed education rules, particularly Ed 306, faced strong opposition for replacing direct instruction requirements with vague "learning opportunities." Critics argued this shift could lead to inconsistent educational outcomes, especially in less affluent districts.
   - **Teacher Certification**: The rules eliminated the requirement for certified teachers to lead classrooms, allowing paraprofessionals to serve as educators. Opponents contended this change could compromise instructional quality and violate state statutes mandating certified teachers.
   - **Competency-Based Education**: While New Hampshire has shifted toward competency-based education, there was confusion and concern about its implementation and potential dilution of educational standards.
   - **Class Size and Ratios**: The rules’ ambiguity around class size, student-teacher ratios, and the definition of "adequate education" raised fiscal and operational concerns for school districts.
   - **Subject-Specific Issues**: Specific subjects like digital literacy, personal finance, and logic and rhetoric lacked State academic standards, leading to calls for clearer guidelines.

2. **Public Engagement and Transparency**:
   - **Public Testimony**: Over 500 pages of public testimony were submitted, with significant opposition to the proposed changes. Educators, parents, and school board members expressed frustration with the lack of transparency and responsiveness to their concerns.
   - **Process Criticisms**: Representatives and stakeholders criticized the Department of Education for insufficient engagement with the education community, flawed contracted services processes, and dismissal of legislative oversight committee input.
   - **Rule Availability**: Confusion arose over which version of the rules was under consideration, and technical issues with accessing updated documents on the Department’s website further eroded trust.

3. **Fiscal and Administrative Impact**:
   - **Financial Burden**: The proposed changes, such as doubling social studies credits required for graduation, could impose significant financial burdens on districts, requiring additional staffing and resources without corresponding funding.
   - **Economic Analysis**: Critics argued that the fiscal impact of the rule changes had not been fully vetted, potentially shifting funding obligations from the state to local districts.

4. **Legislative Oversight and Voting**:
   - **Objections and Approval**: Despite strong opposition, the rules were approved with a narrow vote of 6 to 4. Some representatives argued the rules should be objected to based on their impact on public education, fiscal responsibility, and alignment with legislative intent.

### **Solid Waste Program Rules**
1. **Public Concerns**: Significant public testimony raised issues about the specifics, safety, and process of public input for the proposed solid waste program rules.
2. **Preliminary Objection**: A preliminary objection was moved, emphasizing the need for further work to ensure all concerns were addressed and voices heard.

### **Child Support Payments and Lottery Intercept Program**
1. **Child Support Rules**: The agency continued distributing child support payments despite the expiration of certain rules, operating under federal Social Security Act guidelines and state law. Efforts were underway to reinstate expired rules promptly.
2. **Lottery Intercept Rule**: The lottery intercept rule expired on July 22, 2024, but the program continued under memorandums of understanding and federal authority. Concerns were raised about the legality of enforcing expired rules.

### **Other Discussions**
1. **Fertilizer Rules**: Interim rules related to fertilizer inspection fees were discussed, with questions about fee collection during the lapse period.
2. **Procedural Issues**: Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency, timing of public hearings, and availability of materials for review. The need for more robust fiscal impact statements was emphasized.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored significant concerns about the rule-making process across various domains, particularly in education. Issues of transparency, public engagement, fiscal responsibility, and alignment with legislative intent dominated the discussions. While some rules were approved, the narrow margins and strong opposition highlighted the need for more deliberate, inclusive, and transparent processes in developing and implementing administrative rules.
