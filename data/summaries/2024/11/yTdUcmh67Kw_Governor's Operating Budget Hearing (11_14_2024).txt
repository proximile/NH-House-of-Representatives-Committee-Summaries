**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Governor's Operating Budget Hearing (11/14/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on November 14, 2024, to discuss the Governor's Operating Budget for the 2026-2027 biennium. The hearing featured presentations from numerous state departments and agencies, highlighting their budget requests, operational challenges, and strategic priorities. Key themes included workforce shortages, reliance on federal funding, efficiency measures, and the need for strategic investments to maintain and improve state services. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Key Departments and Budget Highlights**
- **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC):** The OPLC, which oversees occupational licensing and public safety, requested the conversion of temporary positions to permanent roles due to increased workloads. The agency, self-funded through licensing fees, manages over 240,000 licenses and handles 100 complaints monthly. Challenges include staffing shortages and the need for operational efficiency.
  
- **Department of Military Affairs and Veteran Services:** The department emphasized its heavy reliance on federal funding (80% of its budget) and warned against legislative proposals that could jeopardize this support. It met the Governor’s efficiency target but highlighted risks due to funding uncertainties.

- **Insurance Department:** The department reduced reliance on consultants and unfunded several positions to meet efficiency targets. It is self-funded through assessments on insurance carriers and focused on regulatory reform and succession planning.

- **Department of Energy:** The department aligned its budget with the Governor’s targets, focusing on regulatory advocacy, utility safety, and consumer services. Funding comes from federal sources, utility assessments, and minimal general funds.

- **Department of Transportation (DOT):** The DOT faced significant workforce challenges, with vacancy rates up to 24%. It made deep cuts in overtime and supplies to meet budget targets while managing over 900 federal projects. Revenue from the Highway Fund (gas taxes, road tolls) has been flat, with projections indicating a gradual decline.

- **Department of Information Technology (DOIT):** DOIT emphasized its centralized IT model and cybersecurity efforts. Rising IT costs due to shorter equipment life cycles and subscription models were noted. The department prioritized aligning IT strategies with agency needs.

- **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS):** With a $3.5 billion budget, DHHS outlined strategic priorities in workforce development, behavioral health, aging care, and developmental disabilities. The department reduced vacancy rates from 22% to 14.9% and requested $171 million in prioritized needs, including rate increases and system upgrades.

### **2. Workforce Challenges and Efficiency Measures**
- Workforce shortages were a recurring theme across departments, with vacancy rates ranging from 14.9% (DHHS) to 24% (DOT). Departments implemented recruitment and retention strategies, including CDL training programs (DOT) and state employee raises (Department of Energy and Planning).
- Efficiency measures included reducing reliance on consultants (Insurance Department), unfunding open positions (DOIT), and reallocating resources to meet budget targets.

### **3. Reliance on Federal Funding**
- Several departments, including Military Affairs, DOT, and DHHS, rely heavily on federal funding. Concerns were raised about the potential impact of federal funding uncertainties on state operations.
- Programs like the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) were highlighted as critical for supporting low-income households and local economic development.

### **4. Revenue Generation and Budget Constraints**
- Self-funded agencies like the OPLC and Insurance Department rely on licensing fees and assessments, respectively. Revenue projections were cautious due to market fluctuations and declining species populations (Fish and Game Department).
- Departments emphasized the need for strategic investments to maintain infrastructure (DOT), enhance cybersecurity (DOIT), and support public health and safety (DHHS).

### **5. Strategic Priorities and Legislative Requests**
- **Economic Development:** The Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA) focused on workforce availability, housing, and broadband expansion, leveraging ARPA funds for initiatives like the New Hampshire Business Gateway.
- **Natural and Cultural Resources:** The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR) prioritized self-sufficiency through fees, sales, and federal funds. Infrastructure improvements in state parks and historic sites were highlighted.
- **Public Utilities and Consumer Advocacy:** The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Office of the Consumer Advocate focused on balancing utility shareholder and customer interests, particularly in rate cases and storm cost reviews.

### **6. Community and Environmental Initiatives**
- **Elip (Land and Community Heritage Investment Program):** Despite flat funding since 2009, Elip has conserved land and supported local jobs. Increased funding was requested to address rising costs.
- **Environmental Services:** The Department of Environmental Services (DES) focused on water supply, contamination, and infrastructure projects, managing federal funds from ARPA and the Infrastructure Bill.

---

### **7. Budget Challenges and Future Projections**
- Departments highlighted the complexity of managing large budgets, particularly DHHS, which accounts for over half of the state budget. Historical lapses and funding gaps were noted, with calls for clearer decision-making tools.
- Future challenges include declining revenues (Highway Fund), workforce shortages, and the need for sustained investment in infrastructure and IT systems.

### **8. Conclusion**
The hearing underscored the ongoing efforts to balance budget constraints with the need to maintain and improve state services. Workforce recruitment and retention, reliance on federal funding, and strategic investments in infrastructure, IT, and public health were key priorities.
