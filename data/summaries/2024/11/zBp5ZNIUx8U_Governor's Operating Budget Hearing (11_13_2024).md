**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Governor's Operating Budget Hearing (11/13/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on November 13, 2024, to discuss the Governor's Operating Budget, featuring presentations from various state agencies and institutions. The hearing highlighted critical financial challenges, operational updates, and budget requests across sectors, including labor, higher education, public safety, and education. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Labor and Workforce Compensation**
1. **Worker Compensation Division**: The division manages workplace injury reports, hearings, and a revolving trust fund with annual payments up to $20 million. Funding is derived from assessments on insurance carriers and self-insured entities, with 87% from the administration fund and the remainder from the restricted fund, which transfers excess to the general fund.  
2. **Public Employee Labor Relations Board (PELRB)**: Executive Director Doug Ingersoll emphasized the need to increase per diem payments for board members from $50 to $250, unchanged since 1985. The board also implemented a new case management system and requested funding for equipment.  
3. **Department of Labor**: The Inspection Division enforces labor laws, conducts thousands of inspections annually, and recovers unpaid wages. The Workers’ Compensation Division ensures employers maintain insurance for workplace injuries. Both divisions highlighted their roles in protecting workers and enforcing compliance.

### **Higher Education**
1. **University System of New Hampshire (USNH)**: Chancellor Katherine Prenter stressed the importance of state investment to keep tuition low for in-state students. Despite a 4% budget reduction, USNH has maintained flat in-state tuition for six years while increasing out-of-state tuition by 2.5% annually. USNH faces declining enrollment due to demographic challenges and competition from other states investing heavily in higher education. Initiatives include cost reductions, employer partnerships, and innovative programs like three-year bachelor’s degrees.  
2. **Community College System**: The Chancellor highlighted efforts to control costs, maintain affordability, and expand dual and concurrent enrollment programs. The system has reduced its workforce by 30% over the past decade to manage expenses.  
3. **Challenges**: Both systems emphasized rising costs, flat revenues, and the need for state support to maintain quality and affordability. The delayed release of the simplified FAFSA also created enrollment challenges.

### **Judicial and Public Safety**
1. **Judicial Council**:  
   - **Public Defender System**: The New Hampshire Public Defender (NHPD) is under strain due to high caseloads, low salaries, and attrition. Funding requests aim to raise salaries and add attorneys to stabilize the system, which saves the state $20 million annually compared to assigned counsel.  
   - **Contract and Assigned Counsel**: Declining participation and overburdened systems necessitate increased funding and revised contracts. Assigned counsel rates may rise from $90 to $125 per hour to attract more attorneys, especially in rural areas.  
   - **CASA Program**: The Court Appointed Special Advocates program relies on volunteers and requires funding to meet increasing costs.  
2. **Right to Know Ombudsman (RKO)**: Established in 2023, the RKO provides a simpler, less expensive alternative to Superior Court for resolving Right to Know Law complaints. With 254 inquiries and 71 formal complaints handled, the agency seeks funding to extend operations beyond its July 2025 expiration date.

### **State Agencies and Transparency**
1. **Secretary of State**: Presented a maintenance budget, highlighting successful elections and smooth recounts. No significant increases were requested beyond prioritized IT and administrative needs.  
2. **Governor's Commission on Disability (GCD)**: Focused on advising the governor and legislature on disability programs, the GCD requested funding to restore a part-time position to 29 hours per week. It also administers the ABLE Savings Plan, allowing tax-free savings for individuals with disabilities.  
3. **Pease Development Authority (PDA)**: The PDA’s budget includes salaries and benefits for its small workforce, with increases due to rising expenses. High overtime costs were attributed to payroll administration estimates rather than actual usage.  
4. **Board of Tax and Land Appeals (BTLA)**: Facing a 4% budget cut, the BTLA unfunded a review appraiser position and struggles with staffing shortages amid increased post-COVID appeals.

### **Education and Lottery Funding**
1. **Department of Education**: The budget aligns with the Governor’s 3.3% reduction target. Enrollment has declined by 6.7% since 2020, while per-pupil costs have risen from $16,000 to over $21,000. Concerns were raised about the increasing ratio of administrative staff to teachers. Programs funded by COVID-19 relief include tutoring, mental health support, and the "UpGrade" program for computer science credentials.  
2. **New Hampshire Lottery**: The lottery reported significant profits from scratch tickets, joint Powerball/Mega Millions games, and sports betting. Revenue fluctuations are influenced by jackpot sizes. The lottery plays a key role in supporting state funding and the retail network.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**
- **Budget Constraints**: State agencies face significant financial pressures, with many adhering to 3-4% budget cuts while striving to maintain essential services.  
- **Workforce and Compensation**: Low salaries and staffing shortages, particularly in the public defender system and judicial roles, threaten operational efficiency.  
- **Higher Education**: Declining enrollment, rising costs, and competition from other states underscore the need for sustained state investment to maintain affordability and quality.  
- **Transparency and Public Services**: Agencies like the RKO and GCD emphasize their roles in ensuring transparency, protecting taxpayer rights, and supporting vulnerable populations.  
- **Economic Contributions**: Out-of-state students and the NH Lottery provide critical economic benefits, subsidizing in-state tuition and generating state revenue.

Agencies and institutions highlighted their efforts to manage costs, improve efficiency, and address systemic challenges while emphasizing the importance of state support to ensure long-term sustainability and competitiveness.
