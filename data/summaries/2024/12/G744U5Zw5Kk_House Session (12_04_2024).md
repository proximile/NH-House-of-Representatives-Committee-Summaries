The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on **December 4, 2024**, for its **Organization Day**, marking the beginning of the 2025 legislative session. The session opened with formalities, including a **prayer** by Reverend Jean Beniste, the **Pledge of Allegiance**, and a performance of the **National Anthem** by the Goffstown High School Honors Chorus. The House addressed **leaves of absence**, introduced **guests**, and conducted a **roll call** to confirm attendance. **Governor Christopher T. Sununu** administered the **Oath of Office** to newly elected representatives, setting the stage for the day’s proceedings.

The primary focus of the session was the election of the **Speaker of the House**. Two candidates were nominated: **Representative Alexis Simpson**, nominated by Representative Lucy Weber and seconded by Representative Peter Petrigno, and **Representative Sherman Packard**, nominated by Representative Lisa Mazur and seconded by Representatives Kimberly Rice and Ted Gorski. Both candidates delivered remarks emphasizing unity, civility, and effective leadership. After a vote, **Sherman Packard** was elected Speaker with 195 votes. In a gesture of unity, Representative Simpson moved to declare the vote unanimous in support of Packard, which was accepted. Speaker Packard then delivered remarks, expressing gratitude and outlining his vision for the House.

Following the Speaker election, the House elected its officers: **Paul C. Smith** as **House Clerk** and **J.B. Cullen** as **Sergeant-at-Arms**, both of whom were sworn in. The House then convened a **Joint Convention** with the Senate to elect state officials. **David M. Scanlan** was re-elected as **Secretary of State**, and **Monica Mezzapelle** was re-elected as **State Treasurer**. Both officers took their oaths of office and delivered remarks, expressing their commitment to serving the state.

The House addressed several **resolutions**, including rules for the 2025-2026 biennium, the creation of a new **Housing Committee**, and the splitting of the **Education Committee** into two separate committees focusing on funding and policy. An amendment to the **Ethics Guidelines** was proposed, sparking debate about the need for more time to review the changes. A motion to **table the amendment** failed, and the House ultimately voted to postpone its consideration until the next session on **January 8, 2025**, to allow for further review.

The session concluded with **announcements** about upcoming county delegation meetings and other organizational matters. **Representative Megan Murray** highlighted the **United States Senate Youth Program**, congratulating the New Hampshire delegates and emphasizing the importance of civic education and engagement. The House adjourned and will reconvene on **January 8, 2025**, to continue its legislative work.

This comprehensive session laid the groundwork for the upcoming legislative biennium, with the election of key leadership, the adoption of organizational resolutions, and the reaffirmation of state officers, all setting the stage for the House’s future deliberations and decisions.
