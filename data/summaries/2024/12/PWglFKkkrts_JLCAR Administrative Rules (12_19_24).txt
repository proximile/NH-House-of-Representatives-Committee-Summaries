### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Administrative Rules (12/19/24)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on December 19, 2024, to discuss and deliberate on various administrative rules across multiple state departments. The meeting focused on balancing regulatory clarity, public safety, access to care, and fiscal responsibility, with significant discussions on rules related to the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**, **Board of Dental Examiners**, **Department of Energy**, **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**, and other agencies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **1. Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Department of Energy**
#### **Settlement Review Process**
- The PUC proposed codifying its practice of reviewing utility settlement agreements line by line, rather than accepting or rejecting them as a whole. Critics, including the Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) and utilities, argued this approach conflicts with **RSA 541-A:38**, which governs informal settlements, and could lead to increased litigation and costs. The Consumer Advocate expressed concerns that this practice creates uncertainty and discourages settlements, potentially driving up rates for consumers.

#### **Legal Briefs and Fiscal Impact**
- The PUC proposed allowing commissioners to require legal briefs during proceedings to clarify complex legal issues. The Department of Energy raised concerns about the fiscal impact, estimating potential costs of up to **$675,000 annually** due to increased workload and the need for additional staff.

#### **Interagency Disputes**
- Legislators questioned the lack of agreement between the PUC and the Department of Energy, both executive branch agencies, on these rule changes. Some suggested that interagency disputes should be resolved internally before reaching the legislature.

#### **Outcome**
- The committee considered a **preliminary objection** to the PUC rule change due to ambiguity and potential enforcement issues. Further legislative clarification may be needed to resolve ambiguities in the PUC’s authority.

### **2. Board of Dental Examiners: Pediatric Anesthesia Rules**
#### **Patient Safety vs. Access to Care**
- The proposed rules require **two providers** (an anesthesiologist and the dentist) for administering anesthesia to children **under eight years old**, citing heightened risks. However, exemptions are allowed for children aged **9-13**, raising concerns about patient safety in emergency situations.
- Critics, including oral surgeons and pediatric dentists, argued the rules would limit access to care, particularly in rural areas where finding a second provider is challenging. They emphasized that delays in treatment could worsen outcomes for dental emergencies or infections.

#### **Economic Impact**
- The rules could increase costs for families, with hospital-based procedures potentially costing **$10,000–$15,000**. Medicaid patients, in particular, may face significant barriers to timely care.

#### **Lack of Data**
- Opponents argued the rule lacks sufficient data to justify the changes, as adverse outcomes are rare and often unreported. Some states with similar incidents have not implemented such restrictive policies.

#### **Outcome**
- The committee discussed the need for further clarification, particularly regarding age cutoffs and anesthesia provider requirements. A **preliminary objection** was raised, and the agency was given **45 days** to address concerns.

### **3. Department of Environmental Services (DES): Landfill and Contaminated Sites Rules**
#### **Landfill Regulations**
- DES presented updated landfill rules aimed at enhancing public health and environmental protections. While the rules were seen as an improvement over existing ones, some legislators argued they were still insufficiently protective. The committee ultimately voted to **approve the rules**, acknowledging their enhanced protections while noting that further policy changes could be addressed through legislation.

#### **Contaminated Sites**
- DES also presented rules addressing soil and water contamination, emphasizing their necessity for public health and compliance with statutory authority. Public testimony raised concerns about fiscal impact, public notice, and the definition of responsible parties. The committee conditionally approved the rules.

### **4. Other Administrative Rules**
#### **Freshwater Fishing Rules**
- The committee conditionally approved changes to fishing rules, specifically striking language that conflicted with bass tournament regulations. The Department of Fish and Game supported the amendment.

#### **Installation Standards**
- The committee moved to **object** to a rule proposal adopting federal installation standards without legislative approval, citing constitutional concerns.

#### **Animal Records Database**
- The Department of Agriculture addressed rules related to animal records and pet facilities. Issues included unclear definitions and the operational status of the animal records database. The committee approved the rules, with a delayed effective date pending database certification.

---

### **5. Emergency Rule for Recovery Houses**
- The committee discussed an **emergency rule** related to voluntary recovery house registries, introduced to avoid litigation and comply with New Hampshire standards. The emergency rule is valid for **180 days**, with plans to formalize it through regular rulemaking before expiration.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Safety vs. Access**: Both the dental anesthesia and landfill rules highlighted the tension between ensuring safety and maintaining access to care or services, particularly for vulnerable populations.
2. **Regulatory Clarity and Compliance**: The committee emphasized the need for clear, enforceable rules that comply with statutory requirements and legislative intent.
3. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Concerns about the fiscal impact of proposed rules, particularly those related to the PUC and Department of Energy, were a recurring theme.
4. **Public Interest**: Public health, environmental protection, and access to care were central to discussions across all topics.

---

### **Final Actions**
- The committee approved several rules conditionally, raised preliminary objections to others, and adopted an emergency rule for recovery houses. The meeting concluded with a focus on ensuring that administrative rules align with legislative intent and public interest while balancing safety, access, and fiscal responsibility.
