**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (01/30/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 30, 2025, to discuss several critical issues related to education funding, with a particular focus on special education, the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT), and broader funding equity. The meeting included detailed discussions on multiple bills aimed at addressing funding shortfalls, improving equity, and ensuring compliance with constitutional and federal mandates. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and discussions across all segments:

---

### **Special Education Funding Challenges and Proposals**

1. **Current Funding Shortfalls**:
   - Speakers, including school board members, educators, and parents, highlighted the increasing costs of special education services, noting that the current state share of 11% is insufficient. This places a significant financial burden on local districts, particularly smaller ones, and leads to unpredictable budgets.
   - The need for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) for students with higher needs was emphasized, alongside concerns about the cumbersome nature of the IEP framework and the rising costs of out-of-district placements, which average over $120,000 per student.

2. **Proposed Solutions**:
   - **House Bill 603**: Proposes increasing adequacy grants for special education students to a flat rate of $29,000 per student. While this addresses some funding gaps, concerns were raised about the lack of differentiation for varying student needs and potential perverse incentives for districts to categorize students differently.
   - **House Bill 563**: Introduces differentiated aid categories based on the level of support students require (e.g., general education vs. special education settings). While praised for targeting resources more effectively, concerns were raised about potential stigma, perverse incentives, and whether the funding levels adequately cover actual costs.
   - **Catastrophic Aid**: Calls were made to adjust thresholds and funding mechanisms to better support districts with exceptionally high special education costs.

3. **Advocacy and Personal Stories**:
   - Parents and educators shared personal stories about the positive impact of early interventions and adequate funding on student outcomes. However, they also highlighted the stigma and financial challenges faced by families of children with special needs.

### **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) and Funding Equity**

1. **House Bill 137**:
   - Clarifies that excess SWEPT funds collected by towns above the state’s required amount should remain in the town for educational purposes. The bill codifies the intent of a 2011 law and aims to eliminate confusion about fund usage.
   - While supported for its clarity, questions were raised about fairness, particularly for towns with high property values that collect more SWEPT funds compared to towns with lower property values.

2. **House Bill 675**:
   - Proposes significant changes to SWEPT, including remitting all SWEPT revenue to the state for redistribution and introducing a cost-of-living adjustment to account for inflation.
   - The bill also expands the **Low and Moderate Income Homeowner Property Tax Relief Program**, extending relief to both SWEPT and local school taxes with a cap of $1,100 per household.
   - Critics argue that remitting SWEPT funds to the state could lead to higher local tax rates, while proponents see it as a way to ensure constitutional compliance and provide targeted relief to vulnerable populations.

3. **Donor Town System**:
   - The reinstatement of the donor town system, where wealthier towns send excess SWEPT funds to the state, sparked debate. Critics view this as unfair, while proponents argue it addresses broader funding inequities.

### **Broader Education Funding Issues**

1. **Adequacy and Equity**:
   - The meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s failure to meet its constitutional obligation to adequately fund education, particularly special education. Local property taxpayers currently bear 70-80% of the burden, leading to volatile budgets.
   - Proposals to increase **base adequacy aid per pupil** from $4,100 to $7,356 were discussed, aiming to ensure more equitable funding across districts regardless of socioeconomic status.

2. **Spending Controls**:
   - **House Bill 675** includes provisions to cap school district budget increases based on a three-year average of enrollment changes or past appropriations. Exceptions would require a two-thirds majority vote.
   - Opponents argue these controls undermine local autonomy and could lead to cuts in essential programs like arts, music, and mental health services.

3. **Housing Crisis and Property Taxes**:
   - Some speakers linked the state’s housing crisis to high property taxes driven by education spending. They argued that spending controls could help stabilize property taxes and encourage housing development.

### **Key Takeaways and Next Steps**

1. **Comprehensive Approach Needed**:
   - Stakeholders emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach to address the growing costs of special education, ensure sustainable funding, and uphold the commitment to providing a free and appropriate public education for all students.

2. **Legislative Considerations**:
   - The committee planned work sessions to further discuss special education funding, catastrophic aid, and the SWEPT formula. Amendments were suggested to address concerns about perverse incentives, stigma, and inadequate funding levels.

3. **Federal Compliance**:
   - Discussions underscored the importance of aligning state funding mechanisms with federal mandates, such as the **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)** and the principle of the **least restrictive environment (LRE)**.

4. **Public Input and Advocacy**:
   - Public testimony played a significant role in the discussions, with parents, educators, and advocates sharing their experiences and advocating for equitable and adequate funding.

### **Conclusion**

The meeting highlighted the complexity of education funding in New Hampshire, with a focus on special education, SWEPT, and broader funding equity. While various bills aim to address these issues, concerns remain about fairness, local control, and the adequacy of proposed funding levels. The committee’s ongoing work sessions and potential amendments will be critical in shaping a balanced and sustainable approach to education funding.
