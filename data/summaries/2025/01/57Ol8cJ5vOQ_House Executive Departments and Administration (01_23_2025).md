**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on January 23, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 23, 2025, focused on several key bills related to professional licensing, healthcare practices, and scope of practice expansions. The discussions highlighted the balance between improving access to care, ensuring patient safety, and addressing administrative burdens for professionals. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

### **Professional Licensing and Healthcare Practices**
1. **Continuity of Care and Licensing Compacts**:
   - Representatives emphasized the importance of licensing compacts to facilitate continuity of care, particularly for patients moving between states or accessing telehealth services. Personal experiences were shared about the challenges of transitioning patients due to a lack of available providers.
   
2. **Criminal Background Checks for Healthcare Professionals**:
   - There was a debate about the necessity of criminal background checks for certain healthcare professionals, such as recreational therapists and respiratory care practitioners. The discussions underscored the importance of public safety and the potential for expediting the review process through standardized language in statutes.

3. **Psychotherapy Licensing in Schools**:
   - Representative Leon introduced a bill to remove an exemption allowing unlicensed individuals to practice psychotherapy in schools. The discussion focused on protecting vulnerable children and ensuring appropriate standards for mental health service providers.

4. **CPA Retired Title**:
   - Representative Muns presented a bill allowing retired Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) to use the title "CPA Retired" on business cards and other documents, provided they do not represent themselves as actively practicing. The bill aims to recognize their professional achievements while ensuring they do not perform licensed services without a valid license.

5. **Fiscal Impact and Legal Concerns**:
   - Throughout the discussions, representatives raised questions about the fiscal impact of these bills and potential legal issues, such as the use of specific titles and the need for standardized language in statutes.

### **House Bill 144: Dental Hygienists’ Authority**
- **Purpose**: This bill addresses discrepancies between state statutes and rules regarding dental hygienists’ authority to administer nitrous oxide and local anesthesia. Currently, rules allow it, but statutes do not explicitly grant this authority or set requirements for it.
- **Discussion**: The bill aims to align statutes with existing rules without introducing new deficiencies. Committee members questioned the necessity of the bill, as there are no reported issues with hygienists overstepping their scope. The bill passed unanimously in the committee.

### **House Bill 145: Dietitian Licensure Compact**
- **Purpose**: This bill introduces a **Dietitian Licensure Compact**, allowing licensed dietitians to practice across member states without needing separate licenses. It also mandates criminal background checks for dietitians in New Hampshire.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Compact Benefits**: Improves access to care, especially for telehealth and continuity of care for patients who move or travel. It also supports military spouses and enhances workforce mobility.
  - **Background Checks**: Ensures public safety by requiring criminal history checks for initial licensure.
  - **Military Impact**: The compact includes provisions to support military spouses, who often relocate frequently.
  - **Current Status**: Four states have enacted the compact, and 10 others, including New Hampshire, have pending legislation. Seven states are needed for the compact to become active.
- **Testimonies**: Dietitians and educators expressed strong support for the compact, noting its potential to reduce administrative burdens, improve workforce mobility, and enhance continuity of care for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes and eating disorders.
- **Outcome**: The bill received strong support from stakeholders, though some committee members sought further clarification on specific provisions. The committee moved into executive session to deliberate further.

### **House Bill 236: Retired CPA Title**
- **Purpose**: This bill allows CPAs to use the "Retired CPA" title if they are at least 55 years old and in good standing with the state board. Retired CPAs can provide limited volunteer services but cannot perform auditing or attest services.
- **Discussion**: The bill aligns with the Uniform Accountancy Act, which has been adopted by 22 states. Some representatives questioned the necessity of the bill, arguing that CPAs should already be able to use the "Retired CPA" title without additional regulation. The motion to pass the bill was approved with an 11-1 vote.

### **House Bill 349: Optometrists’ Scope of Practice**
- **Purpose**: This bill seeks to modernize the Optometric Statute in New Hampshire by allowing optometrists to perform certain laser eye procedures (YAG laser capsulotomy, selective laser trabeculoplasty, and laser peripheral iridotomy) after certification by the Board of Registration in Optometry.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Proponents argue that optometrists are already trained to perform these procedures in optometry schools nationwide and have been managing related complications for years. The bill would align New Hampshire with 12 other states where optometrists are authorized to perform these procedures, which are proven to be safe and effective.
  - **Concerns**: Opponents, including ophthalmologists, question the adequacy of optometrists' training for surgical procedures, particularly the lack of hands-on experience with live patients in most optometry schools. They argue that surgical proficiency requires extensive residency programs, which optometrists do not undergo, and that low surgical volume increases the risk of complications.
  - **Access to Care**: Supporters highlight the lack of access to eye care in rural areas, particularly the North Country, where there are no ophthalmologists in some counties. Opponents counter that New Hampshire already has favorable access to ophthalmologists, with 90% of residents living within a 30-minute drive of one.
  - **Ethical and Professional Considerations**: Proponents stress that optometrists have the same ethical obligations as ophthalmologists and would refer cases beyond their scope to specialists. Critics argue that expanding optometrists' scope of practice could undermine the training and role of ophthalmologists.
- **Outcome**: The bill will move to a subcommittee for further discussion, with a focus on addressing concerns about training, proficiency, and access.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with several bills being referred to subcommittees for further review and potential amendments. The discussions reflected a broader tension between expanding access to care and ensuring patient safety through rigorous training and professional standards. The overarching theme was the need to balance these priorities while addressing the administrative and regulatory challenges faced by healthcare professionals and other licensed practitioners.
