The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 7, 2025, to discuss a wide range of topics related to consumer protection, regulatory oversight, insurance, banking, securities, and the operations of the New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC). The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to strengthening consumer protection laws, addressing emerging challenges, and ensuring regulatory efficiency across various sectors. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Consumer Protection and Regulatory Oversight**
The committee emphasized the importance of robust consumer protection laws and effective regulatory oversight. Key points included:
- **Consumer Protection Bureau**: Brandon Gad, Chief of the Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau, outlined the bureau’s responsibilities, such as enforcing consumer protection laws, investigating unfair and deceptive practices, and addressing elder abuse and financial exploitation. Gad stressed the need for clear and enforceable legislative language to ensure effective enforcement.
- **Legislative Challenges**: The committee discussed past challenges, including exemptions in consumer protection statutes, and the need for legislative fixes to ensure comprehensive protection. The importance of regulatory bodies having the authority to enforce these laws effectively was underscored.
- **Healthcare and Nonprofit Oversight**: The committee reviewed the oversight of healthcare entities, particularly the acquisition of nonprofit hospitals by for-profit companies, ensuring that assets are preserved for public benefit. The Charitable Trust Unit’s role in regulating nonprofits, including healthcare entities and charter schools, was also discussed.

### **Insurance and Consumer Safety**
The committee addressed the dynamics of the insurance market and its impact on consumers:
- **Insurance Market Trends**: The increasing frequency and severity of catastrophic weather events (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires) were identified as significant drivers of insurance losses, contributing to a "hard market" and rising premiums. Consumers were encouraged to shop around for better rates.
- **Legislative Initiatives**: Ongoing efforts to address issues like ground ambulance billing and mental health accessibility were highlighted. The Behavioral Health Advisory Committee was mentioned as a key resource for addressing mental health concerns.
- **Consumer Education**: The Insurance Department focused on increasing consumer education around financial literacy and fraud prevention, particularly for vulnerable populations like the elderly.

### **Banking and Financial Services**
The Banking Department’s mission to regulate financial services and protect consumers was outlined:
- **Regulatory Oversight**: The department supervises banks, credit unions, and licensed consumer credit entities, conducting examinations, monitoring data, and investigating consumer complaints. It is self-funded, relying on fines, fees, and assessments.
- **Modernization and Recruitment**: The department is modernizing its data systems and actively recruiting, particularly for attorneys, to strengthen its team.
- **Consumer Education**: Efforts to increase financial literacy and fraud prevention were emphasized, including outreach to vulnerable populations and collaboration with community organizations.

### **Securities Regulation and Investor Protection**
The Securities Bureau’s role in protecting investors and enforcing securities laws was discussed:
- **Investor Protection**: The Bureau handles cases involving broker-dealers, investment advisors, and unlicensed securities transactions, including those involving cryptocurrency and robo-advisors. Enforcement actions are taken in collaboration with state and federal agencies.
- **Emerging Issues**: The Bureau is actively addressing cryptocurrency fraud and the role of artificial intelligence in investments, ensuring firms provide adequate disclosures about AI-driven financial decisions.
- **Investor Education**: Educational materials on topics like investment fraud, marriage and finances, and starting a new job are provided, funded by fines and penalties.

### **New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC)**
The NHLC’s operations, financial performance, and future plans were reviewed:
- **Organizational Structure**: The NHLC is composed of Enforcement, Administration, and Marketing & Merchandising divisions. It has modernized its systems, transitioning to a cloud-based Microsoft D365 system to improve efficiency.
- **Financial Performance**: The NHLC reported a decline in net profit for FY 2024 due to increased product costs and higher expenses. However, it has contributed $4.6 million to the state’s general fund since its inception.
- **Retail and Marketing Strategies**: The NHLC operates 65 retail outlets, with 50% of its business coming from cross-border sales. Competitive pricing and discounting are key strategies to remain competitive, especially with the presence of Total Wine stores in New England.
- **Enforcement and Education**: The Enforcement Division focuses on education, licensing, and compliance with alcohol and tobacco laws. Public awareness campaigns and educational programs in high schools address underage drinking and responsible alcohol consumption.
- **Community Engagement**: The NHLC has raised nearly $4.3 million for charitable organizations since 2015 and uses social media and public events to promote responsible drinking.

### **Key Themes and Future Directions**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to:
- **Consumer Protection**: Strengthening laws, ensuring regulatory oversight, and addressing emerging challenges like cryptocurrency fraud and AI in investments.
- **Regulatory Efficiency**: Modernizing systems, recruiting skilled personnel, and adopting a pragmatic and collaborative approach to regulation.
- **Market Trends**: Monitoring the impact of cannabis legalization, declining alcohol sales, and shifting consumer behaviors on the state’s economy and public safety.
- **Collaboration**: Working with state and federal agencies, community organizations, and stakeholders to enforce laws, protect consumers, and promote financial literacy.
