### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 119 FN (Rental Fleet Registration)**  
   - **Purpose**: Allows rental companies to choose New Hampshire as their base jurisdiction for registering rental fleets under the International Registration Plan (IRP).  
   - **Discussion**: Testimony revealed that this capability already exists under the IRP, making the bill redundant. The DMV confirmed no additional staffing or fiscal impact would be required.  
   - **Outcome**: Questions arose about the necessity of the bill, as it does not introduce new functionality.  

2. **House Bill 612 FN (Temporary Driver’s License for Youth Operators)**  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes a temporary driver’s license for youth operators turning 21, allowing them to renew their license up to 30 days before their birthday and receive a temporary license until their horizontal license is issued.  
   - **Support**: The DMV supported the bill, citing streamlined processes, reduced duplicate license requests, and fewer DMV visits.  
   - **Fiscal Impact**: A one-time system update costing $48,000.  
   - **Outcome**: Generally supported for its efficiency and convenience.  

3. **House Bill 209 FN (Exempting New Vehicles from Inspections)**  
   - **Purpose**: Exempts new vehicles purchased in the model year or before from inspection for two years.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued it would save costs for taxpayers, as new vehicles are regularly serviced under warranty.  
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including the DMV, State Police, and auto industry representatives, emphasized the importance of safety inspections, especially in New Hampshire’s harsh climate. Concerns were raised about high failure rates for even new vehicles, potential road safety risks, and impacts on small businesses.  
   - **Additional Concerns**: Electric vehicles’ heavier weight and tire wear, as well as emissions inspection compliance with federal regulations, were highlighted.  
   - **Outcome**: Significant debate, with strong opposition due to safety concerns.  

4. **House Bill 239 FN (Lane Filtering for Motorcycles)**  
   - **Purpose**: Allows motorcyclists to filter between lanes in slow-moving or stopped traffic (under 10 mph).  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued it reduces rear-end collisions, improves traffic flow, and prevents motorcycles from overheating.  
   - **Opposition**: Concerns included the need for driver education and potential dangers of lane filtering, even at low speeds.  
   - **Outcome**: Mixed opinions, with emphasis on further discussion and education.  

5. **House Bill 259 (Handicap License Plates)**  
   - **Purpose**: Removes limits on the number of handicap license plates a handicapped individual can obtain.  
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted 13-3 to recommend “ought to pass,” emphasizing accessibility.  

6. **House Bill 287 (Sharing Motor Vehicle Incident Information)**  
   - **Purpose**: Requires police departments to share certain motor vehicle incident information with fire departments.  
   - **Concerns**: Potential violations of federal HIPAA laws and privacy issues.  
   - **Outcome**: Discussion recessed to February 4th for further research.  

7. **House Bill 326 (Antique Vehicle Restrictions)**  
   - **Purpose**: Would restrict the operation of antique passenger vehicles (model year 1968 or earlier) to 20 miles on state or local highways unless retrofitted with seat belts.  
   - **Outcome**: Unanimously voted “inexpedient to legislate,” criticized as unenforceable and impractical.  

8. **House Bill 140 (Blue Envelope Program for Drivers with Autism)**  
   - **Purpose**: Establishes a voluntary blue envelope program for drivers with autism spectrum disorders, later amended to include individuals with trauma and stress-related disorders (e.g., PTSD).  
   - **Outcome**: Unanimously recommended “ought to pass,” with plans for education and further discussion.  

9. **House Bill 133 (Modifying New Resident Driver’s License Transfer Requirements)**  
   - **Purpose**: Notifies residents who haven’t transferred their licenses within 60 days, reinforcing existing law.  
   - **Support**: Proponents argued it ensures compliance with voter registration laws.  
   - **Opposition**: Concerns about costs ($40,000 for technology upgrades and $677,000+ for DMV positions) and potential unintended consequences.  
   - **Outcome**: Voted 9-7 in favor of “ought to pass,” with a minority report expected.  

10. **House Bill 258 (Study Commission for NH Seacoast Emergency Evacuation Plan)**  
    - **Purpose**: Establishes a study commission for an emergency evacuation plan for the NH Seacoast.

3. **Federal and State Compliance**: Changes to emissions inspections and other programs highlighted the need for coordination with federal regulations and agencies like the EPA.
