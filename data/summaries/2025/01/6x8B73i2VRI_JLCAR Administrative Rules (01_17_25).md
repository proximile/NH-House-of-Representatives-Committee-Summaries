The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) meeting on January 17, 2025, began at 9:00 AM with a light-hearted remark from the chair about the cold weather and a hot tub. The meeting opened with the Pledge of Allegiance, led by Senator Reardon. The first order of business was the approval of the minutes from the previous month, which was quickly moved, seconded, and approved without discussion.

The committee then addressed the consent calendar, which included routine items, and it was approved unanimously. Two pending items were discussed:  
1. **Manufactured Housing Installer Standards**: A preliminary objection was raised, but the response deadline was extended to the next month.  
2. **Dental Examiners Board**: The deadline for resolving a sedation issue was extended to April, as stakeholders are working on a resolution.  

The chair noted that this was the first time in JLCAR history that all items were on the consent calendar without any continuations. The contingent meeting for the month was canceled, and the meeting adjourned after just 4 minutes, marking it as one of the fastest in JLCAR history.  

Following the adjournment, an informational training session was held to explain JLCAR procedures, motions, and processes, expected to last no more than an hour. The session aimed to educate representatives and senators on the committee's operations.
