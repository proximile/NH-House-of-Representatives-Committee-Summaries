The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) meeting on January 17, 2025, began at 9:00 AM with a brief delay due to the chair's tardiness. The meeting opened with the Pledge of Allegiance, led by Senator Reardon. The first order of business was the adoption of the minutes from the previous month, which was approved without discussion.

Next, the committee addressed the consent calendar, which was also approved unanimously. Two pending items were discussed: 
1. **Manufactured Housing Installer Standards**: A preliminary objection was raised, and a response is expected within the next 30 days.  
2. **Dental Examiners Board**: The committee agreed to extend the deadline until April to allow the board to resolve issues related to sedation standards.

The meeting concluded quickly, with no other business to address. A motion to cancel the contingent meeting for the month was passed, and the meeting adjourned. Following the adjournment, a training session was held to explain JLCAR procedures, including the types of motions allowed and the overall process. The chair noted that this was the first time in JLCAR history that all agenda items were on the consent calendar, making it one of the fastest meetings on record. The training session was expected to last no more than an hour.
