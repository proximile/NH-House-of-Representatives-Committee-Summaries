### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/15/2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 15, 2025, to discuss several key bills and issues affecting the state’s commerce and consumer sectors. The meeting highlighted a range of topics, from financial regulations and ambulance service funding to the integration of digital assets into state financial strategies. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

#### **1. House Bill 359: Prohibiting Denial of Banking and Insurance Services**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prevent banks and insurance companies from denying services based on non-quantitative, subjective factors.
- **Opposition**: Strong objections were raised by stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Bankers Association, insurance companies (State Farm, Allstate), and New Hampshire Businesses for Social Responsibility. Key concerns included:
  - Violation of free market principles.
  - Creation of unnecessary regulatory burdens.
  - Potential for banks to be treated as "guilty until proven innocent."
  - Negative impact on smaller banks and businesses’ financial decision-making.
- **Legal and Practical Challenges**: The New Hampshire Department of Justice and the Bank Commissioner highlighted enforceability issues, conflicts with federal laws (e.g., the Bank Secrecy Act), and the increased burden of handling consumer complaints.
- **Outcome**: The committee expressed skepticism about the bill’s viability, noting similar bills had failed in previous sessions.

#### **2. House Bill 316 and House Bill 3516: Ambulance Service Funding and Balance Billing**
- **Background**: Ambulance services in New Hampshire face significant financial challenges, including low reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid, balance billing practices, and rising operational costs. Rural areas are particularly affected due to longer distances and lower population density.
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - **HB 316**: Prohibits balance billing and increases reimbursement rates to ensure financial sustainability.
  - **HB 3516**: Proposes a mandatory cost-based reimbursement schedule (197% of Medicare) and prohibits balance billing. It also establishes a commission to explore an all-payer model for uniform reimbursement across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers.
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Ambulance providers argue that the proposed rates are insufficient to cover costs, potentially leading to service reductions or increased reliance on property taxes.
  - Insurance carriers are hesitant about government rate-setting but acknowledge the need to address balance billing and protect consumers.
- **State Comparisons**: States like Arkansas, Colorado, and Indiana have implemented higher reimbursement rates (300-400% of Medicare), raising questions about the adequacy of New Hampshire’s proposed rates.
- **Outcome**: Both bills were referred to subcommittees for further review, with a focus on balancing provider sustainability, consumer protection, and cost neutrality.

#### **3. House Bill 302: Investing in Precious Metals and Digital Assets**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes allowing the state treasury to invest in precious metals (e.g., gold, silver) and digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin, stablecoins) to hedge against inflation and diversify investment strategies.
- **Arguments in Support**:
  - Bitcoin and precious metals are seen as hedges against inflation and currency devaluation.
  - Other states (e.g., Utah, North Dakota) have passed similar legislation, and New Hampshire aims to modernize its financial strategies.
  - The bill includes safeguards, such as limiting investments to digital assets with a market cap over $500 billion.
- **Concerns**:
  - Bitcoin and digital assets are highly volatile and lack intrinsic value, posing risks to state funds.
  - Constitutional concerns were raised regarding Article 1, Section 10, which prohibits states from making anything but gold and silver legal tender.
  - Questions were raised about the state treasury’s expertise and the regulatory environment for digital assets.
- **Outcome**: The bill was referred to a subcommittee for further review and refinement.

#### **4. House Bill 310: Study Commission for Stable Tokens and Tokenized Assets**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes the creation of a commission to study and recommend a regulatory framework for stable tokens (backed by assets like U.S. dollars) and tokenized real-world assets (e.g., gold, real estate).
- **Key Points**:
  - The commission would address regulatory gaps, ensure transparency, and prevent fraud.
  - Wyoming’s Stable Token Commission was cited as a model for state-level innovation.
- **Concerns**:
  - Potential for money laundering and the need for robust consumer protection.
  - Questions about the impact of tokenization on the U.S. dollar’s stability and global reserve status.
- **Support**:
  - The New Hampshire Banking Department and the Uniform Law Commission expressed support, emphasizing the bill’s alignment with existing digital asset laws.
  - Public testimony highlighted the efficiency and transparency benefits of blockchain technology.
- **Outcome**: The bill will move to a subcommittee for further discussion and refinement.

#### **5. General Observations and Next Steps**
- The meeting underscored the complexities of balancing innovation, consumer protection, and financial sustainability across various sectors.
- Tensions between modernizing financial strategies (e.g., embracing digital assets) and maintaining fiscal conservatism and constitutional principles were evident.
- Representatives emphasized the need for further education, regulatory clarity, and stakeholder input before advancing certain proposals.
- Subcommittees were established to review and refine several bills, including those related to ambulance services, digital assets, and banking regulations.
