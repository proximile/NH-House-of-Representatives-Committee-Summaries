### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (January 24, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 24, 2025, to address a wide range of issues related to state-federal relations, veterans affairs, military families, historical accountability, and international human rights. The meeting featured detailed discussions on several bills and resolutions, with a strong focus on supporting military families, uncovering historical truths, resolving interstate disputes, and addressing global human rights concerns.

#### **Military and Veterans Affairs**
1. **House Bill 64 (Military Spouse Employment Preference)**:
   - **Purpose**: HB 64 aims to provide employment preferences for military spouses in New Hampshire, addressing the challenges they face due to frequent relocations. The bill seeks to reduce the high unemployment rate among military spouses (21% in 2021) by creating stronger employment pathways.
   - **Support**: Melissa, the New England Region Liaison for the U.S. Department of Defense, testified in support, emphasizing the economic and emotional benefits for military families. Representatives shared personal experiences, highlighting the sacrifices made by military families and the need for state support.

2. **House Bill 220 (Educational Support Services Transfer)**:
   - **Purpose**: HB 220 proposes transferring statutory authority for educational support services from the Department of Education to the Department of Military Affairs and Veteran Services. This change aims to formalize existing practices and streamline processes.
   - **Support**: Both departments support the bill, which aligns with current operations and ensures statutory consistency.

3. **House Bill 122 (National Guard Property Damage Compensation)**:
   - **Purpose**: HB 122 increases the maximum payment the National Guard can make for minor property damage (e.g., mailboxes, fences) from $500 to $1,000, without requiring a lengthy legal process. The change accounts for inflation and aims to expedite compensation for affected citizens.

#### **Historical Accountability and Transparency**
1. **House Bill 256 (USS Liberty Investigation)**:
   - **Purpose**: HB 256 proposes establishing a committee to study the federal government’s response to the 1967 attack on the USS Liberty by Israeli forces. The bill seeks to investigate whether the U.S. government properly determined culpability for the attack.
   - **Testimonies**: Survivors, including Tom Molen, provided harrowing accounts of the attack, describing it as deliberate and criticizing the federal government’s subsequent cover-up. They called for transparency, accountability, and an official apology.

2. **Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Boundary Dispute**:
   - **Issue**: The ongoing boundary dispute between New Hampshire and Maine regarding the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard was discussed. Advocates argued that the shipyard and surrounding areas legally belong to New Hampshire, based on historical and legal evidence.
   - **Proposed Solution**: A resolution was proposed urging Congress to recognize the shipyard as part of New Hampshire and requesting the President to change the duty station designation for shipyard workers from Kittery, Maine, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. This would prevent Maine from taxing New Hampshire residents working at the shipyard, allowing them to retain an estimated $5,000 annually.

#### **International Human Rights**
1. **HR11 (Human Rights and Religious Freedoms in Bangladesh)**:
   - **Purpose**: HR11 addresses human rights abuses and religious persecution in Bangladesh under the interim government led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, which took power in August 2024 following a student-led uprising.
   - **Testimonies**: Survivors and advocates detailed widespread violence against religious minorities (Hindus, Buddhists, Christians), destruction of cultural artifacts, and the imprisonment of minority leaders without due process. The resolution urges the U.S. government to investigate and take action to restore peace and democracy in Bangladesh.

2. **HCR9 (Rejecting EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive)**:
   - **Purpose**: HCR9 opposes the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDD), which requires large businesses to enforce ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards across their supply chains, regardless of location.
   - **Concerns**: Representatives argued that the directive is an overreach of EU authority, threatens U.S. sovereignty, and could impose significant financial burdens on U.S. companies. Non-compliance could result in fines of at least 5% of a company’s global revenue and lawsuits from activist groups.
   - **Resolution Goal**: HCR9 urges the U.S. government to reject compliance with the CSDD, viewing it as a threat to U.S. economic independence and corporate interests.

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Support for Military Families**: The meeting highlighted bipartisan support for measures aimed at improving the economic stability and well-being of military families, including employment preferences for military spouses and streamlined educational support services.
- **Historical Accountability**: Discussions on the USS Liberty attack and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard boundary dispute emphasized the importance of transparency, accountability, and justice in historical and jurisdictional matters.
- **Human Rights Advocacy**: The resolutions on Bangladesh and the EU’s CSDD reflected New Hampshire’s commitment to addressing global human rights abuses and protecting U.S. sovereignty in the face of international regulatory pressures.
- **Interstate Disputes**: The financial dispute between New Hampshire and Maine over the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard highlighted the need for clear jurisdictional boundaries and fair taxation practices.

The meeting concluded with plans for further review, amendments, and votes on the discussed bills and resolutions, underscoring the House’s dedication to addressing both local and global issues affecting New Hampshire residents and the broader community.
