**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: House Resources, Recreation and Development (01/29/2025)**

On January 29, 2025, the New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to address a series of bills related to environmental protection, water quality, recreational trails, and resource management. The meeting emphasized a balance between economic development, personal freedoms, and environmental conservation, with significant discussions and outcomes as follows:

---

### **Environmental Protection and Water Quality**
1. **Establishment of a Village District (HB 332)**: A motion to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill passed, despite opposition from Representatives Vil and Sergeant, who highlighted the need for local control over pollutants and the economic impact of contaminated lakes. Representatives Dupont and Donnelly supported the ITL, citing concerns about government overreach and exclusionary environments.

2. **Comprehensive State Development Plan (HB 334)**: The ITL motion passed after Representative Dun argued that the bill was redundant and costly, while Representative Darby emphasized the importance of environmental planning for New Hampshire’s tourism economy.

3. **Increasing Penalties for Shoreland Violations (HB 422)**: The ITL motion passed despite opposition from Representatives Darby and Vil, who advocated for stronger enforcement. Representative Donnelly supported the ITL, noting that the Department of Environmental Services (DES) had not pursued violations in the past decade.

4. **Water Filtration Systems (HB 449)**: The ITL motion passed unanimously after Representative Baldwin raised concerns about potential contamination risks and federal violations, with support from Representative NAB.

3. **OHRV Operation on Highways (HB 113)**: The committee unanimously voted to retain the bill, allowing off-highway recreational vehicle (OHRV) operation on certain highways within the town of Windsor.

4. **Extending OHRV Trail Closing Dates (HB 127)**: The bill passed 11 to 5, extending the closing date of OHRV trails on the Connecticut River headquarters property from September 30th to Columbus Day, seen as an economic development measure for Pittsburgh.

5. **Increasing Utility Terrain Vehicle Weight Limits (HB 174)**: The committee voted 9 to 7 against passing the bill, citing enforcement challenges and potential impacts on private landowners.
