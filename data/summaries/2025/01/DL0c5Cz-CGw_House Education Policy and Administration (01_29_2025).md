---

### **Special Education Legislation**

1. **House Bill 121 - Local Special Education Advisory Councils**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes the establishment of parent-driven councils to improve communication between parents of children with disabilities and school administrations. These councils would advise on special education programs, safety, and policies.
   - **Composition**: Councils would consist of parents of children with disabilities, with at least one parent from each town in a district. Meetings would be open to all parents and held quarterly with district administrations.
   - **Parent Involvement**: Emphasized as critical, with an annual workshop proposed to inform parents about services and rights.
   - **Concerns**:
     - **Membership Selection**: Concerns were raised about the role of Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) in selecting members, with suggestions to involve school boards and ensure at least half of the council members are parents of children with disabilities or individuals with disabilities.
     - **Privacy**: Potential stigma and privacy issues were discussed, but the sponsor clarified that participation is voluntary and does not require disclosing specific details about children.
     - **Resource Allocation**: Costs were expected to be minimal, involving meeting space and materials.
   - **Testimony**: Parents and advocacy groups supported the bill’s intent but raised concerns about clarity in membership and potential divisiveness.

2. **House Bill 76 - Tracking Special Education Complaints**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill requires the Department of Education to track and publicly report special education complaints.
   - **Concerns**: Privacy issues were highlighted, particularly for smaller districts where posting district names could lead to personally identifiable information being disclosed.
   - **Current Practices**: The department already tracks complaints via an Excel sheet and posts redacted decision letters online.

3. **House Bill 388 - Public Reports on Special Education**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill mandates local school boards to issue public reports on special education expenditures, including costs for services, transportation, legal fees, and out-of-district placements.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued for transparency and accountability in special education spending, noting that the data is already collected for federal and state reporting.
   - **Concerns**:
     - **Privacy**: Opponents, including the Disability Rights Center, warned that the data could inadvertently identify students, violating federal privacy laws like IDEA and FERPA.
     - **Divisiveness**: Publicizing costs could lead to stigmatization or community tension.
   - **Alternatives**: Suggestions were made for the Department of Education to aggregate and publish data to protect privacy.

1. **House Bill 677 - EpiPen Legislation**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill mandates schools to maintain a supply of EpiPens for emergency use, particularly for students with unknown allergies.

2. **House Bill 329 - Air Quality and Temperature in Schools**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill requires districts to develop policies to address extreme temperatures and improve air quality using the EPA’s Tools for Schools program.
   - **Support**: Educators highlighted the negative impact of extreme temperatures on learning and health, especially in aging school buildings.
   - **Opposition**: The New Hampshire School Boards Association argued that such decisions should remain local, citing concerns about unfunded mandates and additional staff training.

### **Other Education-Related Bills**

   - **Purpose**: The bill proposes including the impact on people with disabilities in Holocaust and genocide education.
   - **Support**: Testimony emphasized the historical significance of people with disabilities being the first group targeted by the Nazis and the need to ensure their inclusion in curricula.

2. **House Bill 532 - IEP Facilitation**:
   - **Purpose**: The bill moves IEP facilitation from the list of alternative dispute resolutions (ADR) to its own section, emphasizing its role in resolving disputes between parents and school districts.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**

- **Parent Involvement**: Several bills, including HB 121 and HB 76, emphasized the importance of empowering parents, particularly those of children with disabilities, to have a voice in education policy.
- **Transparency vs. Privacy**: Discussions around HB 388 and HB 76 highlighted the tension between increasing transparency in special education spending and protecting student privacy.
- **Health and Safety**: Bills like HB 677 (EpiPens) and HB 329 (air quality) underscored the need to address health and safety concerns in schools, with debates over state mandates versus local control.
- **Funding and Resource Allocation**: Concerns about the high costs of special education and the potential financial burden of new mandates were recurring themes.

The committee concluded the meeting with plans to refine several bills, including HB 121, HB 388, and HB 329, addressing concerns about privacy, resource allocation, and implementation before proceeding to a vote.
