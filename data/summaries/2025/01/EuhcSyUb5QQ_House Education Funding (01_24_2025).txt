**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (01/24/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 24, 2025, to address a range of education funding issues and related legislative bills. The meeting was marked by detailed discussions on school building aid, special education funding, Career and Technical Education (CTE) certification, Education Freedom Accounts (EFA), and half-day kindergarten mandates. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points from the meeting:

### **Opening Remarks and Legislative Context**
The meeting began with the chairperson outlining the agenda and emphasizing the need to address 21 bills by March 6. Delays in fiscal reports and notes created time constraints, prompting a sense of urgency in advancing legislation. The chair stressed the importance of collaboration, prioritization, and efficiency in tackling the complex issues at hand.

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. HB 295 - School Building Aid**
Representative Michael Kahill introduced **HB 295**, which proposes making school building aid funds non-lapsing. This would allow unused funds to roll over for future projects, potentially benefiting smaller initiatives or accelerating priority projects. Committee members raised questions about past lapsed funds, the source of building aid (whether separate from the education trust fund), and the potential impact on school infrastructure planning.

#### **2. HB 237 - Special Education Funds**
Representative Dan McGuire presented **HB 237**, which seeks to prohibit the use of state special education funds on students not receiving special education services. Becky Wilson from the New Hampshire School Boards Association opposed the bill, arguing it is unnecessary, unclear, and could hinder integrated special education services. The discussion highlighted concerns about federal IDEA compliance, the tracking of special education funds, and the potential impact on inclusion and least restrictive environment requirements. Jim Carney from the Department of Education clarified that special education aid must be spent on students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and that IDEA funds are strictly regulated.

#### **3. HB 354 - CTE Certification**
Representative Rick Lad introduced **HB 354**, which creates alternative certification pathways for CTE instructors. The bill aims to address instructor shortages by allowing experienced professionals with industry credentials to teach without traditional teaching certifications. The discussion underscored the challenges of attracting skilled tradespeople to teaching roles due to higher private sector salaries. The bill also aligns with RSA 21:9, which governs professional employee qualifications, emphasizing the importance of professional experience in CTE instruction.

#### **4. HB 549 - Education Freedom Accounts (EFA)**
Representative Timothy Horgan presented **HB 549**, which seeks to restrict the use of EFA funds for religious education. Horgan argued that the EFA program violates **Part I, Article 6 of the New Hampshire Constitution**, which prohibits the use of public funds for religious education. He highlighted that **86% of private school EFA funds** went to religious institutions in the 2022-2023 academic year, raising concerns about oversight, accountability, and program growth. The bill sparked debate over constitutional issues, federal court rulings, and the potential fiscal impact, with calls for further work sessions to gather financial data and address legal implications.

#### **5. HB 484 - CTE Space Repurposing**
This bill proposes allowing school districts to repurpose CTE space after 20 years of exclusive use, provided the repurposing supports CTE program expansion. The goal is to save costs and avoid unnecessary demolition of school facilities.

#### **6. HB 319 - Half-Day Kindergarten**
Representatives discussed **HB 319**, which aims to eliminate mandates for transportation and meal services in half-day kindergarten programs. Proponents argued that these mandates are overly restrictive and costly for districts with half-day programs. Opponents, including representatives from New Hampshire Hunger Solutions, emphasized the importance of school meals for children's nutrition and academic success. Questions were raised about the number of half-day programs in the state and the feasibility of meeting federal meal standards with snacks.

### **Themes and Broader Considerations**

#### **1. Constitutional and Policy Concerns**
Several bills, particularly **HB 549**, raised constitutional questions about the use of public funds for religious education. The debate highlighted the tension between state constitutional provisions and federal court rulings, as well as the broader policy implications of the EFA program.

#### **2. Fiscal Challenges and Prioritization**
The committee acknowledged potential budget cuts (ranging from 4% to 14%) and the need to prioritize education funding policies accordingly. Discussions emphasized the importance of fiscal responsibility, oversight, and the efficient allocation of resources.

#### **3. Collaboration and Efficiency**
The chair stressed the importance of working collaboratively, consulting with ranking members, and focusing on bills with a realistic chance of passing. There was consideration of splitting into subcommittees or working groups to address specific issues more efficiently.

#### **4. Equity and Access**
Several discussions centered on ensuring equitable access to education, particularly for special education students, children in half-day kindergarten programs, and students in CTE programs. The committee grappled with balancing cost-saving measures with the need to provide essential services and support for vulnerable populations.

### **Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with plans to hold work sessions on the discussed bills, particularly those related to special education funding, CTE certification, and EFA restrictions. The committee emphasized the need for further analysis of fiscal impacts, legal implications, and potential compromises to address the complex challenges facing New Hampshireâ€™s education system.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the multifaceted nature of education funding and the importance of thoughtful, collaborative policymaking to address the needs of students, families, and school districts across the state.
