---

### **Committee Structure and Procedures**
The meeting began with introductions from committee members, who shared their professional backgrounds in education and their commitment to improving New Hampshire’s education system. Chair Glenn Cordelli underscored the importance of civility, professionalism, and respect in committee interactions and public hearings. The committee reviewed its procedures, including the division of bills between policy and funding subcommittees, the use of the consent calendar for non-controversial bills, and the handling of public testimony.

### **Legislative Proposals**
1. **School Treasurer Appointment Legislation**:  
   Representative Joe Alexander introduced a bill to allow school districts to appoint treasurers rather than elect them. Currently, towns can appoint treasurers, but school districts cannot. The bill aims to provide flexibility for districts to appoint qualified individuals with financial expertise, improving efficiency and accountability. Mr. Gross, a business administrator from SAU 19, supported the bill, citing the complexity of treasurer duties and the challenges of relying on elected individuals who may lack necessary skills. The committee discussed the historical context and potential benefits of the proposal.

2. **Financial Reporting Requirements for Public Academies**:  
   Representative Jess Edwards presented **House Bill 1116**, which would require public academies like Pinkerton Academy to provide the same financial transparency reports as public schools. Alan Lovino, an Auburn School Board member, testified in favor of the bill, emphasizing the need for accountability in the use of taxpayer funds. Tim Powers, Head of School at Pinkerton Academy, argued that the requested financial information is already available, albeit in a different format, and noted that Pinkerton does not receive state or federal tax dollars directly. The discussion centered on fairness, transparency, and the need for consistent reporting across educational institutions.

### **School Start Times Study**
Representative Wheeler introduced **House Bill 1884**, proposing a legislative study committee to examine the complexities of changing school start times. Middle school students testified about the negative effects of early start times on their health, well-being, and academic performance. Parents and educators supported later start times, citing research on improved outcomes, but raised concerns about logistical challenges such as busing schedules and after-school activities. The New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA) advocated for local control but supported a statewide study to address challenges and identify solutions. The committee discussed broadening the study’s scope to include broader implications for student well-being and logistics.

### **Education Law and Policy Review**
The committee reviewed several areas of education law, including:
- **State Board of Education Duties**: Sections 9C and 9D, which address school district policies on course material exceptions and non-academic surveys.
- **Professional Standards Board (PSB)**: The PSB’s role in advising the State Board on professional practices for educators, including recent additions like Career Technical Education.
- **Special Education**: The complexities of special education law (Chapter 186c), alternative dispute resolution, and recent legislative changes.
- **Charter Schools**: The unique exemptions granted to charter schools from state laws and rules, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- **Background Checks and Code of Conduct**: The process for background checks for educators and the legislative directive for a code of conduct for licensed educational personnel.
- **Bullying and Restraint/Seclusion**: Reporting requirements for bullying, restraint, and seclusion in schools, compiled annually by the Department of Education.
- **Right to Know Law**: The application of New Hampshire’s Right to Know law (Chapter 91a) to education policy and administration.
