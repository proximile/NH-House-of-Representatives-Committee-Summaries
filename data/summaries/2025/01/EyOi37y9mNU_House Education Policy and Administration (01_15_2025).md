- **Home Education (RSA 193-a)**: The rule-making authority granted to the State Board of Education for home education was discussed, with a focus on the need for clear guidelines.

### **4. Financial Transparency and Treasurer Roles**
- **Treasurer Appointment Legislation**: Representative Joe Alexander introduced a bill to allow school districts to appoint rather than elect treasurers, providing communities with the choice to decide through a vote. The bill was supported by SAU 19’s business administrator, who highlighted the benefits of having qualified treasurers manage complex financial duties.
- **Pinkerton Academy Financial Transparency**: Representative Jess Edwards introduced HB 1116, which would require Pinkerton Academy, a semi-public institution, to provide the same financial transparency reports as public schools. Testimony from Auburn School Board member Alan Lov highlighted concerns about insufficient financial transparency, while Pinkerton’s Head of School, Tim Powers, argued that the academy already provides detailed financial information to sending towns. Disagreements centered on the format and standardization of financial reporting.

### **5. School Start Times and Student Well-Being**
- **Proposed Study Committee**: Representative Wheeler introduced House Bill 1884, which would establish a legislative study committee to examine the feasibility of changing school start times. The bill was motivated by research showing health and academic benefits of later start times for middle and high school students.
- **Student Testimonies**: Sixth-grade students shared personal experiences with early start times, citing exhaustion, stress, and safety concerns (e.g., walking to bus stops in the dark). Parents and community members supported later start times, emphasizing improved mental and physical health and academic outcomes.
- **Challenges and Local Control**: Logistical challenges, such as busing schedules and after-school activities, were acknowledged. The New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA) supported the study committee but opposed statewide mandates, emphasizing the importance of local control.
