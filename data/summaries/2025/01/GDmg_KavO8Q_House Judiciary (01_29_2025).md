**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Judiciary Committee Meeting on January 29, 2025**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on January 29, 2025, to discuss several significant bills and amendments, with a primary focus on **medical aid in dying (MAID)**, **competency restoration**, **judicial system reforms**, and **PFAS-related civil actions**. The meeting featured extensive debate, emotional testimonies, and detailed discussions on the ethical, practical, and societal implications of the proposed legislation.

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

#### **1. Medical Aid in Dying (HB 254)**
The most polarizing topic of the meeting was **House Bill 254**, the **New Hampshire End of Life Freedom Act**, which would legalize MAID for terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live. The bill includes safeguards such as requiring two independent physicians to certify the patient’s condition and mental competency, and mandates that the patient self-administer the medication.

- **Supporters** argued that MAID offers terminally ill patients the right to die with dignity, sparing them from prolonged suffering. They cited personal stories of loved ones who endured traumatic deaths and highlighted the success of similar laws in states like Oregon and Vermont. Supporters emphasized New Hampshire’s motto, "Live Free or Die," framing MAID as an issue of personal autonomy and freedom.
  
- **Opponents** raised concerns about a "slippery slope," fearing that MAID could lead to abuse, coercion, and the devaluation of vulnerable populations, including the elderly, disabled, and mentally ill. They argued that life is sacred and that MAID undermines medical ethics and societal values. Opponents also stressed the need for improved palliative and hospice care as alternatives to MAID.

The debate reflected deep ethical and moral divisions, with passionate testimonies from both sides. Supporters focused on compassion and individual choice, while opponents warned of potential risks to vulnerable populations and societal norms.

#### **2. Competency Restoration (HB 480)**
The committee discussed **House Bill 480**, which aims to establish a formal **competency restoration program** in New Hampshire. The current system is deemed ineffective, leaving individuals with mental health challenges unable to navigate the legal system.

- **Proposals:** A **forensic liaison program** was introduced as a pilot initiative to help individuals restore their competency and access mental health treatment. Stakeholders, including **NAMI New Hampshire**, emphasized the importance of reducing barriers to services and improving outcomes for those with mental health issues.
  
- **Concerns:** The committee noted the lack of a fiscal note for HB 480 and planned to revisit the bill after further review.

#### **3. Judicial System Reforms (HB 369)**
**House Bill 369** seeks to streamline the judicial process for **misdemeanor sexual assault cases** involving victims under the age of 16. The bill aims to prevent victims from having to testify twice by allowing defendants to choose upfront between a jury trial in Superior Court or a bench trial in Circuit Court.

- **Support:** Testimonies from survivors, advocates, and legal professionals highlighted the emotional toll of repeated testimony and the need to protect young victims. The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill with an "ought to pass" (OTP) recommendation.
  
- **Concerns:** Questions were raised about whether the bill should apply based on the victim’s age at the time of the assault or prosecution. Some members suggested clarifying the language to focus on the age during the assault.

#### **4. PFAS-Related Civil Actions (HB 199)**
**House Bill 199** proposes extending the **statute of limitations** for civil actions related to damages caused by **PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)** from 6 to 20 years. PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," have caused significant environmental and health issues in Southern New Hampshire.

- **Support:** Representatives and constituents shared personal and community impacts of PFAS contamination, including cancer, kidney disease, and developmental disorders. They argued that the extended statute of limitations would allow more time for victims to identify and address harm.
  
- **Opposition:** The **Business and Industry Association** raised concerns about stale evidence and legal complications, arguing that the extended timeline could hinder justice.

#### **5. Board of Tax and Land Appeals (HB 268)**
**House Bill 268** addresses logistical challenges for the **Board of Tax and Land Appeals (BTLA)** by allowing hearings for eminent domain cases to be held in Concord or via remote participation, rather than requiring them to take place in the county where the property is located.

- **Support:** BTLA members explained that county courthouses often lack available space, leading to inefficiencies. The bill aims to improve accessibility and reduce costs.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s commitment to addressing complex and emotionally charged issues, including end-of-life choices, mental health treatment, judicial reforms, and environmental justice. The discussions emphasized the need for collaboration among stakeholders, systemic reforms, and careful consideration of ethical and practical implications. While some bills, like HB 369, advanced with broad support, others, such as HB 254, remained deeply divisive, reflecting the broader societal debates surrounding individual rights, healthcare, and justice. The committee adjourned without final votes on several key bills, leaving their futures uncertain.
