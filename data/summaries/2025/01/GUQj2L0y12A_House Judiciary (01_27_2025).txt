The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee meeting on January 27, 2025, centered on **House Bill 476 (HB 476)**, which proposed a **15-week abortion ban**, and its associated **Amendment 2531**, which aimed to establish a reporting requirement for abortion statistics in the state. The meeting featured extensive testimonies from medical professionals, advocates, religious leaders, and citizens, reflecting deep divisions over the bill. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and themes:

---

### **House Bill 476: 15-Week Abortion Ban**
#### **Opposition to the Bill:**
1. **Medical and Ethical Concerns:**
   - Medical professionals, including OBGYNs, pediatricians, and midwives, argued that a 15-week ban is medically unsound. Many serious fetal anomalies and maternal health complications are not detected until after 15 weeks, and restricting access to abortion would endanger women’s lives and health.
   - Providers emphasized that abortion is a complex, personal decision that should remain between patients and their doctors, not dictated by the government. Criminal penalties for doctors could deter healthcare providers from practicing in New Hampshire, exacerbating the state’s healthcare shortage.

2. **Impact on Vulnerable Populations:**
   - Survivors of domestic violence, rape, and incest testified that restrictive abortion laws would trap them in dangerous situations and delay access to care. The bill’s lack of exceptions for these cases was criticized as inhumane.
   - Rural residents, who already face longer travel times to access care, would be disproportionately affected by the ban.

3. **Bodily Autonomy and State Values:**
   - Opponents argued that the bill infringes on personal autonomy and New Hampshire’s "Live Free or Die" ethos by imposing government control over private medical decisions.
   - Many invoked the state’s history of valuing individual freedom, warning that the bill would reverse bipartisan progress on maternal and infant health.

4. **Economic and Social Consequences:**
   - Restrictive abortion laws could harm New Hampshire’s economy and healthcare system, driving away medical professionals and deterring young families from settling in the state.

5. **Real-Life Stories:**
   - Individuals shared emotional personal experiences, including cases of unsafe abortions, delayed care, and traumatic outcomes due to restrictive laws in other states.

#### **Support for the Bill:**
1. **Fetal Personhood and Moral Arguments:**
   - Supporters framed the issue as a moral imperative to protect life from conception, citing religious beliefs and historical parallels to slavery and the Holocaust. Some argued that 15 weeks provides sufficient time for women to make informed decisions about pregnancy.
   - Personal stories of miscarriage and holding a fetus were shared to emphasize the humanity of the unborn.

2. **Adoption as an Alternative:**
   - Proponents suggested that adoption is a viable alternative to abortion, citing the high demand for adoptive parents.

3. **Public Opinion and Moderation:**
   - Supporters claimed that polling shows most Granite Staters support a 15-week limit, viewing it as a moderate compromise that balances choice and protection of life.

### **Amendment 2531: Abortion Data Reporting**
The amendment would require the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to collect and report non-identifying data on abortions annually, starting November 1, 2026. Key points from the discussion included:

1. **Support for Reporting Requirements:**
   - Representative Bob Lynn, the amendment’s sponsor, argued that collecting abortion data is essential for public health insights, noting that 46 other states have similar systems.

2. **Privacy and HIPAA Concerns:**
   - Stakeholders, including Planned Parenthood and the DHHS, expressed concerns about patient and provider privacy, particularly in a small state like New Hampshire where low abortion volumes could make individuals identifiable.
   - They suggested improvements, such as aggregating data and creating a secure online portal for data submission, similar to systems in Maine and Vermont.

3. **Technical and Financial Challenges:**
   - The DHHS highlighted the lack of funding and resources to implement the amendment, estimating significant costs for data collection, validation, and reporting.

4. **Alternative Bill:**
   - Witnesses pointed to **Senate Bill 36** as a more viable and secure alternative for abortion data collection, urging the committee to focus on improving that bill rather than advancing the current amendment.

### **Procedural Developments**
- **Withdrawal Request:** The prime sponsor of HB 476, Representative Katie Pillo, submitted a request to withdraw the bill. However, the committee clarified that the bill remains under consideration until the House votes on the withdrawal request, which cannot occur before February 6th.
- **Chair’s Decision:** The chair decided to recess the executive session until February 19th, anticipating that the bill would be withdrawn by then. This decision was met with some disagreement, as members felt the committee should fulfill its responsibilities regardless of the withdrawal request.

### **Key Themes**
- **Healthcare Access:** Opponents stressed that HB 476 would limit access to safe, legal abortion care, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and worsening healthcare shortages.
- **State Identity:** Many invoked New Hampshire’s "Live Free or Die" motto, arguing that the bill contradicts the state’s commitment to personal freedom.
- **Legislative Overreach:** Critics argued that the bill represents unnecessary government interference in healthcare decisions that should be left to patients and providers.
- **Scientific and Medical Evidence:** Medical professionals repeatedly emphasized that the bill is not based on scientific or medical evidence and would harm patient outcomes.
- **Privacy and Data Security:** Amendment 2531 sparked debates about balancing public health insights with the need to protect patient and provider privacy.

### **Conclusion**
The hearing underscored the deeply polarized nature of the abortion debate in New Hampshire. Opponents of HB 476 warned of dire consequences for maternal health, reproductive rights, and the state’s healthcare system, while supporters framed the issue as a moral obligation to protect unborn life. The discussion on Amendment 2531 revealed broad support for abortion data reporting but significant concerns about privacy safeguards, technical feasibility, and financial implications. The fate of both the bill and the amendment will depend on further legislative action and public debate.
