**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Meeting (January 15, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 15, 2025, to address a wide range of issues related to the state’s criminal justice and public safety systems. The meeting emphasized collaboration, resource allocation, and the need for systemic improvements while maintaining professionalism and sensitivity to victims' needs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and topics covered across the three segments:

---

### **Crime Prevention, Training, and Victim Support**
1. **Crime Prevention and Training**: The committee stressed the importance of hiring qualified personnel, providing ongoing training, and maintaining high standards to prevent crime in New Hampshire.  
2. **Body Cameras**: The adoption of body cameras by police departments was discussed, with concerns about the costs of storage and redaction. Smaller departments face financial challenges, but decreasing costs due to competition and potential grant opportunities offer hope.  
3. **Domestic and Sexual Violence**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic and Sexual Violence highlighted their work in supporting victims, providing emergency shelters, and advocating for stronger laws. They emphasized the economic impact of trauma on victims and the need for effective responses to sexual assault cases, including proper evidence collection and victim support.  
4. **Human Trafficking and SANE Program**: Efforts to address human trafficking and the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program were discussed, with a focus on resource allocation and effective responses.  
5. **Victim Sensitivity**: The committee emphasized treating crime victims with sensitivity during testimonies, allowing them to share their experiences without unnecessary questioning.

### **Department of Corrections (DOC) and Rehabilitation Efforts**
1. **Incarceration and Reentry**: The DOC highlighted its role in preparing incarcerated individuals for release through case management, Medicaid application assistance, and risk assessments. Programs aimed at reducing recidivism, such as education, vocational training (including cosmetology and barbering), and therapeutic services, were emphasized.  
2. **Educational Opportunities**: The DOC collaborates with community colleges and universities to provide higher education opportunities for inmates and boasts a certified high school within the correctional system.  
3. **Recidivism Reduction**: The DOC has reduced the reincarceration rate from 48% to 40% and continues to analyze factors contributing to recidivism.  
4. **Probation and Parole**: The DOC has worked to reduce probation and parole officer caseloads to align with national averages. While the parole violation rate is low (around 1%), those who return to prison often do so due to substance use, non-compliance with treatment plans, or criminal behavior.

### **Public Defenders and Indigent Defense Crisis**
1. **Staffing and Caseloads**: The New Hampshire Public Defenders (NHPD) face a crisis due to high caseloads and staffing shortages, particularly in rural areas. With 140 attorneys handling over 21,000 cases annually, burnout and retention challenges are significant.  
2. **Mitigation Efforts**: Efforts to address the crisis include hiring lateral attorneys, collaborating with UNH Law School, and potentially revising state bar admission rules. However, the starting pay of $67,000 is not competitive given the demanding nature of the work.  
3. **Pro Bono Services**: The need for pro bono legal services for indigent defendants was discussed, with efforts to engage law firms and incentivize pro bono work through partnerships with UNH Law.

### **Judicial System Overview**
1. **Structure and Challenges**: Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court provided an overview of the state’s judicial branch, which includes the Circuit Court, Superior Court, and Supreme Court. Challenges include a significant caseload, particularly criminal cases, and safety and security concerns in courthouses.  
2. **Treatment Courts**: Opportunities for improvement include treatment courts (e.g., drug courts, mental health courts, veterans courts) and innovations in technology to reduce failure-to-appear rates.  
3. **Access to Justice**: The judiciary faces a crisis in the indigent defense system and an influx of cases related to the Youth Development Center (YDC) matter. Efforts to improve access to justice include partnerships and legislative engagement.

### **Law Enforcement and Collaboration**
1. **Recruitment and Training**: The New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police (NHACOP) focuses on maintaining high standards for law enforcement recruitment, training, and retention to ensure the state remains one of the safest in the country.  
2. **Legislative Impact**: The impact of legislation on public defender caseloads, such as mandatory arraignment and three-strike laws, was discussed.  

---

### **Committee Operations and Technology**
1. **Collegiality and Efficiency**: The committee chair emphasized maintaining collegiality among members, avoiding social media bashing, and ensuring timely communication. The committee plans to work efficiently, aiming to complete tasks early and avoid prolonged sessions.  
2. **Use of Technology**: While laptops are allowed for research during executive sessions, their use during testimonies was discouraged to maintain focus and professionalism.
