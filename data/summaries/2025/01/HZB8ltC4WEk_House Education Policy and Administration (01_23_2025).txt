**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Committee Meeting (01/23/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Committee convened on January 23, 2025, to discuss a range of critical education-related bills and policies. The meeting addressed pressing issues such as teacher shortages, the consolidation of School Administrative Units (SAUs), the impact of technology in schools, and the need for stricter regulations on cell phone use in classrooms. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Addressing Teacher Shortages and Educational Standards**
Several bills aimed at tackling teacher shortages and maintaining high educational standards were debated:

- **House Bill 90**: This bill proposes allowing adjunct faculty from universities and community colleges to teach part-time in K-12 schools, particularly in Advanced Placement (AP) and Career Technical Education (CTE) courses. While the bill is seen as a temporary solution to address shortages in STEM and CTE fields, concerns were raised about adjunct faculty’s pedagogical skills, certification requirements, and the potential displacement of full-time teachers. Organizations like the New Hampshire School Boards Association and the American Federation of Teachers opposed the bill, arguing that it fails to address the root causes of teacher shortages, such as low salaries and inadequate funding.

- **House Bill 362**: This bill grants the Department of Education rule-making authority to require passing scores on professional education assessments for teachers. The bill emphasizes maintaining rigorous standards, particularly in the face of declining requirements in other states. It also includes provisions for CTE instructors, ensuring they meet industry-recognized credentials while exempting them from certain academic testing requirements.

### **2. Consolidation of School Administrative Units (SAUs)**
The committee extensively debated the consolidation of SAUs to improve efficiency and reduce administrative costs:

- **HB 292** and **HB 765**: These bills propose studying and implementing SAU consolidation, respectively. Proponents argued that consolidation could streamline services like transportation, IT, and special education, while reducing the number of superintendents. However, others emphasized the importance of local control and community connection, noting that many districts prefer having their own superintendent despite higher costs.

- **Challenges and Incentives**: A recent law incentivizes SAU consolidation by offering additional funding per student, but few districts have pursued this option due to resistance from communities and the complexity of managing larger districts. Testimonies highlighted the tension between achieving cost efficiencies and maintaining local autonomy.

### **3. Technology and Cell Phone Use in Schools**
The impact of technology, particularly cell phones, on student learning and well-being was a major focus:

- **House Bill 131**: This bill would require school boards to develop policies restricting or prohibiting cell phone use during instructional time. Testimonies from educators, students, and administrators highlighted the negative effects of cell phones on concentration, academic performance, and mental health. Programs like Yonder pouches, which lock phones during the school day, were praised for reducing distractions and creating calmer learning environments.

- **Concerns and Exceptions**: While there was broad support for the bill, concerns were raised about enforcement, the burden on teachers, and the cost of implementing policies like Yonder pouches. Exceptions for students with medical needs, IEPs, or 504 plans were emphasized to ensure equitable access.

- **Broader Impact**: Data from other states showed that cell phone bans led to reduced bullying, improved attendance, and better academic outcomes. The bill is seen as a critical step in addressing social and behavioral issues in schools.

### **4. Parental Involvement and Local Control**
Several discussions highlighted the importance of parental involvement and local control in education:

- **House Bill 235**: This bill amends the educator code of ethics to explicitly include parents and guardians as part of the school community. The sponsor emphasized the importance of collaboration between teachers and parents in improving student outcomes.

- **Local Control in SAU Consolidation**: Many representatives stressed the value of local control, particularly in small districts, where parents and communities have a strong voice in shaping educational policies.

---

### **5. Funding and Efficiency**
The need for increased funding and greater efficiency in education was a recurring theme:

- **Rising Costs and Declining Enrollment**: Data showed a significant increase in per-pupil education costs (81.6%) despite a 23% decline in enrollment from 2000 to 2023. The committee discussed ways to streamline administrative costs and redirect resources to classroom instruction.

- **Federal Mandates and Salaries**: Some representatives suggested reducing reliance on federal funding and mandates to achieve cost savings and greater local control. Concerns were also raised about high administrative salaries, particularly for superintendents and assistant superintendents.

---

### **6. Professional Development and Curriculum Coordination**
The committee emphasized the importance of professional development and curriculum coordination to improve educational outcomes:

- **Math Learning Communities**: Efforts to improve curriculum coordination, particularly in mathematics, were discussed as a way to enhance teaching effectiveness and student learning.

- **Teacher Training**: The need for ongoing professional development to address diverse learning styles and meet educational standards was highlighted.

---

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
The meeting underscored several overarching themes:
1. **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Solutions**: While bills like HB 90 offer temporary fixes for teacher shortages, there was a consensus that long-term solutions, such as increased funding for competitive salaries, are needed.
2. **Efficiency vs. Local Control**: The debate over SAU consolidation highlighted the tension between achieving cost efficiencies and maintaining local autonomy.
3. **Technology’s Role in Education**: The committee recognized both the benefits and drawbacks of technology in schools, with a strong push to limit cell phone use to improve focus and academic performance.
4. **Parental Involvement and Collaboration**: The importance of recognizing parents as key stakeholders in education was emphasized, particularly in HB 235.
5. **Funding and Resource Allocation**: The need for greater efficiency and increased funding to address rising costs and declining enrollment was a recurring concern.

The committee concluded by scheduling executive sessions to further review and refine the discussed bills, with a focus on balancing immediate needs with sustainable, long-term solutions for New Hampshire’s education system.
