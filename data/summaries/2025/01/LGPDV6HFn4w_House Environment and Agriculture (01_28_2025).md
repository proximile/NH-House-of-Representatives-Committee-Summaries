**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (01/28/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 28, 2025, to discuss a range of bills and issues related to environmental protection, waste management, and agricultural policies. The meeting highlighted significant debates and decisions on topics such as landfill regulations, hazardous waste management, and animal welfare. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Solid Waste and Landfill Management**
Several bills focused on improving waste management practices and addressing environmental concerns related to landfills:

- **HB 355: Solid Waste Working Group Extension**  
  This bill proposes extending the Solid Waste Working Group’s term for five years and replacing the Northeast Recycling Council (NERC) with the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. The group has been instrumental in advancing legislation on food waste disposal bans, lithium-ion battery disposal bans, and solid waste management funding. The bill aims to enhance the group’s effectiveness by focusing on state-specific issues. The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill and recommended it for the consent calendar.

- **HB 566: Leachate Management in Landfills**  
  This bill requires new landfill permit applications to include detailed plans for leachate (toxic landfill liquid) management, including transportation and disposal. The bill was introduced in response to numerous violations at New Hampshire landfills, such as the Bethlehem facility. Supporters emphasized the environmental and public health risks posed by leachate, while opponents argued that existing DES regulations are sufficient. Proposed amendments aimed to clarify language and align the bill with current regulations.

- **HB 171: Landfill Moratorium**  
  This bill proposes a 5-year moratorium on new landfills to address concerns about out-of-state waste, PFAS contamination, and inadequate regulations. Supporters argued that the moratorium would provide time to develop better waste management practices and protect New Hampshire’s environment. Opponents, including the Business and Industry Association (BIA), raised concerns about potential capacity shortages and increased costs for businesses. The committee discussed the need for waste diversion, recycling, and alternative technologies like waste-to-energy plants.

- **HB 215: Landfill Permit Requirements**  
  This bill mandates that landfill permit applicants submit a report assessing the potential harms and benefits of the project. Discussions focused on clarifying the selection process for independent third-party analysts and whether the bill should apply to expansions of existing landfills. A two-stage screening process was proposed to evaluate the net benefit of projects before permitting.

#### **2. Hazardous Waste Management**
- **HB 179: Hazardous Waste Accident Fees**  
  This bill proposes increasing penalties for entities responsible for hazardous material incidents who fail to reimburse fire departments or HazMat teams for equipment damage. The current flat $1,000 fine would be replaced with a $1,000 daily penalty after 90 days, plus 20% interest. Supporters highlighted the financial strain on fire departments and HazMat teams due to unpaid bills, while concerns were raised about the proportionality of fines for smaller entities.

#### **3. Animal Welfare**
- **HB 153: Animal Cruelty Training**  
  This bill requires at least two law enforcement officers in each county to receive training on animal cruelty. Discussions focused on ensuring local law enforcement involvement and considering a task force approach to provide education and support.

- **HB 21: Cat Declawing Ban**  
  This bill proposes prohibiting the removal of cat claws (declawing). The debate centered on whether the practice is cruel and unnecessary, with some representatives emphasizing veterinary autonomy and the lack of data on its prevalence in New Hampshire.

#### **4. Other Key Discussions**
- **HR 13: Opposition to Landfill Near Forest Lake State Park**  
  Representative Jared Sullivan introduced a non-binding resolution opposing the construction of a landfill near Forest Lake State Park due to environmental risks, including potential water contamination from PFAS. Public testimony highlighted the health and environmental dangers of the proposed site.

- **Paint Recycling Bill**  
  The committee briefly discussed a paint recycling bill that had been vacated to the Commerce Committee, raising concerns about the timing of jurisdictional changes.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Environmental Protection and Waste Management**  
   The committee emphasized the need for robust waste management policies to address leachate contamination, out-of-state waste, and landfill expansions. Discussions highlighted the tension between environmental protection and regulatory burdens on businesses.

2. **Enforcement and Penalties**  
   Several bills focused on strengthening enforcement mechanisms and penalties for hazardous waste incidents and landfill violations. The committee explored ways to ensure timely reimbursement for fire departments and HazMat teams while balancing proportionality in fines.

3. **Public Health and Safety**  
   The discussions underscored the importance of protecting public health from environmental hazards, including PFAS contamination and improper waste management.

4. **Collaboration and Innovation**  
   The committee recognized the need for collaboration among stakeholders, including state agencies, advocacy groups, and industry representatives, to develop innovative solutions for waste reduction and environmental protection.

### **Next Steps**
The committee plans to continue hearings on additional bills and consider proposed amendments to refine legislation. Upcoming events include a breakfast meeting with young farmers to discuss agricultural issues. The discussions reflect a strong commitment to addressing environmental challenges while balancing economic and regulatory concerns.
