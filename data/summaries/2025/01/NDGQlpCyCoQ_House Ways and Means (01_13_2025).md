### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 13, 2025)

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on January 13, 2025, to discuss the state’s financial, economic, and demographic outlook. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including revenue collection, tax policies, economic development, housing, labor market trends, and demographic shifts. Key takeaways from the discussions are summarized below:

---

#### **State Financial and Economic Outlook**
1. **Revenue Collection and Budget Status**:
   - **Revenue Collection Delays**: There is a lag of up to 10 months in understanding quarterly revenue details, complicating timely financial planning.
   - **Revenue Trends**: The state collected $926.6 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2025, 88.8% below projections. However, over half of the year’s revenue is expected in the second half, driven by estimated payments and returns in March, April, and June.
   - **Business Taxes**: Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET) are significant revenue sources, with BPT growing notably in recent years. Recent legislative changes include a cap on credit carryovers and a reduction in the BPT rate from 7.6% to 7.5%.
   - **Rainy Day Fund and Reserves**: The state maintains a healthy cash reserve of $2.8 billion (FY 2024), bolstering its credit rating and fiscal stability. The rainy day fund is critical for managing revenue shortfalls.
   - **Debt Management**: New Hampshire has low debt levels and conservative bonding practices, with debt metrics below national medians.

2. **Tax Policies and Revenue Sources**:
   - **Commercial vs. Residential Property Valuations**: Residential property values have increased more than commercial values, partly due to higher vacancy rates in commercial spaces.
   - **Tobacco Tax**: Revenue has declined due to shifts from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes and bans on flavored tobacco in neighboring states.
   - **Utility Property Tax**: Revenue fluctuates with utility property valuations and energy prices, with recent increases due to new utility property coming online.
   - **Communication Services Tax**: Generates $30 million annually but is impacted by declining landline use and federal exemptions for internet access.
   - **Interest and Dividends Tax**: Repealed as of January 1, 2025, but revenue continues from filings for the 2023-2024 tax year.

3. **Credit Ratings and Economic Freedom**:
   - The state’s credit ratings have been upgraded, with S&P assigning an AA+ rating with a stable outlook, reflecting strong financial management, low debt, and robust reserves.
   - New Hampshire ranks first in economic freedom according to the Fraser Institute, highlighting its favorable economic policies.

#### **Economic Development and Challenges**
1. **Housing Crisis**:
   - Affordable housing remains the state’s most significant economic challenge. Programs like **Invest NH** and **Housing Champions** have allocated $60 million and $5 million, respectively, to accelerate housing development and support municipalities.
   - Regional housing needs assessments have been conducted to better understand and address the issue.

2. **Broadband Expansion**:
   - Significant progress has been made in expanding high-speed internet access, with a goal of achieving 100% coverage by 2027. This is critical for economic competitiveness, education, and daily living.

3. **Business Growth and International Trade**:
   - Over $1 billion in capital expenditures has been tracked since 2020, driven by businesses expanding or relocating to New Hampshire.
   - The state has set new export records annually since 2017, supported by efforts to help businesses access international markets.

4. **Tourism and Marketing**:
   - Tourism marketing has been highly effective, with a $17 return for every dollar spent. Visitor spending has significantly increased since 2020, contributing over $300 million in revenue from meals and rentals taxes.

#### **Labor Market and Demographic Trends**
1. **Labor Market Dynamics**:
   - **Job Growth**: Private sector jobs have grown by 5% since the pandemic peak, with significant gains in Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (24% increase). However, sectors like hospitals and retail have struggled to recover.
   - **Unemployment Claims**: Claims are below pre-pandemic levels, but the average duration of claims has increased, indicating a slowdown in hiring.
   - **Labor Force Participation**: The labor force is smaller than pre-pandemic levels, partly due to people working in New Hampshire but living elsewhere.

2. **Migration and Population Growth**:
   - **Domestic Migration**: New Hampshire has seen significant population growth, driven by migration, particularly from Massachusetts. However, housing constraints have limited growth compared to neighboring states like Maine.
   - **International Migration**: The state attracts highly skilled and educated workers, contributing to industries like manufacturing and professional services.
   - **Demographic Shifts**: The state is aging, with the baby boomer cohort moving into older age groups. Meanwhile, the younger population is shrinking, though the child population is becoming more diverse, especially in urban areas like Manchester and Nashua.

3. **Challenges**:
   - **Housing Shortages**: Tight housing markets with low vacancy rates hinder population and labor force growth.
   - **Childcare and Healthcare**: Shortages in childcare and healthcare, particularly nursing, pose significant challenges for economic growth and quality of life.
   - **Income Inequality**: Despite overall low poverty levels, disparities in income, education, and poverty persist across the state.

#### **Future Outlook and Recommendations**
1. **Economic Forecast**:
   - The state’s economic outlook is positive, with modest job growth expected compared to the national average. Strong consumer spending, wage growth outpacing inflation, and moderating inflation support this optimism.
   - Potential threats include higher tariffs, reduced immigration, and reinflation.

2. **Policy Priorities**:
   - Addressing housing affordability and availability is critical for sustaining economic and population growth.
   - Expanding childcare and healthcare access, particularly nursing, is essential for supporting the workforce.
   - Policies focused on education, quality of life, and employment opportunities are key to retaining young people and attracting new residents.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted New Hampshire’s strong financial position, economic strengths, and ongoing challenges. While the state benefits from robust reserves, low debt, and favorable economic policies, issues like housing shortages, childcare access, and an aging population require immediate attention. Strategic investments in housing, infrastructure, and workforce development will be critical for ensuring sustained economic growth and prosperity in the years ahead.
