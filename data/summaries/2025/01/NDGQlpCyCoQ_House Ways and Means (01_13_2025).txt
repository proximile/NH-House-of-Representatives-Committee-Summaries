### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 13, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee convened on January 13, 2025, to discuss a wide range of topics, including tax policy, economic development, demographic trends, state finances, and labor market dynamics. The meeting highlighted the state’s economic strengths, ongoing challenges, and strategies for future growth. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

---

### **Tax Policy and Revenue Trends**
1. **Property Taxes**:
   - Property taxes are set by municipalities and apply uniformly across all property types. Residential property values have risen faster than commercial properties, partly due to reduced demand for office space with the rise of remote work. Mobile homes and starter homes have seen increased value due to affordability issues.

2. **Tobacco Taxes**:
   - Tobacco tax revenue is shifting from traditional cigarettes to other tobacco products and e-cigarettes, influenced by changing consumption habits and cross-border purchases due to lower tax rates in New Hampshire compared to neighboring states.

3. **Business Taxes**:
   - The Business Enterprise Tax (BET) and Business Profits Tax (BPT) are significant revenue sources, with the latter showing notable growth. These taxes are volatile, influenced by economic conditions, legislative changes, and federal stimulus funds. The cap on credit carryovers was also discussed for its impact on state revenue and business operations.

4. **Revenue Performance**:
   - State revenue for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was $926.6 million, 88.8% below plan, with 60% of revenue expected in the second half of the year. The Interest and Dividends Tax was repealed as of January 1, 2025, but revenue from 2023-24 filings will still be collected.

### **Economic Development and Housing**
1. **Housing Crisis**:
   - Housing is the state’s most significant economic challenge, with tens of thousands of units needed to meet demand. The state has invested $60 million in multifamily housing projects with affordability components and introduced a $10,000 per unit grant program for municipalities. Programs like the Housing Opportunities Program and Housing Champions Program have been successful in addressing housing shortages.

2. **Business Expansion**:
   - Over $1 billion in capital expenditures has been tracked since 2020 from businesses moving to or expanding in New Hampshire. The New Hampshire Business Gateway, a $10 million digital platform for state services, is expected to launch soon.

3. **International Trade**:
   - New Hampshire has set record export volumes annually since 2017, with a focus on small and medium-sized businesses expanding into international markets.

### **Demographic Trends and Migration**
1. **Population Growth**:
   - New Hampshire’s population growth has slowed in recent decades but saw an uptick due to migration, particularly from Massachusetts. The state faces a natural decrease (more deaths than births), making migration critical for growth.

2. **Migration Patterns**:
   - Migrants to New Hampshire tend to have higher incomes and education levels, contributing to the state’s economy and skilled workforce. Recreational counties like Carroll County attract older adults and workers for infrastructure and services.

3. **Aging Population**:
   - The state is aging rapidly, with the baby boomer cohort creating a "silver tsunami." Younger populations are growing slowly, with children being the most diverse demographic, especially in urban areas like Manchester and Nashua.

### **Labor Market and Workforce Challenges**
1. **Sectoral Employment Trends**:
   - Construction and business services sectors have seen significant growth, while government, hospitals, and retail have struggled to regain pre-pandemic employment levels. Manufacturing employment has declined by 2%, with challenges in finding skilled workers and adapting to new technologies.

2. **Unemployment Trends**:
   - New Hampshire’s unemployment claims are below pre-pandemic levels, but the average duration of unemployment has increased slightly. The state’s labor force is smaller than pre-pandemic levels, with some growth attributed to attracting workers from other states.

3. **Healthcare and Nursing Shortages**:
   - The healthcare sector faces significant labor shortages, particularly for registered nurses. Temporary staffing agencies and traveling nurses are increasingly prevalent, with out-of-state agencies actively recruiting New Hampshire nurses.

### **State Finances and Fiscal Management**
1. **Rainy Day Fund**:
   - The state has a healthy rainy day fund of $292.5 million, about 7% of the maximum allowed capacity, which is crucial for managing economic downturns.

2. **Bond Ratings and Debt**:
   - New Hampshire maintains strong bond ratings (AA+ from S&P, AA1 from Moody’s, and AA+ from Fitch), enabling low-cost borrowing. The state’s debt levels have decreased, and it maintains a conservative approach to bonding.

3. **Economic Freedom**:
   - New Hampshire ranks #1 in economic freedom according to the Fraser Institute, a position it has held for two consecutive years.

---

### **Tourism and Visitor Spending**
- Visitor spending has significantly increased since 2020, contributing over $300 million annually in meals and rentals tax revenue.

---

### **Key Challenges and Future Considerations**
1. **Housing and Child Care**:
   - Addressing housing affordability and child care shortages is critical to supporting the state’s workforce and economic development.

2. **Migration and Retention**:
   - Sustaining migration and retaining young adults are essential for population and labor force growth. Strategies include improving education, employment opportunities, and housing.

3. **Economic Risks**:
   - Potential federal tariffs, reduced immigration, and reinflation pose risks to New Hampshire’s economy, particularly given its reliance on cross-border trade with Canada.

---

### **Budget and Revenue Outlook**
1. **Revenue Estimation**:
   - Revenue estimates remain fluid, with delays in finalizing the fiscal year 2024 financial report. The general fund has seen increased revenue, while the education trust fund has experienced a significant decline due to underperforming business taxes.

2. **Budget Challenges**:
   - Unbudgeted appropriations and legislative specials could impact the fiscal year 2025 budget. Interest revenue from ARPA funds has been significant but will decline as these funds are spent down.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored New Hampshire’s economic strengths, including its high economic freedom, strong bond ratings, and robust business expansion. However, challenges such as housing shortages, an aging population, and labor force constraints require targeted policies to sustain growth. Migration remains a critical driver of population and economic growth, emphasizing the need for strategies to attract and retain residents. Policymakers must address these challenges while leveraging the state’s economic opportunities to ensure long-term stability and prosperity.
