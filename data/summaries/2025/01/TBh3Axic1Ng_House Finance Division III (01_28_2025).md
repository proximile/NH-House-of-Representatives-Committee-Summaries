**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (January 28, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on January 28, 2025, covered a wide range of topics, including funding for homeless youth services, technology systems within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), contract management, and Medicaid system upgrades. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **1. Funding for Waypoint’s Homeless Youth Services (House Bill 519)**
The meeting began with a focus on **House Bill 519**, which seeks funding for **Waypoint**, an organization providing shelter and services to homeless youth and young adults (ages 18-24). Key points included:
- **Bill Overview**: HB 519 requests $500,000 annually to support Waypoint’s 14-bed shelter, case management, drop-in centers, and housing assistance. The organization serves approximately 400 youth annually but often turns away 20+ individuals nightly due to capacity constraints.
- **Funding Challenges**: Waypoint’s shelter costs $600,000 annually, and while $1.1 million has been raised independently, state funding is critical to sustain operations. The committee noted that HB 519 might be folded into broader budget discussions rather than proceeding as a standalone bill.
- **Age Range Debate**: There was discussion about potentially lowering the upper age limit for shelter eligibility (currently 18-24), but Waypoint emphasized that the current range aligns with federal HUD priorities and developmental needs.
- **Operational Challenges**: Waypoint highlighted difficulties in finding permanent housing due to the tight housing market, which extends the time needed to support young adults.
- **Non-Discrimination**: Representatives inquired about Waypoint’s non-discrimination policies, and the organization confirmed they serve all individuals equally without quotas or preferences.

### **2. DHHS Technology Systems and Project Management**
The meeting shifted to a discussion of **DHHS’s technology systems and project management practices**, with a focus on improving service delivery and efficiency:
- **Technology Platforms**: DHHS uses platforms like Salesforce, New Heights (integrated eligibility system), Medicaid Enterprise System, and New Hampshire Care Connections to support service delivery, data management, and interagency collaboration.
- **Project Management Office (PMO)**: The PMO, embedded within the Information Services Group, uses tools like SmartSheet to manage projects, track progress, and ensure efficient resource allocation. Over 280 staff members have been trained in project management practices.
- **Cloud-Based Solutions**: Many systems, including Salesforce and New Hampshire Care Connections, are cloud-based, enhancing scalability and accessibility. DHHS is also exploring AI applications, though data privacy concerns remain.
- **Disaster Recovery and Data Security**: DHHS ensures data backup and disaster recovery for all IT systems, with cloud-based solutions providing redundancy and rapid failover capabilities.
- **Customer Service Improvements**: Initiatives like New Hampshire Easy and the Medicaid Enterprise System aim to simplify enrollment and eligibility processes for programs like SNAP, TANF, and Medicaid.
- **Future Directions**: DHHS is working on integrating AI to automate processes and decommissioning outdated systems to reallocate resources effectively.

### **3. Contract Management and Performance Metrics**
The discussion then turned to **contract management, risk analysis, and performance metrics**:
- **Contract Management**: DHHS handles over $2 billion in contracts annually, including managed care organization (MCO) contracts. Processes have been streamlined, such as using DocuSign to reduce contract execution time from weeks to minutes.
- **Risk Analysis and Oversight**: Contractors are required to complete financial risk analyses and management questionnaires to evaluate their capacity and potential risks. Oversight mechanisms, including audits and investigations, ensure compliance with contractual obligations.
- **Performance Metrics**: The department is working on aligning performance metrics with strategic goals to measure the success of initiatives like the strategic roadmap, which aims to improve customer service and outcomes for residents.
- **Future IT Systems**: A new state-level system, Cloud Suite, is expected to provide better enterprise management and improved contract oversight, with implementation targeted for fall 2025.

### **4. Medicaid System Stability and Upgrades**
The final segment focused on **Medicaid system stability, upgrades, and financial integrity**:
- **Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)**: The MMIS is stable but outdated, with pain points in provider management and enrollment delays. The state is halfway through a 10-year replacement plan, leveraging federal funding to implement modular solutions.
- **Budget Impact**: The Medicaid program faces increased operational costs due to new systems, but the state is leveraging a 90% federal match to reduce the financial impact. A $33.75 million capital project has been submitted to support third-party liability, call center, and member management components.
- **Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Monitoring**: The state actively monitors Medicaid for fraud, waste, and abuse, with 25 cases referred to the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit last year. Overpayment recoveries also amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.
- **Provider Financial Stability**: The state monitors the financial health of key providers, requiring monthly financial statements and analyzing ratios to ensure stability.
- **Invoicing and Payment Processes**: Efforts are underway to simplify invoicing processes for providers, moving away from cost reimbursement to fixed rates or deliverable-based payments.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of funding for critical services like Waypoint’s shelter program, the role of technology in improving DHHS operations, and the need for robust contract management and Medicaid system upgrades. The discussions highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance efficiency, ensure financial integrity, and improve outcomes for New Hampshire residents. The committee encouraged continued communication with stakeholders as budget and legislative processes progress.
