**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting: House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee (January 27, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 27, 2025, to discuss a range of bills and issues related to energy efficiency, renewable energy, telecommunications, and emerging technologies. The meeting included public hearings, stakeholder testimonies, and detailed committee discussions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes from the session:

---

### **Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy**
1. **House Bill 221**:  
   This bill proposes changes to the cost-benefit test (Granite State Test) used for energy efficiency programs. Stakeholders, including utilities (Eversource), contractors, and energy efficiency advocates, generally opposed the bill, arguing that the current framework provides stability and certainty for businesses and customers. Concerns were raised about the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) potentially altering the cost-benefit test without sufficient stakeholder input, which could destabilize the energy efficiency sector.

2. **House Bill 224**:  
   This bill aims to rebate funds from the renewable energy fund back to ratepayers to provide financial relief. While the Department of Energy expressed neutrality, questions were raised about the bill’s language and intent, particularly regarding administrative costs and incentive payments. The fund currently supports programs such as solar and wood pellet rebates, as well as grants for low-income solar projects. Testimony highlighted concerns that rebating funds could disrupt these programs and hinder the development of new initiatives, such as the municipal solar program.

3. **Renewable Energy Fund and Alternative Compliance Payments (ACPs)**:  
   The renewable energy fund, funded by ACPs, supports renewable energy projects and reduces compliance costs for utilities. Testimony emphasized the fund’s importance in promoting renewable energy development, leveraging private investment, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Critics noted the fund’s significant balance (over $20 million) and called for more effective deployment to meet its goals. Eliminating or reducing the fund could lead to higher compliance costs and hinder renewable energy progress.

4. **House Bill 460**:  
   This bill addresses distributed energy resources (DERs) and seeks to level the playing field between utility companies and competitive markets. Supporters, including the Community Power Coalition (CPC), argued that the bill would expand competitive energy choices and reduce wholesale power costs. Opponents, such as Eversource, raised concerns about potential increased costs for customers and redundancy with ongoing PUC proceedings (Docket 22660). The bill aims to standardize the valuation process for utility investments in DERs, ensuring fairness and competition in the energy market.

### **Nuclear Energy**
1. **House Bill 189**:  
   This bill seeks to include nuclear energy in the definition of clean energy in New Hampshire’s energy strategy. Prime sponsor Representative Doug Thomas emphasized nuclear energy’s lack of CO2 emissions and its potential to attract investment in advanced nuclear technology. An amendment clarified that nuclear and fuel diversity should not be conflated. Testimony from the PUC and nuclear startup Starcube supported the bill, highlighting the secure management of nuclear waste and its minimal volume compared to fossil fuel waste. Committee members raised questions about the definition of "small-scale nuclear" and the broader implications of defining clean energy.

### **Telecommunications and Lifeline Program**
1. **House Bill 627**:  
   This bill aims to shift the authority for designating eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) for the Lifeline program from the federal government to the state. The Lifeline program provides affordable telecommunications services to low-income individuals, including seniors and veterans. The bill would allow New Hampshire to designate ETCs, aligning it with 45 other states that already have this authority. While the bill is intended to expand access to affordable services, concerns were raised about the criteria for designating ETCs and whether the bill would guarantee more providers offering Lifeline discounts. The Department of Energy expressed neutrality, noting the efficiency of the current FCC process.

### **Emerging Technologies and Unexplained Phenomena**
1. **House Bill 436**:  
   This bill proposes establishing a commission to investigate unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), previously referred to as UFOs. The bill faced skepticism from some committee members, who questioned its relevance and practicality. The discussion included the broader context of UAP terminology and military involvement.

---

### **Procedural and Operational Discussions**
1. **Committee Workload**:  
   Committee Chair Representative Michael Bose provided an update on the committee’s workload, noting that the number of bills assigned to the committee had doubled from 22 to 43. A tentative schedule was outlined to complete public hearings by March 3, 2025, with executive sessions to be held along the way.

2. **Field Trip Planning**:  
   The committee discussed potential field trips to facilities like ISO New England, Granite State Hydro Power, Schiller Station, and Eversource’s control room to gain a better understanding of energy infrastructure and operations.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Stability vs. Innovation**: Discussions highlighted the tension between maintaining stable energy efficiency programs (e.g., HB 221) and fostering innovation in renewable energy and DERs (e.g., HB 460).
- **Financial Relief vs. Program Continuity**: The debate around HB 224 underscored the challenge of balancing financial relief for ratepayers with the need to sustain renewable energy programs.
- **Nuclear Energy’s Role**: HB 189 sparked discussions about nuclear energy’s potential as a clean energy source and its alignment with New Hampshire’s energy strategy.
- **Telecommunications Access**: HB 627 aimed to expand access to affordable telecommunications services for low-income residents, though questions remained about its implementation and impact.
- **Emerging Technologies**: The committee’s discussion of UAPs (HB 436) reflected a broader interest in exploring new frontiers in science and technology.

Overall, the meeting emphasized the importance of stakeholder input, careful policy design, and balancing competing priorities in shaping New Hampshire’s energy and technology future.
