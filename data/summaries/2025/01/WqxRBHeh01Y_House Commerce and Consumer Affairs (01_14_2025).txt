---

### **1. Scanning of Driver’s Licenses for Age Verification (House Bill 77)**
The committee debated a bill aimed at prohibiting businesses from scanning driver’s licenses for age verification when selling alcohol or tobacco. Key points included:
- **Privacy Concerns**: Representatives raised issues about the potential misuse of personal data collected through scanning, with some questioning whether standard New Hampshire licenses should suffice for age verification.
- **Industry Perspectives**: Retail, grocery, and convenience store representatives testified in opposition, arguing that scanning technology is essential for preventing underage sales and ensuring compliance with age restrictions. They emphasized that their systems do not store personal information.
- **Public Safety**: Law enforcement officials underscored the importance of scanning technology in preventing the use of fake IDs and ensuring public safety.
- **Subcommittee Review**: The bill was sent to a subcommittee for further refinement, with a focus on balancing privacy concerns with the need for effective age verification tools.

### **2. Alcohol and Tobacco Regulations**
Several bills related to alcohol and tobacco regulations were discussed:
- **House Bill 242 (Brew Pub Licenses)**: This bill corrected a clerical error from the previous session, allowing brew pubs to self-distribute their products to their own licensed establishments, capped at 2,500 barrels. The bill received support from industry representatives and the Liquor Commission.
- **House Bill 81 (Alcohol in Restaurants)**: The bill proposed allowing patrons to take alcoholic beverages into restrooms, with the sponsor arguing it would enhance safety by reducing the risk of drink spiking. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, raised concerns about underage drinking and liability.
- **Federal Compliance**: The Liquor Commission emphasized the importance of maintaining compliance with federal tobacco regulations to avoid losing federal funding.

### **3. Privatization of the Liquor Commission (House Bill 79)**
Representative Peter Leishman introduced a bill to evaluate the potential privatization of the New Hampshire Liquor Commission. Key discussions included:
- **Revenue and Expenses**: The Liquor Commission has seen declining revenues (down 18.7%) and rising expenses, partly due to increased cannabis consumption and changing consumer behaviors.
- **Privatization Concerns**: Opponents argued that privatization could lead to job losses, higher prices, and reduced state revenue, citing Washington State’s negative experience. The Liquor Commission’s control state model was praised for its efficiency, public health benefits, and ability to generate significant revenue (29% gross profit margin, 20% net profit).
- **Social Implications**: Representatives raised concerns about the potential social impacts of increased alcohol availability and the loss of control over alcohol density and underage sales.

### **4. Food Requirements for Alcohol Sales**
The committee debated the necessity of requiring establishments to serve food to sell alcohol. Key points included:
- **Public Safety**: Opponents argued that food requirements slow alcohol absorption, reducing risks like DUIs and public safety incidents.
- **Financial Impact**: The New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association highlighted the significant investments businesses have made to comply with food requirements, warning that removing them would disadvantage existing establishments.
- **Tourism and Image**: Some representatives expressed concerns about how eliminating food requirements might harm New Hampshire’s family-friendly tourism reputation.

### **5. Broader Industry Challenges**
The meeting also addressed broader challenges facing the alcohol industry:
- **Declining Sales**: Nationwide and global alcohol sales have declined due to factors like cannabis legalization, health concerns, and changing consumer preferences, particularly among younger generations.
- **Alternative Models**: Some representatives suggested exploring alternative models, such as allowing customers to bring their own food to establishments, to address public safety concerns while providing flexibility for businesses.

Subcommittees were formed to further review and refine key bills, including those related to age verification, food requirements, and the potential privatization of the Liquor Commission.
