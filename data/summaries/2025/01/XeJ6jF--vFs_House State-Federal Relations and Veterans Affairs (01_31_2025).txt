**Summary of the NH House of Representatives State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee Meeting (January 31, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee convened on January 31, 2025, to address a range of legislative measures, focusing on state-federal relations, veterans' affairs, and constitutional reform. The meeting included discussions on multiple bills, resolutions, and updates on veterans' initiatives, reflecting the committee’s commitment to addressing federal overreach, fiscal responsibility, and support for military personnel and their families.

### **Key Legislative Discussions**

1. **Article 5 Convention and Constitutional Reform**
   - **HB 264 FN**: This bill proposes making it a **Class B felony** for delegates to an Article 5 convention to support or propose amendments not authorized by the legislature. Representative Jordan Yul, the prime sponsor, emphasized the need for state control over delegates to prevent federal overreach. The discussion highlighted the historical context of Article 5, which allows states to propose constitutional amendments as a check on federal power. The bill’s penalties (1 to 7 years in prison) aim to ensure delegates adhere to legislative mandates.
   - **HCR 3**: This concurrent resolution calls for an Article 5 Convention of States to address federal overreach, fiscal responsibility, and term limits. Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum and Representative Bernardi stressed the urgency of addressing the $37 trillion national debt and restoring state authority. Concerns about a "runaway convention" were addressed, with proponents noting the high threshold for ratification (38 states) as a safeguard.
   - **HCR 5**: This resolution seeks to rescind a 2012 call for an Article 5 convention to propose a balanced budget amendment. Supporters argued the 2012 resolution is unnecessary, while opponents defended it as a critical tool for fiscal responsibility. The discussion highlighted the importance of faithful delegate laws to ensure delegates adhere to state directives.

2. **Veterans’ Affairs and Military Support**
   - **Easter Seals Veterans Campus in Franklin**: Alan Aldenberg and Nick Grant provided updates on the $23 million project, which includes permanent affordable housing, workforce development, and recreational facilities for veterans. Phase one is set for completion in June 2025, with phase two requiring additional funding for an indoor aquatics and fitness center.
   - **HB 104 (Defend the Guard)**: This bill aims to restrict National Guard deployments to combat zones without a formal declaration of war. Representative Manion argued that prolonged conflicts like Afghanistan and Iraq have put guardsmen at unnecessary risk. Concerns about potential loss of federal funding and readiness led the committee to vote to retain the bill for further study.
   - **HB 122**: This bill addresses claims against the New Hampshire Army National Guard for training damage and was passed unanimously.
   - **HB 64**: This bill proposes hiring preferences for military spouses and passed unanimously but was not placed on the consent calendar due to potential floor amendments.

3. **State-Federal Relations and International Policy**
   - **HCR 9**: This resolution rejects compliance with the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). Representative Bernardi criticized the directive as “fascistic” and harmful to economic freedom, while Representative Foss argued it aims to prevent human rights abuses. The resolution passed with a 12-6 vote.
   - **HCR 8**: This resolution urges Congress to review the state boundary in the Piscataqua River between Maine and New Hampshire and passed with a 14-4 vote.

4. **Natural Rights and Constitutional Principles**
   - **HJR 1**: Representative Belzer introduced this resolution affirming natural rights as inherent and protected by state and federal governments. The resolution addresses modern challenges to free speech, the right to bear arms, and protection from unlawful search and seizure, emphasizing the importance of the consent of the governed.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Federal Overreach and State Authority**: The discussions emphasized the growing power of the federal government and the need for states to assert their constitutional rights, particularly through the Article 5 convention process.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Multiple resolutions and bills addressed the urgent need to address the national debt and impose fiscal restraints on the federal government.
- **Support for Veterans and Military Families**: The committee demonstrated strong support for initiatives benefiting veterans, including the Easter Seals Veterans Campus and legislative measures addressing military service and family support.
- **Constitutional Safeguards**: The meeting highlighted the importance of ensuring delegates to an Article 5 convention remain faithful to their mandates, with discussions on penalties and selection processes.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on addressing federal overreach, supporting veterans, and promoting fiscal responsibility. The discussions reflected a commitment to constitutional principles, state authority, and the well-being of military personnel and their families. The committee will continue to review and refine these measures in upcoming sessions, ensuring thorough consideration of their potential impacts.
