**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (01/24/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on January 24, 2025, to address a wide range of topics related to public health, healthcare delivery, constituent services, and departmental initiatives. The meeting was organized into three key segments, each focusing on distinct but interconnected areas of concern and progress.

### **Constituent Services and Process Improvements (Segment 1)**
The committee opened with a discussion on constituent services, emphasizing the critical role of the Ombudsman in addressing complex cases, particularly those involving long-term care and denied services or benefits. The Administrative Appeals Unit was highlighted as a key resource for handling appeals. To enhance efficiency, the committee explored the idea of periodic reports summarizing constituent inquiries and creating a flowchart to guide constituents and legislators through the process of addressing concerns. However, some members cautioned against adding unnecessary bureaucracy, stressing the importance of maintaining a responsive system. The committee also acknowledged the need to support new legislators in effectively managing constituent issues. Tentative agenda items for the next meeting included updates from the Commissioner, discussions on the Rare Disease Advisory Council, Alzheimer's disease, therapeutic cannabis, maternal mortality, and child fatality reviews.

### **Public Health, Healthcare Delivery, and Support for Vulnerable Populations (Segment 2)**
The second segment focused on public health and healthcare delivery. Discussions included the transition of total hip replacements to outpatient settings and the challenges of tracking influenza outbreaks in long-term care facilities, as influenza is not a reportable condition under current law. Whitney Hammond, interim deputy director for the Division of Public Health Services, provided an update on the State Health Assessment and Improvement Plan (SHA/SHIP), which identified priority areas such as heart disease, maternal and child health, child mental health, sexually transmitted infections, and environmental health. The committee also heard from Elizabeth Neff and Fred Coello about the tuition waiver program for foster youth, which has seen significant improvements, including an increase in waivers and the age limit for application. Wayne Whitford and Sophia Johnson from the NH Health Officers Association presented their annual report, highlighting the challenges faced by local health officers, who are often volunteers serving multiple municipal roles. The department is working to provide comprehensive training and support to these officers. Finally, Representative Edwards raised concerns about managing constituent cases with DHHS, prompting Associate Commissioner Patricia Tilly to explain existing processes and ongoing efforts to develop a more systemic approach.

### **DHHS Updates and Healthcare-Associated Infections (Segment 3)**
The final segment began with committee organization, including the nomination of Representative Mark Pearson as chair and Representative Lucy Weber as clerk. Associate Commissioners Patricia Tilly and Chris Santinello provided an update on DHHS initiatives, focusing on the transition of youth from the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCF) to adult services. They highlighted the use of Kaizen events to streamline processes and improve collaboration across departments. Christine Hansen, administrator of the Division of Public Health Services, presented an update on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), reporting that New Hampshire hospitals had significantly fewer infections in 2023 compared to national averages. Key statistics included 135 HAIs in hospitals, six surgical site infections in Ambulatory Surgery Centers, and 299 vascular access site infections in dialysis centers. Healthcare personnel influenza vaccination rates were also discussed, with hospitals reporting the highest rates at 89.9%. The HAI program conducted over 100 investigations in 2023 and aims to make HAI data more accessible to the public, prioritize outbreak response, and expand infection prevention training. Committee members raised questions about the role of IT systems, disparities in influenza vaccination rates, and the categorization of infections. Senator Gray emphasized the importance of statistical analysis to assess improvements in HAI rates.
