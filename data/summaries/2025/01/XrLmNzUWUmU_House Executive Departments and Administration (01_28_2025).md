**Summary of the New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee Meeting (January 28, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on January 28, 2025, to discuss several key bills related to building codes, fire codes, and energy conservation. The meeting, led by Representative Davis, focused on balancing the need for updated codes with concerns about costs, housing affordability, and the timing of legislative action. The committee emphasized thorough review and stakeholder input before making final decisions.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

#### **Fire Code Amendments**
The committee explored the process for amending the state fire code, highlighting the importance of public hearings and local-level decision-making for certain administrative changes. For example, discussions included standardizing keys for fire alarm panels to ensure uniformity and efficiency in emergency responses.

#### **Building Code Reorganization (HB 428)**
Philip Sherman, Chair of the Building Code Review Board (BCRB), presented a proposed amendment to HB 428, which aims to streamline the state building code by reorganizing and consolidating various sections, such as RSA 4722 and RSA 67451, into RSA 155A for clarity and consistency. The amendment also clarified the roles of local enforcement agencies and the process for municipalities to adopt and enforce building codes.

Key points of the amendment included:
- **Prohibition of Technical Amendments**: Municipalities would be prevented from making technical changes to the state building code, ensuring uniformity across the state. Administrative amendments, such as those related to permit issuance, fee collection, and plan reviews, would still be permitted but would need confirmation by the BRCB to ensure they meet or exceed state standards.
- **Local Enforcement**: Municipalities could choose whether to enforce the state building code, with about 141 currently doing so.
- **Transition Period**: A 12-month window was proposed to allow municipalities to update their ordinances to comply with the new requirements.

#### **Energy Conservation Code (HB 96)**
The committee reviewed HB 96, which proposed the adoption of the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code. Paul Beus of ASHRAE testified in favor of the bill, highlighting its benefits, including a 15% improvement in energy efficiency and better indoor air quality. However, concerns were raised about the cost of implementation and its potential impact on New Hampshire's housing crisis. Sherman noted that the BRCB is currently reviewing the 2024 codes, making the bill potentially premature. After deliberation, the committee voted against recommending HB 96, citing the ongoing review of the 2024 codes and the need for more information.

#### **Fire Code Integration**
Sean Tumi, the State Fire Marshal, emphasized the importance of clearly distinguishing building code-related items within RSA 155 (building code statute) and fire code-related items within RSA 153 (fire code statute). He stressed the need for clear language to prevent conflicts between local and state codes and ensure cohesive enforcement.

### Overall Focus and Outcomes:
The meeting underscored the committee's commitment to refining the state building and fire codes to ensure consistency, clarity, and safety while addressing concerns from municipalities and stakeholders. The committee decided to retain HB 428 for further review and discussion, reflecting the need for careful consideration of the balance between local autonomy and state uniformity. The decision to hold off on HB 96 highlighted the importance of aligning legislative action with ongoing reviews and stakeholder input to avoid premature implementation of new standards.
