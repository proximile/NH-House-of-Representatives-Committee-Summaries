**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 28, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on January 28, 2025, to discuss several key bills addressing tax policy, economic growth, and corporate accountability. The meeting featured robust debates on the fiscal, administrative, and policy implications of the proposed legislation. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Tax Policy and Economic Growth**
1. **House Bill 155: Reduction of the Business Enterprise Tax (BET)**  
   - The bill proposes a modest reduction in the BET rate from 0.55% to 0.50%, effective July 1, 2025, to stimulate economic growth, attract businesses, and create jobs.  
   - **Supporters** argued that tax cuts historically boost economic activity and revenue, benefiting businesses of all sizes and aiding post-pandemic recovery.  
   - **Opponents** raised concerns about a potential $22 million annual revenue loss and whether the benefits disproportionately favor large corporations over small businesses.  
   - Small business representatives testified that tax burdens remain a significant challenge, and they support the reduction to reinvest and grow.  

2. **House Bill 502: Worldwide Combined Reporting**  
   - The bill aims to require multinational corporations to report global profits to ensure they pay their fair share of taxes in New Hampshire, addressing **profit-shifting** practices.  
   - **Proponents** argued this levels the playing field for local businesses, citing an estimated $177 million annual loss due to profit-shifting.  
   - **Opponents** highlighted the administrative burden and potential negative impact on New Hampshire’s attractiveness to large corporations.  
   - The bill’s sponsors plan to amend it to remove provisions related to the **Statewide Property Tax**, which they believe should be addressed separately.

### **Tourism and Revenue Transparency**
3. **House Bill 596: Meals and Rooms Tax Reporting**  
   - The bill seeks to improve transparency by requiring operators to report meals and rooms tax revenues at the municipal level, providing granular data for economic development and infrastructure planning.  
   - **Supporters** emphasized the importance of accurate data for tourism-heavy towns like Conway and Lebanon, which face higher infrastructure costs due to visitor populations.  
   - **Concerns** were raised about potential competition between towns over revenue distribution and the burden on businesses.  
   - The bill includes privacy protections, with data only disclosed for communities with 10 or more operators.

### **Regulation and Licensing**
4. **House Bill 540: Licensing Fees for Historic Horse Racing (HHR) Machines**  
   - The bill proposes a significant increase in licensing fees for facilities with over 1,000 HHR machines, from $250 to $10 million annually.  
   - **Proponents** argued that large casinos in neighboring states pay much higher fees, and New Hampshire’s low fees are disproportionate to the profitability of these operations.  
   - **Opponents**, including the New Hampshire Charitable Gaming Operators Association, warned that such fees could stifle industry growth and reduce revenue for the state and charities.  
   - A **sliding scale** for fees based on the number of machines was suggested as a potential amendment.

### **Interstate Taxation and State Sovereignty**
5. **House Bill 135: Codifying the Wayfair Decision Response**  
   - The bill seeks to codify a portion of the New Hampshire Constitution to prevent businesses from being required to collect sales or use taxes for other states unless mandated by Congress.  
   - **Supporters** argued that the **Wayfair decision** creates compliance burdens for New Hampshire businesses due to the complexity of over 13,000 different sales tax rates across the U.S.  
   - **Concerns** were raised about the bill’s constitutionality and potential legal challenges, with the Department of Justice highlighting the complexity of interstate tax compliance.

### **Key Themes and Broader Implications**
1. **Balancing Tax Cuts and Revenue**: The debate over HB 155 and HB 502 reflects a broader discussion on balancing tax reductions with fiscal responsibility, with differing views on whether tax cuts drive economic growth or reduce state revenues.  
2. **Fairness and Competitiveness**: The discussions highlighted the differing impacts of tax policies on small businesses and multinational corporations, with a focus on fairness and competitiveness.  
3. **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: HB 596 underscores the importance of accurate data for economic development, infrastructure planning, and addressing inequities in tourism revenue distribution.  
4. **Regulatory Challenges**: HB 540 and HB 502 illustrate the complexities of regulating industries like gaming and corporate taxation, balancing revenue generation with industry sustainability.  
5. **State Sovereignty**: HB 135 emphasizes New Hampshire’s efforts to protect its businesses from interstate taxation challenges while navigating federal and constitutional complexities.
