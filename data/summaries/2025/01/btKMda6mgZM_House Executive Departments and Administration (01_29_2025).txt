### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting:  
**House Executive Departments and Administration (January 29, 2025)**  

The meeting focused on several key legislative initiatives, including transparency in government operations, local food procurement, carbon pricing in state purchasing, governance of the Public Deposit Investment Pool (PIP), and transparency in the New Hampshire Vaccine Association (NHVA). Here’s a detailed overview of the discussions:  

---

#### **1. Transparency in Government Meetings**  
- **Representative Jonah Wheeler** advocated for audio and video recording of all state-chartered board meetings to enhance public access and transparency, particularly when public funds are involved. This proposal aims to ensure accountability and foster public trust in government operations.

#### **2. Local Food Procurement (House Bill 233)**  
- **Representative Peter Bixby** introduced a bill to increase New Hampshire’s ability to source food from local farms and fisheries. The bill proposes establishing a study committee to explore ways to create stable markets for local producers, reduce dependence on distant food sources, and enhance food security and resilience. The initiative aligns with the New Hampshire Food and Agriculture Strategic Plan and has garnered broad support from the agricultural community.

#### **3. Carbon Pricing in State Purchasing (House Bill 278)**  
- **Representative Nick Geremia** presented a bill to incorporate carbon pricing into state purchasing decisions, using a proxy carbon pricing model based on international standards. The goal is to evaluate the total cost of carbon-intensive products over their lifespan and prepare for global energy market changes driven by carbon pricing models adopted by major trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and the EU. While the bill does not mandate lower-carbon options, it encourages their consideration if they are cost-effective.  
- **Representative John Gage** supported the bill, emphasizing the global trend toward carbon pricing and the need for New Hampshire to adapt to international market shifts.

#### **4. Public Deposit Investment Pool (PIP) Governance (House Bill 469)**  
- The bill addresses a perceived conflict of interest in the PIP, which manages municipal funds and competes with banks for financial products. The New Hampshire Banks Association opposed the PIP due to this conflict.  
- The bill proposes replacing one of the two bankers on the PIP advisory board with a member from the Municipal Management Association to reduce conflicts and align with national standards.  
- **Representative Jim Maggiore** and **Todd Selig** (Town Administrator of Durham) supported the bill, arguing that municipal managers bring direct expertise in managing public funds and better represent municipal interests.  
- **Ryan Hail** from the New Hampshire Bankers Association opposed removing one of their seats, citing the need for banker oversight, especially given recent policy changes requiring funds to remain in New Hampshire banks.  
- The bill passed unanimously (13-0), reflecting broad support for governance reforms to improve efficiency and reduce conflicts of interest.

#### **5. Transparency in the New Hampshire Vaccine Association (House Bill 233)**  
- **Representative Barbara Comtois** sponsored a bill to increase transparency and public access to the NHVA, which handles vaccine purchases for commercially insured children. The bill proposes requiring in-person meetings, publishing a complete list of purchased vaccines, and making Zoom meetings publicly available for later viewing.  
- **Patrick Miller**, NHVA Executive Director, opposed the bill, arguing that the NHVA already provides adequate transparency through meeting notices, agendas, minutes, and public comment opportunities. He stated that the bill’s requirements would impose unnecessary administrative burdens and increase costs, which would ultimately be passed on to consumers.  
- The committee raised questions about the NHVA’s operations, including the number of vaccines purchased and the process for answering public questions. The NHVA clarified that it does not set vaccine policy, which is determined by the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

#### **Key Themes and Outcomes**  
- **Transparency**: Efforts to enhance transparency in government meetings, state purchasing, and vaccine funding were central to the discussions. While there was broad support for greater transparency, concerns were raised about the practicality and costs of implementing new requirements.  
- **Local and Global Preparedness**: The meeting highlighted initiatives to strengthen local food systems and prepare for global trends like carbon pricing, reflecting a focus on resilience and long-term planning.  
- **Governance Reforms**: The unanimous passage of House Bill 469 demonstrated a commitment to reducing conflicts of interest and improving the governance of state-managed investment pools.
