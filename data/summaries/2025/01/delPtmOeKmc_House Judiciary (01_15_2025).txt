### **Key Discussions and Highlights**

#### **1. Opening and Committee Procedures**
- **Chairman Bob Lynn** opened the meeting, welcoming members to the new session. Members introduced themselves, highlighting their legislative priorities, which included election law, education, end-of-life options, criminal justice, domestic violence, and the right-to-know law.
- The committee typically meets on Wednesdays, with optional Monday sessions as needed. Hearings do not require a quorum, but executive sessions do. Members were encouraged to attend executive sessions or arrange substitutes if absent.
- A debate over the optimal meeting start time (9:00 AM vs. 10:00 AM) ended with a tentative compromise of 9:30 AM.

#### **2. Judicial Branch Overview**
- **Chief Justice Gordon McDonald** provided an overview of the NH Judicial Branch, including its structure (Circuit Court, Superior Court, and Supreme Court) and challenges such as court security, access to justice, and indigent defense issues.
- Initiatives like treatment courts, veterans courts, and diversion programs were highlighted as efforts to reduce recidivism and address systemic issues. The judiciary is also leveraging technology, such as digital evidence presentation and text reminders, to improve efficiency.
- Chief Justice McDonald and General Counsel Aaron Krien expressed readiness to collaborate with the committee on legislative and judicial matters.

### **Legislative Discussions and Testimonies**

#### **3. Community Property Trusts (HB 88)**
- The bill proposes allowing married couples in NH to create community property trusts, enabling them to avoid federal capital gains taxes on inherited property. This addresses tax disadvantages faced by widows or widowers in non-community property states.
- Concerns were raised about potential fiscal impacts, real estate transfer taxes, and the need for amendments to address issues like mortgages on properties transferred into the trust. The bill’s optional nature and its potential to preserve estate value were debated.

#### **4. Professional Limited Liability Companies (PLLCs) (HB 98)**
- This bill addresses succession planning for solo practitioners in PLLCs, allowing non-professional assistant managers to manage the business temporarily if the sole member becomes unavailable (e.g., due to death or loss of licensure). The assistant manager cannot perform professional duties but can ensure the business continues for up to one year.
- The bill aims to prevent the dissolution of viable practices and ensure smoother transitions. It was reintroduced after failing in the previous session due to concerns from the bar association.

#### **5. Right to Know Ombudsman (HB 111)**
- The bill seeks to extend the Right-to-Know Ombudsman (RKO) position, set to expire on June 30, 2025, for another two years. The RKO provides a less formal and less costly alternative to Superior Court for resolving public records disputes.
- Testimonies highlighted the RKO’s efficiency, user-friendly processes, and quicker resolutions compared to court proceedings. However, challenges such as being a one-person operation, increasing legal involvement, and resource constraints were noted.
- Supporters recommended additional resources, a user-friendly guide for citizens, and potential legislative adjustments to enhance the RKO’s effectiveness. Metrics for evaluating the office’s success were also discussed.

### **Judicial System Challenges and Initiatives**

#### **6. Access to Justice and Paraprofessionals**
- The committee discussed improving access to justice, particularly for incarcerated and self-represented litigants. The role of paraprofessionals in supporting litigants, especially in high-need cases, was emphasized. The program, primarily associated with New Hampshire Legal Assistance, has potential for expansion.

#### **7. Judicial Security and Support Staff**
- The increased threat environment faced by the judiciary was addressed, with concerns about security personnel and digital case management. The need for additional support staff for judges to improve efficiency, particularly in the Circuit Court, was also discussed.

#### **8. Pilot Programs and Policy Changes**
- A pilot program aimed at reducing recidivism and failures to appear in court reported positive results. The committee also discussed the shift in felony cases from Circuit Court to Superior Court and the legislative decision to revert to the previous system.

- The meeting concluded with a focus on fostering collegiality, addressing significant legal and societal issues, and ensuring respectful and efficient legislative processes.
