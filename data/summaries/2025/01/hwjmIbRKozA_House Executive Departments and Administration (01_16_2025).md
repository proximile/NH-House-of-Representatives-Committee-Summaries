**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Executive Departments and Administration (01/16/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 16, 2025, focused on a range of licensing, administrative, and operational matters, with significant discussions on bills aimed at improving access to services, streamlining processes, and maintaining professional standards. The meeting was divided into three main segments, each addressing specific topics and bills.

### **Segment 1: Licensing and Administrative Matters**
1. **Licensed Social Work Associate (LSWA) Exam Requirement (House Bill 271)**:
   - The committee debated removing the exam requirement for the LSWA license. Supporters, including the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) and New Futures, argued that the exam is a financial and logistical barrier for case managers and family support specialists, who already provide services without a license. They emphasized that removing the exam would not compromise public safety, as LSWAs work under supervision and have other training requirements. Opponents, such as the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB), contended that the exam is essential for maintaining professional standards and public safety, particularly for vulnerable populations.

2. **Chiropractic for Animals (House Bill 267)**:
   - This bill proposed allowing licensed chiropractors and veterinarians who complete nationally recognized animal chiropractic programs to adjust animals without requiring a veterinary referral or direct supervision. Proponents highlighted the benefits of chiropractic care for animals and the challenges posed by veterinary shortages, which lead to delays and increased costs.

3. **Budget and Fees**:
   - The committee discussed fee-setting for associated professions, ensuring that fees align with the budget and cost structures. The budget will be part of the governor’s proposal, with fees set accordingly.

4. **Board Appointments and Vacancies**:
   - Concerns were raised about board members serving beyond their statutory limits. The committee emphasized the need for the new governor to address vacancies and ensure timely replacements.

5. **Public Hearings and Subcommittees**:
   - The committee scheduled public hearings on licensing bills and indicated that some bills, including HB 271, would go to subcommittees for further review.

### **Segment 2: Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) Operations**
1. **Introduction and Overview**:
   - Patrick Long introduced the committee, and Deana Jurus, the executive director of the OPLC, provided an overview of the office’s mission, structure, and responsibilities. The OPLC oversees 57 licensing boards, ensuring public health, safety, and compliance with statutory mandates.

2. **Office Structure**:
   - The OPLC is divided into several divisions, including enforcement, licensing and board administration, operations, and legal counsel, each with specific roles such as investigating complaints, issuing licenses, and providing legal support.

3. **Licensing Process**:
   - The OPLC has streamlined the licensing process with an online system, reducing processing times significantly, with 57% of applications processed within 14 days.

4. **Enforcement and Complaints**:
   - The enforcement division is auditing all pending complaints to ensure data accuracy and legal viability, aiming to expedite the review process and reduce the backlog of 2,771 unverified complaints.

5. **Rule Making**:
   - The OPLC is responsible for 25% of the state’s rule-making, updating rules in light of recent legislative changes and mandates related to military service members.

6. **Customer Service**:
   - The OPLC’s customer service team handles a high volume of calls and emails, answering 95-99% of calls and 100% of daily emails.

7. **Collaboration with Boards**:
   - The OPLC is improving collaboration with licensing boards through monthly calls with board chairs.

8. **Future Plans**:
   - For 2025, the OPLC plans to focus on improving enforcement processes, ensuring timely investigations, and continuing to streamline licensing and rule-making activities.

### **Segment 3: Licensing and Administrative Reforms**
1. **House Bill 267: Animal Chiropractic Licensing**:
   - The bill clarifies language regarding exemptions from veterinary licensing for chiropractors and veterinarians attending nationally recognized animal chiropractic programs. Concerns were raised about the lack of explicit language in the original bill, which has now been amended to specify that only licensed chiropractors and veterinarians are exempt.

2. **House Bill 85: Temporary Licenses for Respiratory Therapy Students**:
   - This bill creates temporary licenses for respiratory therapy students to work in hospitals under supervision while completing their education. The New Hampshire Hospital Association supports the bill, citing a 21.7% vacancy rate for respiratory therapists and the need to retain students in the state. Concerns were raised about the clarity of the bill’s language, particularly regarding re-examination rules for students who fail their first exam.

3. **House Bill 82: Statutory Cleanup for Licensing Boards**:
   - This bill consolidates and cleans up statutory language related to licensing boards, removing redundancies and aligning with existing laws. Testimony from the New Hampshire Land Surveyors Association raised concerns about repealing disciplinary action provisions, but the OPLC clarified that the bill aims to streamline statutes and avoid conflicting language.

### **Key Themes**
- **Clarity and Consistency**: Multiple bills aimed to refine language to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistent application of licensing rules.
- **Public Access and Workforce Retention**: Bills like HB 85 focus on improving access to care and retaining healthcare professionals in New Hampshire.
- **Stakeholder Concerns**: Testimony from various associations highlighted the need for careful consideration of unintended consequences, particularly in disciplinary actions and licensing processes.

The bills will proceed to subcommittees for further review and refinement, ensuring that the final legislation balances professional standards, public safety, and access to services.
