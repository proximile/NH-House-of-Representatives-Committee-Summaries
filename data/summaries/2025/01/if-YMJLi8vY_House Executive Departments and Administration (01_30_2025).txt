3. **House Bill 244**: This bill, which updates municipal enforcement of building and fire codes, was retained for further review due to its complexity.

4. **House Bill 534**: Introduced by Representative Steve Pearson, the bill was requested to be killed due to technical issues and misunderstandings about its intended effects. The committee voted 14-0 to ITL the bill.

5. **House Bill 233**: An amendment was proposed to remove the requirement for the New Hampshire Vaccine Association to answer irrelevant questions and to allow video recordings of meetings as official records. The amendment passed 8-5, and the bill, as amended, passed 7-6.

The bill will move to subcommittee for further review.

#### **Focus on Retirement System Reforms**
The meeting included extensive discussions on proposals to transition the state’s retirement system from a **defined benefit (DB) plan** to a **defined contribution (DC) plan**, primarily through **House Bill 581**.

1. **House Bill 581**: This bill proposes establishing a DC plan for new Group 1 state employees (hired after July 1, 2025), replacing the current DB pension plan. Key points include:
   - **Defined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution**: The current DB plan promises fixed payments based on a formula, while the DC plan functions like a 401(k), with employees and employers contributing to a savings account.
   - **Benefits of DC Plan**: Portability, no vesting period, and inheritability of savings.
   - **Concerns**: Critics argue that the DC plan provides less retirement security, exposes employees to market risks, and could harm recruitment and retention. Stakeholders, including the State Employees Association and Retired Firefighters Association, strongly opposed the bill, citing historical failures of DC plans in other states.
   - **Fiscal Impact**: The state would contribute 5% of the employee’s salary, higher than the current 2.42% for normal costs in the DB plan. However, the state would save on unfunded liabilities over time.

2. **Historical Context**: Representative Blazel highlighted the history of the retirement system, noting that past legislative decisions, such as altering interest assumptions and funding methodologies, exacerbated financial problems. He emphasized that the current DB plan has performed well, with an average return of 7.9% over the last decade.

3. **Counterarguments**: Proponents of the DC plan, including Representative Dan Maguire, argued that the current system is outdated and unattractive to younger employees, contributing to hiring challenges. They also suggested that the DC plan would protect the state from future legislative mismanagement of retirement funds.

4. **Subcommittee Review**: Both HB 581 and HB 637 were referred to subcommittees for further review and potential amendments. The subcommittees will address unresolved concerns and refine fiscal and technical details.

#### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting highlighted a contentious debate between maintaining the current DB plan, which offers stability and predictability for employees, and transitioning to a DC plan, which proponents argue would reduce the state’s financial risks and align with modern retirement trends. Stakeholders expressed significant concerns about the potential impact of HB 581 on retirement security, state finances, and workforce stability. Meanwhile, HB 637 seeks to correct a legislative oversight affecting a closed group of retirees, with limited fiscal impact.

Both bills will undergo further scrutiny in subcommittees, with a focus on balancing fiscal responsibility, employee needs, and long-term sustainability of the retirement system.
