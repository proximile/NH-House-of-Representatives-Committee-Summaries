**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (January 22, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee convened on January 22, 2025, to discuss several bills primarily focused on public transparency, access to records, and library privacy. The meeting centered on balancing transparency and accessibility with practical concerns for municipalities, schools, and libraries, while addressing emerging challenges such as technological advancements and privacy issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and debates:

---

### **Right-to-Know Law (RSA 91-A) and Related Bills**
The committee extensively debated bills aimed at modernizing and clarifying the state’s Right-to-Know Law (RSA 91-A), focusing on who can request public records, how records are delivered, and the associated costs and burdens.

1. **HB 66**:  
   - **Scope of Requests**: Expands the definition of a requester to include **any person worldwide**, not just New Hampshire citizens. Supporters argue this promotes transparency and aligns with historical interpretations, while opponents worry about potential abuse by **AI bots**, **foreign entities**, and **commercial organizations**.  
   - **Electronic Delivery**: Requires public bodies to provide records electronically if requested, unless it is unduly burdensome or technologically unfeasible. Proponents highlight efficiency and accessibility, especially for individuals with disabilities or those living far from municipal offices. Critics raise concerns about **security risks**, **privacy issues**, and **administrative burdens**.  
   - **Preliminary Drafts**: Clarifies that preliminary drafts circulated to a quorum of a public body are subject to disclosure, raising concerns about incomplete or incorrect information being released.  
   - **Cost and Burden**: Opponents, including the **New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA)** and **New Hampshire School Boards Association**, argue the bill could increase costs and strain resources, particularly from out-of-state requests. Supporters, including the **ACLU** and **Right to Know NH**, counter that the bill is modest and reasonable, with provisions to address burdensome requests.  

2. **HB 74**:  
   - **Narrower Scope**: Limits requesters to **New Hampshire citizens** or **press acting to inform citizens**, addressing concerns raised in the **Rochester case**. Supporters argue this better balances transparency with protecting local resources, while critics fear it could exclude non-residents with significant ties to the state.  
   - **Domicile Requirement**: Ties citizenship to **domicile**, aligning with voting laws and ensuring the Right-to-Know Law serves local citizens and press.  

3. **HB 114**:  
   - **Repeal of Fees**: Seeks to repeal fees for public records requests, with supporters arguing that fees create barriers to access. Opponents, including the NHMA, contend that fees are necessary to recoup costs for voluminous or complex requests.  

4. **HB 313**:  
   - **Non-Public Sessions**: Grants individuals the right to attend non-public sessions where they are being discussed and request that the meeting be open to the public. Opponents cite practical challenges and potential adverse effects on individuals’ reputations, while supporters emphasize transparency.

### **Library Privacy and Parental Access**
The committee also discussed bills related to library privacy and parental oversight of children’s library records, highlighting tensions between individual privacy, parental rights, and transparency.

1. **HB 376 – Library Privacy**:  
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies exemptions in the Right-to-Know Law to include library cards and membership status, ensuring privacy for library users.  
   - **Background**: Prompted by an incident where library cards of candidates for a Library Board of Trustees were released via a Right-to-Know request and shared on social media.  
   - **Debate**: Supporters argue the bill prevents misuse of personal information, while opponents question whether library card information should be public, especially for candidates.  
   - **Safety Concerns**: Highlights the safety implications for vulnerable populations, such as victims of domestic violence.  

2. **HB 273 – Parental Access to Children’s Library Records**:  
   - **Purpose**: Grants parents access to their children’s library records, ensuring they can monitor what books their children are checking out.  
   - **Debate**: Supporters emphasize parental oversight and concerns about age-appropriate materials, while opponents raise privacy concerns, particularly for LGBTQ+ youth.  
   - **Logistical Challenges**: Libraries express concerns about the costs and administrative burdens of implementing the bill, especially for small, non-automated libraries.

### **Other Bills Discussed**
1. **HB 80 – Remote Voting**:  
   - **Purpose**: Restricts remote voting in public meetings, requiring members to be physically present unless their absence is "unavoidable."  
   - **Debate**: Proponents argue it ensures accountability, while opponents, including disability rights advocates, warn it could exclude individuals with legitimate barriers to in-person attendance.  

2. **HB 164 – Electronic Records Transition**:  
   - **Purpose**: Proposes transitioning municipal records to electronic formats, with a small appropriation to support the initiative.  
   - **Support**: Emphasizes cost savings, efficiency, and public access.  

3. **HB 265 – Meeting Minutes**:  
   - **Purpose**: Requires meeting minutes to include start and end times and the name and signature of the person who wrote the minutes, addressing concerns about authenticity.

- **Privacy and Accessibility**: Discussions emphasized the importance of protecting individual privacy, particularly for vulnerable populations, while ensuring accessibility to public records and meetings.  
- **Technological Challenges**: The bills addressed emerging issues such as electronic records, AI bots, and data scraping, underscoring the need for predictive thinking and risk mitigation.
