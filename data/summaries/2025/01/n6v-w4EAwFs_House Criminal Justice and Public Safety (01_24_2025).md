Below is a consolidated summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 218: Access to Police Reports for Crime Victims**
- **Purpose**: The bill updates RSA 21 m8k to allow crime victims to receive a free, redacted copy of their police report within 60 days of the case’s closure. This aims to eliminate financial burdens on victims and ensure timely access to reports for legal, insurance, and victim compensation purposes.
- **Support**: Advocates, including the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, emphasized the importance of empowering victims in the criminal justice process. Major Bill Bright of the NH State Police supported the bill, noting it aligns with existing statutes like RSA 91a.
- **Concerns**: Some committee members suggested shortening the 60-day waiting period for report access.
- **Outcome**: A subcommittee was proposed to refine the bill in collaboration with law enforcement representatives.

#### **House Bill 397: Marine Patrol Shortage**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses the decline in Marine Patrol presence on New Hampshire’s water bodies by proposing a multi-agency task force to study and recommend solutions. The task force would involve stakeholders such as the Department of Safety, Fish and Game, and Environmental Services.
- **Support**: Major Bill Bright highlighted recruitment challenges for seasonal Marine Patrol officers and suggested creative solutions like joint enforcement teams with road troopers. Andrea LaMore of NH Lakes emphasized the impact of declining patrols on safety and water quality enforcement.
- **Outcome**: The committee endorsed the task force approach to maximize resources, including federal funding, and increase patrol coverage.

#### **House Bill 291: Fertilizer Regulation**
- **Purpose**: The bill reduces the penalty for improper fertilizer use from a misdemeanor to a violation for first-time offenders, with potential escalation for repeat violations.
- **Discussion**: Concerns were raised about enforcement, particularly regarding cyanobacteria blooms in lakes. While there was agreement on reducing penalties for first-time offenses, stricter measures for repeat offenders were proposed.
- **Outcome**: The committee discussed the need for clearer guidelines and potential amendments to address enforcement challenges.

#### **House Bill 183: EMT Reporting Requirements**
- **Purpose**: The bill extends the time frame for EMTs to complete state EMS run forms from 24 hours to seven days, aiming to reduce overtime costs and improve efficiency.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the balance between timely reporting and potential impacts on patient care.
- **Outcome**: The need for flexibility for EMTs was acknowledged, and the bill was supported with this consideration.

#### **House Bill 91: Fireworks Permits**
- **Purpose**: The bill allows municipalities to issue permits for professional fireworks displays and grants fire departments authority to inspect sites. Fire chiefs can determine if fire apparatus and personnel are needed during displays.
- **Discussion**: The committee clarified that the bill applies to professional displays, not consumer fireworks. A deputy fire marshal emphasized the focus on safety for public events.
- **Outcome**: The bill was supported with an emphasis on ensuring fire personnel are present for professional displays.

#### **House Bill 143: No Trespass Orders**
- **Purpose**: The bill addresses due process concerns by requiring a unanimous vote by a governing body to issue no trespass orders on public property, with a hearing process for affected individuals.
- **Discussion**: Representative Juliet Harvey highlighted cases where no trespass orders were issued without proper due process, such as parents being barred from school grounds. Concerns were raised about the practicality of requiring unanimous votes and delays in urgent situations. The New Hampshire School Boards Association opposed the bill, arguing that superintendents need immediate authority to ensure student safety.
- **Outcome**: The committee considered amendments to balance safety and procedural fairness, including allowing temporary emergency orders and reducing the voting threshold to a majority.
