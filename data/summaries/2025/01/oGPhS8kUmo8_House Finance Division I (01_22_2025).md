The NH House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on January 22, 2025, provided a comprehensive overview of the state’s budgetary, operational, and strategic priorities across various departments and agencies. The meeting highlighted efficient use of funds, leveraging federal resources, and addressing challenges in staffing, infrastructure, and market trends. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA) and Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR)**  
- **BEA**: The BEA met its $17 million budget target through strategic planning, with 49% state-funded and 46% federally funded. Key initiatives include the Housing Champions program, broadband expansion (using ARPA and BEAD funds), and support for tourism and economic development. The agency emphasized staffing efficiency and managing welcome centers.  
- **DNCR**: The DNCR manages 220,000 acres of public land, 870 buildings, and state parks, with only 17% of its funding from the general fund. Revenue generation through state parks and federal grants supports initiatives like the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Challenges include maintaining aging infrastructure, such as the 85-year-old aerial tramway, and addressing climate-related risks like wildfires.

### **Department of Revenue (DOR) and Department of Revenue Administration (DRA)**  
- **DOR**: The DOR administers $2.9 billion in revenue, primarily from business taxes, meals and rooms tax, and tobacco tax. The Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) has improved efficiency, generating $14.5 million in FY2024. The department faces staffing challenges but leverages technology to maintain operations, including transitioning to a cloud-based platform.  
- **DRA**: The DRA ensures fair tax administration and supports municipalities with budgeting and property appraisals. It administers taxes like business profits and real estate transfer taxes but does not collect insurance or gas taxes. The department relies on technology and embedded IT support for efficiency.

### **New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority (NHHFA)**  
The NHHFA finances affordable housing projects using federal tax credits, state funds, and gap financing. It administers programs like the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and lead paint hazard remediation, clearing over 500 units since 2019. Challenges include local permitting delays, labor shortages, and rising construction costs. The NHHFA emphasized the need for infrastructure improvements to support housing development.

### **Cultural Resources, State Parks, and Libraries**  
- **Cultural Resources**: The state library leverages $1.5 million in federal funds to support visually and physically disabled residents and resource sharing among 230 libraries.  
- **State Parks**: The Division of Parks and Recreation manages 1,300 campsites and educational programs, generating significant revenue. ARPA funds have been allocated for park projects, but more investment is needed for infrastructure maintenance.  
- **Forests and Lands**: The Division of Forest and Lands manages 170,000 acres, including a state nursery that sells 200,000–300,000 seedlings annually. Fire protection efforts include aerial patrols and partnerships for wildfire response.

### **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**  
The OPLC oversees over 50 licensing boards, processes 200,000 licenses annually, and handles 100 complaints monthly. It is self-funded through licensing fees and is implementing a new licensing system with ARPA funds. Staffing challenges persist, with requests to make temporary positions permanent.

### **New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC)**  
The NHLC is self-funded through liquor sales and oversees 6,200 licenses. It has implemented a loss prevention program and a new cloud-based system, NextGen, to improve operations. The commission faces competition from Total Wine and the cannabis market, with declining alcohol sales attributed to health trends and changing consumer preferences. Budget reductions include unfunding seven positions, while capital projects focus on building new stores.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**  
1. **Federal Funding**: Departments like BEA, DNCR, and NHHFA have effectively utilized federal funds for infrastructure, housing, and broadband projects.  
2. **Staffing and Efficiency**: Many agencies face staffing shortages but are leveraging technology (e.g., RIMS, NextGen) to maintain operations.  
3. **Infrastructure Maintenance**: Aging infrastructure, such as state parks and the aerial tramway, requires significant investment.  
4. **Market Trends**: The NHLC is adapting to competition and declining alcohol sales by expanding curbside pickup, home delivery, and marketing non-alcoholic products.  
5. **Affordable Housing**: The NHHFA highlighted the need for streamlined permitting and infrastructure improvements to address the housing crisis.

### **Strategic Initiatives**  
- **Technology Upgrades**: Agencies are transitioning to cloud-based systems (e.g., RIMS, NextGen) to enhance efficiency and taxpayer services.  
- **Revenue Generation**: Departments like DNCR and NHLC are maximizing revenue through state parks, licensing fees, and retail operations.  
- **Public Service**: Agencies emphasized their commitment to transparency, efficiency, and supporting New Hampshire residents through housing, cultural resources, and tax administration.

The meeting underscored the importance of strategic funding, technological innovation, and addressing operational challenges to ensure the state’s economic and cultural development.
