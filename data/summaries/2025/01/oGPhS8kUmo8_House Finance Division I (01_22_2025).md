**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division I Meeting (January 22, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division I meeting on January 22, 2025, covered a wide range of topics, focusing on state agency budgets, federal funding allocations, housing initiatives, infrastructure projects, and regulatory operations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes from the meeting:

---

### **1. Budget Allocations and Agency Functions**
- **Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA)**: The BEA presented its budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, emphasizing efficiency and prioritized needs. Key initiatives include the Broadband expansion program, the Housing Champions program, and the operationalization of the Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) at a cost of $1.5 million annually. The BEA manages 12 welcome centers and focuses on business recruitment, workforce development, and tourism.
- **New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority (NHHFA)**: NHHFA, a quasi-governmental organization, discussed its role in financing affordable housing projects using state and federal resources. Recent state appropriations of $30 million and an annual $5 million set-aside from the real estate transfer tax have bolstered its efforts. Challenges include rising construction costs and local permitting delays.
- **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA)**: The DRA highlighted the successful implementation of the RIMS system, which has improved efficiency and generated $14.5 million in revenue uplift in FY 2024. The department has reduced staffing from 218 in 2010 to 135 in 2025, leveraging technology to streamline operations and enhance customer service.

### **2. Federal Funding and Strategic Investments**
- **American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)**: Agencies like the BEA and NHHFA utilized ARPA funds for housing, broadband expansion, and lead paint hazard remediation. The obligation deadline for ARPA funds was December 31, 2024, with remaining funds directed to the affordable housing trust fund.
- **State Infrastructure and Housing**: Federal funds were prioritized for one-time investments in housing, broadband, and infrastructure projects, including a new fish hatchery. The Housing Champions program encourages municipalities to adopt affordable housing strategies, with designated communities eligible for infrastructure funding.

### **3. Housing and Lead Remediation Programs**
- **Affordable Housing**: NHHFA administers the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, providing gap financing for multifamily rental projects and ensuring rents remain affordable for low- and moderate-income residents. The agency also manages a lead paint hazard remediation program, which has cleared over 500 units since 2019.
- **Challenges**: Rising construction costs, infrastructure limitations, and local permitting processes were identified as barriers to deploying housing funds effectively.

---

### **4. State Parks, Recreation, and Tourism**
- **State Parks**: New Hampshire’s state parks are self-funded through user fees and contribute $3.9 billion to the state’s economy. Maintenance and capital improvements, such as bathroom renovations, remain a challenge due to limited state funding.
- **Tourism and Outdoor Recreation**: The BEA’s Division of Travel and Tourism collaborates with the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR) on marketing campaigns. The Office of Outdoor Recreation focuses on leveraging outdoor activities to attract businesses and workforce.

---

### **5. Regulatory and Licensing Operations**
- **Occupational Licensing**: The Office of Professional Licensure and Certification oversees over 50 licensing boards and 212,000 licensed individuals. Efforts are underway to streamline the rulemaking process and reduce backlogs. The office is entirely self-funded through licensing fees.
- **Liquor Commission (NHLC)**: The NHLC operates as a control state, ensuring product safety and generating significant revenue. The commission has modernized its operations with the NextGen project, a cloud-based system launched in 2024. Challenges include competition from cannabis sales in neighboring states and declining alcohol sales nationally.

---

### **6. Environmental and Cultural Resources**
- **Division of Forest and Lands**: Manages 170,000 acres of state land, generating $11.75 million in timber revenue in 2024. Challenges include unstaffed fire towers and increased fire risks due to climate change.
- **State Library and Historical Resources**: The State Library, founded in 1717, supports public education and interlibrary loan services. The Division of Historical Resources oversees historic preservation and archaeology, managing programs like the National Register and Moose Plate grants.

---

### **7. Financial Performance and Future Challenges**
- **Revenue Generation**: Agencies like the DRA and NHLC have successfully modernized systems to improve efficiency and revenue generation. The DRA’s RIMS system has paid for itself through revenue uplift, while the NHLC has implemented cost-saving measures and competitive buying practices.
- **Market Trends**: The NHLC faces challenges from declining alcohol sales, increased cannabis use, and competition from large retailers. The agency is adapting by offering non-alcoholic products and enhancing customer experience.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Efficiency and Modernization**: Multiple agencies have invested in technology to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve customer service.
- **Housing and Infrastructure**: Federal and state funds are being strategically allocated to address affordable housing and infrastructure needs, though challenges remain in project deployment.
- **Climate Change and Public Safety**: Environmental divisions highlighted the impact of climate change on forest health and fire risks, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies.
- **Economic and Social Impact**: State parks, tourism, and cultural resources play a significant role in New Hampshire’s economy and quality of life, requiring continued investment and maintenance.

Overall, the meeting underscored the state’s efforts to manage budgets effectively, leverage federal funds, and address critical issues like housing, infrastructure, and public safety while adapting to changing market and environmental conditions.
