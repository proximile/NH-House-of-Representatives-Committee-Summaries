The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 9, 2025, marked Inauguration Day and included several key events and ceremonies. The session began with the adjournment from the previous session, followed by the introduction of guests and the formation of a Joint Convention. The Joint Convention was called to order to hear the report on the vote counts for the Governor and Executive Council, and to inaugurate Governor-Elect Kelly Ayotte and the Executive Councilors.

The ceremony included the invocation by Reverend Monsignor Richard Kelley and Reverend David Harris, the posting of the colors, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the National Anthem performed by Officer Taylor Morin. Governor-Elect Kelly Ayotte and the Executive Councilors were then sworn in, with Chief Justice Gordon J. McDonald administering the oath to Ayotte.

Governor Ayotte delivered her inaugural address, emphasizing her commitment to serving all residents of New Hampshire, regardless of political affiliation. She highlighted the state's strengths, including its low tax burden, strong economy, and high quality of life, and outlined her priorities, which include addressing the housing crisis, improving education, and ensuring public safety. Ayotte also announced the creation of the Commission on Government Efficiency to streamline government operations and reduce waste.

The ceremony concluded with a benediction by Pastor Michael Worsley, and the Joint Convention was adjourned. The House session then proceeded to handle routine business, including motions to adjourn and recess for the purpose of introducing bills and receiving messages.
