**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Therapeutic Cannabis (01/22/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on January 22, 2025, to discuss several bills aimed at expanding and improving the state’s therapeutic cannabis program. The meeting highlighted key debates on access, affordability, sustainability, and regulatory oversight, with a focus on supporting patients while addressing financial and operational challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **HB 25: Exempting Veterans from Application Fees**
- **Objective**: To waive the $50 application fee for veterans participating in the therapeutic cannabis program.
- **Debate**:
  - **Supporters** argued that veterans, including non-combat veterans, face barriers such as PTSD and VA restrictions on certifying medical cannabis use, making the fee an additional burden.
  - **Opponents** raised concerns about the fiscal impact, as the program is self-funded. Waiving fees would shift costs to Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs), potentially increasing prices for other patients.
  - The fiscal note indicated no direct impact on the state budget but noted lost revenue would affect ATCs and patients.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **5 to 1 against the bill**, recognizing veterans' needs but prioritizing the program’s financial sustainability.

#### **HB 31: Cultivation Locations for ATCs**
- **Objective**: To allow ATCs to operate additional cultivation locations, including greenhouses, to reduce production costs and increase product variety.
- **Debate**:
  - **Proponents** highlighted the cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability of greenhouse cultivation, noting that neighboring states already allow it. They emphasized that the bill would not increase production but improve efficiency.
  - **Opponents** raised concerns about security risks, but the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) assured existing protocols would apply.
  - The Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board (TCMO) supported the bill **8 to 0**, with one abstention.
- **Outcome**: The bill received **broad support**, with stakeholders emphasizing its potential to lower costs and improve patient access.

#### **HB 53: Home Cultivation for Therapeutic Cannabis**
- **Objective**: To allow qualifying patients and caregivers to cultivate cannabis at home, with limits (e.g., three mature plants, three immature plants, and 12 seedlings).
- **Debate**:
  - **Supporters**, including TCMO and patients, argued that home cultivation would improve affordability, accessibility, and strain availability. They noted that similar laws in other states have not caused significant issues.
  - **Opponents** expressed concerns about reproducibility, enforcement, and potential misuse, but proponents highlighted safeguards like secure cultivation sites and penalties for violations.
  - The bill does not include routine inspections but allows law enforcement to investigate suspected violations.
- **Outcome**: The bill received **strong support** from stakeholders, with emphasis on its compassionate and cost-effective approach.

#### **HB 51: Hemp-Derived Cannabinoids**
- **Objective**: To expand the definition of cannabis to include non-intoxicating, hemp-derived cannabinoids (e.g., CBD) and allow ATCs to purchase third-party hemp products.
- **Debate**:
  - **Supporters** argued that sourcing hemp-derived cannabinoids externally would reduce costs and provide patients with diverse, effective treatments. All products would undergo rigorous testing to ensure safety and compliance (THC < 0.3%).
  - **Opponents**, including SAM New Hampshire, raised concerns about federal and state definitions of hemp and the lack of a USDA-approved hemp plan in New Hampshire.
- **Outcome**: The bill was **supported** for its potential to enhance patient access and reduce costs.

#### **HB 54: Nonprofit to For-Profit Conversion for ATCs**
- **Objective**: To allow ATCs to convert from nonprofit to for-profit entities to improve access to capital and reduce costs.
- **Debate**:
  - **Supporters** argued that the nonprofit requirement hampers ATCs’ efficiency and ability to compete with neighboring states. They noted that safeguards would prevent out-of-state corporations from taking over.
  - **Opponents**, including SAM New Hampshire, expressed concerns that profit-driven motives could overshadow patient care.
- **Outcome**: The bill was **supported** as a means to improve ATCs’ viability and better serve patients.

### **Key Themes and Testimonies**
- **Veterans’ Challenges**: Veterans face significant barriers due to VA restrictions and additional costs for third-party certifications. While there is strong support for veterans, fiscal concerns have limited fee exemptions.
- **Cost and Affordability**: The therapeutic cannabis program is self-funded, and any fee reductions or exemptions could impact program sustainability or shift costs to other patients.
- **Greenhouse and Home Cultivation**: Both greenhouse and home cultivation were highlighted as cost-effective, environmentally sustainable solutions to improve patient access and affordability.
- **Regulation and Security**: Stakeholders emphasized the importance of maintaining strict regulatory and security measures to prevent diversion and ensure compliance.
- **Scientific Evidence**: Concerns were raised about the lack of robust scientific evidence supporting cannabis for certain conditions (e.g., PTSD), highlighting the need for further research.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the ongoing tension between expanding access to therapeutic cannabis and managing the financial and regulatory challenges of the program. While there was broad support for bills aimed at reducing costs and improving patient access (e.g., HB 31, HB 53, HB 51), concerns about fiscal sustainability and enforcement led to the rejection of fee exemptions for veterans (HB 25). The discussions highlighted the need for careful consideration of the program’s future, balancing patient needs, financial stability, and regulatory oversight. The committee will continue deliberations in subsequent sessions.
