**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Meeting (January 27, 2025)**

The NH House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee meeting on January 27, 2025, covered a wide range of topics, including regulatory oversight, insurance, gaming, sports betting, state finances, and investment strategies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all segments:

---

### **Bureau of Securities Regulation and Insurance Department Overviews**

1. **Bureau of Securities Regulation**:
   - **Director Barry Glennon**: Presented the Bureau’s regulatory functions, including oversight of broker-dealers, investment advisors, securities registration, and enforcement activities.
   - **Enforcement and Revenue**: Handles ~70 complaints annually, leading to ~40 enforcement actions. The Bureau is self-funded through fines, penalties, and licensing fees, generating $43.9 million in unrestricted general fund revenue in FY2024. Licensing fees for broker-dealers and investment advisors are expected to rise, while mutual fund registration fees may decline due to industry consolidation and regulatory changes like Regulation Best Interest.
   - **Challenges**: Addressed issues like unlicensed activity and fraud.

2. **Insurance Department**:
   - **Commissioner DJ Bettencourt**: Outlined the department’s role in regulating insurance companies, producers, and adjusters. The department is self-funded through assessments on insurance companies based on premium volume.
   - **Functions**: Enforces insurance laws, reviews policy rates and forms, ensures financial health of insurers, and conducts market conduct examinations.
   - **Consumer Protection**: Investigates insurance fraud (e.g., auto insurance fraud), monitors health insurance costs, and provides consumer support (~7,000 calls annually).
   - **Initiatives**: Proposed a $1 million home resiliency program to help consumers lower insurance premiums through home improvements. Also addressed challenges in long-term care insurance due to historical underpricing and increased consumer retention.

### **Gaming, Sports Betting, and State Funds**

1. **Gaming and Sports Betting**:
   - **Revenue Trends**: Gross gaming revenues declined 5% year-over-year due to softness in retail and record Powerball/Mega Millions sales in FY24. Sports betting revenues remained strong, with NH being the second most profitable state after New York.
   - **Legislation**:
     - **HB 328**: Passed an amendment reducing the gaming commission’s voting membership from nine to seven and allocating $100,000 in non-appropriated funds for its operations.
     - **HB 83**: Voted inexpedient to legislate (11-7) due to concerns about decreasing state revenues. The bill proposed changes to sports betting age limits.

2. **Fish and Game Department Funding**:
   - **Budget**: Primarily self-funded through unrestricted revenues, with significant contributions from federal grants and indirect cost recoveries.
