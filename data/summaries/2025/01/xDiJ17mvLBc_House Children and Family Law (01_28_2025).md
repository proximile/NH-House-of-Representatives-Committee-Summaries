#### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 433: Child Marriage and Military Exception**
   - **Proposal**: Allows 17-year-olds on active military duty to marry with parental consent.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill would provide critical benefits (e.g., healthcare, housing) for young military families, especially in cases of pregnancy or deployment. They emphasized the narrow scope of the exception and the need for parental consent.
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including military veterans and advocacy groups like Unchained at Last and New Futures, highlighted the dangers of child marriage, such as abuse, isolation, and long-term harm. Testimonies included personal stories of abuse and concerns about legalizing the trafficking of minors.
   - **Outcome**: The bill remained under discussion, with no final decision recorded.

2. **House Bill 325: Eliminating Alimony in No-Fault Divorces**
   - **Proposal**: Seeks to eliminate term and reimbursement alimony in no-fault divorces.
   - **Support**: The sponsor argued that alimony in no-fault divorces is unjust and akin to "involuntary servitude."
   - **Opposition**: Opponents, including attorneys and advocates, emphasized that alimony is crucial for supporting vulnerable spouses, particularly in cases of financial abuse or career sacrifices. They warned that eliminating alimony could force parties into more adversarial fault-based divorces.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted **inexpedient to legislate** (ITL), rejecting the bill.

3. **House Bill 170: Excluding Military Retirement Benefits from Divorce Settlements**
   - **Proposal**: Aims to exclude military retirement benefits from property settlements in divorces.
   - **Concerns**: Representatives expressed concerns about the financial impact on military spouses.
   - **Outcome**: The ITL motion passed 15-1, effectively killing the bill.

4. **House Bill 322: Child Tax Credit for Child Support Payers**
   - **Proposal**: Allows a parent paying child support to claim the child as a dependent on their tax return.
   - **Support**: Proponents argued that the payer, as the primary financial supporter, should benefit from the tax credit.
   - **Opposition**: Critics raised concerns about low-income payers who may not be the primary financial providers, potentially disadvantaging custodial parents.
   - **Outcome**: The committee voted ITL, rejecting the bill.

5. **House Bill 478: Foster Care Oversight Committee**
   - **Proposal**: Establishes a permanent foster care oversight committee within the Commission on Children’s Services.
   - **Support**: Foster parents and advocates testified about systemic dysfunction, isolation, and lack of support in the foster care system. The bill aims to improve support systems and outcomes for foster children.
   - **Outcome**: The bill received strong support from stakeholders, including the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

6. **House Bill 553: Child Abuse and Neglect Definitions**
   - **Proposal**: Updates definitions of child abuse and neglect to include emotional and psychological harm, with a focus on trauma-informed care.
   - **Concerns**: Critics opposed the bill’s presumption of harm for substance use by parents, arguing it could deter individuals from seeking prenatal care or treatment. They called for more nuanced, evidence-based approaches.
   - **Support**: Proponents emphasized the need for early intervention and family preservation, aligning with modern psychological research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
   - **Outcome**: The committee adjourned the hearing and planned to revisit the bill in an executive session.

7. **House Bill 169C: Modernizing Child Abuse and Neglect Laws**
   - **Proposal**: Updates a 45-year-old statute to include psychological abuse, trauma-informed care, and clearer definitions of harm.
   - **Support**: The bill emphasizes early intervention, family preservation, and voluntary services to prevent escalation to removal.
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about psychological harm assessment, staffing shortages at DCYF, and the practical implementation of new definitions.
   - **Outcome**: The bill received bipartisan support and was discussed further in the committee.
