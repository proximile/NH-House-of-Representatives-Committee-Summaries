### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (01/31/2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 31, 2025, focused on several key bills related to criminal justice and public safety. The discussions highlighted the need to balance the protection of first responders and law enforcement with concerns about over-criminalization, constitutional rights, and government transparency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

#### **House Bill 59: Enhanced Penalties for Assaulting First Responders**
- **Objective**: The bill seeks to increase penalties for assaults on public safety officials, including law enforcement officers, firefighters, and EMS personnel, by adding language to the RSA for first and second-degree assault.
- **Support**: First responders testified about the dangers they face, advocating for stronger protections and consequences for intentional assaults. Some representatives emphasized the need to address rising anti-police rhetoric and physical harm to those in public safety roles.
- **Concerns**: Advocacy groups, including NAMI New Hampshire and the Disability Rights Center, raised concerns about the bill’s broad language, particularly the inclusion of “recklessly,” which could disproportionately penalize individuals with mental health crises or disabilities. Critics also questioned the bill’s deterrent effect and potential to exacerbate mass incarceration.
- **Amendments Suggested**: Advocates urged narrowing the language to focus on intentional harm and ensuring protections for vulnerable populations. The New Hampshire Association of Counties requested explicit inclusion of correctional officers in the bill’s protections.

#### **House Bill 109: False Reports to Law Enforcement**
- **Objective**: The bill proposes making it a misdemeanor to knowingly file false reports of misconduct or criminal conduct against law enforcement officers.
- **Support**: Law enforcement officials argued the bill would deter retaliatory false claims while maintaining professionalism.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives worried the bill could discourage legitimate complaints against police misconduct, particularly due to subjective terms like “rudeness.” Questions were raised about its overlap with existing statutes, such as the unsworn falsification law (RSA 641:3).
- **Clarification**: The sponsor emphasized the high burden of proof required (“knowingly false”) and the bill’s intent to address materially false allegations.

---

#### **House Bill 146: Retention of Video Evidence**
- **Objective**: The bill aims to extend the retention period for video evidence in cases of violations.
- **Opposition**: Critics argued the bill is unnecessary, as current systems already retain video evidence for at least three years in cases involving charges or court proceedings. Concerns were raised about setting arbitrary deadlines for video requests and potential disincentives for law enforcement to adopt body cameras.

#### **House Bill 640: Transparency in Federal Agency Operations**
- **Objective**: The bill directs the New Hampshire Attorney General to collect and publish data on federal agencies operating within the state, including details on facilities, staff, surveillance, investigations, warrants, arrests, refugee relocations, and deportations.
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to enhance transparency, empower citizens, and strengthen trust in government by providing a clearer picture of federal activities in New Hampshire.
- **Concerns**: Committee members questioned the feasibility of quarterly reporting, the enforceability of the bill given federal supremacy, and the fiscal impact, which was disputed by the bill’s sponsor.
- **Support**: Former Representative William Foster, the original sponsor of a similar bill (HB 1411), testified in favor, emphasizing the lack of centralized information about federal activities in the state.

#### **House Bill 698: Identification of Law Enforcement Officers**
- **Objective**: The bill requires law enforcement officers to identify themselves when not in uniform, except in undercover or emergency situations.
- **Support**: The sponsor argued the bill would prevent impersonation, enhance public trust, and ensure accountability, with no expected budget impact.
- **Concerns**: Discussions highlighted issues with officers not identifying themselves during interactions, particularly in non-uniform scenarios.

---

#### **House Bill 162: Consent to Searches**
- **Objective**: The bill mandates that law enforcement officers inform individuals of their right to refuse consent to a search and obtain written or recorded consent.
- **Support**: The bill was praised for enhancing constitutional rights, extending previous legislation on vehicle searches to all property searches.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about its implementation and potential impact on law enforcement procedures.
