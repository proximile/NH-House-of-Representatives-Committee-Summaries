**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (January 28, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened to discuss several key bills and issues related to transportation infrastructure, rail systems, and public safety. The meeting focused on three primary topics: **House Bill 100** (prohibiting state funds for new passenger rail services), **House Bill 375** (allowing municipalities to designate public roads for ATV use), and **House Bill 181** (addressing the maintenance of traffic signal preemption systems). The discussions highlighted the tension between fiscal responsibility, economic development, environmental considerations, and public safety.

### **House Bill 100: Prohibiting State Funds for New Passenger Rail Services**
The committee debated **House Bill 100**, which seeks to prohibit the use of state funds for new passenger rail services. The discussion centered on the economic impact, feasibility, and necessity of passenger rail in New Hampshire.

1. **Opposition to Rail Funding**:
   - Several representatives expressed concerns about the financial burden of investing in passenger rail, citing declining ridership and high infrastructure costs.
   - Representative Edwards argued that the state should prioritize other pressing issues, such as pension funding, education, and legal liabilities, over new rail projects. He referenced California’s costly "bullet train to nowhere" as a cautionary example.

2. **Support for Rail Development**:
   - Representative St. Clair and the **Nashua Chamber of Commerce** advocated for passenger rail, highlighting the success of the **Downeaster** service, which connects New Hampshire to Boston and Maine. They emphasized economic benefits, including tourism, workforce mobility, and housing development near train stations.

3. **Concerns About Bill Language**:
   - The bill’s vague language raised concerns about unintended consequences, such as restricting funding for existing tourist rail services like the **Cog Railway** and **Conway Scenic Railroad**.

4. **State Funds and Rail Infrastructure**:
   - The Department of Transportation clarified that the state has **revolving loan funds** and **special railroad funds** for rail infrastructure projects. The bill’s potential impact on these funding mechanisms was a point of contention.

5. **Feasibility Studies and Economic Benefits**:
   - A previous study on a potential **Nashua-Manchester-Concord rail line** was halted due to lack of funding. While some criticized the repeated studies as wasteful, others argued that data is necessary for informed decisions.
   - Proponents highlighted the potential of rail to boost tourism, reduce traffic congestion, and provide affordable transportation options.

6. **Local Impact**:
   - Representatives from towns like **Merrimack** raised concerns about the potential negative impact of rail projects on local infrastructure, such as the need to relocate sewer lines.

The committee adjourned without a final decision, leaving the bill open for further consideration.

### **House Bill 375: ATVs on Public Roads**
**House Bill 375**, introduced by Representative Dan Maguire, aims to allow municipalities to designate certain road segments for ATV travel to boost tourism and local economies.

1. **Key Provisions**:
   - The bill provides a framework for towns to adopt, including mapping designated areas, setting seasonal restrictions, and imposing safety requirements like headlights and brake lights.
   - It sets a maximum speed limit of 40 mph (possibly intended to be 30 mph) for ATVs on designated roads.

2. **Support and Concerns**:
   - Supporters highlighted the positive economic impact in towns like **Berlin** and **Colebrook**, which already allow ATV use on roads.
   - Concerns were raised about conflicts with existing laws, potential road damage, and safety issues.
   - Captain Michael Eastman of Fish and Game opposed the bill, citing safety concerns and the need for clear definitions of ATVs versus other off-highway vehicles (OHVs).

3. **Bureau of Trails Clarification**:
   - The Bureau of Trails emphasized the existing permitting process for ATV highway crossings and connectors, stressing the importance of safety reviews.

### **House Bill 181: Traffic Signal Preemption Systems**
**House Bill 181**, introduced by Representative Mark Pearson, addresses the inconsistent maintenance of traffic signal preemption systems (e.g., Opticom) used by emergency vehicles.

1. **Key Issues**:
   - The systems, which interrupt normal traffic signals to give emergency vehicles priority, are installed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) but maintained by municipalities.
   - Representative Pearson highlighted reliability issues with state-maintained systems, posing safety risks for emergency responders.

2. **DOT’s Perspective**:
   - Leo Bonis, DOT’s Bureau of Traffic Administrator, explained that while DOT installs the systems, municipalities are responsible for their upkeep. Some cities are transitioning to newer technologies like GPS-based systems.

3. **Concerns**:
   - The lack of regular testing and maintenance schedules for these systems raised concerns about potential failures during emergencies.

### **Outcome**
The committee discussed all three bills in detail, hearing testimony from multiple stakeholders, including the Department of Transportation, Fish and Game, and local representatives. Concerns about fiscal responsibility, economic development, environmental impact, and public safety were central to the debates. The committee will likely consider revisions to address the raised issues before moving the bills forward. The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing immediate state needs with long-term infrastructure investments.
