### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. Charitable Gaming: HB 531 and HB 588**
   - **HB 531**: Proposed a $50,000 annual cap on revenue that nonprofits can earn from charitable gaming activities, with surplus funds redirected to the state’s education trust fund.  
     - **Opposition**: Nonprofits overwhelmingly testified against the bill, arguing it would severely limit their ability to provide essential services. Organizations like **Webster House Children’s Home**, **New Hampshire Soccer Association**, and **Granite State Independent Living** emphasized the critical role of gaming revenue in funding programs for at-risk youth, mental health, and disability services.  
     - **Concerns**: Critics argued the bill would shift $18.6 million from nonprofits to the state, effectively taxing the nonprofit sector. They also noted the timing of the bill would unfairly penalize charities operating in the latter half of the fiscal year.  
     - **Call for Further Study**: Many urged the committee to wait for recommendations from the newly formed **Charitable Gaming Commission** rather than rushing to implement HB 531.  

   - **HB 588**: Proposed redirecting a portion of historic horse racing (HHR) revenue to the state’s education trust fund.  
     - **Opposition**: Stakeholders argued this would reduce funding for nonprofits and undermine the original intent of charitable gaming, which is to support nonprofits directly.  
     - **Impact of HHR**: Nonprofits highlighted the significant role of HHR in increasing revenue since its introduction in 2022, with many relying on it as a critical funding source.  

   - **Broader Implications**: Both bills were criticized for destabilizing the nonprofit sector, shifting the burden of providing essential services back to the state, and undermining the **unique New Hampshire model** of charitable gaming, which supports over 800 charities.

#### **2. Affordable Housing: HB 530**
   - **Introduction**: Representative Jessica Lontine highlighted New Hampshire’s housing crisis, with median rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $1,800/month, making it unaffordable for many.  
   - **Proposal**: HB 530 aimed to increase the **Affordable Housing Fund** from $5 million to $10 million by reallocating funds from the real estate transfer tax, without raising taxes.  
   - **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to earmark $10 million from the sale of the Laconia State School to support housing for people with intellectual disabilities.  
   - **Testimonies in Support**:  
     - **Ben Saul** (Visions for Creative Housing Solutions) and **Tom Do Rosa** (Housing Action NH) highlighted the fund’s success in leveraging private investments to build affordable housing.  
     - **Lori Macintosh** (OurPlace NH) and **Maddie Mandelbound** shared personal stories, stressing the dire need for housing for adults with developmental disabilities.  
     - **Jack Rudderman** (NH Housing) detailed the fund’s impact and urged its expansion to address the housing crisis.  
   - **Key Concerns**: Ensuring funding does not come at the expense of education or other essential services, and addressing long-term housing needs for vulnerable populations.

#### **3. Other Bills Discussed**

   - **HB 502, HB 318, and HB 255**: The committee voted to declare these bills “inexpedient to legislate” (ITL).  
     - HB 502 involved corporate reporting for unitary businesses.  
     - HB 318 and HB 255 addressed the percentage of business enterprise tax and business profits tax revenue allocated to the education trust fund, respectively.  
   - **HB 135**: The committee unanimously voted to ITL this bill, which dealt with the collection of sales taxes from foreign jurisdictions by New Hampshire businesses, citing legal considerations related to the Wayfair decision.

### **General Observations**
