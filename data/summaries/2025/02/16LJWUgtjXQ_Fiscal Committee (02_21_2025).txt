The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee meeting on February 21st addressed a range of critical issues, focusing on improving efficiency, addressing financial shortfalls, and ensuring accountability across various state departments and commissions. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### Human Rights Commission (HRC)
The committee reviewed a performance audit of the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights (HRC), revealing significant inefficiencies and systemic issues:
1. **Delays and Backlogs**: Cases at the HRC often take years to resolve, undermining its purpose and discouraging petitioners. The backlog dates back to 1984, despite legislative efforts to address it.
2. **Audit Findings**: The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) audit identified procedural inefficiencies, lack of clear rules, and potential abuse of processes. Recommendations included setting limits on charge amendments, improving transparency, and clarifying staff roles in the conciliation process.
3. **Staffing Challenges**: Although budget increases have funded additional investigators, case loads continue to rise. High staff turnover and slow hiring have hindered progress, and the HRC lacks a method to measure its effectiveness.
4. **Legislative Action**: The House Judiciary Committee plans to meet with the HRC and LBA to discuss solutions, including potential legislative fixes to improve efficiency and accountability.
5. **Self-Represented Litigants**: The challenges posed by self-represented litigants were noted, with suggestions to involve paralegals to assist in case management.

### College Savings Plans Audit
The committee received a positive audit report on the state’s college savings plans:
1. **Clean Audit Opinions**: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) issued unqualified audit opinions for the Unique College Investing Plan and the Fidelity Advisor 529 Plan, confirming strong financial management.
2. **Internal Controls**: The audit found robust internal controls, accurate asset valuations, and proper fee calculations. All required disclosures and related party transactions were appropriately reported, with no fraud or significant deficiencies identified.

### Department of Transportation (DOT)
A major project to improve the DOT’s systems for project planning, design, construction, and asset management was discussed:
1. **Consultant Costs**: The project involves significant consultant expenses, with discussions on expected savings and return on investment.
2. **Timeline**: The project is expected to take 3–4 years, with incremental improvements along the way.

### Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
The committee addressed a $16 million shortfall in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP):
1. **Cause of Shortfall**: The deficit was attributed to changes in federal requirements and continuous enrollment policies.
2. **Future Planning**: DHHS is working to improve budgeting and tracking of CHIP funds to prevent similar issues.

### Canon Mountain
Fee adjustments for Canon Mountain were discussed:
1. **Pricing Strategy**: The adjustments include price freezes and the creation of a new in-season tier to drive advanced commitment and maintain the mountain’s market position as a value leader.

### Department of Corrections (DOC)
The committee reviewed staffing trends and their impact on operations:
1. **Retirement Wave**: A large group of employees is eligible for retirement, raising concerns about staffing levels.
2. **Recruitment and Retention**: The DOC has been working to improve recruitment and retention, with discussions on the relationship between staffing levels and overtime costs.

### Next Steps
- The fiscal committee scheduled its next meeting for March 21st at 11:00 AM.
- The House Judiciary Committee will lead efforts to address HRC issues, potentially proposing legislative changes to improve efficiency and accountability.

### Overall Takeaways
The meeting underscored the urgent need for reforms at the HRC to restore public trust and ensure timely justice. It also highlighted the sound financial management of college savings plans and the importance of strategic planning in addressing shortfalls and improving efficiency across state departments. The committee’s discussions reflected a commitment to accountability, transparency, and effective resource allocation.
