**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (February 18, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 18, 2025, to discuss a series of bills related to education funding, student welfare, and higher education initiatives. The meeting featured extensive debates, amendments, and votes on key legislative proposals. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

---

### **K-12 Education and School Funding**
1. **HB 665 (Eligibility for Free School Meals)**  
   The committee voted to retain the bill, which addresses eligibility for free school meals. The motion passed with 11 yay votes and 3 nay votes.

2. **HB 703 (School Meal Debt Policies)**  
   The committee discussed an amendment to prohibit school districts from denying meals to students with unpaid meal balances. The amendment removes the Department of Education’s responsibility to pay off meal debt and eliminates debt collection clauses. The bill also requires districts to adopt policies preventing shaming or bullying students with unpaid balances and to accept voluntary donations for debt relief. The motion to retain the bill passed with 11 yay votes and 3 nay votes.

3. **HB 583 (Medicaid Direct Certification Program)**  
   This bill proposes state participation in the Medicaid Direct Certification Program for free and reduced-price school meals. An amendment was introduced to make the bill budget-neutral and identify an additional 10,000 eligible students statewide without affecting the school funding formula. After extensive debate, the bill passed with a majority vote of 10 yeas to 8 nays.

4. **HB 646 (Online Applications for Free and Reduced-Price Meals)**  
   The bill would require school districts to establish an online application for the free and reduced-price meal program. A motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was passed, as many districts already offer online applications without legislation.

5. **HB 771 (Funding for Open Enrollment Schools)**  
   The committee discussed a bill allowing parents to send their children to schools outside their district. The motion for OTP (Ought to Pass) passed with 10 yay votes and 8 nay votes.

6. **HB 718 (Reporting Unfunded Financial Impacts)**  
   This bill requires the State Board of Education to report the unfunded financial impact on school districts for rules exceeding state or federal minimum standards. The motion for OTP passed with 10 yay votes and 8 nay votes.

### **Higher Education Initiatives**
1. **HB 770 (Tuition Credits Through Community Service)**  
   The bill aims to establish a program for earning tuition credits at New Hampshire higher education institutions through community service. The motion for ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate) initially passed with 10 yay votes and 8 nay votes. However, further discussion was postponed due to an expected amendment from the prime sponsor.

2. **HB 659 (College Graduate Retention Incentive Program)**  
   This bill proposes the establishment of the New Hampshire College Graduate Retention Incentive Program. Due to its complexity, the committee decided not to move forward with it at this time.

3. **HB 112 (Civics Test Requirement)**  
   The bill requires students in the University and Community College systems of New Hampshire to pass the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Civics naturalization test. It was retained without further discussion.

4. **HB 510 (Due Process Rights in Higher Education)**  
   The bill establishes due process rights for students, student organizations, and faculty facing disciplinary actions in state higher education institutions. It was passed over for further review and will be revisited the following Tuesday.
