### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Executive Departments and Administration (02/19/2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Executive Departments and Administration Committee convened on February 19, 2025, to discuss and vote on several bills. The meeting was marked by extensive debates on retirement benefits, state employee recruitment, leasing practices, and specialized services for vulnerable populations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Retirement Benefits and State Employee Recruitment**
- **House Bill 702 (Special Duty Pay for Retirees)**: The bill aimed to allow retired state employees, particularly police officers, to work extra hours without affecting their retirement payouts. Proponents argued this would address labor shortages and reduce costs for municipalities, while opponents raised concerns about "double-dipping" and fairness in retirement contributions. The subcommittee voted 3-2 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."
  
- **House Bill 581 (Defined Contribution Retirement Plan)**: This bill proposed shifting new state employees from a defined benefit (pension) plan to a defined contribution plan (similar to a 401(k)). Employees would contribute 7% of their salary, with the state contributing 5%, and a two-year vesting period. Proponents highlighted alignment with private-sector practices and reduced unfunded liabilities, while opponents feared it would hinder recruitment and retention. The subcommittee voted 3-2 to recommend the bill with amendments, including a delayed start date of January 1, 2026.

#### **2. Leasing Practices and Fair Market Value**
- **House Bill 694 (Fair Market Value Leases)**: Introduced by Representative Judy Aaron, this bill requires state agencies to lease property at fair market value unless property owners agree to submarket rates. The bill aims to prevent the state from imposing below-market lease rates on properties like courthouses, which burden local taxpayers. The committee discussed the lack of a standardized negotiation process and supported the bill to ensure fairness for both the state and property owners.

#### **3. Specialized Services for Vulnerable Populations**
- **House Bill 525 (Interpreter Licensure Board and Office of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services)**: This bill proposed moving the Interpreter Licensure Board (ILB) and the Office of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (ODHH) from the Department of Education to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC). **Strong opposition** from the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community, interpreters, and advocates highlighted concerns about losing cultural and linguistic expertise, accessibility, and community trust. Stakeholders argued that the OPLC lacks the specialized knowledge needed to manage these services effectively. The OPLC acknowledged the need for adjustments but expressed willingness to implement the bill if passed.

#### **4. Modernizing Language and Streamlining Processes**
- **House Bill 780 (Gender-Neutral Language)**: This bill updates the statute governing the State Archivist position to use gender-neutral language. It received broad support, with discussions about further refining the language to ensure consistency across state statutes.

- **House Bill 82 (Licensing Simplification for Mental Health Practitioners)**: The bill aimed to streamline licensing and insurance reimbursement for mental health professionals by removing references to different licensure levels. Concerns were raised about potential ambiguity and unintended consequences. Amendments were proposed to strike specific sections and maintain the status quo until further review.

---

#### **5. Amendments and Other Bills**
- **House Bill 271 (Licensed Social Worker Assistants)**: An amendment replaced the requirement for a national proctored exam with a uniform competence assessment approved by the New Hampshire Board of Mental Health Practice. The amendment was approved to reduce burdens while ensuring standards.

- **House Bill 145 (Criminal Background Checks for Dieticians)**: The subcommittee debated the effective date of the bill and proposed amendments to clarify language around criminal history record checks, ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements.

- **House Bill 278 (Proxy Carbon Pricing in State Procurement)**: The bill proposed incorporating proxy carbon pricing into state procurement decisions. It failed 11-5, with concerns about speculative costs and delegating legislative authority to foreign entities.

#### **6. Financial and Policy Implications**
Throughout the meeting, the committee debated the financial and policy implications of the bills, focusing on:
- **Fairness**: Ensuring equitable treatment of retirees, state employees, and taxpayers.
- **Recruitment and Retention**: Balancing cost-saving measures with the need to attract and retain skilled state employees.
- **Specialized Services**: Protecting critical services for vulnerable populations, such as the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.
- **Streamlining Processes**: Modernizing language and reducing administrative burdens while maintaining accountability and compliance.

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee's efforts to address inefficiencies, modernize state operations, and ensure fairness in policy decisions. While some bills, like HB 780 and HB 271, received broad support, others, such as HB 525 and HB 278, faced significant opposition or failed to pass. The committee emphasized the importance of balancing fiscal responsibility with the needs of state employees, retirees, and vulnerable populations. The bills will move forward to the full House for further consideration, with amendments and recommendations reflecting the committee's deliberations.
