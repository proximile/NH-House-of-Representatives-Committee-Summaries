**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on February 5, 2025**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on February 5, 2025, to discuss several key bills and issues, focusing on dedicated funds, property tax exemptions, local control over gaming, nonprofit status eligibility, and property tax assessments for charitable gaming facilities. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **HB 650: Dedicated Funds Cleanup**
The committee addressed **HB 650**, which aims to streamline administrative processes related to dedicated state funds. The bill removes references to repealed funds, separates state park funds into distinct accounts (e.g., Cannon Mountain ski area vs. general parks), and modifies the robotics education fund by capping it at $1 million, with excess funds reverting to the general fund. Representative Dan Maguire, chair of the Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds, explained the bill’s intent, and the committee unanimously voted (16-0) to recommend it for passage, moving it to the consent calendar.

### **HB 585: Property Tax Exemption for Religious Organizations**
**HB 585** seeks to exempt small churches and religious organizations from property taxes on parsonages and worship buildings, even if rented out, provided the income is used for religious purposes, pastor salaries, or church maintenance. Representative John Janigian shared a personal example of his church being taxed on a vacant parsonage, highlighting the financial burden on small congregations. Former Representative Betty Gay supported the bill, criticizing strict interpretations by assessors that taxed church properties, including wetlands and trees. Opposition came from Brad Dees of the Municipal Association, who raised concerns about expanding tax exemptions, vague statutory language, and potential conflicts with existing laws. The committee debated definitions of "regularly recognized" religious organizations, fiscal impacts, and the potential for abuse, leaving the bill under consideration pending further review.

### **HB 737: Local Control Over Games of Chance**
The committee discussed **HB 737**, which grants municipalities the authority to decide whether to allow games of chance, such as casinos, within their boundaries. The bill is not a gambling bill but a local zoning option, modeled after existing provisions for other forms of gaming. Key debates centered on **opt-in** (municipalities must vote to allow casinos) versus **opt-out** (casinos are allowed unless municipalities vote to prohibit them). The bill grandfathers existing casinos and those in the pipeline, protecting investments by current operators. Testimony highlighted concerns about the economic and social impacts of casinos, including addiction and community character, as well as the significant revenue generated for local charities (35% of proceeds). The bill enjoys bipartisan support, emphasizing local control as a community rights issue.

### **HB 635: Nonprofit Status and Support for Illegal Immigrants**
**HB 635** proposes revoking nonprofit status for organizations that assist illegal immigrants. Representative Corkran, the bill’s sponsor, argued that nonprofit status is a privilege, not a right, and should not be extended to organizations profiting from government grants to settle illegal immigrants. Opponents raised concerns about the bill’s constitutionality, potential racial discrimination, and the practicality of verifying immigration status. The sponsor suggested using the federal E-Verify system, while opponents emphasized the humanitarian work of nonprofits and the positive contributions of refugees to New Hampshire. The committee remained divided, with some members advocating for refining the bill’s language and others recommending it be deemed inexpedient to legislate (ITL). A work session was scheduled for further discussion.

### **Property Tax Assessments and Charitable Gaming Facilities**
The committee also debated property tax assessments and a proposed "Enterprise Tax" on charitable gaming facilities, particularly casinos. The Board of Tax and Land Appeals clarified that only property actively used for charitable or religious purposes is exempt from assessment, while other property on the same lot is taxable. Concerns were raised about the fairness of the proposed tax, which would be assessed at twice the property value of facilities with 100 or more gaming machines. Representatives from the charitable gaming industry opposed the bill, arguing that it unfairly targets their sector and that existing tax structures are sufficient. The Department of Revenue emphasized the need for clarity in the bill’s language, particularly regarding the definition of "assessed property value" and the mechanism for opting in or out of the tax. Historical context was provided, noting past legislative efforts to introduce full-scale casinos and associated tax structures, which were consistently rejected.

1. **Administrative Efficiency**: **HB 650** focuses on cleaning up administrative processes related to dedicated funds, earning unanimous support.
2. **Tax Exemptions and Religious Organizations**: **HB 585** highlights the financial struggles of small congregations and the need for clarity in tax laws, though concerns about expanding exemptions remain.
3. **Local Control Over Gaming**: **HB 737** emphasizes the importance of local decision-making on casinos, balancing economic benefits with community concerns.
4. **Nonprofit Status and Immigration**: **HB 635** sparks debate over the role of nonprofits in supporting immigrants, with significant disagreement over its intent and potential impact.
5. **Property Tax Assessments**: Discussions on taxing charitable gaming facilities raise questions about fairness, constitutionality, and the need for clear statutory language.

The meeting concluded with several bills advancing for further review, while others remain under consideration pending additional amendments and discussions. The committee emphasized the need for clarity, fairness, and careful consideration of the broader implications of each proposal.
