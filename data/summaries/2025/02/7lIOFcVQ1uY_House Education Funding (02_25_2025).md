The New Hampshire House of Representatives held multiple meetings focused on education funding, addressing a range of complex issues including fiscal capacity disparities, special education funding, the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT), and budgetary reforms. The discussions highlighted the challenges of ensuring equitable funding across diverse school districts while balancing fiscal responsibility. Key themes and proposals from these meetings are summarized below:

---

### **Fiscal Capacity and Equity Concerns**
1. **Fiscal Capacity Disparity Aid**: Representatives debated the impact of fiscal capacity disparity aid on towns, noting significant funding increases or decreases for certain municipalities. Concerns were raised about equity, particularly for towns with lower per-pupil spending, such as Manchester and Pittsfield, compared to wealthier towns like Newcastle. The committee emphasized the need to address these disparities before implementing measures like budget caps.

2. **Budget Caps and Restrictions**: A proposed amendment to HB 675 aimed to cap annual school district budget growth, limiting increases to a certain percentage unless overridden by a two-thirds majority vote. Critics argued that this would lock in existing inequities, as struggling districts would struggle to secure the votes needed to exceed the cap, perpetuating funding disparities.

### **Special Education Funding**
1. **Increased Funding Proposals**: The committee reviewed several bills (e.g., HB 717, 742, 773, 603) aimed at increasing special education funding. Proposals included raising the per-pupil allocation and adjusting the catastrophic aid threshold (e.g., reducing the multiplier from 3.5x to 3x). However, concerns were raised about the lack of data on students in the 2.5x to 3.5x cost range, making it difficult to project the financial impact.

2. **Proration Issues**: The committee discussed the proration of special education aid, where districts receive less than the full amount due to budget shortfalls. Proposals were made to address this by drawing funds directly from the Education Trust Fund or adjusting the state's share of funding. There was also debate about the risks of open warrants, which could lead to unpredictable budget overruns.

3. **Timing of Funding Increases**: Due to timing issues with the Department of Education, a proposed $28 million increase in differentiated aid for special education would likely take effect in FY 2027.

### **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)**
1. **Excess SWEPT Funds**: The committee debated the timing of calculating and remitting excess SWEPT funds to the state, with concerns raised about the alignment of tax rate setting and excess amount determination. Bills like HB 739 and 734 addressed the collection and redistribution of excess SWEPT funds, with proposals to redirect excess funds to the Education Trust Fund rather than donor towns. There was a call for clarity in defining "excess" funds to avoid future legal disputes.

2. **Reform Proposals**: HB 527 proposed replacing SWEPT with a local revenue contribution, but the committee recommended further study (ITL) due to concerns about transparency and the potential impact on towns. HB 734, which combines SWEPT reform with a low and moderate-income property tax relief program, was retained for further consideration.

### **Reallocation of Grants and Funds**
1. **Extraordinary Needs Grant**: The committee discussed reallocating the $184 million Extraordinary Needs Grant and $50 million in hold harmless funds. Suggestions included shifting to a fiscal capacity disparity model and creating a separate grant for low-income students based on free and reduced lunch (FRL) data.

2. **Community College and University Ethics**: HB 510, which deals with ethics codes for higher education institutions, was retained for further study due to the complexity of the issue and the need for more information.

### **Legislative Process and Next Steps**
1. **Amendments and Retentions**: Several bills were retained for further discussion and amendment, including HB 563, HB 773, and HB 734. The committee planned to form small groups to draft amendments and finalize recommendations by March 4.

2. **Data Collection**: A recurring theme was the need for better data on special education costs and student counts to inform funding decisions. Proposals were made to incentivize districts to collect and submit this data, though challenges were acknowledged in tracking costs at the individual student level.

3. **Collaboration and Deadlines**: The committee emphasized the importance of collaboration to finalize proposals and reminded members of upcoming deadlines for amendments and reports.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the complexities of education funding in New Hampshire, with a focus on balancing fiscal responsibility, equity, and the needs of diverse school districts. Key priorities included addressing fiscal capacity disparities, increasing special education funding, refining SWEPT mechanisms, and ensuring data-driven decision-making. The committee planned to continue working on amendments and proposals to create a more equitable and sustainable education funding system.
