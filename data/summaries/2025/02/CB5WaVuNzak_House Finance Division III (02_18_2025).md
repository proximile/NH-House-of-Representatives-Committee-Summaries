**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting on February 18, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 18, 2025, addressed a wide range of budgetary, legislative, and operational issues, primarily focusing on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Medicaid, education, and healthcare services. The meeting was divided into three main segments, each covering distinct topics but interconnected through their focus on fiscal responsibility, federal funding, and legislative clarity.

---

### **1. Medicaid, Healthcare Services, and Education**

The first segment centered on Medicaid and healthcare services, with significant discussions on budgetary and legislative issues:

- **Medicaid and Healthcare Services**:
  - **House Bill 191 (2011)**: The bill, repeatedly extended, was discussed for its impact on community mental health centers, increasing expenses. Its effective date has been extended multiple times.
  - **Graduate Medical Education and Catastrophic Aid Payments**: Both programs were suspended, requiring additional General Funds if reinstated.
  - **Medicaid to Schools Program**: This cost-neutral program allows state matching of costs incurred by local education organizations. There was debate on whether additional funds should go through the fiscal committee for transparency.
  - **Pharmacy Reimbursement**: A proposal to allow the purchase of brand-name drugs in Medicaid was discussed, which could increase rebate revenue and result in net savings despite higher upfront costs.

- **Education and Special Services**:
  - **Special Education and Medicaid**: Emphasis was placed on ensuring timely payments for services provided to special education students under Medicaid.
  - **Pilot Program for DD Services**: A $2.8 million pilot program for individuals not qualifying under the waiver was discussed, with funds carried forward to continue services for those aging out of the program.

- **Legislative and Budgetary Cleanup**:
  - **Unclassified Positions**: Technical cleanup of language regarding unclassified positions within DHHS.
  - **County Cap on Medicaid Payments**: Adjustments to the county contribution cap for Medicaid payments, reflecting a 2% maximum increase allowable under statute.

- **Training and Health Equity**:
  - **Health Equity Training**: Concerns were raised about an outdated document on the UNH website referencing DHHS’s Office of Health Equity. DHHS committed to ensuring all training listings are up-to-date.

### **2. DHHS Budget Complexity and Operational Updates**

The second segment focused on the complexities of the DHHS budget and operational updates:

- **Budget Complexity and Integration**: DHHS emphasized the complexity of its budget, which includes over 100 federal funding sources. Careful cost allocation is required to maximize federal funds while minimizing general fund usage.
  
- **Staffing and Personnel Costs**: The department highlighted that 394 positions were unfunded in the governor’s budget, leading to a reduction in personnel costs. The use of contracted staff was noted as more expensive than retaining state employees.

- **Medicaid and Federal Funds**: Medicaid constitutes a significant portion of the budget, with federal matching funds varying by program. The department stressed the importance of maintaining maintenance of effort to avoid penalties or reduced federal funding.

- **Opioid Abatement Trust Fund**: A provision in the budget directs $5 million annually from the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund to support emergency shelter services for individuals with opioid use disorders.

- **Hamstead Hospital Transition**: The state transitioned the operation of Hamstead Hospital to Dartmouth, resulting in cost savings and a net positive financial impact for the state.

- **Legislative Provisions**: The meeting reviewed several recurring legislative items in the budget, including provisions related to fund transfers and eligibility criteria. There was discussion about codifying some of these recurring items into permanent law to avoid repeated legislative action.

### **3. House Bill 71 (HP71) and DHHS Budget Overview**

The third segment focused on **House Bill 71 (HP71)** and an overview of the DHHS budget:

- **House Bill 71 (HP71) Discussion**:
  - **Amendment Concerns**: The committee discussed an amendment previously tied to **Bill 519**, now proposed for **HP71**. The amendment requires contractors to comply with the Patient Bill of Rights (RSA 151:21) and sets a repeal date for the requirement (November 30, 2026). There was confusion over whether the amendment could be discussed and voted on without a new public hearing. The committee decided to schedule a **non-germane amendment hearing** with the full Finance Committee before proceeding.
  - **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal note for HP71 raised concerns about potential federal funding losses ($12-18 million annually) due to conflicts with federal law, particularly regarding sheltering refugees and immigrants. The definition of "specified alien" in the bill was unclear, leading to interpretations that could include legally present non-citizens, potentially violating federal funding requirements.
  - **Next Steps**: The committee decided to **retain HP71** until after the non-germane amendment hearing and scheduled another work session to discuss the bill and its amendment further.

- **DHHS Budget Overview**:
  - **Commissioner's Absence**: The DHHS commissioner was absent, so Deputy Commissioner Marissa Hen and CFO Nathan White presented the budget overview, including aggregate analyses of the governor’s budget proposal and prioritized funding requests.
  - **Budget Details**: The committee planned to delve into specific budget details, including operations, finance, legal, HR, and facilities, in a subsequent session.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**

- **Process and Transparency**: The committee emphasized the need for proper public hearings and transparency in discussing amendments and fiscal impacts.
- **Fiscal Concerns**: Members expressed concerns about potential federal funding losses and the need for clarity in legislative language to avoid conflicts with federal law.
- **Future Discussions**: The committee scheduled additional hearings and work sessions to address unresolved issues related to HP71, the DHHS budget, and other topics like the Capital Budget and Medicaid expense modular strategy.

The meeting concluded with plans for further discussions and follow-ups on specific issues, particularly around Medicaid, training programs, and legislative amendments. The focus remained on careful deliberation, fiscal responsibility, and maximizing federal funding opportunities.
