The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on February 5, 2025, to discuss several key bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 392**, **House Bill 724**, **House Bill 756**, **House Bill 751**, and **House Bill 576**. The meeting highlighted deep ideological divides, particularly around equity, environmental justice, and public health, while also addressing substance abuse treatment, lead poisoning prevention, and medical cannabis access. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **House Bill 392: Dissolution of Offices and Divisions**
**HB 392** proposes to dissolve several state offices and divisions, including the Office of Health Equity and the Governor’s Council on Diversity and Inclusion. Prime sponsor **Representative Mike Belcher** argued these programs are unconstitutional, promote discrimination based on identity characteristics, and advance Marxist-inspired concepts like equity and social justice. He claimed they have withheld medical resources based on race, endangered the electrical grid, and risked federal funding losses.

**Key Points**:
- **Supporters**: Argued the bill corrects perceived overreach in equity programs and aligns with federal executive orders targeting DEI initiatives.
- **Opponents**: Testified that the Office of Health Equity ensures compliance with federal laws like the Civil Rights Act and ADA, providing critical services for refugees, individuals with disabilities, and non-English speakers. Dissolving it could lead to lawsuits, financial penalties, and increased healthcare costs.
- **DES Concerns**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) warned the bill could jeopardize $80–$90 million in federal funding by undermining compliance with civil rights and environmental justice mandates.
- **Public Testimony**: Advocacy groups, nonprofits, and medical professionals opposed the bill, emphasizing its potential harm to vulnerable populations and essential services like refugee resettlement and mental health support.

### **House Bill 724 and House Bill 756: Lead Poisoning Prevention**
**HB 724** and **HB 756** address lead poisoning in children, a growing crisis in New Hampshire, with 1,142 children affected in 2023. **HB 724** focuses on lead hazards in housing, proposing no-cost solutions like requiring EPA RRP licenses for renovations, restoring DHHS inspection authority, and establishing a rebuttable presumption of lead in pre-1978 housing. **HB 756** mandates blood lead level testing for children aged six or upon school entry.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Advocates, including AARP and the Conservation Law Foundation, highlighted the economic and societal benefits of prevention, estimating a $17 return for every $1 spent on abatement.
- **Opposition**: Housing providers expressed concerns about the financial burden of lead abatement and the feasibility of inspecting entire buildings.
- **Testimonies**: Parents and public health professionals shared personal stories of lead poisoning’s irreversible impacts, emphasizing the need for universal testing and primary prevention.
- **Debate**: Representatives discussed the inclusion of private schools and the need for better nutrition and awareness of lead exposure sources beyond housing.

### **House Bill 751: Substance Abuse Treatment Oversight**
**HB 751** aims to improve oversight and licensing for outpatient substance abuse treatment programs. Testimonies highlighted the lack of state oversight, leading to substandard care, abuse, and exploitation of patients.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Stakeholders, including New Futures and healthcare providers, emphasized the bill’s potential to ensure quality care, patient protections, and accountability.
- **Patient Stories**: Personal testimonies included tragic accounts of inadequate treatment and misconduct in unregulated facilities.
- **Licensing and Oversight**: The bill proposes licensing outpatient providers and creating a behavioral health specialist position in the Ombudsman’s office to address complaints.
- **Public Health Impact**: Speakers stressed the societal costs of untreated addiction, including increased crime and overdose deaths.

### **House Bill 576: ALS Registry**
**HB 576** proposed creating a registry for ALS cases in New Hampshire, which has higher-than-average ALS rates. However, concerns about the bill’s fiscal note led to its defeat.

**Key Points**:
- **Concerns**: Representatives deemed the fiscal note unrealistic and excessively high compared to similar efforts in other states.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Some suggested leveraging existing systems or collaborating with medical institutions like Dartmouth for data collection.
- **Outcome**: The bill was voted **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)** with a 15-2 vote, effectively killing it for the session.

### **Other Bills**
- **HB 51**: Passed unanimously, improving definitions and expanding access to therapeutic cannabis products.
- **HB 53**: Passed as amended, allowing medical cannabis patients to grow their own cannabis to address access, cost, and safety concerns.
- **HB 126**: Passed unanimously, enabling patients on long-term medications to receive three-month prescriptions after a year of monthly refills.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Equity and Inclusion**: Deep divisions emerged over the role of equity initiatives, with supporters of **HB 392** framing them as discriminatory and opponents emphasizing their importance for vulnerable populations.
2. **Public Health**: Lead poisoning prevention and substance abuse treatment oversight were central, with a focus on protecting children and individuals with addiction.
3. **Federal Compliance**: Many bills raised concerns about losing federal funding or violating federal laws, particularly civil rights and environmental justice mandates.
4. **Cost and Implementation**: Fiscal impact and feasibility were recurring concerns, influencing decisions on bills like **HB 576** and **HB 724**.

### **Outcome**
The committee closed public hearings on several bills, with further discussions and potential amendments expected. The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing public health crises while balancing fiscal responsibility and federal compliance.
