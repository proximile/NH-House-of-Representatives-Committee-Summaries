The New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee meeting on February 12, 2025, addressed a wide range of legislative proposals, focusing on domestic violence protections, digital rights, civil asset forfeiture, constitutional remedies, and animal welfare. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Domestic Violence and Wiretapping (House Bill 587)**
The committee discussed **House Bill 587**, which proposes an exemption to New Hampshire’s wiretapping law to allow victims of domestic violence to record their abusers without consent for use as evidence in legal proceedings. Currently, recording someone without consent is a felony in NH. Advocates emphasized the importance of enabling victims to gather evidence without fear of legal repercussions. However, concerns were raised about the bill’s broad language, which could apply to any crime, not just domestic violence. Law enforcement officials supported the bill, noting the complexity of domestic violence cases and the need for tools to aid investigations. The discussion also touched on whether the exception should be limited to violent crimes or apply more broadly.

### **Digital Rights and Constitutional Amendment (CACR 6)**
**CACR 6**, a proposed constitutional amendment recognizing the right to compute as a fundamental right, was introduced by Representative Keith Ammon. The amendment aims to protect individuals from government or corporate restrictions on computational resources, drawing parallels to fundamental rights like freedom of speech and the Second Amendment. Concerns were raised about its potential impact on encryption, security, child protection laws, and energy resources. Supporters, including Sarah Scott from Americans for Prosperity, argued that the amendment is essential for protecting innovation and individual autonomy in the digital age. The committee sought further clarity on specific language and potential amendments.

### **Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform (House Bill 615)**
**House Bill 615** seeks to reform civil asset forfeiture laws, particularly in drug-related cases, by integrating forfeiture proceedings into criminal cases and requiring a criminal conviction before property can be forfeited. The bill aims to protect innocent owners, shift the burden of proof to the state, and set minimum values for forfeiture ($1,000 for cash, $5,000 for vehicles). Law enforcement officials, including Lieutenant Derek Catalo, expressed concerns that the bill would hinder their ability to prosecute drug traffickers, particularly in cases where cash is found near drugs but not directly linked to sales. The bill was presented as a compromise between protecting property rights and maintaining law enforcement’s ability to combat drug trafficking.

### **Constitutional Remedies (House Bill 614)**
**House Bill 614** addresses the lack of remedies for past violations of state constitutional rights, proposing nominal damages, declaratory relief, or equitable relief. Proponents argued that the bill aligns with the state constitution and common law, ensuring that constitutional rights are meaningful. Opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, warned that the bill is vague and could lead to excessive litigation, increasing legal costs for municipalities. The committee discussed past judicial precedents and the potential impact of the bill but did not take immediate action.

### **Animal Welfare and Loss of Consortium (House Bill 593)**
**House Bill 593** aimed to expand the legal concept of "loss of consortium" to include pets, allowing owners to seek damages for emotional distress caused by the loss of a pet. Opponents, including Nancy Holmes and Angela Ferrari, argued that the bill would blur legal distinctions between pets and humans, potentially leading to unintended consequences and increased costs. Supporters, like Shauna Silver, emphasized the emotional bond between owners and pets and shared personal experiences of wrongful pet loss. The committee voted **11-0** to recommend the bill as **inexpedient to legislate**, effectively rejecting it.

### **Privacy and Surveillance (House Bill 462)**
**House Bill 462** was introduced in response to complaints about neighbors installing cameras pointed at backyards, creating a private right of action for individuals who feel their privacy is violated. The bill specifically targets video imaging devices monitoring areas with a reasonable expectation of privacy. Committee members raised concerns about the bill’s scope, including its applicability to drones, and did not take immediate action.

### **Other Bills**
- **House Bill 509**: Focused on improving transparency in asset forfeiture reporting, requiring detailed data on seized assets and related offenses. Advocates argued that better data is needed to ensure accountability.
- **House Bill 485**: Allowed lottery winners to remain anonymous, passed with minimal opposition.
- **House Bill 601**: Addressed legal actions against companies misrepresenting their environmental impact.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Victim Protections**: Bills like HB 587 and HB 615 aimed to strengthen legal protections for victims of domestic violence and innocent property owners, though concerns about implementation and unintended consequences were raised.
2. **Digital Rights**: CACR 6 highlighted the evolving importance of digital rights, with discussions balancing innovation, security, and constitutional protections.
3. **Constitutional Remedies**: HB 614 sought to address a gap in New Hampshire law by providing remedies for past constitutional violations, though opponents warned of potential litigation risks.
4. **Animal Welfare**: HB 593 sparked debate over the legal status of pets, with the committee ultimately rejecting the expansion of loss of consortium claims.
5. **Privacy**: HB 462 addressed privacy concerns related to surveillance, though questions about scope and language remained unresolved.

The meeting concluded with the committee voting to reject HB 593 and continuing discussions on other significant bills, emphasizing the need for clarity and balance in addressing complex legal and societal issues.
