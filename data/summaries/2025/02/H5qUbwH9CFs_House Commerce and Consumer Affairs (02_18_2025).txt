The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 18, 2025, to discuss a range of legislative proposals and amendments, with a significant focus on the Tavern License Amendment, digital asset mining, and other key issues. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

### **Tavern License Amendment**
The proposed Tavern License Amendment sparked extensive debate, centering on the following key points:
1. **Local Control**: The amendment would require towns to vote affirmatively to allow tavern license applications before they can be submitted, ensuring local control over whether taverns can operate in their communities. The default would be no taverns unless a town votes to permit them.
2. **Liquor Commission Oversight**: The New Hampshire Liquor Commission would review applications, verifying town approval and ensuring all necessary application requirements are met.
3. **Public Safety Concerns**: Representatives raised concerns about the potential for increased crime, drunk driving, and strain on local law enforcement. Some argued that taverns without food requirements could lead to irresponsible drinking and disorderly conduct, particularly if they operate late at night.
4. **Economic Impact**: There was debate about whether taverns would help revitalize small towns or harm existing businesses by diverting profitable alcohol sales from restaurants.
5. **Higher Licensing Fees**: To address enforcement costs, a significantly higher licensing fee of $6,400 was proposed—five times the current highest fee for liquor licenses. Some argued this fee might still be insufficient to cover the potential burden on local law enforcement.
6. **Food Requirements**: Some representatives emphasized the importance of requiring food service to promote responsible alcohol consumption, arguing that taverns without food could exacerbate irresponsible behavior.
7. **Enforcement and Liability**: Concerns were raised about the burden on local law enforcement and the potential for increased incidents like fights or drunk driving.

### **Digital Asset Mining Legislation**
The committee also discussed amendments to a bill related to digital asset mining (e.g., cryptocurrency), focusing on the following:
1. **Key Changes**: Language about private keys and home digital asset mining was removed, and the bill was clarified to focus on blockchain technology broadly, not just Bitcoin.
2. **Noise Limits**: State or local governments would be prohibited from setting specific noise limits for digital asset mining unless consistent with existing local ordinances.
3. **Electricity Rates**: The bill ensures non-discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses, preventing unfair pricing practices.
4. **Broader Applications**: The discussion highlighted the potential applications of blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrency, emphasizing the need for forward-looking legislation.

### **Gold Standard and Treasury Valuation**
A representative raised concerns about the valuation of gold held by the U.S. Treasury, noting that its statutory value ($422/ounce) is significantly lower than its market value (~$2,900/ounce). The discussion included historical context, such as FDR’s policies, and explored the implications for state investments in gold.

### **Paint Recycling Program**
The committee reviewed a bill related to paint recycling, making the following changes:
1. **Fee Assessment**: Language about specific fee assessments was removed, shifting the focus to allowing paint manufacturers to manage recycling costs as a business expense.
2. **Oversight**: The Department of Environmental Services would oversee the program to ensure proper implementation and compliance.

### **Overall Themes**
Throughout the meeting, representatives emphasized the importance of:
- **Local Control**: Ensuring towns and communities have the authority to make decisions that directly impact them.
- **Public Safety**: Addressing potential risks associated with new legislation, particularly in areas like alcohol regulation and digital asset mining.
- **Economic Impact**: Weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks of proposed measures on local businesses and economies.
- **Regulatory Clarity**: Providing clear guidelines and oversight to prevent future issues and ensure alignment with state statutes.

The meeting concluded with lively debates on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed amendments, highlighting the committee’s commitment to proactive and thoughtful legislation.
