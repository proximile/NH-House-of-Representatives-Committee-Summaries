**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting on February 3, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III convened on February 3, 2025, to discuss various aspects of the state’s Medicaid and Medicare programs. The meeting provided a detailed overview of Medicaid’s role in supporting vulnerable populations, explored eligibility and enrollment processes, and addressed financial mechanisms, program management, and cost containment strategies. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all segments of the meeting:

---

### **1. Overview of Medicaid in New Hampshire**
Medicaid is a critical public health program that provides coverage to low-income individuals, pregnant women, children, and people with disabilities. New Hampshire’s Medicaid program is the fourth smallest in the country, covering approximately 184,000 residents. The program operates as a federal-state partnership, with shared funding and flexibility for states to determine eligibility and service coverage. Key programs include Granite Advantage, Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS), and Choices for Independence, each tailored to specific populations.

---

### **2. Eligibility and Enrollment**
Eligibility criteria vary by group, with recent policy changes such as extending postpartum care from 60 days to 12 months to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. New Hampshire ranks 5th in children’s health coverage but 34th for pregnant women, reflecting a lower percentage of pregnant women covered by Medicaid compared to other states. Household eligibility was clarified, with pregnant women counted as one household member until the baby is born, after which the household size increases.

---

### **3. Medicaid Expansion and Granite Advantage**
The Granite Advantage Program, part of Medicaid expansion, provides coverage to low-income adults and is federally funded at 90%. A state law provision terminates the program if federal funding drops below 90%. The program has positively impacted individuals and the state’s insurance market.

---

### **4. Medicaid in Schools**
Medicaid funds services tied to Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) or equivalent plans for students with disabilities, including mental health counseling, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and nursing care. These services require parental consent and are strictly educational and health-related. Most New Hampshire school districts (172 out of 178) participate in the program, though smaller districts may opt out due to administrative costs. The federal government reimburses 50% of costs, and the state is transitioning to a new cost-reporting methodology.

---

### **5. Financial Mechanisms and Budgeting**
Medicaid budgeting is based on actuarial estimates, eligible populations, and service utilization. The state has limited control over final expenditures but works within appropriations using managed care contracts. Pharmaceuticals account for 31% of Medicaid spending, with costs doubling over the past decade. New measures to control spending include comprehensive medication reviews, a common formulary, and shared-risk arrangements for high-cost medications like gene therapies.

---

### **6. Managed Care and Long-Term Services**
Medicaid enrollees are primarily served by three Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), with a small number receiving fee-for-service care. There was debate about moving long-term services and supports (e.g., nursing home care, home-based services) under managed care contracts, with concerns raised about potential impacts on counties and providers. Provider taxes, such as the Medicaid Enhancement Tax, are used to generate additional federal funding.

---

### **7. Waivers and Flexibility**
New Hampshire utilizes various Medicaid waivers, including 1915(c) waivers, to provide additional services and flexibility, particularly for populations with developmental disabilities. These waivers allow for cost savings and tailored service delivery.

---

### **8. Legislative and Federal Considerations**
Potential changes to Medicaid funding, such as reduced federal match rates and block grant proposals, were discussed. Legislative support may be needed to adjust eligibility standards, work requirements, and pharmaceutical pricing flexibility. The state is monitoring federal developments, including disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding and potential changes to Medicaid expansion.

---

### **9. Future Discussions**
The committee plans to explore Medicaid waivers, UNH contracts, developmental services, and nursing facility financing in upcoming meetings. The department committed to keeping the committee informed of significant federal or state Medicaid changes.

---

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
- **Vulnerable Populations**: Medicaid plays a vital role in supporting low-income individuals, children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, though gaps in coverage for pregnant women remain a concern.
- **Financial Management**: The state is focused on cost containment, particularly in pharmaceutical spending, while leveraging federal funding and provider taxes to sustain the program.
- **Program Flexibility**: Waivers and managed care contracts allow New Hampshire to tailor services to meet the needs of specific populations.
- **Legislative Collaboration**: Ongoing legislative support and federal coordination are essential to address challenges such as rising costs, eligibility adjustments, and potential changes to Medicaid funding.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexities of Medicaid administration and the importance of optimizing the program to ensure equitable access to healthcare for New Hampshire’s most vulnerable residents.
