**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (February 3, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III convened on February 3, 2025, for an in-depth discussion on Medicaid and Medicare programs, with a focus on eligibility, financing, and the broader impact on healthcare and education in the state. The meeting was divided into four segments, each addressing specific aspects of the Medicaid program, its challenges, and future considerations.

### **Medicaid Program Overview and Historical Context**
The session began with an overview of the Medicaid program, emphasizing its critical role in providing healthcare to vulnerable populations, including low-income individuals, pregnant women, children, and people with disabilities. Medicaid is a federal-state partnership, allowing states some flexibility in coverage and eligibility. New Hampshire's Medicaid program is one of the smallest in the U.S., covering approximately 184,000 residents. The state expanded postpartum care from 60 days to 12 months in 2023, and data on utilization and costs are being tracked.

Historically, the Medicaid program has evolved significantly since its inception in 1965, with key milestones such as the Olmstead decision (promoting care in the least restrictive environment) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2008. New Hampshire ranks high in children's Medicaid eligibility (5th in the nation) but lower for pregnant women (34th). The state has a strong focus on children's health, rooted in the New Hampshire Healthy Kids Corporation.

### **Eligibility, Enrollment, and Program Integrity**
Eligibility for Medicaid in New Hampshire varies based on income, age, and household size. The Granite Advantage Program, which covers low-income adults, has seen increased enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This program is federally funded at 90%, with a state law trigger that could terminate the program if federal funding drops below 90%. Ensuring that only eligible individuals receive Medicaid benefits is a priority, with ongoing efforts to improve eligibility verification processes.

The COVID-19 public health emergency led to continuous Medicaid enrollment, which has since unwound, resulting in a decrease in enrollment numbers. The state is also exploring programs aimed at helping individuals transition off Medicaid, such as the 1115 waiver for community re-entry.

### **Managed Care, Pharmaceutical Costs, and Federal Funding**
Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) play a significant role in managing Medicaid services, particularly in long-term care and support services. There was a debate about whether certain long-term services should be included in MCO contracts, with concerns about cost control and quality of care.

Pharmaceutical costs within Medicaid were a major focus, accounting for 31% of the program's medical spend. The state has implemented measures such as comprehensive medication reviews and a common formulary to control costs and reduce waste.

Potential federal changes to Medicaid funding, such as reductions in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and the possibility of block grants, were discussed. The state is preparing for potential impacts from federal legislative changes, including work requirements and eligibility adjustments.

### **Medicaid Expansion, Schools, and Federal Matching Funds**
Medicaid expansion in New Hampshire, particularly through the Granite Advantage Program and the 1332 waiver, has been crucial in stabilizing the insurance market. The state has one of the lowest ACA benchmark premiums in the country, and terminating Medicaid expansion could negatively impact the state's insurance market and healthcare costs.

A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to Medicaid's role in funding healthcare services provided in schools, particularly for students with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) or 504 plans. These services include occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, and other medically necessary supports. The program reimburses schools for 50% of the costs of these services, easing the financial burden on local school districts.

The discussion also covered federal matching funds, with New Hampshire receiving a 50% match due to its higher per capita income compared to other states. The state is exploring ways to maximize federal funding, such as through directed payments and rate adjustments.

### **Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Program and Public Misconceptions**
The DSH program, which compensates hospitals for uncompensated care, was also discussed. The state is considering ways to optimize federal matching funds for this program, balancing traditional DSH payments with other mechanisms that can draw higher federal matches.

Legislators expressed concerns about public misconceptions regarding Medicaid in schools, particularly fears that schools are setting up clinics or providing services without parental consent. It was clarified that Medicaid only covers services that are part of a student's education plan and that parental consent is required for billing.

### **Future Considerations and Scheduling**
The committee plans to continue discussions on Medicaid, including specific topics like UNH contracts, developmental services, and elderly and adult services. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for the following Monday.

The meeting concluded with a brief discussion on scheduling and logistics, with the group agreeing on a 1:00 PM start time for the next session and penciling in an overflow date as a backup. The chair acknowledged the preparation involved, particularly for a newly created slide deck, and expressed gratitude for the effort.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, the meeting provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges and strategies related to managing Medicaid in New Hampshire, with a focus on cost control, service quality, and legislative changes. The importance of Medicaid in supporting healthcare and education in the state was underscored, along with the need for continued collaboration between state and federal partners to optimize healthcare delivery.
