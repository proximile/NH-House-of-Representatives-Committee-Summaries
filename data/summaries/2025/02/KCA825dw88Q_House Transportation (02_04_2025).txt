**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting – House Transportation (February 4, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 4, 2025, to discuss and debate a range of transportation-related bills. The meeting featured detailed discussions on legislative proposals, public testimony, and procedural updates, covering topics such as traffic enforcement, vehicle safety, license suspensions, and logistical planning. Below is a cohesive summary of the meeting’s key segments:

---

### **Legislative Discussions and Decisions**

1. **House Bill 305 (Speed and Red Light Cameras)**  
   Representative Jones introduced this bill, which proposes the use of speed and red light cameras for traffic enforcement. The bill aims to address erratic driving and police officer shortages by allowing municipalities to install and maintain these cameras, ensuring compliance with state and federal laws. Concerns were raised about enforcement, due process, and identifying drivers in multi-driver households.

2. **House Bill 368 (Prohibiting Smoking in Vehicles with Children)**  
   Representative Miller presented this bill, which seeks to prohibit smoking and e-cigarette use in motor vehicles when a child under 16 is present. The bill imposes a $100 fine and is a secondary enforcement action. The committee ultimately moved to declare it inexpedient to legislate (ITL), sending it to the regular calendar for further debate.

3. **House Bill 390 (Retired Fire Apparatus in Parades)**  
   Representative Parson introduced this bill to add retired fire trucks to antique vehicle exemptions, allowing them to be used in parades without stripping identifying features. The bill specifies that fire apparatus must be at least 20 years old to qualify, addressing a strict interpretation of current law that has hindered their use.

4. **House Bill 419 (Headlights with Windshield Wipers)**  
   Representative Jones proposed this bill, which would require headlights to be on whenever windshield wipers are active. Citing data showing reduced accidents in states with similar laws, the bill faced concerns about enforceability, particularly with intermittent or automatic wiper use.

5. **House Bill 414 (Prohibiting License Suspension for Towing Debts)**  
   Representative Ellen Reed introduced this bill to prevent the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) from suspending driver’s licenses due to unpaid debts to private towing companies. The bill addresses financial hardships faced by individuals whose vehicles are towed and stored without their consent, aiming to end this practice and reinstate affected licenses.

6. **House Bill 439 (Ending License Suspensions for Non-Driving Violations)**  
   Representative Dan Ve presented this bill to stop driver’s license suspensions for non-driving violations, such as unpaid court fines. The bill focuses on fairness, economic mobility, and ensuring traffic laws prioritize public safety over debt collection, excluding dangerous driving offenses like DUI and reckless driving.

7. **Other Notable Bills**  
   - **House Bill 260 (Bunker Hill Commemorative License Plate)**: Passed with an amendment, recommending its approval.  
   - **House Bill 612 (Temporary Traditional Licenses for Youth)**: Passed, allowing the DMV to create temporary traditional licenses for youth operators nearing age 21.  
   - **House Bill 182 (Prohibiting Electric Vehicles in Commercial Parking Garages)** and **House Bill 239 (Lane Filtering)**: Both declared ITL, moving to consent.  
   - **House Bill 209** and **House Bill 298**: Postponed due to incomplete information and lack of readiness for debate.
