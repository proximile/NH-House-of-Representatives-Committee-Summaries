**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services (02/18/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 18, 2025, for a session focused on labor, industrial, and rehabilitative services. The meeting addressed a range of bills and amendments, primarily centered on workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor practices. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**  
   - **Workers' Compensation Reforms**: The committee discussed **HB 744**, which proposed increasing the wage replacement rate for workers' compensation from 60% to 66⅔%, aligning New Hampshire with most other states. The amendment aimed to restore benefits reduced by previous legislation. While the estimated cost increase for the workers' compensation system was between 5% and 6.3%, concerns were raised about the potential impact on insurance premiums and employer costs. The amendment ultimately failed, and the bill was moved to "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).  
   - **Unemployment Benefits**: **HB 542** was debated, with an amendment introduced to increase the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $427 to $535 for individuals earning at least $52,000 annually. The amendment aimed to improve wage replacement rates for higher earners (from 26% to 35%) while ensuring the unemployment fund remained solvent, even in recessionary scenarios. Proponents argued that the fund’s current balance of $380 million could support the increase, while opponents expressed concerns about potential impacts on small businesses. The amendment failed, and the bill was voted down.

2. **Workplace Safety and Utilization**  
   - The importance of workplace safety programs in reducing workers' compensation claims was emphasized. While increased benefits were noted to correlate with longer utilization, updated analysis was deemed necessary due to changes in the economy.

3. **Economic Context**  
   - Discussions highlighted New Hampshire’s strong job market, with private sector earnings increasing and an average unemployment duration of 12 weeks—one of the lowest in the country. However, concerns were raised about the availability of high-paying white-collar jobs during a recession.

### **Other Bills and Amendments**

1. **HB 280**:  
   - An amendment to add the word "employee" to signify equal partnership between employers and employees passed 11-9. However, the bill itself was indefinitely postponed (ITL) after a motion to pass it as amended failed.

2. **HB 379**:  
   - A motion to pass the bill as amended failed 12-8, and a motion to retain it for further work also failed. The bill was ultimately ITL.

3. **HB 386**:  
   - An amendment to limit non-compete agreements for nurses to 13 weeks failed 11-9. The bill was retained for further work but later ITL.

4. **HB 487**:  
   - An amendment to narrow the bill’s scope to the hospitality industry, requiring employers to provide schedules at least five days in advance, failed 11-9. The bill was ultimately passed with a vote of 11 to 9.

5. **HB 757**:  
   - The bill aimed to clarify tip-sharing and tip-pooling practices in the restaurant industry. An amendment to provide examples of tip-sharing was criticized for adding confusion and failed. The bill was moved to ITL.

### **Key Outcomes and Considerations**

- **Balancing Worker and Employer Needs**: Throughout the session, representatives emphasized the importance of balancing the needs of workers and businesses. Discussions frequently touched on the potential financial impacts of benefit increases on employers, particularly small businesses, and the need to ensure fiscal responsibility.  
- **Economic Scenarios**: Hypothetical recession scenarios were used to assess the potential impacts of amendments on unemployment funds and employer tax rates. While no recession was forecasted, stress tests informed decisions about the feasibility of proposed changes.  
- **Legislative Process**: The committee followed a thorough procedural approach, with detailed discussions and voting on amendments before final votes on bills.
