Supporters cited incidents like the 2020 Manchester election and noted that 22 states already have similar laws.

- **House Bill 56**: Aimed to implement universal background checks and a 72-hour waiting period for firearm transfers. Supporters emphasized public safety and suicide prevention, while opponents argued it infringed on constitutional rights. The bill was deemed "inexpedient to legislate."
