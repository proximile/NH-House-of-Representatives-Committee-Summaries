---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 769: Base Cost of Adequate Education and SWEPT Rate Adjustment**  
   - Sponsored by Representative Linda Gold, this bill seeks to increase the base cost of providing an adequate education and adjust the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) rate from $1.12 to $2.50 per $1,000 of property value.  
   - The proposal aims to raise approximately $811 million in revenue, which would remain locally to address funding shortfalls.  
   - Testimonies, including from Newport School District Superintendent Donna Magon, highlighted the struggles of districts with staffing shortages, increased student needs (e.g., IEPs, ELLs), and the impact of underfunding on teacher retention and graduation rates.  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential increase in local property tax burdens, as the bill does not redistribute funds but relies on local revenue.

2. **HB 773: Special Education Funding**  
   - This bill addresses the proration of catastrophic special education aid, ensuring districts receive at least 85% of their entitlement.  
   - Current proration rates have dropped to 67%, leaving districts financially strained and forced to borrow or cut programs.  
   - The bill aims to provide more predictable funding for special education costs, supporting students with disabilities and reducing financial instability in districts.

3. **HB 747: Gifted Student Scholarships**  
   - This bill establishes a program for enrichment scholarships for gifted and talented students, offering up to $1,000 annually for tuition, tutoring, instructional materials, and therapies.  
   - The Department of Education would administer the program, with a $1 million annual appropriation for scholarships and $75,000 for contracted services.  
   - Discussions centered on defining "giftedness," with concerns about over-reliance on IQ tests and the need for flexibility to include artistic and creative talents.  
   - Questions were raised about accessibility for students from less privileged backgrounds and whether funding should prioritize improving public schools before supporting private programs.

4. **HB 750: Incentive Grants for School Improvement**  
   - This bill proposes $50,000 grants to schools showing improvement in specific assessments, particularly in mathematics.  
   - The goal is to celebrate progress, boost morale, and share best practices statewide.  
   - Concerns were raised about the adequacy of the grant amount for larger districts and whether the program would effectively address declining test scores.

5. **HB 772: Foundation Opportunity Budget Program**  
   - This comprehensive bill seeks to reform New Hampshire’s education funding model by moving away from the current one-size-fits-all approach.  
   - It introduces a **Foundation Opportunity Budget**, which calculates funding based on student outcomes and district-specific needs, such as low-income populations and special education requirements.  
   - The bill includes mechanisms for accountability, ensuring districts meet statewide proficiency levels, and proposes an 8- to 10-year phase-in period to ease the transition.  
   - It avoids stabilization measures like hold-harmless provisions, aiming for a more equitable distribution of funds.  
   - Stakeholders, including teacher unions and education advocates, expressed support for the bill, emphasizing the need for stable and predictable funding.

6. **Other Bills**  
   - **HB 193**: Limits Dual and Concurrent Enrollment Program courses to no more than four credits.  
   - **HB 295 and HB 366**: Related to School Building Aid programs, these bills were retained for further review due to their complexity.  
   - **HB 494**: Flat-funds the Math Learning Communities Program at the current rate for the next biennium due to budget constraints.  
   - **HB 515**: Proposed repealing Charter Public School eligibility for State School Building Aid; the committee voted inexpedient to legislate.  
   - **HB 716**: Flat-funds the Dual and Concurrent Enrollment Program at the current rate due to budgetary concerns.
