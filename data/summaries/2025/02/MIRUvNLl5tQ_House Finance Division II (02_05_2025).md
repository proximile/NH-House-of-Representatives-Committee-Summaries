**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (02/05/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on February 5, 2025, focused on key aspects of state education funding, including **school building aid**, **charter school lease aid**, **school safety grants**, **nutrition programs**, **special education funding**, and **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**. The discussions highlighted the complexities of funding mechanisms, the interplay between federal and state resources, and the challenges of ensuring equitable access to programs for students across the state.

### **School Building Aid**
- **Program Overview**: Provides funding for large-scale school renovations or new constructions, excluding smaller projects like HVAC systems. Schools can adjust construction costs for inflation, but caps on allowable costs per square foot apply.
- **Funding Process**: Communities have three opportunities to pass a local vote to secure funding. If unsuccessful, funding shifts to the next project on the list. Projects remain on the list annually, eliminating the need for schools to reapply.
- **Historical Context**: A moratorium on new projects was in place from 2010 to 2017. Since then, competitive funding has been reinstated, with limited projects approved due to budget constraints.
- **Challenges**: Ongoing debt payments from pre-moratorium projects reduce available funds for new projects. Legislators discussed the inability to prepay bonds and the lapsing of unused funds back to the Education Trust Fund.

### **Charter School Lease Aid**
- **Program Overview**: Provides lease assistance to charter schools that lease their buildings, covering 30% of the annual lease payment with a cap of $50,000 per year.
- **Funding Process**: Funds are distributed annually, with no mechanism to reclaim funds if a school closes mid-year.

---

### **School Safety Grants (SAFE Grants)**
- **Program Overview**: Part of the Public School Infrastructure Fund, SAFE Grants prioritize school safety projects such as surveillance, access control, and emergency alerting.
- **Process**: Schools work with the Department of Homeland Security for security assessments and apply for funding based on identified needs. Funds are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, with reimbursements provided after costs are incurred.
- **Funding Status**: As of the meeting, there was a $9.2 million waitlist for school safety projects.

### **Nutrition Programs**
- **Programs Covered**: Includes the **National School Lunch Program**, **Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program**, **After School Snack Program**, **Child and Adult Care Food Program**, and **Summer Food Service Program**.
- **Funding**: Primarily federally funded by the USDA, with some state supplemental funds. Reimbursement rates vary by program and are tied to meal counts.
- **Summer Meals**: Challenges in ensuring children receive meals during the summer were highlighted, along with the financial burden on parents when programs are unavailable.
- **Community Eligibility Provision (CEP)**: Allows schools with high poverty rates to offer free meals to all students. The eligibility threshold was recently reduced from 40% to 25%, but concerns were raised about the financial burden on local districts.

### **Special Education Funding**
- **Formula Overview**: Embedded in RSA 186-C, the formula supports local public school districts with high-cost special education students. Costs exceeding 3.5 times the average per-pupil cost are eligible for state reimbursement. The state reimburses 80% of costs above this threshold, though proration reduces the actual reimbursement rate (e.g., 68% this year).
- **Process**: Schools submit invoices for eligible students' Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), which the Department of Education reviews for compliance. Reimbursements are processed manually by the Bureau of Special Education.
- **Challenges**: Proration and rising costs have created funding shortfalls. The process is labor-intensive, and staffing limitations hinder deeper analysis of service costs or trends.
- **Historical Trends**: Costs have fluctuated, with recent increases potentially linked to pandemic-related expenses and rising costs across sectors. Federal relief funds previously supported these costs but have since decreased.
- **Legislative Considerations**: Discussions included improving data tracking and reporting to better anticipate funding needs, eliminating proration, or setting minimum reimbursement thresholds.

### **Career and Technical Education (CTE)**
- **Perkins Funds**: The state receives approximately $6.9 million in federal Perkins funds for CTE programs, with $1.2 million allocated to the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH). The remainder supports regional CTE centers and public schools, primarily at the high school level.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Funding Challenges**: Programs like school building aid and special education face significant funding constraints due to historical debt, rising costs, and proration.
2. **Interagency Coordination**: Effective coordination between state agencies (e.g., DOE and DHHS) is critical for efficient program delivery and funding.
3. **Local Impact**: Funding decisions have significant implications for local school districts, particularly in managing costs and ensuring access to services.
4. **Legislative Proposals**: Discussions included potential legislative changes to address funding shortfalls, improve data tracking, and optimize resource allocation.

The meeting underscored the importance of balancing state and federal resources to support critical education programs while addressing the financial challenges faced by local districts. The committee plans to hold further sessions to delve deeper into specific funding areas, such as CTE and special education.
