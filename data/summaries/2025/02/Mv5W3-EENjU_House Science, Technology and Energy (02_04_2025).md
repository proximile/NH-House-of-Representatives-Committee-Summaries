The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 4, 2025, to discuss and vote on several bills related to energy policy, utility regulations, and infrastructure resilience. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

### **House Bill 654: Group Net Metering for Small Generators**
- **Overview**: HB 654 aims to allow small customer generators (with a maximum capacity of 100 kilowatts or less) to participate in group net metering arrangements, which pool energy resources to reduce costs. Currently, small generators are excluded from such groups.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Double Dipping**: Concerns were raised about whether small generators could benefit twice—through individual and group net metering. The Department of Energy clarified that the bill likely does not intend to permit double dipping.
  - **Administrative Challenges**: Utilities expressed concerns about the complexity of billing and administration, which could lead to increased costs for ratepayers. Eversource testified that current billing systems are not equipped to handle the proposed changes without manual intervention.
  - **Original Intent**: The Department of Energy noted that group net metering was designed to allow surplus power from a host to benefit non-generating customers, not to include other generators.
- **Potential Benefits**: The bill could enable municipal entities (e.g., town halls and libraries) to join group net metering arrangements, enhance energy resilience, and support investments in batteries and virtual power plants.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 9-6 in favor of passing the bill, with a minority report to be written by Representative Wendy Thomas.

### **House Bill 680: Utility Rates for Condominium Shared Meters**
- **Overview**: HB 680 seeks to ensure that shared meters for essential services (e.g., well pumps, septic systems) in condominium associations are billed at residential rather than commercial rates.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Residential vs. Commercial Classification**: Condo associations argued they are residential entities and should not be billed at higher commercial rates. Utilities rely on self-declaration for classification and cannot audit usage behind the meter.
  - **Proposed Solutions**: Suggestions included requiring condo associations to file documentation with the Secretary of State or Public Utilities Commission to certify their residential status, or assigning billing to a single individual within the association.
  - **Subcommittee Formation**: Due to the complexity of the issue, a subcommittee was formed to refine the bill's language and propose a workable solution.
- **Broader Concerns**: The discussion also touched on potential conflicts with other condominium-related bills and the need for uniformity in utility rate classifications.

### **House Bill 537 and HB 539: Residential Rates for Condominium Shared Meters**
- **Overview**: These bills aim to ensure that shared electric meters for well and septic pumps in residential condominiums are billed at residential rates.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Testimony**: Residents of condominiums testified in support of the bills, emphasizing that associations should not be classified as commercial entities.
  - **Utility Perspective**: Eversource explained that rate classification is based on the account holder's status and suggested that changing the account holder’s name to a resident could result in residential rates.
  - **Department of Energy**: The Department expressed neutrality but raised concerns about unintended consequences, such as shifting the responsibility for rate classification from utilities to condo associations.
- **Outcome**: The committee explored the legal and practical implications of the bills, with a focus on ensuring fair billing practices for essential services in residential condominiums.

### **House Bill 541: Study on Infrastructure Survivability and Resiliency**
- **Overview**: HB 541 proposes a committee to study the survivability and resiliency of New Hampshire's energy and telecommunications infrastructure against physical and cyber threats.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Sponsor’s Perspective**: Representative Donald McFarland emphasized the growing threats from nation-state actors and the need for state-level preparedness.
  - **Utility Perspective**: Eversource supported the bill's goals but noted that utilities already coordinate with federal and state agencies on cybersecurity and infrastructure protection.
- **Outcome**: The committee closed the public hearing on the bill and emphasized the importance of confidentiality in sharing information with state and federal agencies.

### **Senate Bill 4: Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACER)**
- **Overview**: SB 4 aims to improve the C-PACER program, which facilitates financing for energy efficiency improvements in commercial properties.
- **Key Discussions**:
  - **Benefits**: Supporters argued the bill would boost energy efficiency, property value, and housing availability.
  - **Opposition**: Representative Harrington expressed concerns about government involvement and potential future subsidies.
- **Outcome**: The bill passed 15-3, with Representative Harrington tasked with writing the minority report.

### **Other Bills**:
- **House Bill 166**: The committee voted to recommend "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) on this bill, which sought to address the transition from copper to fiber internet infrastructure, citing technical errors and redundancy.
- **House Bill 169 FN**: The committee voted 10-7 to recommend ITL on this bill, which aimed to modify Public Utilities Commission (PUC) hearing requirements, arguing it was unnecessary.
- **House Bill 436**: The committee unanimously voted to recommend ITL on this bill due to a lack of sponsor, testimony, or interest.
- **House Bill 504**: The committee debated an amendment to update the state’s energy policy, emphasizing diverse, affordable, reliable, and secure energy resources. The bill passed 10-8, with Representative Bine writing the majority report and Representative Swanson the minority report.
- **House Bill 508**: The committee unanimously passed this bill, which addresses fairness in assessments for legacy telephone companies, reducing their assessment from 33% to 10%.

### **House Continuing Resolution 4 (HCR 4): Opposition to Offshore Wind Development**
- **Overview**: HCR 4 opposes offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine, citing environmental concerns and the impact on marine life and fishermen’s livelihoods.
- **Outcome**: The resolution aims to send a message to federal and state governments to reject offshore wind until these concerns are addressed.

### **Conclusion**:
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on energy policy, utility regulations, and infrastructure resilience. Key themes included the need for clarity in legislative intent, addressing administrative challenges, and ensuring fairness in utility billing practices. The committee voted on several bills, with some passing and others being recommended for further review or rejection. The discussions underscored the importance of balancing economic benefits, environmental protection, and administrative feasibility in energy-related legislation.
