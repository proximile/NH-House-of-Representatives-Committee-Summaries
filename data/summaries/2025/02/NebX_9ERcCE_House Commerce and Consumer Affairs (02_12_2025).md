**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting on February 12, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 12, 2025, to address several key legislative issues, with a primary focus on **House Bill 733**, which aims to regulate **third-party litigation financing (TPLF)** and **Consumer Legal Funding**. The meeting also covered updates to insurance laws, consumer protections, and technical corrections. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and decisions:

### **House Bill 733: Regulation of Third-Party Litigation Financing and Consumer Legal Funding**
HB 733 seeks to bring transparency and regulation to the rapidly growing TPLF industry, where external investors fund lawsuits in exchange for a portion of the settlement. The bill distinguishes between **Consumer Legal Funding** (small amounts for immediate household needs) and **Litigation Financing** (larger sums for legal expenses), aiming to protect consumers and ensure fairness in the legal system.

#### **Key Points and Discussions:**
1. **Purpose and Support**:
   - The bill aims to require disclosure of TPLF agreements to all parties in litigation and the courts, addressing concerns about undisclosed financial interests and litigation abuse.
   - Supporters, including the **Business and Industry Association**, **American Property Casualty Insurance Association**, and **State Farm**, emphasized the need for transparency and regulation in an industry currently unregulated in New Hampshire.

2. **Consumer Protection and Industry Concerns**:
   - Testifiers highlighted the high costs of litigation financing, including interest rates and fees, which can burden plaintiffs.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential for frivolous lawsuits and prolonged litigation due to third-party involvement, which drives up insurance costs and creates a "tort tax."

3. **Disclosure and Enforcement**:
   - The bill includes strong enforcement measures, such as rendering contracts null and void if companies violate the statute.
   - Discussions focused on whether TPLF agreements should be disclosed to all parties and whether the bill unfairly targets plaintiffs without requiring similar disclosures from defendants.

4. **Amendments and Industry Impact**:
   - The committee discussed amendments to clarify definitions and ensure proper regulation of both consumer and commercial litigation financing.
   - The bill’s potential to aid settlement negotiations by providing clarity on plaintiffs' financial obligations was noted.

5. **Opposition and Legal Concerns**:
   - Trial lawyers argued that the bill is unnecessary and biased, as existing court rules already ensure transparency.
   - Concerns were raised about the bill’s impact on attorney-client privilege and the discoverability of TPLF agreements.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee discussed potential amendments to address enforcement and disclosure issues, with refinements expected in subcommittee before further consideration.

### **Updates to Insurance Laws and Consumer Affairs**
The committee also addressed several insurance-related issues, focusing on improving industry practices, ensuring compliance with federal standards, and making technical corrections.

#### **Key Points and Decisions:**
1. **Insurance Company Thresholds**:
   - The committee discussed raising the financial threshold for new insurance companies to $3 million to attract more credible entities and reduce the influx of less serious players.

2. **Technical Corrections**:
   - Adjustments were made to producer fees and other cleanup items missed in previous amendments to streamline processes and ensure clarity.

3. **Network Adequacy Reporting**:
   - Amendments retained network adequacy reporting requirements, making the information publicly available while reducing unnecessary reporting burdens on the industry.

4. **No Surprises Act**:
   - Small tweaks were made to align New Hampshire’s No Surprises Act with federal law, ensuring consistency and addressing missed provisions.

5. **Retiree Insurance Plan**:
   - The committee addressed a bill to extend health insurance coverage for children of state retirees up to age 26, regardless of student status, aligning with federal Affordable Care Act provisions. The cost of coverage is borne by the retirees, not the state.

6. **Withdrawn Bill**:
   - A bill related to consumer protection and enforcement of certain products was withdrawn by the sponsor due to concerns about enforcement mechanisms and the broad scope of the bill. The sponsor plans to revisit the issue with amendments in the future.

### **Future Meetings and Deadlines**
The committee outlined upcoming meetings and deadlines, including subcommittee sessions and executive sessions to finalize bills by March 5th. The focus will be on health insurance, business plans, and other pending legislation.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of regulating the litigation financing industry to protect consumers, ensure transparency, and maintain fairness in the legal system. HB 733 aims to bring New Hampshire in line with other states that have enacted similar legislation. Additionally, the committee’s work on insurance laws and technical corrections reflects a commitment to improving industry practices and ensuring compliance with federal standards. Further refinements and discussions are expected as the legislative process continues.
