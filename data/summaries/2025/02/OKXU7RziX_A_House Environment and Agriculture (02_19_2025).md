The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a series of meetings addressing various bills related to animal welfare, food safety, and agricultural practices. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and debates:

### **1. Wild Animals as Pets (HB 2)**
The House discussed a bill proposing the legalization of keeping raccoons and gray squirrels as companion animals under specific conditions. The bill would allow individuals to possess these animals if they are adopted from licensed wildlife rehabilitation facilities and deemed unfit for release into the wild. It prohibits breeding, selling, or capturing wild raccoons and squirrels for pets and mandates that the animals be up-to-date on required vaccinations. The bill also includes provisions to prevent confiscation or euthanasia without the owner's permission, except in cases of suspected rabies.

**Proponents**, including Representative Jim Spain, argued that the bill provides a humane alternative to euthanasia for animals that cannot survive in the wild and aligns with laws in neighboring states like Vermont and Rhode Island. They emphasized that the bill includes safeguards, such as vaccination requirements and restrictions on how the animals can be acquired.

**Opponents**, including the Humane Society and the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, raised concerns about public health risks, particularly the spread of diseases like rabies, raccoon roundworm, and canine distemper. They highlighted that rabies vaccines are not approved for wild animals and that keeping wild animals as pets is inhumane and poses significant welfare challenges. The Fish and Game Department also noted that current rules require euthanasia for animals that cannot be released into the wild, as they believe this is the most responsible approach.

The committee discussed potential amendments, including clarifying quarantine provisions, specifying vaccine schedules, and addressing concerns about animal welfare and public safety. The bill was scheduled for further discussion and potential revisions in a future work session.

### **2. Ban on Glue Traps (HB 152)**
The House debated **HB 152**, which aims to ban the use of glue traps for rodent control due to their inhumane nature. Glue traps cause prolonged suffering for animals, often leading to starvation, dehydration, or self-inflicted injuries as they struggle to escape.

**Proponents** argued that these traps are cruel and unnecessary, pointing to alternatives like snap traps, exclusion methods, and humane capture-and-release options. They emphasized that glue traps often catch non-target species, such as birds or small mammals, and that many people are unprepared to deal with live animals caught in these traps, sometimes resorting to inhumane methods of disposal.

**Opponents**, including representatives from the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and pest control industries, argued that glue traps are a cost-effective, non-toxic tool for rodent control, especially in agricultural and commercial settings. They highlighted the importance of glue traps in integrated pest management (IPM) programs, which are legally required for food-related businesses in the state. Opponents also noted that glue traps are often used indoors or in enclosed areas, reducing the risk of catching non-target species.

The debate touched on various rodent control methods, including exclusion, snap traps, and even mouse contraceptives, with discussions on their effectiveness and ethical implications. The hearing concluded with a significant number of people (281) signing in support of the bill and 10 in opposition. The committee will reconvene on March 4th to continue deliberations.

### **3. Food Safety and Agriculture**
The committee discussed several bills related to food safety, agriculture, and animal welfare:

- **Freeze-Dried Foods (HB 505)**: The committee discussed allowing the sale of freeze-dried foods produced in homestead operations. Concerns were raised about ensuring food safety, particularly regarding moisture control and the use of proper equipment (freeze-dryers vs. dehydrators). Amendments were proposed to clarify that freeze-dried processed foods should not be considered potentially hazardous and to include specific guidelines for fruits and berries.

- **Rabbit Meat Sales (HB 779)**: The bill aimed to expand the sale of uninspected rabbit meat to farm stands, farmers' markets, and interstate commerce. Concerns were raised by the Department of Agriculture and Health and Human Services about inconsistencies in the bill’s language and the need for educational and registration requirements for rabbit producers. The committee discussed amending the bill to align with existing regulations and ensure food safety.

- **Meat Inspection Exemptions (HB 396)**: The bill sought to exempt meat and meat products slaughtered and prepared in-state from certain inspections. Testimony highlighted that federal law currently prohibits this, but there are USDA exemptions for state-inspected facilities to process and sell cuts of meat. The committee discussed clarifying state regulations to reflect these federal exemptions and improve transparency for producers.

- **Animal Welfare (HB 277)**: The bill addressed a loophole in the state’s animal cruelty statutes regarding foals (baby horses). It proposed replacing the term "colt" with "foal" to ensure protections apply to both male and female foals under 90 days old. The New Hampshire Farm Bureau supported the bill, noting it corrects an oversight in the law.

### **4. Meat Processing Regulations**
The House discussed meat processing regulations, focusing on USDA and state-inspected facilities, exemptions, and the challenges faced by small farms and producers:

- **Retention of a Bill**: Representatives debated whether to retain a bill (likely related to meat processing) to allow for further discussion and potential amendments, especially in light of federal-level changes like the PRIME Act and USDA actions.

- **USDA vs. State Inspection**: The committee discussed the differences between USDA-inspected and state-inspected facilities, emphasizing the need for clarity in state statutes to ensure all options for meat producers are clearly outlined.

- **Exemptions and Licensing**: There was a focus on the need for clear guidelines on exemptions and licensing for meat producers, particularly for small farms. Representatives expressed concerns about the complexity and cost of obtaining USDA certification and the need for more accessible options.

- **Mobile Slaughter Facilities**: The idea of mobile slaughter facilities was proposed as a potential solution to the bottleneck in USDA facilities, but concerns were raised about the cost-effectiveness and practicality of such operations in New Hampshire.

- **Dehydrated Meat and Jerky**: The discussion also touched on a bill (HB 642) related to dehydrated meat and jerky production. Representatives debated whether the current licensing and inspection requirements were too burdensome for small producers and whether a scaled-down commercial kitchen option could be explored.

### **5. Cost of Care Fund (HB 263)**
The House discussed **HB 263**, which proposes additional restrictions on how applications to the cost of care fund for livestock care are assessed.

**Commissioner Sean Jasper** of the Department of Agriculture opposed the bill as written, arguing that it would create conflicts with existing laws and place the commissioner in the position of judging whether law enforcement acted lawfully, which is beyond their role. The commissioner suggested that any necessary changes to the cost of care fund should be incorporated into HB 616, a related bill, to avoid conflicts.

The **Farm Bureau** supported the bill, stating that it adds necessary language to the cost of care fund, but the commissioner argued that the issues addressed in the bill are not necessary if underlying problems in the law are fixed.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings highlighted the tension between supporting local agriculture, ensuring public health, and promoting animal welfare. Representatives sought practical solutions to reduce barriers for small producers while maintaining safety standards. The discussions also emphasized the importance of humane treatment of animals and the need for regulatory clarity in various areas, from food safety to pest control. The committee planned to reconvene for further discussions and potential amendments on several bills.
