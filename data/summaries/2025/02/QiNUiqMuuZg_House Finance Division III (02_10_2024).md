The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 10, 2024, featured in-depth discussions on Medicaid services, public health programs, developmental services, and healthy aging initiatives. The meeting, led by key officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), focused on understanding program structures, funding mechanisms, and the challenges of meeting the needs of vulnerable populations in a budget-constrained environment.

### Key Highlights:

#### **Medicaid Services and Home and Community-Based Waivers:**
1. **Medicaid Changes**: The state eliminated the spousal impoverishment rule, allowing spouses of Medicaid recipients to retain more assets, and reduced the look-back period for Medicaid eligibility from 60 to 36 months, simplifying the application process.
2. **Home and Community-Based Waivers**: New Hampshire operates four 1915c waivers—Children’s In-Home Support, Developmental Disability, Acquired Brain Disorder, and Choices for Independence (CFI)—providing cost-effective alternatives to institutional care. Each waiver serves specific populations with unique eligibility criteria and service costs.
3. **Nursing Facility Financing**: Nursing facility funding involves federal, state, and county contributions, with a county cap adjusted biennially. Rising care costs, outpacing the 2% annual cap increase, have led to higher state expenditures.
4. **Workforce and Rate Challenges**: Providers emphasized the need for rate increases to address workforce shortages, particularly for the CFI program, which helps older adults remain in the community at a lower cost than nursing homes. Standardized rates and consistent funding were highlighted as critical to meeting growing demand.

#### **Public Health Programs:**
1. **Historical Context and Reorganization**: Patricia Tilly, Associate Commissioner of DHHS, provided an overview of public health programs, tracing their history back to 1881 and explaining recent reorganizations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes aimed to improve efficiency and focus.
2. **Federal Funding and Mandates**: Approximately 85% of public health funding comes from federal sources, with significant implications for program mandates and state-level decisions.
3. **Behavioral Health and Prevention**: The rising demand for behavioral health services, exacerbated by the pandemic, was discussed, alongside the importance of prevention programs, such as the state loan repayment program to attract providers to underserved areas and initiatives to address adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
4. **UNH Partnerships**: Contracts with the University of New Hampshire (UNH) for maternal and child health epidemiology and pediatric mental health care access were reviewed, highlighting the role of academic expertise in public health data analysis and provider training.

#### **Developmental Services and Healthy Aging:**
1. **Developmental Services**: The state’s developmental services system, managed through 10 area agencies, focuses on choice, uniformity, quality, and sustainability. Efforts to address workforce challenges, improve access, and implement assessment-informed rates were outlined.
2. **Healthy Aging**: With nearly 20% of the population aged 65 and over, New Hampshire is working to build a comprehensive system of care for healthy aging. Programs like Meals on Wheels and Adult Protective Services were emphasized, alongside financial eligibility changes to improve access to services.
3. **Budgetary Constraints**: Balancing investments in high-need services with preventive measures remains a challenge. Strategic resource allocation and the potential for long-term savings through preventive care were discussed.

#### **Public Input and Future Discussions:**
Representatives from case management agencies shared their experiences, stressing the impact of rate increases on service delivery and the need for consistent funding. The committee acknowledged the need for more detailed discussions on specific programs and funding, which will be addressed in future budget presentations once the governor’s budget is released.

### Conclusion:
The meeting underscored the state’s commitment to improving Medicaid services, public health programs, developmental services, and healthy aging initiatives. While progress has been made in simplifying Medicaid eligibility, expanding home and community-based care, and addressing workforce challenges, budgetary constraints and rising costs remain significant hurdles. The committee emphasized the importance of preventive care, data-driven decision-making, and strategic resource allocation to meet the needs of New Hampshire’s most vulnerable populations. Future discussions will focus on program specifics and funding details as the state works to balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability.
