### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **Voting Rights and Accessibility**

   - **Purpose**: To allow individuals without immediate access to required documentation (e.g., birth certificates, licenses) to vote using a qualified voter affidavit.

   - **Opponents**: Critics argued the bill was unnecessary due to the rarity of voter fraud and expressed concerns about election integrity.

   - **Purpose**: To create a system for verifying citizenship and a voucher program to help indigent voters obtain birth certificates.  
   - **Supporters**: Seen as a way to assist voters struggling to access citizenship documents. The Secretary of State supported the bill but suggested broadening its scope.  
   - **Opponents**: Critics argued it was overly restrictive and did not address broader issues, advocating instead for reinstating the affidavit process.  
   - **Outcome**: Mixed reactions, with concerns about its limited scope.

   - **Supporters**: Argued it would ensure election integrity and clarify voting requirements.

   - **Outcome**: Strong opposition, with concerns about disenfranchisement and constitutional violations.

4. **House Bill 323: Narrowing Acceptable Voter IDs**  
   - **Purpose**: To exclude out-of-state driver’s licenses and student IDs from acceptable voter identification.  
   - **Opponents**: Argued it would disenfranchise students, young voters, and others without addressing any real issue of voter fraud.

5. **House Bill 289: Tying Voting Rights to University Residency Rules**  
   - **Purpose**: To link voting rights to university residency rules.

   - **Outcome**: Concerns raised about its impact on student voters.

6. **House Bill 1569: Documentary Proof of Citizenship**  
   - **Purpose**: To require documentary proof of citizenship to vote and eliminate the affidavit option.

   - **Supporters**: Argued it would ensure fairness and integrity in the candidate selection process.  
   - **Opponents**: Critics, including Undeclared voters and advocacy groups, argued it would disenfranchise approximately 40% of New Hampshire voters who value the flexibility to choose which primary to participate in.
