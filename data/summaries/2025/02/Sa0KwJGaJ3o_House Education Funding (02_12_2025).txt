**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (02/12/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 12, 2025, to discuss **House Bill 772** and other related proposals aimed at reforming the state’s education funding system. The discussions centered on creating a more equitable, transparent, and predictable funding formula to ensure adequate education for all students, while addressing disparities in local property wealth and meeting constitutional obligations. Key themes and proposals from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **1. Foundation Opportunity Budget and Funding Mechanics**
- **House Bill 772** introduces a **Foundation Opportunity Budget**, which calculates the cost of providing an adequate education for each school district. This budget is determined using **weighted factors** to account for varying student needs, such as special education, low-income students, and English language learners. These weights are based on regression analysis by the American Institutes for Research, ensuring alignment with actual educational costs and outcomes.
- Funding begins with a **local share** (up to $538 per $1,000 of property value), with the state covering any remaining costs. The bill includes an **efficiency factor** (a 10% reduction) and a **transition phase-in period** to adjust the budget further.
- **State grants** are calculated based on the foundation budget, with districts retaining the flexibility to exceed this amount if voters approve. This approach aims to provide clarity for local school boards while maintaining flexibility for enrichment programs beyond the 11 core elements of an adequate education.

---

### **2. Weighted Funding and Equity**
- The funding formula incorporates **weighted factors** to address diverse student needs, ensuring that districts with higher costs (e.g., special education, low-income students) receive additional support.
- Concerns were raised about **regional cost disparities**, such as higher teacher salaries in urban areas or transportation costs in rural districts. The bill does not explicitly address these variations, prompting calls for further refinement.
- The formula aims to balance equity by ensuring wealthier districts contribute more through the **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)** while providing sufficient support to lower-income districts.

---

### **3. Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) Reforms**
- **SWEPT**, introduced in 1999 in response to the **Claremont lawsuit**, is a property tax intended to fund education. However, its classification as a state or local tax has been contentious.
- **Excess SWEPT** occurs when municipalities collect more revenue than needed for their education budgets. **House Bill 772** requires excess funds to be remitted to the state, addressing inequities and ensuring wealthier districts contribute more to statewide education needs.
- Two related bills were discussed:
  - **HB 137**: Allows municipalities to retain excess SWEPT funds for educational purposes.
  - **HB 527**: Reclassifies SWEPT as a local contribution, addressing constitutional concerns raised by the **Rand court decision**, which ruled that excess SWEPT should be remitted to the state.
- The financial impact of remitting excess SWEPT (approximately $28 million) was noted, as it could reduce local revenue and necessitate higher property taxes in some municipalities.

---

### **4. Special Education and Transportation Costs**
- Special education funding was a major focus, with proposals to break down costs into more specific categories or create an **insurance-like product** to cover high-cost cases.
- **Transportation costs**, particularly for special education students, were highlighted as highly variable. Some representatives suggested separating transportation costs from the general education budget to improve transparency and fairness.
- The bill does not include a **circuit breaker** for high-cost special education needs, but it acknowledges that such measures might be necessary separately.

---

### **5. Accountability and Transparency**
- Representatives emphasized the need for better tracking and accountability in how education funds are spent, particularly for special education services.
- A **funding simulator** was mentioned as a tool to project costs and impacts on local tax rates, aiding in fiscal planning and transparency.

---

### **6. Historical Context and Legal Challenges**
- Discussions referenced past education funding formulas and court rulings, including the **Claremont lawsuit** and the **Rand decision**, which have shaped the state’s approach to education funding.
- The **ConVal case** was cited as an example of past struggles in determining adequate education costs. The current bill builds on previous models but introduces new factors like **student outcomes**.

---

### **7. Fiscal Impact and Next Steps**
- The **fiscal note** for **House Bill 772** is still under review, but preliminary estimates suggest it would increase the number of towns subject to excess SWEPT and raise significant state funds for education.
- Representatives noted the need for further analysis to understand the state’s financial obligations and the bill’s impact on local tax rates.
- The committee plans to review fiscal notes and continue discussions on the bill, alongside other education-related proposals, in future meetings.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected ongoing efforts to refine New Hampshire’s education funding system, addressing disparities, and ensuring that all students receive adequate support. **House Bill 772** aims to create a fairer, more transparent, and predictable funding formula by balancing state and local contributions, accounting for diverse student needs, and addressing inequities in property wealth. However, concerns remain about regional cost disparities, transportation costs, and the adequacy of proposed funding levels. Further refinement and fiscal analysis will be critical as the bill progresses.
