The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 18, 2025, focused on a wide range of election law issues, reflecting ongoing debates about election integrity, voter participation, and procedural fairness. The discussions centered on several key bills and themes, which are summarized below:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. House Bill 714: Single-Ballot Primary System**
- **Proposal**: HB 714, introduced by Representative Russ Mirad, seeks to replace the current partisan primary system with a single-ballot primary where all candidates, regardless of party, appear together. The top two vote-getters would advance to the general election.
- **Support**: Advocates argue that this system would reduce polarization, increase voter participation, and allow independent voters greater influence. Examples from states like Alaska, California, Nebraska, and Washington were cited to demonstrate the system's effectiveness.
- **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about potential single-party dominance, the dilution of minority party candidates, and logistical challenges. Some suggested ranked-choice voting as an alternative to ensure proportional representation.
- **Citizens Assembly**: The New Hampshire Together Citizens Assembly, a diverse group of residents, strongly supported the single-ballot primary as a way to reduce polarization and improve voter engagement.

#### **2. House Bill 308: Election Checklist Adjustments**
- **Proposal**: Introduced by Representative Travis Toner, HB 308 would require election checklists to include a column indicating if a non-New Hampshire ID was used.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed the bill, citing it as burdensome and unnecessary.

#### **3. House Bill 341: Voter Record Accuracy**
- **Proposal**: Introduced by Representative Jerry Ward, HB 341 aims to require the Secretary of State to check voter records 90 days before every election to improve voter list accuracy.
- **Support**: The bill addresses issues faced in 2024 when voter registrars received the National Change of Address (NCOA) list too close to the election, causing processing delays. It has broad support from registrars.

#### **4. House Bill 711: Voting Machine Contractors**
- **Proposal**: Introduced by Representative Bernardi, HB 711 requires voting machine contractors to register with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, obtain a contractor ID, and provide proof of bonding and insurance.
- **Support**: Testimonies highlighted the need for background checks and OSHA safety certification to ensure election integrity.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed the bill, citing ambiguity in the registration process and responsibilities for municipalities.

#### **5. House Bill 270: Preservation of Memory Chips**
- **Proposal**: Introduced by Representative Claudine Burnham, HB 270 requires the preservation of electronic ballot counting device memory chips for 22 months after elections.
- **Support**: Testimonies emphasized the importance of maintaining a strict chain of custody for election security.
- **Secretary of State’s Response**: Current practices already involve securely storing memory devices with ballots, but some devices need to be recycled for future elections, which could conflict with the bill’s requirements.

#### **6. House Bill 154 & HB 693: Hand Counting of Ballots**
- **Proposal**: These bills allow voters to request hand counting of their ballots and enable town clerks or selectmen to conduct supplemental hand counts of specific races before certification.
- **Support**: Advocates argue that hand counting addresses voter distrust in voting machines and ensures election integrity.
- **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about the accuracy and efficiency of hand counting versus machine counting, as well as potential disenfranchisement if only one party’s candidates appear on the ballot after a primary.

#### **7. House Bill 423: Political Signage**
- **Proposal**: This bill addresses the placement of political signs on public property, with some advocating for local control over sign regulations.
- **Discussions**: Representatives discussed various approaches, including allowing homeowners to remove signs in front of their properties, clarifying state and municipal property rules, and ensuring enforcement mechanisms.

### **Executive Session Decisions**
- **House Bill 472 (Proving Domicile)**: The committee voted unanimously (17-0) to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."
- **House Bill 141 (Campaign Disclosures for LLCs)**: The committee voted 10-7 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."
- **House Bill 172 (Restricting Undeclared Voters)**: The committee voted unanimously (17-0) to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

### **Broader Themes**
- **Election Integrity and Transparency**: Many bills focused on enhancing election security, such as requiring background checks for voting machine contractors and preserving memory chips from electronic ballot counting devices.
- **Voter Participation and Fairness**: Discussions around the single-ballot primary system and hand counting of ballots highlighted efforts to increase voter participation and ensure fair election outcomes.
- **Local vs. State Control**: Debates over political signage and voter record accuracy reflected broader tensions between local control and the need for clear statewide standards.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of election law reform, balancing the need for integrity, transparency, and voter participation with practical concerns and potential overreach. The committee plans to continue deliberations on these bills, with further hearings and potential amendments expected.
