### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (02/18/2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 18, 2025, focused extensively on election law, addressing a range of bills aimed at improving election integrity, voter participation, and administrative efficiency. The discussions covered voter verification, ballot counting, campaign finance, public property signage, and broader electoral reforms. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points and debates:

---

#### **1. Voter Registration and Verification**
- **House Bill 341**: Requires the Secretary of State to check voter records at least 90 days before elections using the National Change of Address (NCOA) list to ensure accuracy. Proponents argued this would give registrars more time to process address changes, while concerns were raised about the timing and frequency of checks.
- **House Bill 274**: Proposes annual verification of voter roles instead of the current 10-year cycle and extends the look-back period for voter activity from 4 to 5 years. The goal is to maintain accurate voter checklists and reduce the workload for supervisors.
- **House Bill 317**: Prevents supervisors of the checklist from verifying a voter’s identity without identification, even if they personally know the voter. Supporters emphasized consistency, while opponents argued it could disenfranchise vulnerable groups like the elderly or disabled.

#### **2. Ballot Counting and Election Integrity**
- **House Bill 693**: Permits hand counting of ballots and allows selectmen or town clerks to conduct supplemental hand counts to verify election results. Testimonies highlighted the constitutional basis for hand counting and the need for transparency.
- **House Bill 154**: Enables voters to request their ballots be hand-counted. Supporters cited concerns about voter trust in machine-counted ballots, while critics warned of potential delays in election results.
- **House Bill 270**: Requires the preservation of electronic ballot counting device memory chips for 22 months after an election, similar to the preservation of ballots. Discussions focused on terminology (memory chips vs. memory cards) and practical implications.

---

#### **3. Voting Machine and Contractor Oversight**
- **House Bill 711**: Requires voting machine contractors to register with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, obtain a registration number, and provide proof of bonding and insurance. The bill aims to enhance election integrity by ensuring proper oversight of contractors and subcontractors.

---

#### **4. Campaign Finance and Political Signage**
- **House Bill 311**: Addresses permissible campaign contributions by businesses and labor unions. A motion was made to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate," with arguments about fairness between corporations and unions.
- **Political Signage**: Representatives debated regulations for political signs on public property, with varying opinions on whether towns or the state should set rules. Concerns included property rights, First Amendment issues, and the practical challenges of enforcement.

---

#### **5. Electoral Reforms and Voter Participation**
- **House Bill 714**: Proposes a single primary ballot system, replacing separate Democratic and Republican ballots with a nonpartisan ballot where all candidates appear together. The top two vote-getters would advance to the general election. Supporters argued it would increase voter participation, reduce polarization, and provide a level playing field for independent candidates. Opponents raised concerns about single-party dominance and potential strategic voting.
- **House Bill 172**: Discussed restricting undeclared voters from same-day voting in primaries. Extensive debate included statistics on the impact of undeclared voters, with some arguing against restrictions to maintain inclusivity.

---

#### **6. Public Testimony and Citizen Input**
- The meeting included public hearings where citizens, election officials, and moderators provided testimony on various bills. Key themes included the need for transparency, trust in the electoral process, and concerns about machine reliability.
- **New Hampshire Citizens Assembly**: The single primary ballot proposal (HB 714) was inspired by this nonpartisan group, which identified political polarization and election confidence as key issues. The proposal received over 80% support from assembly delegates.

---

#### **7. Administrative and Logistical Challenges**
- **Secretary of State’s Insights**: David Scanland highlighted logistical challenges, such as increased proofing requirements and potential errors in implementing a single primary ballot system.
- **Frequency of Updates**: The Deputy Secretary of State suggested updating voter registration systems twice a year for feasibility and financial reasons, with concerns raised about overlapping election periods and administrative burdens.

---

#### **8. Miscellaneous Discussions**
- **Fluoride in Water**: Some public comments opposed the use of fluoride in water, though this was unrelated to the primary election law focus.
- **School Vacation**: The meeting concluded with remarks about school vacation and plans to reconvene in two weeks for votes and sessions.
