The NH House of Representatives meeting on February 3, 2025, covered a wide range of topics, focusing on the financial and operational challenges facing various state departments and programs. The discussions provided insights into revenue trends, workforce issues, infrastructure maintenance, and the impact of external factors such as inflation, cannabis legalization, and changing consumer behaviors. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from all three segments:

---

### **1. New Hampshire Liquor Commission (NHLC) Operations and Financial Performance**
The NHLC reported $744 million in sales for 2024, with significant revenue transferred to the state’s general fund. However, net profits declined due to increased expenses, including a 10% pay raise and investments in a new software system. Key highlights include:
- **Beverage Alcohol Trends**: National trends like "Dry January" and "Sober October," as well as the growing cannabis market, are impacting alcohol sales. The NHLC remains neutral on cannabis legalization but acknowledges its potential influence.
- **Retail and E-commerce**: The NHLC operates 65 retail stores, with curbside pickup generating $3.2 million in 2024. Plans for home delivery and a strong e-commerce platform are underway.
- **Exclusive Products and Marketing**: International buying trips help the NHLC secure exclusive products, differentiating its offerings. Targeted email campaigns and social media presence also drive sales.
- **Alcohol Abuse Prevention**: A portion of NHLC revenue is allocated to prevention and treatment programs, as mandated by state law.
- **Challenges**: Representatives raised concerns about the impact of cannabis on alcohol sales, underage drinking prevention, and the effectiveness of promotional events.

### **2. Department of Safety and Department of Transportation (DOT) Financial Overview**
Both departments face financial pressures due to rising costs and modest revenue growth. Key points include:
- **Highway Fund Revenues**: The Department of Safety reported $263 million in FY2024 highway fund revenues, primarily from gas taxes, vehicle registrations, and driver licenses. However, revenue growth (0.51% annually since 2018) has not kept pace with costs, leading to structural deficits.
  - **Road Toll Operations**: Motor fuel taxes are collected at the distributor level, with exemptions for exports or sales to other distributors.
  - **DMV Revenues**: Motor vehicle registration revenues were $93.1 million in FY2024, slightly above projections, but dips may be due to economic conditions or policy changes.
- **DOT Operations**: The DOT manages 4,600 miles of roadway, 2,159 state bridges, and public transit systems. Funding relies heavily on federal funds ($230+ million annually) and gas taxes (22.2 cents per gallon). However, $20 million annually is diverted to pay off the I-93 Tiff loan, reducing funds for road maintenance.
  - **Challenges**: Inflation, increased labor and material costs, and a 24% vacancy rate strain operations. The DOT prioritizes safety and leverages federal funds and toll credits to manage projects.
  - **Brining Program**: The brining program, used as a pre-treatment on limited roadways, has improved safety and reduced plowing costs.
- **Legislative Concerns**: Representatives inquired about fuel tax rates, the impact of electric vehicles on road toll revenues, and the efficiency of State Police enforcement.

### **3. Workforce Challenges and Other Key Issues**
The meeting also addressed broader state challenges, including workforce shortages, inflation, and revenue recoveries:
- **Vacancy Rates**: The state faces rising vacancy rates since the COVID-19 pandemic, with recruitment and retention challenges exacerbated by lower hourly wages compared to private industry and the housing cost crisis.
- **Inflation and Budgeting**: The DOT incorporates inflation into its 10-year plans, but post-COVID spikes in material and labor costs have exceeded inflation rates. Updates are planned for the next cycle.
- **Federal Aid for Airports**: Larger commercial airports receive federal aid, while smaller private airports generally do not. The state manages federal pass-through funds with limited state resources.
- **Medicaid Recoveries**: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recovers funds from deceased Medicaid recipients, overpayments, and third-party insurers. Recoveries fluctuate based on probate actions and fraud investigations.
- **Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA)**: New Hampshire receives annual MSA payments, adjusted based on cigarette sales and inflation. Estimates for 2025-2027 are $35.5 million, $32.5 million, and $30 million, respectively, though uncertainties remain due to manufacturer withholdings.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the financial and operational challenges facing New Hampshire’s state departments, including the NHLC, Department of Safety, and DOT. Key issues include declining alcohol sales due to cannabis legalization and changing consumer trends, structural deficits in highway fund revenues, rising vacancy rates, and the impact of inflation on infrastructure projects. Legislative support and strategic planning will be critical to address these challenges and sustain essential programs and services.
