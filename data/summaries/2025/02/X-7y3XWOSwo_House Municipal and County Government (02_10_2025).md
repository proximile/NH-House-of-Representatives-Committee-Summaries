**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee Meeting (02/10/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee convened on February 10, 2025, to discuss a range of bills addressing municipal and county governance, taxation, and economic development. The meeting included public hearings, executive sessions, and testimonies from stakeholders, with discussions focusing on the financial, operational, and policy implications of the proposed legislation. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 547: Medicaid Reimbursement for Elderly and Disabled**
   - The bill addressed county reimbursement claims related to Medicaid assistance for the elderly and disabled, stemming from a federal funding adjustment during COVID-19. Counties sought an $11.2 million reimbursement, highlighting the state’s budget constraints and the need to address this financial obligation.

2. **House Bill 569: Countywide Communication Districts**
   - This bill proposed establishing countywide communication districts to improve broadband infrastructure and economic opportunities. Supporters argued it would enhance efficiency and collaboration, while opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, raised concerns about forcing municipalities to participate. County commissioners advocated for flexible, enabling legislation.

3. **House Bill 643: Expanding Grafton County Commissioners**
   - The bill proposed increasing the number of Grafton County Commissioners from three to five and redistricting the county. It faced strong opposition from current commissioners and stakeholders, who argued it would increase costs by $40,000 annually, disrupt the existing term system, and lack local support. The bill was criticized for its lack of a needs analysis and potential inefficiency.

4. **House Bill 544: Optional Local Public Safety Assessment on Room Occupancies**
   - The bill aimed to allow municipalities to impose a $2 per night occupancy fee on hotel stays to offset tourism-related costs (e.g., police, fire, EMS). Supporters, including Representative Paige, argued that tourism-heavy towns like Conway needed this tool to manage expenses. Opponents, including the lodging industry, raised concerns about fairness, enforcement costs, and the exclusion of short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb).

5. **House Bill 123: Timber Taxation and Carbon Sequestration**
   - This bill sought to update the timber tax law (RSA 79) to include carbon sequestration projects, ensuring they pay a 10% yield tax similar to timber harvesting. Proponents argued this would prevent revenue losses for municipalities, particularly in Coos County, where timber taxes are a significant revenue source. Concerns were raised about the long-term impact on forest management, local economies, and the timber industry. The bill faced opposition from organizations like the Nature Conservancy and the Business and Industry Association, who cited complexity and potential double taxation.

6. **House Bill 125: Electing Strafford County Commissioners at Large**
   - The bill proposed reverting Strafford County to an at-large system for electing County Commissioners, rather than the current district-based system. Supporters argued the at-large system ensures fair representation and simplifies elections, while critics questioned the need for the change.

7. **Other Bills and Amendments**
   - **House Bill 92**: An amendment was accepted to prevent conflicts of interest for members serving on both zoning and planning boards.
   - **House Bill 272**: Passed to exempt certain agricultural practices from municipal noise regulations.
   - **House Bill 149 FN**: Voted against, as it proposed changes to the approval process for town and school budget warrant articles.
   - **House Bill 339**: Voted against for proposing unnecessary additions to municipal master plans.
   - **House Bill 407**: Voted against due to vagueness in setting a minimum threshold for budget item adoption.
   - **House Bill 447**: Voted against over concerns about expanding property tax exemptions for disabled veterans.

- **Financial Impact**: Many discussions centered on the financial implications of proposed legislation, including revenue losses, increased costs, and tax burdens on municipalities and businesses.
- **Fairness and Equity**: Stakeholders emphasized the need for fairness in taxation, representation, and economic opportunities, particularly in rural and tourism-heavy areas.
- **Environmental and Economic Balance**: The debate over carbon sequestration and timber taxation underscored the challenge of balancing environmental conservation with local economic interests.
- **Implementation Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the enforceability, practicality, and administrative complexity of several bills, prompting calls for further study and collaboration.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing municipal and county governance issues in a way that balances local needs, state interests, and economic realities. While some bills, such as the optional occupancy fee and timber tax updates, were seen as potential solutions to specific challenges, others faced significant opposition due to their lack of local support or practical feasibility. The committee’s discussions reflected a commitment to fairness, transparency, and sustainable governance, with further deliberations and amendments expected in future sessions.
