**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting on February 14, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 14, 2025, to address the pressing issue of improving the state’s response to animal cruelty cases. The meeting focused on **HB 153**, a bill aimed at enhancing law enforcement’s ability to handle such cases through standardized protocols, training, and resource allocation. Key discussions and outcomes from the meeting are summarized below:

### **Key Issues and Challenges**
1. **Training Gaps**: Currently, law enforcement officers receive only a 2-hour introductory course on animal cruelty laws during police academy training, with no comprehensive or mandatory training for active officers. This lack of consistent education often leads to inadequate responses to animal cruelty cases.
2. **Resource Limitations**: Many law enforcement agencies lack awareness of existing protocols, such as involving veterinarians or issuing warrants for animal removal. Additionally, staffing shortages and limited resources, particularly in rural areas, hinder effective investigations.
3. **Variability in Responses**: There is significant inconsistency in how animal cruelty cases are handled across the state, with some areas lacking trained personnel or animal control officers (ACOs).
4. **Financial Constraints**: Funding for training, compensation for officers involved in investigations, and the cost of caring for seized animals remain significant challenges. The state’s existing Cost of Care Fund, which covers expenses for seized animals, may need expansion to include legal costs or additional training.

### **Proposed Solutions**
1. **Standardized Protocols and Training**:
   - Establish clear protocols for prompt and effective responses to animal cruelty cases.
   - Expand training opportunities, leveraging programs like those offered by the University of Missouri, and ensure at least one sheriff or deputy and one state trooper per county are trained as resources for local law enforcement.
2. **Voluntary Task Force and Expert Lists**:
   - Create a voluntary task force of trained officers, ACOs, and veterinarians to assist with animal cruelty investigations.
   - Develop a statewide list of officers with specialized training in animal cruelty, similar to the system for drug recognition experts (DREs).
3. **Study Committee**:
   - Amend HB 153 to form a study committee involving key stakeholders, including law enforcement, veterinarians, prosecutors, and animal welfare organizations. This committee would explore sustainable statewide resources and develop comprehensive legislation for future sessions.
4. **Funding Mechanisms**:
   - Explore grants, reimbursements, and other funding mechanisms to support training and resource allocation without duplicating existing efforts.

### **Additional Concerns**
- **Urban and Homeless Populations**: The treatment of pets in urban areas, particularly among the homeless population, was raised as a concern.
- **Emotional Support Animals**: Enforcement of laws regarding emotional support animals in public spaces was also discussed.

### **Next Steps**
The committee reached a consensus to amend HB 153 to establish a study committee, ensuring a collaborative and well-rounded approach to addressing animal cruelty. The goal is to pass comprehensive legislation in the next session, balancing training, resources, and funding to create a standardized and effective system for animal cruelty investigations across New Hampshire. 

This meeting highlighted the need for a coordinated effort among stakeholders to protect animals and ensure justice in cruelty cases, while addressing the practical and financial challenges faced by law enforcement and other involved parties.
