**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (02/11/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 11, 2025, to discuss a wide range of bills and amendments related to environmental protection, waste management, and food production. The meeting focused on balancing environmental sustainability, public health, and support for local industries, particularly small-scale food producers. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Environmental and Waste Management Issues**

1. **Landfill Regulations and Moratorium**:
   - **HB 77 (Landfill Setback Distances)**: The committee discussed establishing site-specific setback distances for new landfills. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) provided maps showing limited suitable areas under the proposed criteria. Concerns were raised about the need for in-state waste management and the potential impact of buffer zones.
   - **HB 171 (Solid Waste Management Moratorium)**: The committee reviewed amendments to impose a moratorium on landfill applications until 2030. Key changes included adding a "notwithstanding clause" to prevent automatic approvals and clarifying that applications must remain compliant with new laws enacted during the moratorium. The bill was moved to executive session for a vote.
   - **HB 2115 (Net Public Benefit and Leachate Management)**: This bill introduces a two-stage process for evaluating landfill applications, focusing on whether a proposed facility provides a net public benefit (benefits outweighing harms). The amendment requires an independent third-party assessment and consultation with other state departments. The committee also discussed **HB 566**, which mandates detailed leachate management plans, including on-site treatment and off-site contamination risks.

2. **Oil Discharge and Plastic Waste**:
   - **HB 658 (Oil Discharge and Disposal Cleanup Fund)**: The bill reauthorizes the fund for oil spill cleanup and financial assistance for replacing aging oil tanks. The committee deemed it straightforward and ready for executive session.
   - **HB 4779 (Solid Waste Study Committee)**: Discussions centered on the impact of plastic bag waste. The committee considered writing a letter to the Solid Waste Working Group rather than forming a study committee, given existing research.

3. **Environmental Values**:
   - **HR 10 (Right to Clean Air, Water, and a Healthy Environment)**: The committee reviewed an amendment emphasizing the importance of clean air, water, and a healthy environment without framing them as fundamental rights, making the resolution less controversial.

### **Food Production and Safety**

1. **Homestead and Small-Scale Food Operations**:
   - **HB 150**: Clarifies that homestead food operations can use commercial kitchen equipment if it can be washed, rinsed, and sanitized. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) suggested adding "sanitized" to ensure proper cleaning protocols.
   - **HB 307**: Expands the definition of where homestead food can be produced, allowing for non-traditional spaces (e.g., basements, garages) if they meet sanitary standards. Concerns were raised about ensuring cleanliness, and the committee delayed voting to allow further discussion.
   - **HB 304**: Proposes allowing QR codes for ingredient lists on products sold at home or farm stands, while maintaining allergen information on physical labels. The bill also permits email addresses instead of physical addresses for security reasons. It passed unanimously.
   - **HB 371**: Modifies the definition of "occasional food service establishment," allowing food to be taken home and adjusting the operational time frame to four out of 28 days. DHHS did not oppose the bill, as it posed no food safety risks.

2. **Recipe Alterations and Process Reviews**:
   - **HB 279**: Addresses the costly process of altering food recipes, providing leeway for small-scale producers. The bill passed unanimously.
   - **Homestead Foods Study**: Representative Peter Bixby introduced a bill to study recipe and process approval for homestead foods, aiming to address licensing and production issues.

### **Animal Welfare**

1. **Animal Cruelty Training**: The committee discussed a bill requiring law enforcement officers to receive training on animal cruelty. Debates centered on involving the state veterinarian's office and the role of law enforcement in handling such cases.

- Bills related to food production aimed to reduce regulatory burdens on small-scale producers while maintaining food safety standards.
- Amendments were proposed to address concerns raised by stakeholders, and several bills were moved to executive session for further review and voting.
- Future discussions and work sessions were scheduled to finalize amendments and address unresolved issues, particularly regarding homestead food production and landfill regulations.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the committee's commitment to promoting environmental sustainability, supporting local industries, and ensuring public health and safety.
