**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House Committee on Housing Meeting (February 11, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Housing convened on February 11, 2025, to address several bills aimed at tackling the state’s housing crisis. The discussions centered on balancing state mandates with local control, promoting affordable housing, and addressing practical concerns related to zoning, density, and landlord-tenant issues. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **1. Housing Density and Zoning Reforms**
The committee focused on a bill designed to increase housing density by addressing restrictive local zoning ordinances. Key points included:
- **Workforce Housing vs. Fair Market Housing**: Members emphasized prioritizing workforce housing over fair market housing, noting issues such as landlords raising rents in response to housing vouchers.
- **Landlord Discrimination**: Concerns were raised about landlords discriminating against tenants based on payment methods (e.g., housing vouchers). The bill sought to close this loophole and prevent illegal discrimination.
- **Density Standards and Neighborhood Definitions**: There was debate over how to define "neighborhood" for zoning purposes, with proposals ranging from a 1,000-foot radius to other criteria. The committee also discussed allowing property owners to build based on historical zoning or the majority density of nearby properties to make underutilized lots viable for development.
- **Streamlining Approval Processes**: The committee considered allowing local zoning administrators or permit technicians to verify compliance with density requirements, reducing the need for planning board involvement.
- **State vs. Local Control**: The bill was seen as a state-mandated effort to override restrictive local zoning ordinances, with the goal of increasing housing availability.

### **2. Private Roads, Parking, and Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**
Several bills addressing practical housing-related issues were debated:
- **HB 296 - Private Roads**: The committee discussed amendments to ensure emergency vehicle access and road maintenance on private roads. Concerns were raised about municipal oversight and disputes among property owners. Reps. Dumont and Howland were tasked with drafting an amendment to limit planning board involvement for existing private roads.
- **HB 382 - Parking Requirements**: A bill to remove municipalities' authority to mandate on-site parking requirements sparked debate. Rep. Howland proposed an amendment to simplify parking requirements to one space per unit, with flexibility for off-site parking. The committee was divided, with some members favoring the unamended bill and others supporting the amendment.
- **HB 577 - Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**: The committee reviewed proposed changes to a bill allowing ADUs, including removing the requirement for municipalities without zoning to create zoning ordinances. There was debate over ADU size limits (e.g., 750–950 square feet) and whether ADUs should remain subordinate to the primary dwelling. The Municipal Association indicated potential support if certain amendments, such as retaining local control over short-term rentals and owner-occupancy requirements, were included.

### **3. Workforce Housing, Short-Term Rentals, and Manufactured Housing**
The committee addressed broader housing issues, including workforce housing, short-term rentals, and manufactured housing:
- **Workforce Housing and ADU Size**: Amendments to a bill on workforce housing focused on ADU size, with a proposed standard of 950 square feet. The committee debated whether municipalities should retain authority to regulate ADU aesthetic standards, with some members opposing such regulations as bureaucratic overreach.
- **Short-Term Rental Regulations**: There was extensive discussion about the impact of short-term rentals on local housing markets and the tourism economy. Some members advocated for clear municipal authority to regulate short-term rentals, while others warned against overly restrictive measures that could harm tourism.
- **Manufactured Housing**: A bill allowing manufactured housing in residential zones was reviewed, with amendments proposed to clarify language and ensure municipalities had sufficient time to update zoning ordinances. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts between state and local housing standards.

### **4. Landlord-Tenant Laws and Housing Vouchers**
The committee considered bills related to landlord-tenant protections and housing vouchers:
- **Eviction and Rent Increase Notices**: One bill proposed extending the notice period for evictions to 60 days, sparking debate about the balance between tenant protections and landlord rights.
- **Housing Vouchers**: A bill prohibiting landlords from discriminating against tenants with housing vouchers was discussed. While some members argued that such a mandate could lead to rent inflation, others emphasized the need to protect vulnerable populations.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to draft amendments for several bills, review proposed language, and reconvene after the next housing committee meeting for further discussion and potential voting. The discussions highlighted ongoing tensions between state oversight, municipal autonomy, and the urgent need to address New Hampshire’s housing crisis. The committee’s efforts aimed to promote affordable housing, protect tenant rights, and support local economies while addressing practical concerns related to zoning, density, and housing development.
