### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Fish and Game and Marine Resources (February 5, 2025)

The NH House of Representatives meeting on February 5, 2025, focused on the Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee, addressing a wide range of topics related to wildlife management, outdoor recreation, public safety, and economic contributions. The meeting included detailed presentations from various divisions within the Fish and Game Department, discussions on proposed legislation, and considerations for future initiatives. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **Overview of the Fish and Game Department**

1. **Law Division**: Colonel Jordan provided an overview of the Law Division, which enforces hunting, fishing, and trapping regulations, manages nuisance animal calls, conducts rabies investigations, and leads search and rescue operations. The division includes specialized teams like dive units, K9 units, and drone teams. Despite being well-equipped, the division faces staffing challenges, with only 38 field officers covering the state and six open positions.

2. **Community Engagement and Education**: The department is increasingly involved in community policing, outdoor education programs (e.g., hunter safety, OHV safety), and public outreach. Initiatives like the Hike Safe program, which funds search and rescue operations through voluntary card purchases, have been highly successful, generating $300,000 annually.

3. **Marine Resources**: Commissioner Jim Tatone highlighted the economic importance of the Gulf of Maine, which accounts for 50% of seafood landings on the Eastern Seaboard, contributing over $3 billion to the economy.

### **Proposed Legislation and Key Discussions**

1. **HB 21: Air Rifles for Hunting**:
   - **Purpose**: To allow the use of air rifles for hunting big game (e.g., deer, bear, moose) in addition to small game.
   - **Details**: The bill emphasizes kinetic energy at the muzzle as a measure of lethality and ethical use. It allows the Fish and Game Department to set kinetic energy requirements in administrative rules for flexibility.
   - **Benefits**: Air rifles are quieter and safer in populated areas compared to traditional firearms. However, they are currently expensive and require specialized knowledge.
   - **Hunter Education**: The bill includes plans to incorporate air rifle training into hunter safety courses.
   - **Support**: The committee unanimously supported the bill, noting its potential as an alternative hunting method.

2. **HB 579: Fish and Game Guides Licensing**:
   - **Current Process**: Applicants must pass both written and oral exams, with the oral exam administered by licensed guides who own guide businesses. Concerns were raised about fairness and consistency.
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill shifts responsibility for administering both exams to Fish and Game officers, aiming to standardize the process and reduce conflicts of interest.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents, including the New Hampshire Guides Association, argued that experienced guides ensure high standards. Supporters emphasized the need for transparency and feedback for applicants.
   - **Alternative Solutions**: Suggestions included apprenticeship programs or guide schools to help applicants prepare without lowering standards.

3. **HB 61: Study Committee on Oyster Harvesting Laws**:
   - **Purpose**: To form a study committee addressing issues in commercial oyster harvesting, such as access, poaching, enforcement, and property rights.
   - **Support**: Testimony highlighted the economic and ecological benefits of oyster farming, including water filtration and job creation. The industry has grown to 95 licensed acres, with potential for expansion to 400 acres.

4. **HB 404: Hike Safe Card Expansion**:
   - **Purpose**: To expand the definition of "family" to include domestic partners, reflecting modern family structures and increasing program participation.
   - **Support**: The Hike Safe Card has been a successful funding mechanism for search and rescue operations, raising over $300,000 annually. The bill aims to make the program more inclusive.

5. **HB 647: Newborn Lifetime Hunting and Fishing License Fee**:
   - **Purpose**: To allow the executive director to adjust fees for newborn lifetime licenses, potentially increasing revenue despite a reduction in license sales.

6. **HB 655: Poaching and Hunting Violations**:
   - **Purpose**: To increase restitution for illegal taking of animals, mandate restitution, and establish a Class A misdemeanor for third-time offenders. The bill aims to deter repeat offenders and enhance penalties.
