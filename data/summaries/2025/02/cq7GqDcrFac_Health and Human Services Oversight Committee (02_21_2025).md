The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a meeting addressing a range of topics, with a significant focus on the state’s therapeutic cannabis program, health and human services initiatives, and legislative efforts to improve healthcare access and affordability. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **Therapeutic Cannabis Program**
The therapeutic cannabis program was a central topic, with updates on its operations, challenges, and legislative proposals to enhance patient access and reduce costs. Key points included:

1. **Program Efficiency**: The program is running smoothly, with registry ID cards issued efficiently and within statutory timeframes. Over $1.1 million in affordability discounts have been provided across three Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs).

2. **Low Program Uptake**: New Hampshire has one of the lowest participation rates in the nation, attributed to the program’s restrictive nature, limited qualifying conditions, and the availability of cheaper cannabis in neighboring states like Maine. Disparities in uptake between counties, such as Coos and Hillsboro, were noted, with demographic factors like population age playing a role.

3. **Legislative Proposals**: Several bills are under consideration to improve the program, including allowing ATCs to outsource non-intoxicating hemp-derived cannabinoids (e.g., CBD), permitting greenhouse cultivation, and converting ATCs to for-profit status. Home cultivation for patients is also supported as a cost-saving measure.

4. **Cost Barriers**: While the program ensures product quality (free of pesticides and herbicides), cost remains a significant barrier for patients. Increasing patient numbers could create economies of scale to lower prices.

5. **Provider Certification**: Most providers certify only a few patients, with a small number certifying over 100 patients. The program emphasizes the importance of the patient-provider relationship and integrating cannabis therapy into regular medical care.

6. **Educational Efforts**: The Therapeutic Cannabis Medical Oversight Board is developing educational materials about the risks of cannabis use in adolescence, aiming to create digestible, population-friendly documents for distribution at ATCs.

### **Health and Human Services (HHS) Initiatives**
Associate Commissioner Patricia Tilly provided updates on various HHS initiatives:

1. **Youth Development Center (YDC)**: Construction of the new YDC in Hampstead is progressing, with the facility expected to be operational by August 2026.

2. **ALS Registry**: The department is exploring existing data sets to reduce costs associated with developing a new system for tracking ALS cases.

3. **Alzheimer’s and Dementia Subcommittee**: Jenny Horan, representing the Alzheimer’s Association, reported on the subcommittee’s efforts to develop a state plan addressing gaps in care and services. The report included data on dementia care, instances of abuse and exploitation, caregiver strains, and available services.

4. **Medicaid Enhancement**: Olivia May, Director of Medicaid Enterprise Development, provided an update on the 12-month postpartum coverage extension in the Medicaid program. The state plan amendment was approved in November 2023, and initial data shows a significant percentage of women are receiving medical, mental health, and preventive services during the extended coverage period.

### **Budget Oversight and Legislative Discussions**
The committee discussed the need for better oversight of the therapeutic cannabis program’s budget, particularly in light of a projected $47 million shortfall in state lapses, with a significant portion attributed to HHS. Establishing a subcommittee to focus on HHS budget oversight was considered. Future discussions will involve the House and Senate finance committees, with a focus on legislative proposals to improve program efficiency and patient access.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with a light-hearted exchange about wine and cheese, highlighting the camaraderie among committee members. The committee plans to continue discussions on budget oversight, legislative proposals, and program effectiveness in future meetings, ensuring ongoing efforts to address healthcare challenges and improve access for New Hampshire residents.
