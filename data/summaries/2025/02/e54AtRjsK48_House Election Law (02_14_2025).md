### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (February 14, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a series of meetings on February 14, 2025, to discuss various bills related to election law, with a particular focus on absentee voting, voter identification, and voter registration. The discussions highlighted the ongoing tension between ensuring election security and maintaining voter accessibility, with representatives debating the implications of proposed legislation on different segments of the population, including elderly, disabled, low-income, and student voters. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from the three segments of the meeting:

---

#### **1. Absentee Voting Procedures**
The first segment focused on a bill related to absentee voting, which proposed several changes to the existing process:
- **Absentee Ballot Requirements**: The bill outlined conditions under which voters could request absentee ballots, including disability, confinement, religious observance, employment obligations, caregiving responsibilities, and winter storm warnings affecting voting accessibility.
- **Notarization and Identification**: The bill required absentee ballot applications to be signed and notarized, along with a color copy of a valid government-issued photo ID. Concerns were raised about the accessibility and cost of these requirements, particularly for elderly, infirm, or low-income voters.
- **Verification and Security**: Representatives debated the balance between election security and voter accessibility. Some argued that the proposed requirements could create barriers, while others emphasized the need for consistent verification processes across in-person and absentee voting.
- **Technology and Alternatives**: Suggestions were made to explore remote identity verification technologies used in banking and finance, such as submitting photos of IDs via email. However, concerns about feasibility and cybersecurity implications were raised.
- **Affidavit System**: Some representatives advocated for aligning absentee ballot procedures with in-person voting by using affidavits for identity verification, similar to past practices.
- **Concerns About Disenfranchisement**: Several members expressed concerns that the proposed requirements could disenfranchise voters, particularly those without access to notaries, copiers, or technology.

The meeting concluded without a resolution, with the subcommittee planning to revisit the bill in future sessions.

#### **2. Voter Identification and Absentee Ballots**
The second segment focused on several bills related to voter identification and absentee ballots:
- **HB 472**: The subcommittee recommended that HB 472, which required voters to prove domicile, be deemed "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL). The bill was criticized for conflating voter registration and check-in processes, leading to confusion. The motion to ITL passed unanimously.
- **Voter ID Requirements**: Discussions centered on the use of out-of-state driver's licenses, student IDs, and other forms of ID for voter check-in and absentee ballots. Concerns were raised about the practicality of enforcing certain ID requirements, especially for elderly or disabled voters.
- **HB 684**: This bill aimed to prevent the use of student identification cards for obtaining a ballot and instead required government-issued IDs. The subcommittee noted inconsistencies in the bill's language and intent, particularly regarding the exclusion of student IDs.
- **Absentee Ballot Requirements (HB 686)**: The subcommittee began discussing HB 686, which required voters to provide government-issued photo ID and a notarized application for absentee ballots. The bill also mandated in-person curing of errors in applications.
- **Challenges with Voter ID Laws**: Testimony highlighted potential issues with requiring in-state driver's licenses for voting, especially for military families, students, and seniors. The subcommittee acknowledged the need for reasonable accommodations and the importance of not disenfranchising voters.

The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussing HB 686 and other related bills in future sessions.

#### **3. Voter Registration and Non-Resident Voting**
The third segment focused on voter registration and the impacts of non-resident voting:
- **Mission and Scope**: The subcommittee's mission was to evaluate and consolidate various 2025 House bills related to voter registration and non-resident voting. The subcommittee reviewed proposed legislation for constitutionality, alignment with federal election law, and legal precedents.
- **Bills Under Review**: The subcommittee reviewed 10 specific House bills (HB 27, 289, 323, 365, 385, 418, 472, 618, 684, 686) that had already had public hearings. Additional bills were expected to be assigned after public hearings.
- **Voter ID and Domicile**: The subcommittee discussed bills related to voter ID requirements, particularly focusing on the use of out-of-state driver's licenses and student IDs for voting. There was debate about whether student IDs, particularly from state institutions like UNH, should be considered government-issued IDs. The subcommittee also discussed the need to clarify the distinction between proving identity and proving domicile.
- **Challenges with Voter Verification**: The subcommittee considered the logistical challenges of verifying voter identity and domicile, especially for same-day registrants. They discussed the potential for longer lines and chaos at polling places if additional verification steps were required.
- **Coordination with DMV**: The subcommittee discussed HB 133, which would require the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to contact voters who used out-of-state driver's licenses to remind them to obtain a New Hampshire driver's license. The subcommittee noted the low compliance rate with this requirement in the past.
- **Public Testimony**: The subcommittee heard from a lobbyist, Michael O'Brien, who emphasized that IDs are used to prove identity, not necessarily domicile, and that voters should not be required to prove domicile at the polling place unless they are registering to vote.
- **Next Steps**: The subcommittee considered returning certain bills to the main election law committee for further review, particularly those that conflate registration and voting processes. They also discussed the need for additional data on the use of out-of-state driver's licenses in elections.
