**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Committee Meeting (February 3, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Committee convened on February 3, 2025, to discuss several education-related bills, with a primary focus on **House Bill 699 (HB 699)**, which proposes changes to special education policies and definitions. The meeting also addressed other bills, including **HB 222**, **HB 754**, **HB 753**, **HB 677**, **HB 68**, and **HB 329**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. House Bill 699 (HB 699): Special Education Definitions and Policies**
- **Purpose**: HB 699 aims to clarify special education definitions, ensure students receive specialized instruction from qualified professionals, and prevent inappropriate educational environments (e.g., storage closets or boiler rooms).  
- **Concerns and Criticisms**:  
  - **Clarity and Drafting Issues**: Stakeholders, including parents, educators, and advocates, criticized the bill’s language as unclear and potentially restrictive. Definitions of terms like "specially designed instruction," "related services," and "educational environments" were seen as overly complex and open to misinterpretation.  
  - **Impact on Students**: Parents shared personal stories, emphasizing that the bill could limit access to out-of-district placements, specialized programs, and inclusive education. There were fears it might lead to more restrictive environments for students with disabilities.  
  - **Federal Compliance**: Concerns were raised that the bill’s language could conflict with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), particularly regarding the least restrictive environment (LRE) mandate.  
  - **Role of Paraprofessionals**: The bill’s implications for paraprofessionals (paras) were questioned, with stakeholders arguing it could limit their ability to effectively support students.  
  - **Loss of Protections**: Removing or altering definitions like "functionally blind" or "related services" was seen as potentially stripping away important protections for students.  

- **Support for Collaboration and Interim Study**: Many stakeholders urged the committee to refer the bill to an interim study for further review and collaboration, emphasizing the need for clear, inclusive, and effective legislation.  

- **Proposed Amendments**: An amendment was introduced to address some concerns, such as reinserting general education settings into the definition of educational environments. However, critics argued it did not go far enough to ensure compliance with IDEA and best practices for inclusion.  

#### **2. House Bill 222 (HB 222): Repealing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Requirement**
- **Purpose**: HB 222 seeks to repeal the requirement for MOUs between chartered public schools and school districts regarding special education services.  
- **Sponsor’s Argument**: Representative Peggy Balon argued that MOUs have created unnecessary administrative burdens and legal costs without improving service delivery.  
- **Supporting Testimony**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators and the New Hampshire Alliance for Public Charter Schools supported the repeal, stating that MOUs have not positively impacted students.  
- **Concerns Raised**: Some committee members questioned whether removing MOUs would lead to unresolved disputes, but supporters argued that collaboration and existing legal frameworks (e.g., IEPs) are sufficient to ensure services.  

#### **3. Other Bills Discussed**
- **House Bill 754 (HB 754): Special Education Discovery Process**: The bill aims to establish automatic discovery and due process hearings for enforcing special education rights. Amendments were proposed to streamline the process and reduce burdens on parents.  
- **House Bill 753 (HB 753): Expedited Due Process Hearings**: The bill seeks to ensure that expedited hearings for special education rights do not take longer than regular hearings.  
- **House Bill 677 (HB 677): EpiPen Requirement in Schools**: The bill requires schools to maintain a supply of EpiPens for emergency use and received unanimous support.  
- **House Bill 68 (HB 68): Best Interest Placements**: The bill mandates that school districts approve requests for best interest placements within the same district unless there is a valid reason to deny them. Concerns were raised about its impact on school planning and staffing.  
- **House Bill 329 (HB 329): School District Policies on Air Quality and Temperature**: The committee recommended the bill as inexpedient to legislate, indicating that the issue may not require new legislation.  

### **Key Themes**
- **Inclusivity**: Stakeholders consistently emphasized the importance of inclusive education for students with disabilities, ensuring access to general education classrooms and peer interactions.  
- **Collaboration**: There was a strong call for collaborative efforts to refine legislation, involving all impacted parties to avoid unintended consequences.  
- **Clarity**: The need for clear, consistent definitions and language in bills was a recurring theme to prevent misinterpretation and ensure students’ needs are met.  
- **Federal Compliance**: Ensuring alignment with federal laws, particularly IDEA, was a critical concern across discussions.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting revealed significant opposition to HB 699 in its current form, with stakeholders urging the committee to either revise the bill significantly or refer it to an interim study for further development. Other bills, such as HB 222 and HB 677, received mixed reactions, with some garnering support and others facing concerns about implementation and impact. The overarching goal of the discussions was to ensure that New Hampshire’s education policies support the rights and needs of all students, particularly those with disabilities. The committee planned to reconvene for further hearings and amendments.
