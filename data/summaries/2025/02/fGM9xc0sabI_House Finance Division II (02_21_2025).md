The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused extensively on the regulation, operation, and financial management of gaming activities in the state, with particular attention to the New Hampshire Lottery Commission’s budget and the broader implications of expanded gaming. The discussions revolved around historical horse racing (HHR), video lottery terminals (VLTs), sports betting, lottery operations, and their impact on state revenue and local communities. Here is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key points:

### **Gaming Regulation and Implementation**
1. **Historical Horse Racing (HHR) and VLTs**: Representatives discussed the transition of HHR permits to new VLT machines, which involves significant investment but can be converted at a cost of $3,000 to $4,000 per machine. It was assumed that all permit holders would adopt the new machines based on ongoing conversations.
2. **Legislative Oversight**: The Lottery Commission emphasized that any major changes, such as introducing new gaming products like VLTs, would require legislative approval. They stressed the importance of adhering to proper legislative processes, even when legal opinions suggest they could act independently.
3. **Bills and Budgets**: Multiple bills related to gaming were discussed, including **House Bill 728** (addressing VLTs), Senate bills, and provisions in the governor’s budget (**HB1** and **HB2**). The House Ways and Means Committee will review HB 728 and wait for the House to set policy on VLTs before making decisions.
4. **Local Control**: Towns and cities currently have the authority to opt out of selling lottery tickets and hosting sports betting or keno. However, this provision does not extend to VLTs, though a bill has been proposed to grant towns this option.

### **Revenue and Financial Performance**
1. **Sports Betting and Lottery Revenue**: New Hampshire generates substantial revenue from sports betting, with 85% of activity conducted online. The state receives approximately 43% of the profit from bets placed within its borders. The iLottery, entirely internet-based, allows residents to purchase lottery tickets and play interactive games online.
2. **Scratch Tickets**: The Lottery Commission requested an increase in the authorized amount for purchasing scratch tickets from $6 million to $15 million, reflecting increased sales and profitability.
3. **Budget and Profitability**: The Lottery’s net profitability to the state has more than tripled since 2011, with gross sales increasing from $250 million a decade ago to $633 million currently. Profits contribute to the Education Trust Fund, with $207 million projected for FY 2024.
4. **Future Revenue Estimates**: The governor’s budget includes increased revenue estimates for FY 2026 and 2027, driven by factors like sports betting and the introduction of historic horse racing machines. The Lottery anticipates further revenue growth as more gaming machines come online.

### **Regulation, Compliance, and Social Responsibility**
1. **Geofencing Technology**: The state uses geofencing to ensure that only residents within New Hampshire can place bets or purchase lottery tickets online. This system has been rigorously tested for compliance.
2. **Addiction Prevention**: The state has measures in place to protect individuals from gambling addiction, including self-exclusion lists and deposit limits.
3. **Security and Facility Upgrades**: The Lottery requested funding to update its outdated security system, which runs on Windows 7 and is incompatible with current infrastructure. They also sought ADA-compliant upgrades to their entranceway.

### **Questions and Concerns**
1. **Operating Expenses**: Representatives raised questions about the Lottery’s operating expenses, which have increased by 76% from 2022 to 2025. Charlie McIntyre, the Lottery’s Director, explained that this increase is due to additional employees, advertising, and the launch of new products like sports betting and internet gaming.
2. **Societal Impact**: Some representatives expressed concerns about the potential societal impact of expanded gaming, emphasizing the need for careful scrutiny of expenses and thorough understanding of the Lottery’s operations.

### **Self-Funding Agency**
The Lottery operates as a self-funding agency, spending from its own revenue stream rather than relying on state appropriations. Any unspent funds contribute directly to the Education Trust Fund.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of proper regulation, legislative oversight, and maximizing revenue from gaming activities while addressing concerns about addiction and local control. Representatives emphasized the need for careful management of expenses and a balanced approach to expanding gaming opportunities to ensure both financial benefits and societal well-being. The Lottery’s robust financial performance and contributions to the Education Trust Fund were highlighted as key successes, but challenges such as outdated infrastructure and the societal impact of gaming expansion remain areas of focus.
