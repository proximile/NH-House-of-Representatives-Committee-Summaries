The New Hampshire House of Representatives' House Finance Division I meeting on February 19, 2025, focused on a wide range of budgetary, operational, and administrative matters across various state agencies and boards. The discussions centered on optimizing efficiency, ensuring financial sustainability, and providing cost-effective services to the public. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points addressed during the meeting:

### **Budgetary and Operational Discussions**
1. **House Bill 1 (HB1) Budget Cuts**:  
   - The committee reviewed proposed budget cuts, including a $500,000 annual reduction to the legislative branch’s budget, primarily targeting personnel costs. Concerns were raised about the impact of these cuts and the need for detailed line-item reductions.

2. **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**:  
   - Executive Director Jan Goodwin presented the NHRS budget, highlighting positive funding progress, operational improvements, and strategic planning. The budget includes increases for IT upgrades, modernization projects, and new staff positions. Committee members questioned the justification for certain increases, particularly in healthcare costs and staffing.

3. **Community Development Finance Authority (CDFA)**:  
   - Executive Director Marty discussed the $560,000 budget request for administering the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which leverages $19 million in federal funds for community development projects. The committee emphasized the importance of ensuring project completion and cost-effectiveness.

4. **Liquor Commission (NHLC)**:  
   - Chairman Joseph Mica addressed the NHLC budget, including increases in enforcement salaries, federal funds for tobacco compliance, and transfers to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The committee questioned the transparency of shared positions and contract increases.  
   - The NHLC transitioned to a cloud-based Microsoft D365 system, which requires more maintenance and support. Workers’ compensation claims spiked during COVID-19 but have since been streamlined. Underperforming stores are being considered for consolidation, and liquor sales trends show a shift toward premium products, though overall consumption is declining due to cannabis sales in neighboring states.

5. **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)**:  
   - The OPLC proposed a 10% increase in licensing fees to address a $1 million budget shortfall. The office manages over 212,000 licenses, with a slight decline post-pandemic. Increased costs for consultants and technical investigations were noted. Several temporary positions are being converted to permanent roles, and a project manager is being added to oversee IT projects, including a new licensing portal.

6. **Medicaid Expansion and Funding**:  
   - The Medicaid Advantage program requires non-federal funding, with potential quarterly requests for additional funds. An additional $1-2 million was requested for the current year to address shortfalls.

### **State Boards and Their Operations**
1. **Board of Tax and Land Appeals**:  
   - The board faces challenges in filling a statutory tax review appraiser position due to higher pay in the private sector. A proposal to remove the appraiser license requirement was discussed to make the position more flexible. The board provides a low-cost alternative to the courts for tax appeals, handling around 100 cases annually, with many settling before hearing.

2. **Housing Appeals Board**:  
   - The board offers an alternative to Superior Court for appeals from local zoning and planning boards, handling approximately 33 cases per year with a $250 filing fee. The board has a strong track record, with only two of its decisions overturned by the Supreme Court. Its annual budget is approximately $550,000.

3. **Public Employee Labor Relations Board (PELRB)**:  
   - Executive Director Doug Ingersol outlined the board’s role in administering collective bargaining laws, handling unfair labor practices, and facilitating bargaining unit formation. The board has averaged about 106 case filings annually over the past five years. A request was made to increase the per diem for board members from $50 to $250, unchanged since 1985.

4. **Right to Know Ombudsman**:  
   - Thomas FC discussed the office’s role in resolving disputes under RSA 91a (New Hampshire’s Right to Know law). The office has handled 78 cases since its inception in January 2023. Its future is uncertain as it is set to expire on July 1, 2025, unless renewed.

### **Fee Adjustments and Revenue Considerations**
- Discussions included potential fee increases for various state services to address revenue shortfalls, such as licensing fees for the OPLC and NHLC. Concerns were raised about the impact of these increases on businesses and individuals.

### **Efficiency and Transparency**
- Throughout the meeting, committee members emphasized the importance of transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the operations of state agencies and boards. Questions were raised about the justification for budget increases, the effectiveness of programs, and the potential for cost savings.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s focus on scrutinizing budget proposals, ensuring financial sustainability, and optimizing the operations of state agencies and boards. Discussions highlighted the need for transparency, efficiency, and cost-effective solutions to serve the public effectively. The committee aimed to complete initial budget reviews by the end of the week and make final decisions in subsequent meetings.
