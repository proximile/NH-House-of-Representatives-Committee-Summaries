Below is a detailed summary of the key bills and debates:

- This bill sought to strengthen grandparents’ rights to maintain consistent relationships with their grandchildren, particularly in cases where parents struggle with issues like substance abuse.

- This bill aimed to codify parental rights in education and healthcare decisions for their children, including access to school and medical records, consent for medical procedures, and the ability to object to certain instructional materials.

  - Vagueness in terms like "morality," "sex," and "discipline" could lead to enforcement challenges.  
  - Potential barriers to medical care for minors, particularly those with chronic illnesses or rare diseases.  
  - Negative impact on LGBTQ+ youth, as the bill could force schools to disclose a student’s LGBTQ+ identity to unsupportive parents, increasing risks of homelessness and suicide.

- **Amendments**:  
  - Proposals to clarify language and remove criminal penalties for educators were discussed.  
- **Opposition**:

- This bill proposed requiring judges to consider **known mental health conditions** of parents when making custody decisions, emphasizing the best interest of the child.  
- **Support**:

  - The bill aimed to provide judges with critical information without disclosing private medical records.  
- **Opposition**:  
  - Mental health advocates, including NAMI New Hampshire and the Disability Rights Center, argued the bill stigmatized mental illness and could deter individuals from seeking treatment.

- **Proposed Amendments**:

#### **Other Bills**  
- **Marital Property Settlements**: A bill setting standards for enforcing marital property settlements in divorce cases was discussed and voted to pass, emphasizing the need for clear guidelines.
