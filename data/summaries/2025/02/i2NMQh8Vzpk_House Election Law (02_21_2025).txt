The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Election Law Subcommittee held multiple meetings in February and March to address a range of election-related legislation, focusing on voter registration, absentee voting, proof of citizenship, and the balance between election security and voter accessibility. The discussions highlighted the complexities of election law, the tension between preventing fraud and ensuring voter access, and the need for legal clarity and consistency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and issues addressed across the meetings:

### **Legislation Overview**
The subcommittee reviewed several bills, with **House Bill 217** and **House Bill 365** receiving significant attention. **HB 217** focuses on streamlining absentee voter registration affidavits, requiring voters to attest to their citizenship, domicile, and age, while imposing penalties for false information. **HB 365** proposes a process for verifying citizenship for voters who cannot provide documentation, including provisions for indigent voters to obtain vouchers for necessary documents. Additionally, the subcommittee briefly discussed **House Bill 385**, which repeals **HB 1569** and reverts to pre-1569 statutes, with plans to compare the two to ensure no unintended changes.

### **Citizenship Verification and Voter ID**
A central issue across the meetings was the requirement for proof of citizenship and voter identification. While all members agreed that citizenship is a valid qualification for voting, concerns were raised about the potential burden on marginalized groups, such as homeless individuals, the elderly, or those without easy access to documents like birth certificates or passports. The subcommittee debated whether affidavits (sworn statements) should suffice for voter registration, with some members arguing that affidavits have historically worked well, while others expressed concerns about potential fraud, citing legal cases in other states involving non-citizen voting. New Hampshire is one of only eight states requiring proof of citizenship for first-time voters, and the subcommittee acknowledged pending lawsuits that may influence future legislation.

### **Absentee Voting and Notary Requirements**
The subcommittee extensively discussed absentee voting, including the process for requesting and submitting absentee ballots. Concerns were raised about the lack of identification scrutiny for absentee voters compared to in-person voters. The committee debated the necessity of requiring notarization for absentee ballots, particularly for disabled individuals who may face challenges in obtaining a notary. Members noted that most absentee ballot fraud cases involve household members filling out ballots for others, which notarization would not prevent. The subcommittee also reviewed the **CEO v. Garder** case, which ruled against signature matching for absentee ballots due to lack of notice, uneven enforcement, and moderators’ lack of expertise in handwriting analysis.

### **Same-Day Registration and Voter Fraud**
The subcommittee explored issues related to same-day voter registration and the potential for voter fraud, particularly double voting. They noted that most detected fraud cases involve individuals voting in multiple jurisdictions, often due to having multiple residences. While some members emphasized the need for stricter measures to prevent fraud, others highlighted the importance of ensuring that laws do not disenfranchise eligible voters or complicate same-day registration.

### **Legal Precedence and Constitutional Concerns**
The subcommittee reviewed several legal precedents, including the 2018 New Hampshire Supreme Court opinion and the 2020 *Caroline Casey v. New Hampshire Secretary of State* case, which addressed domicile and residency requirements for voting, particularly concerning college students. The court ruled that individuals who claim New Hampshire as their domicile for voting purposes must comply with the same legal requirements as residents, including motor vehicle registration and driver’s license fees. The subcommittee also referenced the Anderson-Burdick framework, which courts use to evaluate voting laws based on the burden they impose on the right to vote, underscoring the need to balance security with accessibility.

### **Election Integrity and Human Error**
Members acknowledged that discrepancies in vote counts often result from human error rather than fraud, highlighting the challenges local election officials face in updating voter checklists and ensuring accurate vote counts. While there are isolated instances of inappropriate voting, there is no evidence of widespread or organized voter fraud in New Hampshire.

### **Public Testimony and Expert Input**
Secretary of State David Scanlan and ACLU Deputy Legal Director Henry Clement provided testimony, emphasizing the importance of applying the law equally to all voters, including college students, and ensuring that absentee voting is not overly burdensome. Clement discussed the residency and domicile distinctions, the *Casey* case, and the *CEO v. Garder* case, highlighting the complexities of enforcing residency requirements for voting and motor vehicle registration.

### **Next Steps and Broader Policy Considerations**
The subcommittee planned to meet again on **March 7th** and **March 14th** to continue discussions, with additional sessions possible if needed. Members emphasized the need for consistent, fair, and secure election policies, recognizing the importance of thorough research and legal guidance in shaping legislation. They also discussed potential improvements to the absentee voting process, such as requiring notarization or other forms of verification, to ensure the integrity of absentee ballots.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, the meetings underscored the challenges of crafting election laws that balance security, accessibility, and fairness. The subcommittee’s discussions reflected a commitment to addressing these complexities while ensuring that New Hampshire’s election processes remain robust and inclusive.
