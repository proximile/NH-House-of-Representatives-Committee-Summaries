**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Meeting (02/05/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Committee convened on February 5, 2025, to discuss several education-related bills. The meeting featured debates on topics ranging from curriculum mandates and school budgeting transparency to bullying prevention and administrative costs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the session:

---

### **1. Curriculum and Health Education Bills**
Several bills focused on mandating specific educational content in schools sparked significant debate:

- **House Bill 667**: This bill proposes requiring students to watch a three-minute video on biological development as a graduation requirement. Supporters argued it provides essential information on human development, while critics contended it was not evidence-based, potentially misleading, and an overreach into local curriculum decisions. Similar concerns were raised about the "Meet Baby Olivia" video, which demonstrates gestational development.

- **House Bill 662**: This bill would mandate public schools to include discussions of abortion procedures and the viewing of medically accurate, age-appropriate videos during health education classes. Supporters, including New Hampshire Right to Life, emphasized the need for accurate information to inform students. Opponents, including school administrators, criticized the bill for eroding local control, questioned its age appropriateness, and raised concerns about the Attorney General’s enforcement role and implementation costs.

- **House Bill 730**: This bill seeks to educate students about adoption during health education for grades 9-12 and in college. Supporters highlighted its importance in informing students about adoption options, particularly in cases of unplanned pregnancies. Critics expressed concerns that it might create barriers for students seeking STI/STD testing and education.

### **2. School Budget Transparency and Administrative Costs**
The committee discussed bills aimed at increasing transparency and voter control over school budgets and administrative spending:

- **House Bill 557**: This bill proposes adding detailed financial information (e.g., average cost per pupil, enrollment trends, teacher-to-administrator ratios) to school budget ballots. Supporters argued it would increase transparency and voter awareness, while opponents, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association, noted that such information is already available through public hearings and voter guides, making the bill redundant and costly. Questions were also raised about its applicability to SB2 and non-SB2 districts and the definition of "administrator."

- **House Bill 564**: This bill would require School Administrative Unit (SAU) budgets to be separated from school district budgets and placed on ballots for independent voter approval. Supporters emphasized the need for transparency and voter control over administrative costs, which have grown significantly. Opponents argued the bill was unnecessary, potentially confusing, and redundant with existing laws that already require SAU costs to be broken out.

### **3. Bullying and Discrimination Prevention**
The committee addressed bills aimed at improving data collection, reporting, and intervention for bullying and hate-based incidents:

- **House Bill 673**: This bill seeks to improve data collection on bullying and hate-based incidents by requiring schools to report incidents to the state at the end of each semester. The data would be made publicly accessible and shared with the Attorney General’s office for trend analysis. The discussion clarified the distinction between hate crimes and hateful acts, with the bill focusing on the latter. Concerns were raised about the lack of resources for accurate reporting and the need for structured processes.

- **House Bill 108**: This bill clarifies which school district is responsible for investigating cross-district bullying incidents, particularly cyberbullying. The New Hampshire School Boards Association proposed an amendment to encourage collaboration among principals from all involved districts. The discussion highlighted the challenges of addressing incidents that occur off school property or involve students from different states, as well as the importance of parental involvement in investigations.

### **4. Administrative Costs and Efficiency**
The committee examined concerns about the growth of administrative costs in school districts and proposed solutions:

- **Administrative Costs**: The discussion highlighted the unchecked growth of administrative positions, such as assistant superintendents, and the lack of transparency in SAU budgets. Proposed solutions included requiring SAUs to present transparent budgets in separate warrant articles, allowing voters to directly vote on administrative spending.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**
1. **Curriculum Control**: Debates over curriculum mandates revealed tensions between state-level requirements and local control, with concerns about age appropriateness, cost, and enforcement mechanisms.
2. **Transparency and Voter Empowerment**: Bills aimed at increasing budget transparency and voter control over administrative spending were met with mixed reactions, with supporters emphasizing accountability and opponents citing redundancy and logistical challenges.
3. **Bullying Prevention**: The committee focused on improving data collection, reporting, and intervention strategies for bullying and hate-based incidents, with an emphasis on collaboration and early prevention.
4. **Administrative Efficiency**: Concerns about the growth of administrative costs and the need for transparency in SAU budgets were central to discussions, with proposals to empower voters in budgetary decisions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of balancing state mandates with local autonomy, ensuring transparency in school funding, and addressing critical issues like bullying and administrative efficiency. While there was broad agreement on the importance of transparency and student safety, the discussions highlighted the need for clarity, collaboration, and careful consideration of the practical implications of proposed legislation. The committee plans to hold further work sessions to refine the bills and address outstanding concerns.
