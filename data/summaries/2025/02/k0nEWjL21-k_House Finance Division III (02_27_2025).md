The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III meeting on February 27, 2025, featured extensive discussions on behavioral health, homelessness, substance misuse, and recovery programs. The meeting highlighted the state’s efforts to address critical issues through strategic investments, legislative processes, and community partnerships, while also grappling with funding challenges and gaps in services.

### **Behavioral Health and Mental Health Services**
1. **Mission Zero and Crisis Response**: The state’s "Mission Zero" initiative aims to eliminate emergency department boarding for mental health services. Key investments include certified community behavioral health clinics, crisis stabilization centers, and supportive housing. Progress has been made in reducing wait times and increasing access to mental health beds, but Medicaid funding uncertainties remain a concern. The state’s rapid response crisis system, including the 988 suicide prevention lifeline, mobile crisis units, and crisis stabilization centers, was emphasized as a critical tool for reducing emergency room visits.

2. **Suicide Prevention and Data Tracking**: The Suicide Prevention Council and the Chief Medical Examiner’s annual report were discussed, with data on suicide rates and trends playing a vital role in shaping prevention efforts.

3. **Residential Treatment for Youth**: The state faces challenges in providing residential treatment for children and youth with complex needs, with 339 children currently in residential care. High costs and unique needs were highlighted, along with the importance of both in-state and out-of-state facilities.

4. **Critical Time Intervention (CTI)**: The CTI program, which supports individuals transitioning from acute care settings back into the community, was discussed. The program focuses on basic needs like housing and food, and readmission rates are tracked to measure success.

### **Housing and Homelessness**
1. **Recovery and Supportive Housing**: The state has expanded supportive housing despite a housing crunch, using ARPA funds and partnerships with organizations like NFI North. Landlord incentive programs and bridge subsidies were discussed as essential tools for transitioning individuals from inpatient settings to stable housing.

2. **Homeless Services**: The Bureau of Homeless Services focuses on addressing homelessness linked to mental health and substance use. Key programs include emergency shelters, rapid rehousing, and youth transitional housing. The annual point-in-time homeless count is crucial for funding allocations.

3. **Homelessness Prevention**: Programs aimed at preventing homelessness through rental assistance and supportive services were highlighted, with an emphasis on keeping individuals housed to promote self-sufficiency.

### **Substance Abuse and Recovery Programs**
1. **State-Funded Recovery Housing**: The certification process for recovery houses and the importance of medication for addiction treatment in state-funded housing were discussed. The State Opioid Response Grant funds various programs, including doorway systems across the state.

2. **Overdose Prevention**: The distribution of Narcan (naloxone) and its effectiveness in reducing overdose deaths, particularly those involving fentanyl, was emphasized. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) was also noted as a critical tool.

3. **Gambling Addiction**: The absence of gambling addiction coverage in the behavioral health budget was briefly discussed, with potential funding roles for the Lottery Commission.

### **Budget and Funding Discussions**
1. **Funding Challenges**: Concerns were raised about potential Medicaid cuts and their impact on behavioral health services. The meeting addressed the complexities of funding mental health services, including the mix of federal and state funds, Medicaid reimbursements, and the challenges faced by Community Mental Health Centers due to uncompensated care.

2. **Opioid Abatement Trust Fund**: The fund, established through settlements with pharmaceutical companies, supports various initiatives, including housing and community programs.

3. **Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs**: The commission’s role in allocating funds, its transparency, and its strategic planning process were outlined. The commission’s flexibility in funding and its efforts to address gaps in services were highlighted.

4. **Juvenile Court Diversion Programs**: These programs aim to divert at-risk youth from the criminal justice system, with community-based organizations playing a key role.

### **Prevention and Education**

2. **Public Comment**: Representatives from organizations like the Community Behavioral Health Association and New Futures provided input, emphasizing the importance of continued funding for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery programs, as well as children’s behavioral health services.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored New Hampshire’s comprehensive approach to addressing behavioral health, homelessness, and substance misuse through coordinated funding, strategic planning, and community-based initiatives. While progress has been made, challenges remain, particularly in securing sustainable funding and addressing gaps in services.
