The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee meeting on February 6, 2025, focused on **House Bill 637**, which aimed to address an oversight in **Senate Bill 57** (2023). SB 57, incorporated into the 2023 budget, adjusted retirement benefits for state employees but unintentionally excluded retirees who had already retired before its enactment. HB 637 sought to rectify this by ensuring these retirees received the same benefits.

Key points discussed:

1. **Background**: SB 57 was a costly bill, with a fiscal impact of $1.4 million to the state and $5.74 million to municipalities. It was included in the 2023 budget to avoid passing a separate, expensive bill. However, it excluded pre-enactment retirees, which HB 637 aimed to address.

2. **Fiscal Impact**: The New Hampshire Retirement System projected an increase in actuarial liability by $45 million due to SB 57, to be amortized over 20 years. HB 637 would add further financial burdens, estimated at $1.4 million annually for the state and $5.74 million for municipalities.

3. **Policy vs. Oversight**: The subcommittee debated whether the exclusion of pre-enactment retirees was an oversight or a deliberate policy decision. Testimony from stakeholders, including retirees, indicated it was an oversight, while committee analysis suggested it was a policy choice made due to financial constraints.

4. **Testimony**: Retirees, including Karen Irwin, testified that the exclusion was unfair and based on a misinterpretation of "retiree members" in the fiscal note. They argued the language of SB 57 should have included all retirees, not just active employees.

5. **Committee Discussion**: The subcommittee considered the fairness of the bill versus its financial implications. Some members felt the bill was necessary to correct an oversight, while others argued it was a policy decision that should not be revisited due to the significant costs.

6. **Vote**: The subcommittee voted **3-2** to recommend HB 637 as **inexpedient to legislate**, meaning they advised against moving the bill forward. The decision was largely based on the financial burden and the belief that the exclusion was a deliberate policy choice rather than an oversight.

The meeting highlighted the tension between fairness for retirees and fiscal responsibility, with the subcommittee ultimately deciding against advancing the bill.
