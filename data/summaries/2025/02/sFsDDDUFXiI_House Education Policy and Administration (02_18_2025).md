**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Meeting (February 18, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Education Policy and Administration Committee convened on February 18, 2025, to discuss and debate several key education-related bills and resolutions. The meeting focused on addressing issues such as bullying, open enrollment, school choice, and educational equity, while also considering the implications of proposed legislation on local control, funding, and student rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Topics and Discussions:**

#### **1. Bullying and Cyberbullying**
The committee explored the complexities of addressing bullying and cyberbullying, particularly in cases involving multiple school districts or cross-state incidents. Key points included:
- **Interstate Coordination**: The need for clear protocols and interstate compacts to facilitate investigations and policy enforcement across state lines was emphasized.
- **Role of State Agencies**: Discussions highlighted the roles of the Attorney General’s office, law enforcement, and the Human Rights Commission in addressing bullying and discrimination.
- **Legislative Refinement**: The committee reviewed three bills (HB 108, HB 384, and HB 673) related to bullying, proposing amendments to clarify the roles of principals, School Resource Officers (SROs), and the use of evidence-based interventions. No formal action was taken, but further discussions were planned.

#### **2. Open Enrollment and School Choice**
House Bill 741, which proposes **mandatory open enrollment** for public schools, was a central focus of the meeting. The bill would allow students to attend any public school regardless of district residency, with funding following the student. Key points included:
- **Arguments in Favor**:
  - **Parental Choice**: Supporters, including Americans for Prosperity, argued that open enrollment provides families with flexibility to meet diverse needs, such as childcare, proximity to workplaces, or care for aging family members.
  - **Military Families**: Amendment 0336 H prioritized enrollment for children of military personnel, addressing the challenges of frequent relocations.
  - **Public School Funding**: Open enrollment keeps public dollars within the public school system, countering criticisms of voucher programs.

- **Concerns and Opposition**:
  - **Inequities**: Critics argued that the bill exacerbates existing inequalities, favoring families with means to transport students and disadvantaging low-income families, students with disciplinary issues, or those with special needs.
  - **Local Control**: Opponents, including the American Federation of Teachers New Hampshire and the New Hampshire School Boards Association (NHSBA), argued that the bill undermines local control by mandating open enrollment, disrupting existing tuition agreements and budgeting processes.
  - **Budgeting and Capacity**: School districts raised concerns about managing fluctuating enrollment numbers, transportation logistics, and the potential impact on local tax rates and budgets.
  - **Academic Disparities**: Questions were raised about how schools would accommodate students transferring mid-year, particularly if there were mismatches in curriculum or academic levels.

#### **3. Other Bills and Resolutions**
The committee discussed and voted on several other education-related bills:
- **HB 662 (Abortion Education)**: A bill requiring the discussion of abortion procedures and the viewing of specific videos during health education was debated. The committee voted 18-0 to recommend "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), effectively killing the bill.
- **HCR 6 (Superintendent Removal)**: A resolution to remove the superintendent of District 67 was discussed, with concerns raised about targeting individuals and setting a bad precedent. The committee voted 18-0 to recommend ITL.
- **HR 9 (STEM Education)**: A resolution urging the Department of Education to emphasize STEM education was seen as nonpartisan and forward-looking. The committee voted 18-0 to recommend "Ought to Pass" (OTP).
- **HB 440 (Educator Licensing)**: A bill addressing educator licensing, particularly for Career and Technical Education (CTE) instructors, was amended to clarify that it applies only to initial licenses. The committee voted 18-0 to recommend OTP as amended.
- **HB 222 (Charter School MOUs)**: A bill repealing the requirement for memoranda of understanding (MOUs) between charter schools and school districts regarding students with disabilities was discussed. The committee voted 18-0 to recommend OTP.
- **HB 719 (Charter School Facilities)**: A bill repealing the right of first refusal for charter schools to purchase or lease unused school district buildings was debated. The committee voted 17-1 to recommend ITL.

#### **4. Public Testimony and Stakeholder Input**
Throughout the meeting, various stakeholders, including superintendents, military families, and advocacy groups, provided testimony on the proposed bills. Key highlights included:
- **Superintendent’s Letter**: A superintendent from Prospect Mountain School highlighted challenges with open enrollment, such as districts sending students without prior notice.
- **Military Families**: The Department of Defense advocated for military-connected children to retain enrollment preferences, emphasizing the importance of educational stability.
- **NHSBA**: Opposed HB 741, citing concerns about disrupting existing tuition agreements, increased administrative burdens, and inadequate funding for schools.
- **David Trumble**: Argued that open enrollment is premature without first addressing the state’s inequitable school funding system, which heavily relies on local property taxes.

### **Key Questions and Considerations**
The discussions raised several critical questions:
- How will schools manage capacity limits and fluctuating enrollment numbers under open enrollment?
- What happens if a student transfers mid-year and doesn’t fit academically into the new school’s curriculum?
- How will the bill impact local tax rates and school budgets?
- Will the bill unintentionally affect child custody agreements or divorce proceedings?

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of balancing **family choice**, **educational equity**, and **local control** in education policy. While supporters of HB 741 emphasized its potential to provide flexibility and improve public education, opponents raised significant concerns about exacerbating inequities and undermining local governance. The committee also addressed other pressing issues, such as bullying, STEM education, and educator licensing, demonstrating a commitment to refining legislation to better serve students and schools. Further discussions and amendments are expected as the committee continues its work on these critical education policies.
