### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Science, Technology, and Energy (February 18, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 18, 2025, to discuss several key energy-related bills. The discussions centered on advancing energy market competition, modernizing the grid, promoting distributed energy resources (DERs), and addressing cost and regulatory challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and themes from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 755: New Hampshire Energy Forward Act**
- **Objective**: Enable **true market competition** for innovative energy services by leveraging **distributed energy resources (DERs)** such as small-scale power generation, energy storage, and electric vehicles. The bill aims to lower energy costs, increase customer choice, strengthen grid reliability, and promote community resiliency.
- **Support**: Proponents, including the **Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire**, argued that the bill would **liberate market forces**, encourage private investment in DERs, and reduce reliance on utility-owned projects.
- **Concerns**: 
  - **Costs**: Utilities, including the **New Hampshire Electric Co-op**, raised concerns about the **millions of dollars** required to upgrade metering, billing, and load settlement systems.
  - **Complexity**: The bill introduces **individualized variable rates** and a new class of customers called **load reducers**, which could complicate billing and load settlement processes.
  - **Cost Shifting**: Critics argued that the bill could shift costs among customer groups, creating **winners and losers** without overall savings.
  - **Feasibility**: The **New Hampshire Electric Co-op** shared their failed attempt to implement a similar **transactive energy rate** program due to technical and customer uptake challenges.

#### **House Bill 761: Customer Energy Storage**
- **Objective**: Allow customers to **net meter energy from batteries**, enabling them to store excess energy and release it during peak demand times. The bill focuses on technologies like **lithium-ion**, **iron-air**, and **solid-state batteries**.
- **Benefits**: Storage technologies can optimize energy use, reduce grid strain, and support renewable energy integration.
- **Current Limitations**: Customers with solar panels and batteries cannot currently **net meter stored energy**, limiting their ability to contribute to grid stability during peak times.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the technological neutrality of the bill and whether the Department of Energy (DOE) and Public Utilities Commission (PUC) should define rules for storage systems.

---

#### **House Bill 692: Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)**
- **Objective**: Require electric distribution utilities to develop a plan for implementing **advanced meters** on an **opt-in basis**. The bill aims to prepare for future technological advancements without mandating costly upgrades for all ratepayers.
- **Key Points**:
  - Advanced meters support **time-of-use rates** and **load settlement practices**, essential for competitive energy markets.
  - **Eversource** plans to replace all meters with AMI by **2033**, but the bill would require a plan by **November 2026**.
  - **Cost Concerns**: Utilities and the DOE raised concerns about potential **cost shifting** to ratepayers and the high costs of AMI implementation ($400 million to $394 million).
  - **Stranded Costs**: Utilities warned of **stranded costs** if legacy meters are replaced before a full AMI rollout.

---

#### **House Bill 759: Community Energy Generators**
- **Objective**: Define **community generators** as entities producing less than 5 megawatts of energy, allowing them to offset the load obligations of municipal or county aggregations. The bill enables net metering for community generators, providing a market-based alternative to utility default service.
- **Support**: The **Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire** and **Clean Energy New Hampshire** supported the bill, highlighting its potential to expand access to DERs and reduce regulatory risk for solar developers.
- **Concerns**: The DOE raised issues with the bill’s language, particularly the lack of a lower limit in the generator definition and the use of "maximum rated export capacity" instead of "nameplate capacity."

---

#### **House Bill 760: Default Service**
- **Objective**: Ensure that customers of **competitive suppliers** (e.g., community power programs) are not forced to subsidize utility supply rates, particularly in cases of under- or over-collections.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Support**: Advocates, including the **Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire** and **Constellation Energy**, argued that the bill aligns with the goals of **market competition** and **customer choice**.
  - **Opposition**: **Eversource** opposed the bill, stating that utilities do not profit from default service and that the legislature should not intervene in ongoing PUC adjudications.
  - **Cost Shifting**: Critics warned that under- or over-collections could unfairly burden competitive suppliers and their customers.

---

#### **House Bill 690: Investigating Withdrawal from ISO New England**
- **Objective**: Direct the DOE to investigate the pros and cons of withdrawing from **ISO New England**, the regional grid operator, and its impact on ratepayers and environmental policies.
- **Support**: Advocates argued that New Hampshire should explore alternatives to ISO New England, as decisions by larger states like Massachusetts and Connecticut dominate regional energy policies, potentially driving up costs and limiting New Hampshire’s control.
- **Concerns**: Opponents criticized the bill for lacking a clear timeline, end date, or recipient for the investigation. They also questioned the $200,000 cost estimate and argued that existing studies from Maine and Connecticut provide sufficient insights.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Market Competition vs. Regulation**: The debate centered on whether competitive markets for energy services can coexist with the regulated monopoly of utility distribution systems.
2. **Technological Advancements**: Bills emphasized the importance of **distributed energy resources**, **storage technologies**, and **advanced metering infrastructure** in modernizing the energy grid.
3. **Cost and Feasibility**: While the goals of the bills are widely supported, concerns about **implementation costs**, **complexity**, and **customer impact** were significant points of contention.
4. **Cost Shifting**: Many bills raised concerns about potential **cost shifting** among customer groups, particularly between default service customers and competitive suppliers.
5. **Grid Modernization**: Discussions highlighted the need for careful planning, cost optimization, and alignment with ongoing PUC proceedings to ensure fair and effective energy market reforms.

### **Outcomes**
- **House Bill 759** was voted **10-8** to pass, while **House Bill 681** and **House Bill 674** were deemed "inexpedient to legislate."
- **House Bill 723** (related to energy data platforms) was passed.
- **House Bill 690** remained under discussion, with concerns about feasibility and cost.

The meeting concluded with a focus on public hearings and executive sessions to finalize recommendations on pending legislation. The discussions underscored the need to balance technological advancement, market competition, and cost considerations in shaping New Hampshire’s energy future.
