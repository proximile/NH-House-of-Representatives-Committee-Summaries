Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and bills covered during the session:

### **Impaired Driving and Road Safety**

   - This nationwide program, aimed at reducing recidivism related to impaired driving, was highlighted for its success in states like Florida and Texas.  
   - It includes both online and live Impact Panels, with the latter being particularly impactful in helping participants understand the consequences of impaired driving.

   - Proposed amendments include increased penalties for refusing a breathalyzer test, with first-time refusal penalties rising from a six-month to a one-year license suspension.  
   - The bill allows the DMV to consider out-of-state DWI convictions and refusals when determining penalties.  
   - It also removes mandatory jail time for first-time offenders with a BAC of 0.16 or higher, giving judges discretion to focus on treatment over punishment.  
   - Law enforcement and legal experts supported the bill, emphasizing its potential to reduce refusal rates and improve road safety.

3. **House Bill 602 (Online Victim Impact Panels)**:  
   - This bill mandates that DUI offenders complete an online Victim Impact Panel (VIP) program as part of their court-ordered obligations.

1. **House Bill 473 (Child Exposure to Controlled Substances)**:

   - Concerns were raised about unintended impacts on therapeutic cannabis patients and caregivers, prompting a proposed amendment to exclude them.

2. **Therapeutic Cannabis Program**:  
   - Discussions emphasized the challenges faced by therapeutic cannabis patients due to its Schedule I status, which prevents prescriptions.  
   - Representatives advocated for legal protections similar to those for prescribed controlled substances, particularly for patients with chronic pain.

   - Introduced by Representative Kevin Verville, this bill seeks to decriminalize psilocybin (found in magic mushrooms) in New Hampshire.  
   - Proponents argued that psilocybin is non-addictive, has no lethal dose, and offers therapeutic benefits for conditions like depression, PTSD, and addiction.  
   - Personal testimonies highlighted the potential of psilocybin to provide relief for chronic pain and migraines, with calls for greater access to such treatments.

4. **Fentanyl and Child Protection**:  
   - Testimonies underscored the devastating impact of fentanyl on children, with cases of accidental exposure and overdose driving the need for stricter protections.
