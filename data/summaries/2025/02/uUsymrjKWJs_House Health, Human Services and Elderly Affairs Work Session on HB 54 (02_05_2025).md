**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Work Session on HB 54 (02/05/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee held a work session to discuss **HB 54**, a bill aimed at allowing alternative treatment centers (ATCs) for medical cannabis to operate as for-profit entities. The session, led by Representative David Nagel, focused on the potential impact of the bill on patient access, market dynamics, and regulatory oversight. Key points from the discussion include:

### **Key Concerns and Discussions**

1. **Governor’s Objections and Monopoly Concerns**:  
   - Historically, similar bills have faced opposition from the governor’s office, particularly over concerns that the bill could unfairly position three companies to monopolize the cannabis market if legalization occurs. However, it was clarified that the bill does not open the market to new ATCs but allows existing ones to transition to for-profit status. Members noted that past legislation has restricted market access, reducing the risk of monopolization.  
   - Some members expressed concerns about the potential for large corporations to dominate the market, but it was argued that the bill includes strong guardrails to prevent this.

2. **Patient Access and Pricing**:  
   - Data shows that only a small subset of the 15,000 medical marijuana patients in New Hampshire regularly visit dispensaries. Many patients turn to neighboring states like Maine or the black market for cheaper, unregulated cannabis, which lacks testing and safety standards.  
   - Stakeholders, including **Brandon Pollock** (Tascal Wellness) and **Keenan Blum** (Granite Leaf Cannabis), highlighted the financial challenges faced by nonprofit ATCs, such as high-interest debt and difficulty raising funds, which limit their ability to expand and serve patients effectively.  
   - Allowing ATCs to operate as for-profits could reduce costs, improve access, and help retain patients within the state’s regulated system.

3. **Regulatory Oversight**:  
   - The bill does not alter the existing regulatory framework, including oversight by the Department of Health and Human Services. Members emphasized that the bill maintains strong guardrails to ensure patient safety and prevent market domination by large cannabis companies.

4. **Federal Legal Status Concerns**:  
   - Members raised concerns about marijuana’s federal illegality and the potential for changes in federal enforcement, which could create significant challenges for the state’s cannabis program.

### **Stakeholder Testimonies and Potential Benefits**

- **Nathaniel Gri**, a medical cannabis patient, testified that he purchases cannabis in Maine due to significantly lower prices, despite wanting to support local ATCs.  
- Transitioning to for-profit status could enable ATCs to secure better financing, reduce debt, and invest in improvements that benefit patients, such as lower prices and expanded access points.  
- The bill is seen as a step toward making New Hampshire’s medical cannabis program more competitive with neighboring states and the black market.

### **Support for the Bill and Next Steps**

- Despite concerns, many committee members supported the bill, emphasizing that it addresses real-world issues like patient access, safety, and competition with unregulated street marijuana. They viewed it as a “protected step” in the right direction.  
- **Representative Wendy Thomas** expressed interest in exploring legislation to increase the number of dispensaries in the state, contingent on the passage of HB 54.  
- The committee appeared to reach a consensus in favor of the bill, agreeing that the guardrails in place are sufficient and that the bill addresses critical issues in the cannabis market.

### **Conclusion**

The work session concluded with appreciation for the robust discussion and a sense of agreement on moving forward with the bill. Members acknowledged the need to balance patient access, financial sustainability, and regulatory oversight while addressing concerns about potential market monopolization. The next steps include considering a recommendation on the bill and exploring additional legislation to further improve the state’s medical cannabis program.
