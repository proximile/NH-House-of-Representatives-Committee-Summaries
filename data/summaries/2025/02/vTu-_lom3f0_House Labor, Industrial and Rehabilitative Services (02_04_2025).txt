The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on February 4, 2025, to discuss a series of bills addressing labor, wages, worker safety, and unemployment benefits. The meeting included detailed debates on the fiscal, economic, and social implications of proposed legislation, with a focus on balancing worker protections with employer concerns. Below is a consolidated summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. First Responders and Worker Safety**
   - **HB 282 - Increasing Maximum Benefits for First Responders**: The committee debated raising the maximum benefits for critically injured first responders from $500,000 to $1 million. Opponents argued the current cap has not been reached, while supporters emphasized preparedness for large-scale disasters. The motion to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" passed 11-9.
   - **HB 586 - Employee Assistance Program for Small Town First Responders**: The bill was deemed inexpedient (11-9) after arguments that existing programs cover these needs.
   - **HB 303 - Adopting OSHA Standards for Worker Safety**: The bill was retained for further study, with discussions on phased implementation and cost concerns.

#### **2. Minimum Wage and Tipped Workers**
   - **HB 726 - Minimum Wage Increase**: The bill proposes raising New Hampshire’s minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 by 2025. Advocates highlighted that 61,000 workers would benefit, addressing rising living costs. Opponents raised concerns about economic impacts, but supporters pointed to neighboring states’ experiences. The bill also sets the tipped wage at half the minimum wage.
   - **HB 442 - Eliminating Subminimum Wage for Tipped Workers**: The bill aims to eliminate the $3.27/hour tipped wage, requiring employers to pay the full minimum wage with tips on top. Opponents, including the restaurant industry, argued it would increase costs and reduce tipping culture, while supporters emphasized fairness and stability for workers.

#### **3. Unemployment Benefits**
   - **HB 542 FN - Increasing Unemployment Benefits**: The bill proposes raising the maximum weekly benefit from $427 to $669, addressing inflation and wage growth. Concerns were raised about the impact on the unemployment trust fund, especially during recessions. The committee discussed amendments to balance worker support with financial sustainability.
   - **Labor Force and Trust Fund**: Representatives noted New Hampshire’s low unemployment rate and growing labor force but expressed concerns about the trust fund’s depletion during economic downturns.

#### **4. Workers' Compensation**
   - **HB 744 - Increasing Indemnity Benefits**: The bill seeks to raise wage replacement benefits from 60% to 66⅔% of an injured worker’s average weekly wage. The New Hampshire Insurance Department estimated a small premium increase for employers. The committee discussed implementation challenges, including whether the change should apply retroactively.
   - **HB 299 - Attorney Fees in Workers' Compensation Claims**: The bill was deemed inexpedient (11-9) over concerns about rising insurance rates.

#### **5. Wage Theft and Vacation Pay**
   - **HB 378 - Payout of Unused Vacation Time**: The bill addresses wage theft by requiring employers to pay out unused vacation time upon termination. Business representatives opposed the bill, citing financial burdens and lack of clarity, while supporters emphasized fairness for workers. The Department of Labor suggested amendments to clarify terms like "reasonable assurance."

#### **6. Employment Protections**
   - **HB 225 - Employment Protection for Military Spouses**: The bill was amended to include a one-year-and-one-day limit for job protection and written acknowledgment of deployment. It was recommended for passage with the amendment (OTPA).

4. **Minimum Wage and Tipped Workers**: The push to raise the minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage for tipped workers underscored broader concerns about economic inequality and the rising cost of living.
5. **Implementation Challenges**: Several bills raised questions about implementation, including phased approaches, retroactive application, and clarity in language.
