The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee meeting on February 12, 2025, covered a wide range of topics related to wildlife management, conservation, and ethical hunting practices. The discussions included public hearings, testimonies, and debates on several key bills and amendments. Here is a cohesive summary of the meeting:

### Key Bills and Discussions:

1. **HB 720: Prohibition of Live Bait Fish Importation**  
   - The committee held a public hearing on HB 720, which seeks to ban the importation and sale of live bait fish from out of state to protect New Hampshire’s ecosystems from invasive species and aquatic diseases.  
   - **Supporters**, including environmental advocates, argued that 10% of aquatic invasive species in the state are linked to live bait fish, emphasizing the need for proactive measures.  
   - **Opponents**, primarily bait shop owners, highlighted the potential economic impact on local businesses and tourism, as many rely on out-of-state suppliers.  
   - The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department expressed concerns about illegal bait trafficking and the adequacy of existing regulations, which already prioritize native species.

2. **HB 573: Search and Rescue Funding**  
   - This bill proposed allocating $200,000 annually from the general fund to support Fish and Game’s search and rescue operations, in response to the increasing popularity of outdoor activities and potential federal funding cuts.  
   - Testimonies from hikers, organizations like The Nature Conservancy, and Colonel Kevin Jordan of NH Fish and Game supported the bill, though Jordan noted that current funds are sufficient for now.  
   - The committee ultimately voted to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill due to budget constraints and lack of immediate need.

3. **HB 589: Ban on Wildlife Killing Contests and Wanton Waste**  
   - This bill aims to ban wildlife killing contests and address wanton waste, requiring that animals killed for sport be used responsibly (e.g., for meat or fur) rather than left to rot.  
   - **Supporters**, including the Humane Society and wildlife advocates, argued that killing contests are inhumane, unethical, and detrimental to wildlife populations, particularly predators like coyotes and foxes.  
   - **Opponents**, including some committee members, raised concerns about the bill’s language and the rule-making process, suggesting that the Fish and Game Commission should be involved in adopting rules rather than leaving it to the executive director.  
   - The bill also sparked discussions on ethical hunting practices and the need for science-based wildlife management.

4. **HB 655: Poaching Penalties and Crossbow Permits**  
   - The committee discussed amendments to HB 655, which addresses restitution costs and penalties for poaching.  
   - **Amendment 2025-00-63h** passed unanimously, allowing individuals with permanent crossbow permits to return to regular bow hunting if their condition improves.  
   - **Amendment 2025-00-29h**, which proposed increasing poaching fines for vulnerable species (e.g., Fisher, Bobcat, Otter, and Fox) from $200 to $1,000, sparked debate. Opponents argued that restitution should reflect replacement costs rather than punitive measures, and the amendment was not voted on during the session.

5. **HB 22: Restructuring the Fish and Game Commission**  
   - This bill seeks to restructure the Fish and Game Commission, making it advisory-only and shifting more authority to the executive director.  
   - **Opposition** was overwhelming, with testimonies from the New Hampshire Guides Association, the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation, and commissioners emphasizing the importance of the commission’s independence, local representation, and accountability.  
   - Concerns were raised about the potential loss of checks and balances and the commission’s critical role in land acquisition, funding decisions, and long-term conservation planning.

6. **Wildlife Repopulation and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD)**  
   - The committee discussed declining populations of species like fishers and foxes and the challenges of repopulation, including debates over restitution fees for killing endangered animals.  
   - CWD, a prion disease affecting cervids (e.g., deer), was a major topic, with discussions on the risks of importing infected meat and the need for testing regulations.  
   - Current NH Fish and Game regulations restrict the import of high-risk tissues from CWD-positive states, but there was debate over whether to update existing rules or introduce new legislation.

### Conclusion:
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing ecological protection, ethical hunting practices, and economic considerations. Key themes included the need for sustainable funding for search and rescue operations, the ethical and ecological concerns surrounding wildlife killing contests, and the importance of local representation in wildlife management. The committee also grappled with the complexities of addressing invasive species, repopulating endangered wildlife, and mitigating the risks of diseases like CWD. Public testimonies played a significant role in shaping the discussions, reflecting diverse perspectives from stakeholders across the state. The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene for further discussions on pending bills.
