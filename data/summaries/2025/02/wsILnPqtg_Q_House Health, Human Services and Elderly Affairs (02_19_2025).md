**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs (February 19, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened on February 19, 2025, to address a range of critical healthcare and social services issues. The meeting featured discussions on several bills and resolutions, with debates centering on electronic medical records (EMRs), biosimilar drugs, abortion rights, housing for individuals with disabilities, and public health initiatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **1. Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) – House Bill 70 (HB 70)**
**Overview**:  
HB 70, introduced by Representative David Nagel, seeks to address the challenges posed by the widespread adoption of EMRs in healthcare. The bill aims to reduce the burden on healthcare providers, particularly small, independent practices, by limiting the mandatory use of EMRs imposed by commercial insurers and federal programs like Medicare.

**Key Points**:
- **Issues with EMRs**: Providers face increased documentation burdens, high adoption and maintenance costs, and a shift in focus from patient care to billing and data collection. These challenges contribute to practitioner burnout and the closure of independent practices.
- **Support**: The bill received strong backing from medical associations, including the New Hampshire Medical Society, Chiropractic Association, and Acupuncture Association. Dr. Ruth Colligan, an expert in patient safety, testified in favor, highlighting the negative impact of EMRs on healthcare quality and provider well-being.
- **Opposition**: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield opposed the bill, arguing it restricts insurers’ ability to use EMRs effectively for claims processing and creates logistical challenges.
- **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to allow insurers to request additional information for prior authorization purposes, addressing some concerns raised by Anthem.

**Outcome**: The bill reflects broader concerns about the corporatization of medicine and the role of technology in healthcare. While it has significant support from medical professionals, opposition from insurers highlights the complexities of balancing cost, efficiency, and patient care.

### **2. Biosimilar Drugs – House Bill 17 (HB 17)**
**Overview**:  
HB 17 aims to empower pharmacists to substitute biosimilar drugs for more expensive biologics, reducing costs for patients while maintaining treatment efficacy.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: The bill aligns with potential changes by the FDA to streamline biosimilar approval processes, eliminating the need for costly switching studies. It is supported by the NH Insurance Department for its potential to lower drug costs.
- **Opposition**: Representatives from Amgen argued that the current system works well and that the interchangeable designation is essential for patient safety.

**Outcome**: The bill represents a push for increased competition and affordability in the pharmaceutical market, though concerns about safety and efficacy remain.

### **3. Abortion Rights – House Concurrent Resolution 7 (HCR 7)**
**Overview**:  
HCR 7 affirms the right to abortion in New Hampshire up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, aiming to protect reproductive healthcare access and reassure providers and patients.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Advocates, including the ACLU of New Hampshire and the NH Medical Society, emphasized that abortion is a safe, lifesaving medical procedure and a human right. They highlighted the need to retain OB-GYNs and improve physician morale in the state.
- **Opposition**: Opponents argued that abortion is not healthcare and undermines the value of human life, raising ethical and moral objections.

**Outcome**: The resolution reflects a deep divide between those who view abortion as a fundamental healthcare right and those who oppose it on moral grounds. It seeks to provide symbolic but important protections for reproductive rights in New Hampshire.

### **4. Housing for Individuals with Disabilities – House Bill 731 (HB 731)**
**Overview**:  
HB 731 focuses on creating affordable and supportive housing for individuals with disabilities, particularly developmental disabilities, by exempting certain housing models from state licensing requirements.

**Key Points**:
- **Support**: Stakeholders, including Lori McIntosh from Our Place NH, emphasized the need to reduce regulatory barriers and costs to develop mixed-use housing models.
- **Concerns**: Some representatives raised issues with the bill’s language and potential limitations, suggesting further amendments to improve its effectiveness.

**Outcome**: The bill aims to simplify certification requirements and increase housing options for individuals with disabilities, addressing a critical need for aging parents concerned about their adult children’s future.

### **5. Public Health Initiatives**
Several bills related to public health were discussed and voted on:
- **HB 73 (Substance Misuse Harm Reduction)**: Passed with an amendment to expedite its effective date, aiming to reduce harm related to substance misuse.
- **HB 994 (Circumcision Funding)**: Passed, prohibiting state funding for medically unnecessary circumcisions.
- **HB 223 (Healthcare Facility Licensing)**: Passed, easing licensing requirements for healthcare facilities near critical access hospitals.
- **HB 524 (Vaccine Association)**: Passed, eliminating state involvement in purchasing vaccines through the Vaccine Association.

### **6. Autism Council Repeal – House Bill 634 (HB 634)**
**Overview**:  
HB 634 seeks to repeal the Autism Council, which has been inactive since 2019. Supporters argued that the council is duplicative and ineffective.

**Outcome**: The bill was amended and passed, reflecting frustrations with the council’s lack of activity and representation for individuals with autism.

---

### **7. Prescription Drug Affordability – House Bill 645 (HB 645)**
**Overview**:  
HB 645 aims to improve the effectiveness of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board by clarifying language and enhancing transparency.

**Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously, with representatives hopeful it would reduce drug costs and increase accountability.

The meeting highlighted several overarching themes:
- **Healthcare Technology**: Debates over EMRs underscored the tension between technological advancements and their impact on provider workloads and patient care.
- **Affordability and Access**: Bills on biosimilars, housing, and prescription drugs emphasized the need to reduce costs and increase access to essential services.
