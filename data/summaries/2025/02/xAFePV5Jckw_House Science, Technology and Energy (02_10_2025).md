### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (February 10, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 10, 2025, to discuss a wide range of bills and initiatives related to energy policy, utility reform, and technological innovation. The meeting included public hearings, executive sessions, and detailed debates on several key issues, reflecting the complexity of balancing economic, environmental, and regulatory considerations in energy policy. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

#### **Key Themes and Overview**
1. **Biomass and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs):** Strong opposition to proposals reducing RECs for biomass, citing economic, environmental, and energy benefits.
2. **Utility Reform and Energy Data Hub:** Calls for modernizing utility regulations and establishing a centralized energy data platform to enhance transparency, planning, and consumer savings.
3. **Regional Grid Independence:** Exploration of New Hampshire’s role in ISO New England, including a cost-benefit analysis of potential withdrawal.
4. **Economic Viability of Energy Projects:** Significant concerns over the costs and benefits of proposed energy initiatives, particularly the statewide energy data platform.
5. **State vs. Market Role:** Debates over whether the state or private sector should lead energy innovation and infrastructure development.
6. **Ratepayer Impact:** A recurring focus on how proposed policies would affect ratepayers, balancing short-term savings with long-term investments in renewable energy and infrastructure.

#### **Detailed Discussions and Decisions**

### **1. Biomass and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)**
- **House Bill 567:** This bill proposed reducing the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for Class III biomass and landfill gas projects from 8% to 1%. Stakeholders, including biomass plant operators, environmental groups, and industry representatives, strongly opposed the bill, arguing it would devastate the biomass industry. They highlighted its role in providing baseload energy, supporting local economies, and promoting sustainable forestry. Concerns were also raised about the loss of REC revenue, which currently helps municipalities and schools offset operational costs.
- **House Bill 567 FN:** This related bill sought to eliminate thermal energy from the RPS, effectively removing support for biomass plants. Testimony from stakeholders emphasized the economic and environmental benefits of thermal RECs, including reduced fossil fuel use, carbon sequestration, and local job creation. The committee concluded with a call for further exploration of alternative incentives and the potential impacts of the bill.

### **2. Utility Reform and Energy Data Hub**
- **House Bill 674:** This bill focused on utility reforms, including time-of-use tariffs and multi-year rate settings. Representative Kaplan emphasized the need for bipartisan collaboration to modernize utility regulations and improve cost efficiency.
- **Statewide Energy Data Platform:** Multiple discussions centered on the proposed platform, which aims to consolidate energy data from utilities to enhance transparency, planning, and consumer savings. While proponents highlighted its potential benefits, significant concerns were raised about costs (estimated at $4.6–$7 million initially), governance, and transparency. The Governance Council’s private entity status and lack of public oversight were particularly contentious.
- **House Bill 681:** This bill sought to formalize the data platform’s development, but it faced criticism from the Department of Energy (DOE) and others over its economic viability, regulatory oversight, and lack of a completed cost-benefit analysis. The debate highlighted tensions between innovation and accountability in energy policy.

### **3. Regional Grid Independence**
- **House Bill 690:** This bill proposed an investigation into the feasibility and implications of New Hampshire potentially leaving ISO New England, the regional grid operator. Key points included:
  - **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** The bill aims to evaluate the financial, reliability, and policy impacts of staying in or leaving the regional grid.
  - **New Hampshire’s Energy Context:** The state generates 177% of its energy needs but consumes only 10%, exporting the surplus to other states. Its focus on cost and affordability contrasts with other New England states’ decarbonization goals.
  - **Concerns and Testimony:** Stakeholders, including the Consumer Advocate and the DOE, supported the investigation but acknowledged the complexity and challenges of withdrawing from ISO New England. Industry representatives argued that leaving would incur substantial costs and undermine market confidence.

### **4. Economic Viability and Ratepayer Impact**
- **House Bill 723:** This bill sought to repeal the Statewide Multi-Use Energy Data Platform, citing its economic unviability and complexity. Representative Lex Bney argued that utilities or private companies should lead such initiatives, emphasizing the need for utility software modernization before pursuing the project.
- **House Bill 224:** The committee approved this bill, which reallocates funds from the Renewable Energy Fund (REF) to rebate ratepayers. The amendment ensured continued funding for offshore wind development and energy innovation, reflecting a balance between direct ratepayer relief and long-term renewable energy investments.

### **5. Other Bills and Decisions**
- **House Bill 575 (Offshore Wind Energy Prohibition):** The committee voted “Inexpedient to Legislate” (ITL) due to constitutional concerns, redundancy with existing laws, and potential legal challenges.
- **House Bill 654 (Group Net Metering Participation):** The committee voted ITL, citing concerns about “double dipping” in net metering and opposition from the DOE and Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
- **House Bill 541 (Energy and Telecommunications Infrastructure Study):** The committee voted ITL, deeming the bill’s goals too broad and redundant with ongoing efforts by state and federal agencies.
- **House Bill 460 (Utility Investments in Distributed Energy Resources):** The committee voted ITL, feeling the PUC was already addressing these issues and that legislative intervention was premature.

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexities of energy policy, with significant debate over the future of biomass, utility regulation, and the state’s role in regional energy systems. Key takeaways include:
- Strong support for maintaining RECs for biomass to preserve economic and environmental benefits.
- Concerns over the costs, governance, and transparency of the proposed statewide energy data platform.
- A cautious approach to exploring New Hampshire’s independence from ISO New England, with an emphasis on cost-benefit analysis and ratepayer impacts.
- A focus on balancing short-term ratepayer relief with long-term investments in renewable energy and infrastructure.

The committee’s decisions reflect a commitment to careful analysis, stakeholder input, and a pragmatic approach to energy policy that prioritizes economic viability and ratepayer interests.
