### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on February 5, 2025

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 5, 2025, focused on several key bills and amendments, primarily addressing retirement benefits for public employees, government transparency, and immigration policies. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 727 (Group 2 Retirement Benefits)**
- **Purpose**: This bill aims to address retroactive changes made to the Group 2 pension system in 2011, particularly for Tier B employees (hired before July 1, 2011). It seeks to restore some benefits that were previously reduced, though not fully.
- **Testimony**: **Gary Burke**, a captain at the New Hampshire State Prison Department of Corrections, and **Cypher Regasa**, a chief probation officer, testified in support of retaining the bill to align with the governor’s plans in **HB2**.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal note indicates a positive effect on the retirement system’s finances, contingent on the state contributing $27.5 million annually for 10 years. Without this funding, employer rates would increase significantly.
- **Governor’s Involvement**: The governor has prioritized addressing Group 2 retirement benefits, likely through the state budget or **HB2**.
- **Outcome**: The bill was retained in committee with a 13-2 vote, pending further fiscal analysis and alignment with the governor’s budget priorities.

#### **House Bill 702 (Police Retirement Work Hours)**
- **Purpose**: This bill seeks to exclude "extra duty" hours (e.g., security details paid by private contractors) from the yearly calculation of hours worked for retired part-time police officers. This would allow retired officers to continue serving their communities without affecting their retirement benefits.
- **Support**: Representatives from the New Hampshire Police Association and the New Hampshire Troopers Association testified in favor, emphasizing the bill’s practicality and lack of cost to the state.
- **Concerns**: The New Hampshire Retirement System raised concerns about potential re-enrollment in the retirement system due to excessive hours.
- **Outcome**: The bill was discussed in executive session, with further analysis planned.

#### **House Bill 598 (Government Data Transparency)**
- **Purpose**: This bill proposes a study committee to examine existing government data and make it more accessible and machine-readable, improving transparency and policy decision-making.
- **Amendment**: **Amendment 285H** was introduced to streamline the committee’s structure and require two reports (preliminary in 2025 and final in 2026). However, concerns about bipartisan representation and privacy information (PII) led to its withdrawal for revision.
- **Outcome**: The public hearing was closed, and the bill will be revisited after the amendment is revised.

#### **House Bill 180 (Critical Incident Stress Management Teams)**
- **Purpose**: This bill addresses issues with a $400 certification test imposed by the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation, which many volunteer team members find burdensome.
- **Amendment**: An amendment was introduced to clarify the role of a "team leader," which passed unanimously.
- **Outcome**: The amendment was adopted, and the bill passed with an 11-0 vote.

#### **House Bill 438 (Immigration Detention Facilities)**
- **Purpose**: This bill updates regulations related to immigration detention facilities, prohibiting for-profit entities from operating such facilities and restricting the use of the National Guard for immigration enforcement without executive council approval.
- **Amendments**: Representative Patrick Long proposed an amendment to remove certain clauses, including prohibitions on private contracts and references to mass deportations. The amendment was discussed but not yet voted on.
- **Outcome**: The public hearing was closed, and further discussion will occur in executive session.
