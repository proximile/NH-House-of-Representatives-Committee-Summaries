The New Hampshire House of Representatives, through its Division 3 of the House Finance Committee, chaired by State Representative Maureen Mooney, conducted a series of work sessions focused on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) budget and related child welfare issues. These sessions, featuring presentations by DCYF Director Marie Nunan and Chief Financial Officer Nathan White of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), addressed critical aspects of child welfare, foster care, juvenile justice, and residential treatment. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **DCYF Mission and Strategic Priorities**
DCYFâ€™s mission is to partner with families and communities to ensure the safety and healthy development of children. Key mandates include Child Protective Services, Juvenile Justice Services, and the Sununu Youth Services Center (SYSC). The division has achieved notable accomplishments, such as reducing vacancy rates for caseworkers, juvenile justice officers, and youth counselors, and increasing kinship care placements to 74% of out-of-home placements. Strategic priorities for 2025-2026 include:
- **Case Practice**: Improving case management to reduce reliance on residential treatment.
- **New Secure Treatment Facility**: Opening a facility by December 2026 with a maximum capacity of 12 youth.
- **Electronic Case Management System**: Transitioning to "Granite Families" by December 2026.
- **Service Array**: Expanding community-based services and foster home availability, particularly for older youth (14-17 years old).

### **Juvenile Justice Transformation**
DCYF has seen a 30% reduction in juvenile probation cases from 2019 to 2023, driven by efforts to divert youth from the justice system through assessments and community-based services. Legislative support for kinship care licensing and stipends has further emphasized placing children with relatives or known caregivers.

### **Residential Treatment and Foster Care**
The department aims to minimize the use of residential treatment, focusing on short-term, treatment-oriented stays with a goal of stepping youth back into family or foster care settings. Efforts include increasing kinship care placements and enhancing foster care rates, though standard rate increases were not funded in the current budget. The department is also transitioning the Hampstead Hospital Residential Treatment Facility to Dartmouth, with discussions on shared services and reimbursement for contracted services.

### **Transition-Aged Youth and Community Support**
Programs like HOPE (Housing and Opportunities to Personally Excel) and Youth Villages LifeSet support youth aging out of foster care. Emphasis was placed on community prevention and early intervention, leveraging resources like schools, medical providers, and Family Resource Centers to identify and address issues early.

### **Legislative and Operational Updates**
- **Senate Bill 417**: Mandates monthly in-person visits for children in out-of-state placements, leading to increased workloads for caseworkers and the creation of 10 new positions.
- **Senate Bill 463**: Guarantees legal representation for children in foster care, with phased implementation to manage increased workloads.
- **Federal Funding and Medicaid**: The expiration of a federal waiver allowing Medicaid funding for larger residential treatment facilities necessitates a transition to community-based care.
- **Budget Adjustments**: Significant shifts in funding sources were discussed, with a decrease in federal funds and an increase in state general funds due to changes in Medicaid reimbursement rules.

### **Staffing and Training**
DCYF has implemented robust training programs for new staff, including child protective workers, juvenile probation officers, and youth counselors. The department is addressing secondary trauma and safety concerns for staff, who face significant challenges and threats in their work.

### **Metrics and Goals**
DCYF has set specific metrics to measure progress, including a 10% reduction in residential treatment and a 10% increase in in-home family services. The department is also working on reducing costs and improving efficiency, including shared services with other facilities on the Hampstead campus.

### **Public Involvement and Future Discussions**
The committee encouraged public participation and questions, with detailed discussions on foster care, kinship care, and the challenges of matching children with appropriate caregivers. Upcoming sessions will focus on the Division of Behavioral Health's budget and the Behavioral Health System of Care, with a continued commitment to refining services and ensuring the well-being of children and families in New Hampshire.

Overall, the sessions highlighted the complexities of managing child welfare services, the need for adequate funding, and ongoing efforts to improve outcomes for children and families in New Hampshire. The department is seeking additional resources to address these challenges and enhance support for vulnerable populations.
