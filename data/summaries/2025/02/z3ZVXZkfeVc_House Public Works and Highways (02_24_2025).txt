The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held meetings focused on financial management, debt servicing, and the capital budget process. These discussions emphasized transparency, efficiency, and fiscal responsibility, particularly regarding debt management, bond issuance, and capital project funding. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **Debt Service and Bond Issuance**
- The state typically issues **$60 million in new debt service annually**, offset by paying off existing debt, resulting in a **net increase of less than $60 million**.  
- An additional **$40 million in bonds**, authorized but unissued in a prior term, will be issued in **2026**, increasing the state’s debt ratio.  
- Bond issuance is tied to agency readiness to spend funds, such as the **$40 million prison project**, which has been deferred to 2026.  
- The state currently owes **$525 million in bonds**, part of the net tax-supported debt paid with general funds. School Building Aid has **$30 million outstanding**, to be paid off by 2029.  

### **Capital Budget Process**
- The capital budget process begins nearly a year in advance, with agencies submitting capital project requests by **May 1st**. The governor compiles a recommended list by June.  
- The governor’s current recommendation includes **$143 million in general fund capital appropriations**, slightly higher than the typical **$120–$125 million range**.  
- **Key Projects**:  
  - **Tramway at Cannon Mountain**: An **$18 million appropriation** is recommended to be closed out and replaced with a **$20 million request**.  
  - **New Prison**: The Department of Corrections has a **$50 million appropriation** for land assessment and design, but the **$40 million construction phase** is deferred to 2026.  
  - **CTE (Career and Technical Education) Projects**: Previously funded through the education trust fund, the governor proposes returning to bonding for these projects.  

### **Debt Management and Affordability**
- State Treasurer Monica Mapelli emphasized maintaining manageable debt levels to preserve the state’s **strong credit rating**.  
- The state’s **debt-to-revenue ratio** has improved significantly, from **8.2% in 2015 to 3.8% in 2024**.  
- The treasurer recommended staying within a **$120–$130 million annual bonding limit**, though the governor’s proposal is **$143 million**.  
- The state’s **debt limit** is **10% of unrestricted revenue** from the previous fiscal year. While there is capacity to borrow more, exceeding recommended limits could impact credit ratings and increase borrowing costs.  

### **Lapse Extensions**
- Agencies are required to report on **lapse extensions** (funds that would otherwise expire) as part of their committee presentations.  
- A subcommittee will finalize lapse extensions, which are critical for ongoing capital projects like the **$40 million prison project**.  
- Remaining funds from lapses are reviewed and repurposed for other projects.  

### **Committee’s Role and Meeting Schedule**
- The Public Works and Highways Committee will review agency requests, recommend a capital budget to the full House, and reconcile differences with the Senate in a **committee of conference**. The goal is to finalize the budget by **June**.  
- The committee is scheduled to meet next on **March 4th**, with presentations from agencies like the Department of Administrative Services, DoIT, and the Governor’s Office.  
- A tentative lapse extension meeting is planned for **March 14th**.  
- The schedule has been streamlined to avoid dead periods, with agencies presenting back-to-back. Agencies are allocated specific time slots (e.g., **60 minutes for Administrative Services, 30 minutes for DoIT and the Governor’s Office**), with flexibility to start early if time allows.  

### **Questions and Clarifications**
- Representatives sought clarification on the **CTE funding process** and the status of the new prison project.  
- Treasurer Mapelli explained that the **$40 million for the prison** was deferred to 2026 and that the state’s debt calculations include all authorized and projected debt.  

In summary, the meetings highlighted the state’s efforts to balance **capital project needs** with **fiscal responsibility**. While the governor’s recommended budget of **$143 million** exceeds the treasurer’s preferred range, the committee will work to ensure debt levels remain manageable while addressing critical infrastructure and public works projects. The streamlined meeting schedule and focus on lapse extensions underscore the commitment to efficient and transparent financial management.
