**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Ways and Means (02/10/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 10, 2025, centered on detailed discussions around revenue estimation, taxation, and financial projections for various state funds. The meeting highlighted the complexities of economic forecasting, the impact of external factors, and the need for accurate financial reporting to guide fiscal policy decisions. Key topics included insurance taxes, reinsurance, natural disasters, liquor transfer funds, business taxes, and the economic outlook for the state.

### **Insurance and Reinsurance**
The committee addressed the financial impact of natural disasters on insurance rates, particularly how reinsurers compensate for large losses, such as those in California. These costs are distributed across policyholders, leading to increased insurance rates. Concerns were raised about the cyclical nature of insurance payments and the difficulty in predicting future costs, especially given recent catastrophic events like wildfires and floods. Representative Opel suggested inviting the insurance department back to clarify uncertainties before voting on revenue estimates.

### **Revenue Projections**
The committee reviewed projected increases in insurance taxes, with an 11.2% rise from 2025 to 2026, followed by a smaller 2.5% increase the following year. Members debated the accuracy of these projections and whether they adequately accounted for recent catastrophic events. Other revenue sources discussed included:
- **Fishing and Game Fund**: Adjustments for interest income and the impact of COVID-19 on outdoor activities and licensing revenue.
- **Highway Fund**: Projections for motor vehicle fees, inspection fees, and road tolls, with consideration of pending legislation.
- **Medicaid Recoveries**: Declining recoveries due to fewer audits and the shift to managed care contracts.
- **Beer Tax**: The impact of changing consumer preferences, such as the rise of blended drinks and microbreweries, on tax collections.
- **General Fund Securities and Court Fines**: Stability of these revenue streams.

### **Liquor Transfer Funds**
The committee reviewed and approved liquor transfer funds, noting the agency's accuracy in projections and adjustments for Medicaid expansion and other statutory requirements.

### **Business Taxes and Economic Outlook**
The committee discussed business taxes (BET and BPT), which were combined into a single number for estimation purposes to minimize confusion. They reviewed the official revenue plan for fiscal year 2025 and discussed high and low estimates provided by the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA). The economic outlook for the next few years was a key focus, with some representatives expressing optimism about stabilizing energy prices and potential tax reforms, while others voiced concerns about national debt, interest rates, and housing affordability. There was a consensus that the economy might experience flat growth in the near term, with potential improvements by 2027.

### **Utility Property Tax and Education Trust Fund**
The committee discussed the impact of utility property taxes on the education trust fund and proposed legislation that would shift the tax burden from utility generators to statewide education property taxes.

### **Legislative and Administrative Processes**
The role of the governor and administrative services in finalizing budget estimates was highlighted, along with the process of reconciling financial data from different agencies. The committee emphasized the importance of accurate revenue estimation and the challenges posed by fluctuating tax revenues and economic uncertainties. They also stressed the need for detailed and accessible financial reports to aid in decision-making.

### **Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with plans to continue discussions on business taxes, rooms and meals taxes, and other financial matters the following day. Members emphasized that the numbers were preliminary and would be revisited in the coming months.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the complexity of financial forecasting and the need for careful consideration of external factors like natural disasters, reinsurance costs, and economic trends. The committee highlighted the importance of transparency, accuracy, and detailed reporting in making informed fiscal policy decisions. The discussions aimed to ensure that revenue estimates and budget projections are robust and reflective of current and future economic conditions.
