### **Climate Policy and HCR1**
The committee extensively discussed **HCR1**, a resolution advocating for balanced dialogue in climate policy formation, opposing climate alarmism, and addressing concerns about bullying climate skeptics. Key points included:
- **Support for Balanced Debate**: Sponsors like Representative Rollins emphasized fairness in climate discussions, critiquing alarmist rhetoric and raising concerns about the economic impact of climate policies, such as higher electricity costs and renewable energy mandates.
- **Public Health Concerns**: Testimonies highlighted the public health implications of climate change, including vector-borne diseases, mental health stress, and heat-related injuries.
- **Opposition to HCR1**: Critics like Tim Horgan and John Gage argued that the resolution downplayed the urgency of climate action, with accusations of fossil fuel industry influence. They called for evidence-based policy and criticized the resolution’s lack of clarity.
- **Economic and Policy Concerns**: Discussions centered on the economic implications of carbon taxes, renewable energy mandates, and the feasibility of transitioning to clean energy.

### **The Jones Act: Repeal vs. Reform**
The Jones Act, a century-old law requiring domestic shipping to use U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed vessels, was a focal point of debate:
- **Arguments for Repeal**: Proponents of **HCR10** argued that the Act inflates shipping costs, stifles innovation, and harms consumers. They cited examples of inefficiencies, such as the high cost of transporting natural gas from Europe to New England instead of the Gulf Coast.
- **Arguments Against Repeal**: Opponents, including maritime industry representatives, emphasized the Act’s role in supporting 650,000 jobs, contributing $230 million annually to New Hampshire’s economy, and maintaining national security by ensuring a ready fleet of U.S. vessels.
- **Potential Reforms**: Some committee members suggested modernizing the Act rather than repealing it, addressing specific issues like allowing foreign-built ships for certain cargo types.

### **Government Propaganda and HR12**
The committee discussed **HR12**, a resolution urging Congress to amend the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2013 to reinstate prohibitions on government propaganda targeting U.S. citizens:
- **Concerns Over Information Warfare**: Testimony highlighted the dangers of government-funded propaganda, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to prevent the use of federal funds for influencing public opinion.
- **Support for HR12**: The resolution passed with a vote of 10-7, reflecting bipartisan concerns about the misuse of state and military resources for propaganda.

### **Article 5 Conventions and Constitutional Governance**
Several measures related to Article 5 of the U.S. Constitution, which allows states to propose constitutional amendments through a convention, were debated:
- **HB 264**: This bill, which passed 15-2, would penalize New Hampshire delegates for supporting unauthorized amendments at an Article 5 convention.
- **HCR 3**: A resolution calling for an Article 5 convention to address federal overreach and debt, passed 10-7.
- **HCR 5**: A resolution to rescind a 2012 call for an Article 5 convention was rejected (10-7), with concerns about runaway conventions and the role of delegates.
- **HJR 1**: A resolution affirming natural rights and the government’s role in protecting them, passed with a philosophical emphasis on Judeo-Christian ethics and the Founding Fathers’ vision.

### **Scientific Testimony and Climate Resilience**
Retired professor Yur Matot provided expert testimony on climate change, advocating for evidence-based policy and societal resilience. He cautioned against panic-driven responses and emphasized the need for critical scrutiny of scientific evidence. The committee also briefly discussed cloud seeding and its limited effectiveness in weather modification.

### **Committee Outcomes and Next Steps**
The committee concluded by voting on and recommending passage of several measures, including HB 264, HCR 3, HJR 1, and HR12, while rejecting HCR 5. Reports and minority reports were to be prepared for further legislative action. The chair thanked committee members, substitutes, and staff for their work, noting that the committee would await Senate measures for additional review.
