**Summary of the New Hampshire House Committee on Housing Meeting (March 4, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Housing convened on March 4, 2025, to address a range of legislative proposals aimed at refining housing, zoning, and land use policies. The meeting highlighted the committee's commitment to balancing local control with the need for fair and evidence-based regulations, while addressing the state's housing crisis. Key discussions and decisions included:

### **Zoning and Housing Restrictions**
1. **Zoning Authority and Evidence Standards**: The committee debated the appropriate level of scrutiny for zoning ordinances, particularly "extraordinary restrictions" on residential property. Some members advocated for a strict scrutiny standard, requiring towns to provide compelling evidence for such restrictions, while others favored intermediate scrutiny to avoid overcomplicating the process. The goal was to ensure zoning changes are justified by empirical, quantitative, and peer-reviewed evidence rather than arbitrary reasoning.

2. **Defining Extraordinary Restrictions**: Discussions focused on what constitutes "extraordinary restrictions," with proposals including limits on minimum lot sizes, square footage requirements, and restrictions on in-home businesses. The committee agreed to keep the bill focused to avoid overloading it with provisions that could hinder its passage.

3. **Camping on Private Property**: A contentious issue was whether property owners should be allowed to camp on their land indefinitely. Some representatives supported this provision, provided it was limited to the property owner and did not create health or safety hazards, while others opposed it, fearing it would complicate the bill.

4. **Appeals Process**: The committee considered whether appeals of zoning decisions should go directly to superior court or first to the zoning board of appeals (ZBA). Some argued that retaining the ZBA step would provide a cheaper, quicker option, while others favored streamlining the process by going straight to superior court.

### **Legislative Proposals and Amendments**
1. **HB 572 - Housing Champion Grant Fund Program**: The committee passed an amendment to reduce the appropriation from $10.5 million to $150,000, focusing on creating a database of municipal and county-owned properties suitable for residential development. The bill passed unanimously.

2. **HB 296 - Building Permits Along Roads**: An amendment was proposed to treat private roads built to town standards the same as town roads. The committee agreed to draft the amendment and revisit it later.

3. **HB 342 and HB 631 - Residential Development in Commercial Zones**: Both bills passed amendments allowing residential development in commercial zones under certain conditions, with HB 631 also empowering municipalities to regulate ground-floor usage. Both bills passed unanimously, aiming to promote mixed-use development.

4. **HB 382 - Parking Space Regulations**: The committee passed an amendment limiting municipalities to regulating no more than one residential parking space per unit, emphasizing the free market's role in determining parking needs. The bill passed unanimously.

5. **HB 457 - Lodging Houses and Single-Family Homes**: The committee discussed challenges in defining and regulating lodging houses, particularly in relation to single-family homes and recovery houses. The discussion highlighted the need for clearer definitions and potential connections to other related bills.

6. **HB 465 - Retained for Further Work**: The committee recognized the bill's merit but decided to retain it for further refinement.

### **Process and Next Steps**
1. **Effective Date**: The committee settled on a 60-day effective date for certain legislation to allow towns time to adopt and educate stakeholders on the changes.

2. **Subcommittee Work**: A smaller group of representatives, including attorneys, was tasked with refining the language of bills, particularly around evidentiary standards and the appeals process. A follow-up meeting was scheduled to review proposed amendments and potentially vote on final versions.

3. **Bipartisan Collaboration**: The committee emphasized the importance of bipartisan collaboration in addressing New Hampshire's housing crisis through thoughtful and balanced legislation.

The meeting concluded with plans to address remaining bills and potentially hold a quick executive session during a future session day. Overall, the committee demonstrated a commitment to advancing comprehensive housing legislation while navigating political and practical challenges.
