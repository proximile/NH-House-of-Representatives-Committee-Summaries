The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held meetings across multiple committees and subcommittees, focusing on crafting and refining legislation related to housing, zoning, local ordinances, and property rights. These discussions highlighted the ongoing challenges of balancing individual property rights, local control, and state oversight while addressing practical concerns and the state’s housing crisis. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Legal Standards for Local Ordinances**  
   - Committees debated whether to apply **strict scrutiny** (a higher standard requiring ordinances to be narrowly tailored and least restrictive) or **intermediate scrutiny** to local ordinances affecting health, safety, and property use.  
   - Some members favored strict scrutiny to prevent overly restrictive local ordinances, while others argued it could be seen as state overreach into local control.  

2. **Local Control vs. State Oversight**  
   - The tension between **local autonomy** and **state-level oversight** was a recurring theme. Some members emphasized the need for higher standards to curb excessive local restrictions, while others cautioned against undermining local decision-making.  

3. **Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) Role**  
   - Discussions centered on whether appeals should bypass the ZBA and go directly to **superior court**. Some members argued this could disadvantage poorer petitioners, while others saw it as a way to streamline the process and reduce bureaucratic hurdles.  

4. **Property Rights and Camping on Private Land**  
   - A contentious issue was whether property owners should be allowed to **camp on their land without time restrictions**. Supporters framed it as a matter of property rights, while opponents raised concerns about health, safety, and potential misuse. This debate underscored the need to balance individual freedoms with community standards.  

5. **Inclusion of Additional Restrictions**  
   - Committees considered adding various restrictions to bills, such as limits on **lot sizes**, **in-home businesses**, and **accessory dwelling units (ADUs)**. However, there was caution against overloading bills with too many provisions, as this could jeopardize their passage.

### **Key Bills and Amendments**

1. **HB 572 - Housing Champion Grant Fund Program**  
   - An amendment passed to remove a $10.5 million appropriation and replace it with a $150,000 allocation to create a **database of municipal and county-owned properties** suitable for residential development. The bill was recommended to move forward.  

2. **HB 296 - Building Permits Along Roads**  
   - An amendment was proposed to treat **private roads built to town standards** the same as town roads. The committee agreed to draft the amendment and revisit it later.  

3. **HB 342 - Zoning and Lot Coverage**  
   - An amendment passed to allow property owners to build on lots that conform to the majority of properties within a **1,000-foot radius**, bypassing the ZBA in some cases. The bill was recommended to move forward.  

4. **HB 382 - Parking Space Regulations**  
   - An amendment passed to limit municipalities from mandating more than **one parking space per residential unit**, based on a previous bill (HB 1400). The bill was recommended for the consent calendar.  

5. **HB 465 - Residential Building Permits**  
   - The committee voted to retain the bill for further refinement, as it was deemed to have merit but needed additional work.  

6. **HB 631 - Mixed-Use Development**  
   - An amendment passed to allow **residential development in commercial zones** while giving municipalities control over ground-floor usage. The bill was recommended for the consent calendar.  

7. **HB 457 - Lodging Houses and Zoning**  
   - The committee discussed concerns about **excessive government overreach** in zoning regulations, particularly regarding lodging houses and single-family neighborhoods. The bill was temporarily held for further review.  

8. **HB 410 - Zoning and Extraordinary Restrictions**  
   - The committee debated the evidentiary standards required for municipalities to enforce zoning restrictions, focusing on **empirical evidence**, **peer-reviewed sources**, and **judicial scrutiny**. The goal was to balance local control with clear, enforceable standards.

### **Next Steps**  
- Committees agreed to refine the language of several bills, particularly around **legal standards** and the role of the ZBA.  
- Specific members, including Representative Bollier, were tasked with drafting amendments for further review.  
- Plans were made to revisit certain bills during session days and finalize amendments and reports for upcoming votes.
