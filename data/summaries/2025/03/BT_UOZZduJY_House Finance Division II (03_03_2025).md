The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting covered a wide range of topics, focusing primarily on budgetary and operational challenges faced by key state agencies and institutions, including the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHFGD), the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH), and the University System of New Hampshire (USNH). Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHFGD):**
1. **Budget and Funding Challenges:**
   - The NHFGD’s budget includes unrestricted funds, dedicated accounts, and a balance forward of $9.3 million. However, unrestricted funds are under significant pressure, with future budgets projecting deficits without additional general fund support.
   - License fee revenues, last increased in 2018, saw a COVID-related bump in 2020-2021 but have since leveled out. The department is considering fee increases to address funding shortfalls.
   - General fund transfers have been critical since 2014, initially as direct transfers and later integrated into the conservation law enforcement accounting unit for transparency.

2. **Operational and Personnel Issues:**
   - The department manages 193 authorized full-time positions, with 18 critical vacancies, particularly in law enforcement. Recruitment efforts are ongoing.
   - Pay raises since fiscal year 2022, along with high overtime and holiday pay in divisions like hatcheries and law enforcement, have impacted the budget.
   - Rising retiree health benefit costs, driven by an aging workforce, are a growing concern.

3. **Modernization and Infrastructure:**
   - The department is transitioning to an online registration system for off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRV), expected to be operational by September 2024. This transition is costly but aims to improve efficiency and reduce long-term costs.
   - A significant portion of OHRV registration fees is transferred to the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR) for trail maintenance, with the department retaining a smaller portion for operations.

4. **Search and Rescue and Environmental Programs:**
   - The hike safe card has been successful in generating revenue for search and rescue operations, but indirect costs are not fully accounted for in the budget.
   - Proposed changes to the environmental review and permitting process could impact the department’s ability to meet mandates and avoid legal challenges.

### **Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH):**
1. **Budget and State Funding:**
   - CCSNH emphasized the need for state support to maintain flat tuition rates despite rising costs. The system requested $17 million for critical maintenance and program-specific renovations but received only $700,000.
   - Federal pandemic relief funds (ARPA) were used to offset lost revenue and invest in online learning technology.

2. **Workforce Development and Programs:**
   - CCSNH plays a crucial role in workforce development, particularly in early childhood education and nursing programs. Concerns were raised about low wages in these fields post-graduation.
   - The committee stressed the importance of balancing endowment growth with the needs of current students to ensure tuition affordability.

3. **Financial Overview:**
   - CCSNH provided a detailed breakdown of revenues, expenses, and personnel costs, including Grant-funded positions. The committee requested more detailed financial forecasts and variance analysis for future budgets.

### **University System of New Hampshire (USNH):**
1. **Financial Challenges and Enrollment Trends:**
   - USNH faces a proposed 8.3% reduction in state funding ($16.5 million) for fiscal years 2024-2027, following a $20 million cost reduction plan for fiscal 2026. The system urges the legislature to maintain the governor’s recommended funding level.
   - Enrollment has declined by 11% over five years, though there has been a recent small increase in New Hampshire resident students for the first time since 2013.

2. **Workforce Development and Research:**
   - USNH is critical to New Hampshire’s workforce pipeline, with 3,000 graduates entering the state’s workforce annually. The system has strong ties to industries like life sciences and advanced manufacturing.
   - USNH, particularly UNH, is a leader in research (classified as R1 by Carnegie) and has significant partnerships with federal agencies like NOAA. However, federal grant funding faces uncertainties, with stop-work orders on some grants.

3. **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI):**
   - USNH clarified that its DEI initiatives focus on student support services (e.g., veterans, disabilities) and do not influence admissions or hiring decisions based on race or underrepresented status.

4. **Capital Investments and Endowment:**
   - USNH has made significant investments in facilities, such as the $95 million Life Sciences building at UNH. The system’s endowment is valued at $988 million, with a 4.5% annual payout supporting scholarships and campus budgets.

### **Key Themes and Legislative Considerations:**
- **Funding Sustainability:** All three entities emphasized the need for adequate state funding to maintain critical programs and infrastructure. Fee increases and potential legislative changes to funding structures were discussed as possible solutions.
- **Workforce Development:** CCSNH and USNH play pivotal roles in addressing workforce needs, particularly in high-demand fields like healthcare, education, and advanced manufacturing.
- **Modernization and Efficiency:** Both NHFGD and USNH are investing in modernization efforts, such as online registration systems and AI-driven learning platforms, to improve efficiency and reduce long-term costs.
- **Public Engagement and Education:** NHFGD and USNH highlighted their efforts to increase public engagement and education, focusing on conservation, wildlife management, and workforce readiness.

The meeting concluded with plans for continued detailed budget reviews and discussions to address the financial and operational challenges facing these critical state entities.
