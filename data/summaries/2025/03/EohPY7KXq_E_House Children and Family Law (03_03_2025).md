**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Children and Family Law (March 3, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Children and Family Law subcommittee convened on March 3, 2025, to discuss critical updates to the state’s **Child Protection Act**, with a focus on **HB 553**, a bipartisan bill aimed at modernizing definitions of child abuse and neglect. The meeting centered on refining the bill’s language to better protect children while supporting families, particularly in cases involving emotional abuse. Key discussions and outcomes included:

### **Defining Emotional Abuse and Psychological Maltreatment**
Legislators emphasized the need for clear, specific definitions of **emotional abuse** and **psychological maltreatment** to ensure parents understand what constitutes abusive behavior and to prevent misinterpretation in family court. Concerns were raised about the vagueness of current definitions, which could lead to unfair outcomes. The committee debated the use of phrases like "including but not limited to" versus providing specific examples of abusive behaviors. While some argued for explicit examples to offer clarity, others cautioned against creating an exhaustive list that might inadvertently exclude other forms of abuse.

The discussion also highlighted the psychological and emotional impact of abuse, with a focus on refining the definition of **psychological maltreatment** to include behaviors such as demeaning, threatening, or humiliating a child. This approach aims to address emotional abuse more precisely without creating overly broad definitions.

### **Intervention vs. Punishment**
The bill prioritizes **intervention over punitive measures**, emphasizing the provision of support services to families rather than immediately removing children from their homes. Legislators stressed the importance of keeping families together whenever possible, particularly in cases where parents may be unaware their actions are abusive. The bill aims to educate parents and provide resources to address underlying issues, such as substance abuse or mental health challenges.

### **Substance Abuse and Prenatal Care**
The bill includes trauma-informed language around **substance abuse disorder**, particularly for pregnant individuals. It clarifies that substance exposure alone does not automatically constitute neglect if monitored by a licensed healthcare provider. This provision seeks to encourage pregnant individuals to seek medical care without fear of punitive intervention.

### **Parental Rights and Constitutional Considerations**
The bill maintains **parental rights**, ensuring that parents can decline involvement from the **Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCF)** unless there is clear evidence of harm. It also clarifies that disagreements over a child’s religious or gender identity do not constitute grounds for intervention. The bill was confirmed to be constitutional, with references to Supreme Court cases supporting its provisions.

### **Historical Context and Systemic Improvements**
Legislators reflected on past cases, such as the **Harmony Montgomery** case, where systemic failures in the child protection system led to tragic outcomes. The bill is part of a broader effort to address these gaps and ensure that New Hampshire’s child protection laws align with best practices in other states.

### **Amendment Proposal and Next Steps**
A motion was made to amend the bill to include more specific language defining emotional abuse, with a focus on ensuring clarity without limiting the scope of what constitutes abuse. The amendment process will involve further collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including the **Office of the Child Advocate**. The committee voted to recommend the bill with the proposed amendment (**OTP-A**), acknowledging the extensive work done to refine the legislation.

### **Public Perception and Media Influence**
Representatives acknowledged the role of media in shaping public perceptions of abuse and neglect, emphasizing the need for clear, specific definitions to avoid unnecessary fear or misunderstanding. The bill aims to provide a strong foundation for child protection laws while fostering public trust in the system.

### **Conclusion**
The session concluded with a commitment to continue refining the bill to balance clarity, specificity, and flexibility in addressing emotional abuse and other forms of maltreatment. The bipartisan nature of the bill underscores its goal of protecting children while supporting families, ensuring that New Hampshire’s child protection laws are both effective and compassionate.
