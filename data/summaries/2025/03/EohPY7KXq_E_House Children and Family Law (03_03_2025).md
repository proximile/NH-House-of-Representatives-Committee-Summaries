The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held discussions focused on **Bill 553**, which seeks to update the state’s Child Protection Act to address emotional abuse, modernize definitions of child abuse and neglect, and emphasize family preservation. The bipartisan bill, spearheaded by Senator Carson, aims to align New Hampshire with other states by reflecting current understandings of abuse and family dynamics, while prioritizing intervention and prevention over punitive measures. Here are the key points from the discussions:

### **Family Preservation and Support**
- The bill emphasizes keeping families together as often being in the best interest of children, even in cases of abuse. Removing children from their homes is seen as potentially causing more harm than good.
- It focuses on providing support and education to parents and children to improve family dynamics, rather than relying on punitive actions.

### **Emotional Abuse Awareness**
- Emotional abuse, often misunderstood and unseen because it doesn’t leave visible scars, is a central focus of the bill. The discussions highlighted the need for a clear and modern definition of emotional abuse to address this issue effectively.
- There is debate over whether to include a specific definition of emotional abuse. Some representatives argue for clarity to help parents understand what constitutes abuse, while others caution against overly narrow definitions that could limit child protection workers’ ability to intervene in complex situations.
- Proposed amendments aim to refine the language around emotional abuse, potentially using phrases like “for example” to clarify that listed behaviors (e.g., belittling, threatening, humiliating) are not exhaustive.

### **Intervention and Prevention**
- The bill is designed to focus on intervention and prevention, providing trauma-informed care and support for families. It includes updated language around substance abuse during pregnancy, emphasizing help rather than punishment for parents seeking assistance.
- Psychological maltreatment is addressed within the bill, with definitions that include behaviors like belittling and threatening, though some representatives argue for more explicit examples to ensure clarity.

### **Bipartisan Efforts and Stakeholder Input**
- The bill is the result of years of bipartisan effort, with input from various stakeholders. It updates outdated language from 1980 to reflect modern understandings of abuse and family dynamics.
- The committee has invested significant time and effort into refining the bill, working with the Office of Child Advocate and other stakeholders to address concerns and ensure the bill’s effectiveness.

### **Constitutional Concerns and Public Misconceptions**
- The bill has been reviewed for constitutionality, with no issues identified. It does not introduce criminal penalties but updates definitions to guide child protection interventions.
- Representatives addressed public misconceptions, such as fears that the bill could lead to children being removed from homes for minor disagreements or parental disagreements with a child’s identity (e.g., gender or religious choices). The bill does not support such actions.

### **Next Steps**
- The committee plans to draft an amendment to incorporate feedback and refine the language, particularly around emotional abuse and trauma-informed care. The goal is to ensure clarity and alignment with modern understandings of abuse while protecting children and supporting families.

In summary, the discussions highlighted the importance of addressing emotional abuse, supporting families, and focusing on intervention and prevention to improve outcomes for children. Bill 553 represents a significant step toward modernizing New Hampshire’s approach to child protection, with a focus on clarity, support, and family preservation.
