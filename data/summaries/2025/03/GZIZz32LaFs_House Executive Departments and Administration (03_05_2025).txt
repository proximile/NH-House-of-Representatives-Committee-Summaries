The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a series of meetings to discuss and vote on several key bills, with significant focus on **House Bill 610 (HB 610)**, **House Bill 161 (HB 161)**, **House Bill 470 (HB 470)**, and **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 1 (CACR 1)**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **House Bill 610: Restructuring the Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA)**
**Purpose**: HB 610 proposes dissolving the independent **Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA)** and integrating it into the **Department of Energy (DOE)**. The OCA, established in the 1980s, advocates for residential ratepayers in utility rate cases and is funded by a tax on utilities, which is passed on to consumers.

**Key Points**:
1. **Role of the OCA**: The OCA represents residential ratepayers in proceedings before the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)**, focusing on lowering rates, ensuring reliable energy supply, and advocating for consumer interests in energy policies.
2. **Criticism of the OCA**: Representative Barry, the bill’s sponsor, argued that the OCA has not effectively lowered rates historically and has strayed from its core mission by supporting programs like **New Hampshire Saves**, which he claims increase costs for consumers.
3. **Proposed Changes**: The bill would reduce the OCA’s staff from five to three positions and eliminate its independent funding mechanism, shifting its responsibilities to the DOE. This would streamline bureaucracy but potentially reduce its effectiveness.
4. **Opposition**: Many representatives, including **Representative Harrington** and **Representative McGee**, opposed the bill, emphasizing the importance of the OCA’s independence in advocating for residential ratepayers. They argued that folding it into the DOE would subject it to political pressures and diminish its effectiveness.
5. **Fiscal Impact**: The fiscal note indicates a $1 million reduction in revenue and spending, but opponents highlighted that the bill could result in paying the current OCA’s salary through the end of their term while also funding a new position in the DOE.
6. **Conclusion**: Opponents argued that the OCA’s independence is crucial for maintaining a balanced regulatory environment and suggested tightening its statutory requirements rather than eliminating its independence.

### **House Bill 161: Restructuring the New Hampshire Commission on Native American Affairs**
**Purpose**: HB 161 proposes changes to the membership and appointment process of the **New Hampshire Commission on Native American Affairs**, allowing **state-recognized or federally recognized tribal chiefs**, including those from Vermont and other New England states, to nominate members, with the **Speaker of the House** making the final appointments. The bill also tasks the commission with studying **tribal recognition** and reporting back to the legislature.

**Key Points**:
1. **Purpose of HB 161**: The bill seeks to address issues of **representation** and **recognition** for Native American tribes in New Hampshire, particularly the **Abanaki**, who are recognized in Vermont but not in New Hampshire.
2. **Support**: Proponents argued that the current commission lacks representation from recognized tribal members, which is essential for addressing complex Native American legal and cultural issues. They emphasized the need for **state recognition** of the Abanaki and other tribes to ensure their rights and cultural preservation.
3. **Opposition**: Critics argued that the bill marginalizes the current commission and removes oversight from New Hampshire state agencies, transferring it to out-of-state tribal chiefs. They expressed concerns about accountability and the exclusion of non-recognized tribal members.
4. **Outcome**: The commission, in a **unanimous vote**, requested that the committee **not pass HB 161** as written, citing concerns about marginalization, loss of state oversight, and the exclusion of non-recognized tribal members.

### **House Bill 470: Dental Anesthesia Regulations**
**Purpose**: HB 470 addresses regulations around the administration of anesthesia in dental practices, particularly in outpatient settings, to prevent overly restrictive rules that could limit access to care, especially for pediatric patients requiring emergency dental treatments.

**Key Points**:
1. **Background**: The bill was prompted by concerns over **DEN 304**, a proposed rule by the Dental Board that would have imposed stricter anesthesia regulations, potentially hindering access to care.
2. **Support**: Oral surgeons, pediatric dentists, and general dentists testified in support of the bill, emphasizing that current practices are safe, effective, and aligned with national standards. They highlighted that restrictive rules would force patients, especially children, to seek care in hospitals, increasing costs and delaying treatment.
3. **Outcome**: The committee voted unanimously to pass the bill, with a motion to place it on the consent calendar. The bill aims to protect access to dental care, particularly for pediatric patients, and prevent unnecessary restrictions on anesthesia administration in dental offices.

### **Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution 1 (CACR 1): Establishing a Lieutenant Governor Position**
**Purpose**: CACR 1 proposes a constitutional amendment to establish a **Lieutenant Governor** position in New Hampshire to improve the state’s line of succession and avoid potential chaos if the Governor is incapacitated or leaves office.

**Key Points**:
1. **Current Issues**: The current succession plan, which makes the Senate President the acting Governor, is criticized as flawed, especially when the Senate President and Governor are from different parties, potentially disenfranchising voters.
2. **Proposal**: The Lieutenant Governor would be elected on a ticket with the Governor, paid $125 annually (same as the Senate President), and serve as a citizen legislator to avoid increasing government costs.
3. **Benefits**: It would ensure continuity, avoid conflicts of interest, and align New Hampshire with 43 other states that have Lieutenant Governors.
4. **Concerns**: Some representatives questioned the necessity, potential costs, and role clarity of the position.

The meetings highlighted the complexities of balancing independence, representation, and efficiency in state governance. Key takeaways include:
- **HB 610**: Opponents stressed the importance of maintaining the OCA’s independence to advocate for residential ratepayers effectively.
