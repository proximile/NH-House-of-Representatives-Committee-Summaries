The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings addressing a range of education-related bills, with a particular focus on **House Bill 748 (Local Education Freedom Accounts)** and **House Bill 555 (Holocaust and Genocide Education)**. The discussions highlighted significant debates around school choice, funding accountability, special education, and the inclusion of controversial topics in the curriculum. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key issues and arguments:

---

### **House Bill 748: Local Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**
**Overview:**  
House Bill 748 proposes the establishment of **Local Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**, allowing parents to use taxpayer funds for private, religious, or homeschooling options. The program would be funded through a combination of state adequacy grants and local property taxes, requiring a 60% supermajority vote for enactment or repeal at the local level.

**Key Concerns Raised:**  
1. **Impact on Public Schools:**  
   - Critics argue that EFAs would drain critical funding from public schools, particularly in special education. Public schools would still bear costs for students who leave, as they remain obligated to provide services like special education and transportation.  
   - The bill lacks accountability for how funds are spent, with concerns about transparency and oversight, including potential misuse of funds for non-educational expenses like ski passes or religious curricula.  

2. **Special Education:**  
   - Schools would retain responsibility for providing special education services to students who leave for EFAs, creating additional financial and logistical burdens.  
   - The separation of special education from regular education programs raises concerns about the effectiveness of services.  

3. **Constitutional and Ethical Issues:**  
   - Opponents argue the bill violates the state's constitutional obligation to fund public education and could lead to discrimination if funds are used for religious schools.  
   - Critics also view the bill as enabling taxation without representation, as taxpayers have no say in how EFA funds are used.  

4. **Financial Impact on Communities:**  
   - Local districts would lose significant funding, even if they repeal EFAs, as they remain responsible for students who leave.  
   - The bill could lead to increased property taxes and further strain already tight school budgets.  

**Supporters' Perspective:**  
- Proponents argue that EFAs provide school choice, allowing parents to tailor education to their children's needs.  
- They suggest local EFAs could reduce property taxes by reallocating funds already collected for education.  

**Testimonies and Arguments:**  
- **Public School Teachers and Administrators:** Highlighted the strain on public schools, loss of funding, and lack of accountability in EFA spending.  
- **Taxpayers and Parents:** Expressed concerns about the financial burden on communities and the potential for misuse of funds.  
- **Constitutional Experts:** Argued the bill contradicts the state's duty to fund public education and could lead to legal challenges.  

**Conclusion:**  
The bill faces strong opposition from educators, parents, and constitutional experts who argue it undermines public education, lacks accountability, and shifts financial burdens onto local communities. Supporters believe it empowers parents with school choice, but critics emphasize the negative impact on public schools and taxpayers.

### **House Bill 555: Holocaust and Genocide Education**  
**Overview:**  
House Bill 555 proposes amendments to the state's Holocaust and genocide education statute, expanding the curriculum to include other genocides, including the controversial inclusion of the term "Palestinian genocide."  

**Key Arguments Against HB 555:**  
1. **Anti-Semitism Concerns:**  
   - Opponents argued that the bill would fuel anti-Semitism by equating Israel’s actions with genocide, a narrative they deem false.  
   - They highlighted the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in schools and communities, particularly since October 7, 2023, and warned that the bill could further radicalize students.  

2. **Misrepresentation of Genocide:**  
   - Critics stated there is no factual basis for labeling Israel’s actions as genocide, noting the growth of the Palestinian population since 1948.  
   - They accused the bill of promoting a divisive political agenda rather than historical education.  

3. **Impact on Education:**  
   - Educators and parents warned that the bill would introduce biased and politicized content into classrooms, turning them into battlegrounds for political narratives rather than spaces for factual learning.  
   - Teachers already face challenges in implementing the existing Holocaust and genocide curriculum.  

4. **Holocaust Inversion:**  
   - Critics accused the bill of engaging in "Holocaust inversion," a tactic they say is used to demonize Israel and Jews by equating their actions with those of the Nazis.  

5. **United Nations Criticism:**  
   - Many speakers questioned the credibility of the United Nations (UN) and its agencies, citing their alleged anti-Semitic bias and involvement in promoting false narratives about Israel.  

**Key Arguments in Favor of HB 555:**  
1. **Historical Accuracy:**  
   - Proponents argued that it is important to teach about all genocides, including those involving Palestinians, to provide a comprehensive understanding of history.  

2. **Global Perspective:**  
   - Some speakers defended the inclusion of UN perspectives, arguing that the UN is a globally recognized body that has extensively studied genocide.  

**Conclusion:**  
The hearing revealed deep divisions over the bill, with opponents warning of its potential to incite anti-Semitism and politicize education, while proponents argued for a more inclusive approach to teaching about genocide.

### **Other Key Discussions:**
1. **Charter School Closure Procedures:**  
   - House Bill 752, addressing the closure of charter schools, was discussed with a focus on increasing transparency and accountability. The bill passed with a 17-1 vote.  

2. **Health Education and Gestational Development:**  
   - House Bill 667, which requires public school and college students to view videos demonstrating gestational development, was debated. An amendment was proposed to simplify the bill by focusing on medically accurate, age-appropriate health curriculum.  

3. **Transportation of Minors for Medical Procedures:**  
   - House Bill 231, prohibiting school personnel from transporting minors for medical appointments without parental consent, was discussed. An amendment clarified emergency protocols, and the bill passed with a 12-4 vote.

### **Overall Themes:**  
The meetings underscored tensions over **school choice**, **education funding**, **local control**, and the **politicization of curriculum**. While supporters of EFAs and expanded genocide education emphasized parental choice and inclusivity, critics warned of the potential harm to public schools, taxpayers, and the integrity of education. The discussions highlighted the need for clear guidelines, accountability, and careful consideration of the fiscal and ethical implications of these policies.
