### **Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee Meeting**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee convened on March 3, 2025, to discuss, amend, and vote on several bills related to local governance, infrastructure financing, development, and planning. The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance and proceeded to address a range of legislative proposals, with significant focus on regional planning, leasing flexibility, and development processes. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills Discussed**

#### **House Bill 471: Regional Planning and Growth Challenges**
- **Purpose**: Establishes a commission to study growth, traffic, planning, and land use issues in 10 southern New Hampshire towns experiencing rapid development.
- **Discussion**: Representative Perez introduced the bill, emphasizing the need to evaluate the effectiveness of existing regional planning commissions and consider reconfigurations to better serve these towns. Committee members raised questions about the selection of towns, the potential for amendments to include additional towns, and the relevance of existing mechanisms under RSA 3646.
- **Outcome**: No vote was taken during this session; further discussions and potential amendments are expected.

#### **House Bill 373: Leasing Flexibility for Town Property**
- **Purpose**: Amends RSA 41:11-a to allow towns to authorize leases for up to 99 years with a three-fifths majority vote, rather than requiring reauthorization every five years.
- **Discussion**: Representative Diane Power, the bill’s sponsor, highlighted the impracticality of short-term lease approvals for long-term projects like solar installations or cell towers. While supporters argued for greater flexibility to encourage investment, the New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed the bill, citing concerns about the three-fifths majority requirement and retroactive impacts on existing leases.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill as **"Inexpedient to Legislate"**, effectively halting its progress.

#### **House Bill 413: Streamlining Development Processes**
- **Purpose**: Extends exemption periods for subdivision plats from five to seven years and increases the preliminary step for project initiation from two to three years. Limits local building boards of appeals to decisions made under local amendments to building and fire codes.
- **Discussion**: Proponents argued that the bill reduces barriers for developers, particularly in addressing the state’s housing crisis, by preventing escalating costs due to code changes. Critics raised concerns about retroactive applications and potential legal ambiguities.
- **Outcome**: The bill was discussed extensively, but no vote was taken during this session.

#### **House Bill 372: Infrastructure Financing and Lease Agreements**
- **Purpose**: Limits the use of lease agreements for financing infrastructure projects involving fixtures (e.g., boilers, HVAC systems), requiring a three-fifths majority vote instead of a simple majority.
- **Discussion**: Supporters, including Eric Power, argued that lease agreements are often more expensive than bonds and are being misused for long-term projects. Opponents, including energy efficiency companies and school districts, countered that leases provide flexibility and cost-neutral options for municipalities.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill as **"Inexpedient to Legislate"**.

#### **House Bill 569: Countywide Communication Districts**
- **Purpose**: Establishes countywide communication districts to improve broadband and high-speed internet access by pooling resources.
- **Amendment**: An amendment was adopted to make participation in the planning committee opt-in rather than opt-out.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted **18-0** to recommend the bill as **"Ought to Pass with Amendment"**.

#### **House Bill 229: Zoning Ordinance Adoption Procedures**
- **Purpose**: Repeals the alternative procedure for adopting zoning ordinances in non-charter towns, villages, districts, or counties.
- **Discussion**: Proponents argued that the current procedure disenfranchises voters by allowing select boards to propose and approve zoning amendments without public input. Critics raised concerns about retroactive impacts.
- **Outcome**: No vote was taken during this session.

#### **House Bill 544 Local: Public Safety Assessments**
- **Purpose**: Allows optional public safety assessments on certain room occupancies (e.g., short-term rentals).
