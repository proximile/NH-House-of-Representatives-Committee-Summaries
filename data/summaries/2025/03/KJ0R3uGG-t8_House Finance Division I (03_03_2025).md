The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a series of meetings to discuss a wide range of budgetary, legislative, and operational matters, focusing on improving state services, managing finances, and addressing pressing needs across various departments. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Special Education and Advocacy**
- **Office of the Child Advocate**: The office highlighted the challenges of managing approximately 30,000 Individualized Education Program (IEP) cases with limited staff. They requested a budget increase to $740,000 to hire additional case managers and data tracking personnel, aiming to improve efficiency and service delivery. The office collaborates with agencies like vocational rehabilitation to ensure special education students become productive members of society.
- **Special Education Advocate Office**: The office ensures compliance with special education mandates and is working with the Department of Education to improve data accuracy. Discussions included the state’s funding formula for high-cost special education cases and the need to balance special education and general education funding.

### **Abandoned Property Management**
- The state collects around $24 million annually in abandoned property, with efforts to return as much as possible to rightful owners. Last year, $12 million was returned, and $4.4 million was returned this year. Methods to inform the public include advertisements in the Union Leader and outreach events. Funds not returned within three years are transferred to the general fund, contributing to unrestricted state revenue. The state treasurer discussed the costs of audits and contracts with external firms to recover property.

### **Personnel Appeals Board (PAB)**
- The PAB, established in 1986, handles appeals from classified state employees challenging disciplinary actions. Transitioning to an independent agency, the PAB requested a budget of $353,500 for FY2026, including one-time startup costs for furniture and equipment. The board hears 25-35 cases annually, with members paid $400 per hearing day and $200 biweekly for prep work.

### **New Hampshire Council on Developmental Disabilities (NHCDD)**
- Federally funded through the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act), the NHCDD focuses on improving the quality of life and advocacy for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The council collaborates with state agencies and organizations to address barriers to community participation and provides grants for accessibility projects. The budget includes $200,000 for grants, up from $30,000 in 2024.

### **Debt Service and Bonding**
- The state’s debt service is expected to increase due to planned expenditures on prison infrastructure and other projects. Representatives discussed the issuance of approximately $16 million in bonds this year and the potential restructuring of $80 million in bonds to save around $2 million over the next 10 years. The state’s debt-to-revenue ratio is currently at 3.8%, reflecting a healthy debt profile.

### **Scholarship Programs**
- The Governor's Scholarship Fund and the New Hampshire Excellence and Higher Education Trust Fund were discussed. The Governor's Scholarship Fund, established in 2018, provides scholarships to full-time students, with suggestions to increase the scholarship amount due to rising college costs. The New Hampshire Excellence and Higher Education Trust Fund, supported by Fidelity, provides scholarships based on university estimates of eligible students.

### **Trust Funds and Endowments**
- Representatives reviewed several trust funds, including the Ben Thompson Trust Fund and the Community Conservation Endowment. The Ben Thompson Trust Fund may be transferred to the University of New Hampshire Foundation for better management, while the Community Conservation Endowment ensures funds are available for the stewardship of properties supported by the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP).

### **Budget Adjustments and Revenue Shortfalls**
- The committee discussed the need to reduce the budget by approximately $65 million annually to align with the House Ways and Means revenue estimates. Potential cuts include layoffs, reducing grants, and limiting municipal reimbursements. Discussions also focused on streamlining the state's management structure, reducing the number of supervisors, and increasing the number of workers to save costs.

### **Specific Budget Items**
- **Corrections**: Concerns were raised about the Corrections Department’s budget, particularly the unrealistic reduction in overtime costs.
- **Liquor Enforcement**: Proposals to reallocate Liquor Enforcement personnel to Corrections were considered due to hiring needs in Corrections.
- **Group Two Employees**: The committee discussed the potential to reallocate Group Two employees (e.g., police forces) to areas with higher needs, such as Corrections.

### **Legislative Proposals**
- **Office of Cost Containment**: A bill to eliminate this office was discussed, with debates over its cost-effectiveness and revenue generation.
- **Paid Family Leave Marketing**: A bill in Commerce might remove the Department of Administrative Services' responsibility for marketing Paid Family Leave, potentially saving $500,000.
- **Video Lottery Terminals**: Concerns were raised about the revenue projections from video lottery terminals, with skepticism about the projected $117 million in the second year.

### **Policy Considerations**
- **Diversion Programs**: Investments in diversion programs to reduce incarceration costs were deemed wise.
- **Young Adult Court**: A pilot program for a Young Adult Court was discussed as a potential long-term cost-saving measure.

### **Public Hearings and Future Meetings**
- The committee planned public hearings for HB1 and HB2, with ongoing discussions about scheduling and coordination with other divisions and agencies.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the representatives' commitment to ensuring effective and efficient use of state resources, improving service delivery, and maintaining the state’s financial stability. Key areas of focus included special education, abandoned property management, debt service, scholarship programs, and budget adjustments. The discussions highlighted the need for careful planning and collaboration across various state agencies to address current challenges and future needs.
