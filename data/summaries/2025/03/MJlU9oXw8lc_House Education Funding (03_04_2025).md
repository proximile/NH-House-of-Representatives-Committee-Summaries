The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings focused on education funding, with significant attention given to the **Education Freedom Account (EFA) program**, **special education funding**, and broader fiscal and policy issues impacting public schools. These discussions revealed deep philosophical and practical divides over the role of public funding in education, parental choice, and equitable resource distribution. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and debates from these meetings:

---

### **Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**
1. **Definition and Purpose**:  
   Representatives clarified that EFAs are not traditional vouchers but state payments to parents, who allocate funds for qualified educational expenses. This distinction was emphasized to avoid public confusion.

2. **Means Testing Debate**:  
   There was significant debate over whether EFAs should be means-tested (restricted based on income). Proponents argued for universal access to parental choice, while opponents raised concerns about fiscal responsibility, particularly for higher-income families.

3. **Cost Estimates and Fiscal Impact**:  
   Estimates for expanding the EFA program ranged from $17.5 million to $102 million. Opponents questioned the financial burden on public schools and taxpayers, arguing funds could better support public education or provide property tax relief. Data showed fewer than 5% of EFA participants left public schools, raising questions about the program’s effectiveness and impact on public education funding.

4. **Educational Outcomes and Accountability**:  
   Concerns were raised about the lack of tracking and accountability for student outcomes in the EFA program. Critics cited poor results from similar programs in other states and called for better measurement and reporting.

5. **Parental Choice**:  
   Supporters emphasized the importance of parental choice, arguing EFAs allow families to find the best educational fit for their children, particularly when public schools fall short.

6. **Public Testimony**:  
   Online testimony revealed significant opposition to the bill (3,444 opposed vs. 791 in support), reflecting broader public division.

7. **Amendment Vote**:  
   A committee amendment to HB15 passed 10-8, though specifics were not detailed. The amendment likely addressed means testing or other program criteria.

### **Special Education Funding**
1. **HB 563 and Amendment 06508**:  
   The committee discussed and unanimously passed an amendment to HB 563, which adjusts the adequacy formula for education funding, focusing on special education. The amendment increases aid for students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), particularly for categories like autism, and reintroduces fiscal capacity disparity aid to support property-poor communities.

2. **Catastrophic Aid (HB 773 and Amendment 0714 H)**:  
   The committee considered an amendment to HB 773, blending elements from HB 742, which addresses catastrophic aid for special education. The amendment sets an 80% funding floor, removes proration in case of shortfalls, and retains a 3.5 times average cost threshold.

---

### **School Budget Caps and Local Control**
1. **Proposed Spending Caps**:  
   A bill proposing to cap school district spending based on a five-year average of appropriations, adjusted for inflation, sparked debate. Proponents argued it would control property tax increases, while opponents warned it would lock in inequities and disproportionately impact districts with higher special education costs.

2. **Local Control and Equity**:  
   Several representatives emphasized the importance of local control over school budgets and the need to address funding inequities between districts before implementing spending caps.

### **Broader Education Funding Issues**
1. **Catastrophic Aid Predictability**:  
   The state ensures at least 80% funding for catastrophic aid, with potential for 100% if funds are adequate. While seen as an improvement in predictability, concerns remain about proration leaving districts with unexpected costs.

2. **Fiscal Capacity Disparity Aid**:  
   The reintroduction of fiscal capacity disparity aid aims to support property-poor communities by reassigning funds from the extraordinary needs grant.

### **Key Themes and Divisions**
The meetings highlighted deep divides over:
- The role of public funding in education and the balance between public and private schooling.
- Fiscal responsibility and the potential costs of expanding programs like EFAs.
- Equity and local control, particularly in addressing disparities between districts.
- The importance of parental choice versus the need for accountability and measurable outcomes in education programs.

### **Future Steps**
The committee scheduled its next meeting for **March 12th** to address remaining bills, including HB137, HB237, HB354, HB443, HB461, HB549, HB656, and HB729. These discussions will continue to shape New Hampshire’s approach to education funding and policy.

Overall, the meetings underscored the complexity of education funding debates, with representatives grappling with competing priorities of fiscal responsibility, equity, parental choice, and the need for accountability in educational outcomes.
