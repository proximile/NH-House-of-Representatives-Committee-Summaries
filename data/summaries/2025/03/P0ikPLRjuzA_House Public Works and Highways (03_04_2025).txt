The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently convened multiple meetings to discuss a wide range of critical issues, focusing primarily on state infrastructure, cybersecurity, and capital budget projects. These discussions highlighted the state’s ongoing challenges in maintaining aging facilities, addressing cybersecurity threats, and managing financial constraints while prioritizing essential projects. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and decisions from these meetings:

### **State Building Infrastructure**
Representatives expressed significant concerns about the deteriorating condition of state-owned buildings, which include 96 facilities. Issues such as leaking roofs, bursting pipes, and outdated HVAC systems were cited as urgent problems. The lack of sufficient funds for maintenance and repairs was a recurring theme, with only small amounts remaining in older accounts. The state’s insurance policies, which have high deductibles, further complicate the ability to address emergencies. To mitigate these issues, there was a call to establish a capital reserve fund specifically for emergency repairs. The Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and the Division of Public Works (DPW) emphasized the importance of facility condition assessments to prioritize projects, categorizing them based on urgency, such as health and safety concerns versus less critical needs.

### **Cybersecurity**
The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) underscored the escalating threat of cyberattacks, particularly ransomware attempts, and stressed the need for robust cybersecurity measures. Full funding was requested to enhance the state’s cybersecurity infrastructure, which is critical for protecting sensitive data and ensuring the continuity of government operations. DoIT also highlighted partnerships with local municipalities and schools to improve cybersecurity across the state. While cybersecurity remains a top priority, other projects, such as the transition to cloud services, have taken precedence due to previous funding allocations.

### **Capital Budget Projects**
The governor’s office presented the capital budget for the 2026-2027 biennium, totaling $143 million, which includes projects from 16 different departments. Notable projects include:
- **Renovations to the State House Annex** ($12.25 million).
- **Maintenance for the men’s prison** and **replacement of the Cannon Mountain tram**, which saw a cost increase from $18 million to $20 million due to overruns.
- **HVAC upgrades for courthouses** in Portsmouth and Coos County ($4.3 million).
- **Elevator replacements** in aging state buildings ($650,000).
The budget aims to address critical infrastructure needs while staying within debt limits and maintaining the state’s strong bond ratings. The committee also discussed the challenges of balancing competing priorities and ensuring long-term sustainability, including incorporating energy-efficient technologies like heat pumps and solar panels into capital projects.

### **Public Works Contracts and Project Management**
Representatives discussed the process of awarding public works contracts, emphasizing the importance of selecting the lowest responsible bidder. Challenges in managing large projects were highlighted, including a past failure at a regional training facility. DPW plays a crucial role in managing capital projects, from design and bidding to construction oversight. DPW charges fees for its services, which are included in project budgets and help offset operational costs, particularly for non-general fund projects.

### **Specific Departmental Requests**
Several state departments presented capital budget requests and project updates:
- **Department of Education**: Requests included $16.46 million for the Jeffrey Ringe CTE renovation and $9.8 million for the Milford Applied Technology Center. These projects are subject to local votes, and the committee discussed contingency plans if funding is not approved.
- **Police Standards and Training (PST)**: PST requested $480,000 for physical security improvements and extensions for three projects totaling $575,200, including boiler replacements and facility upgrades.
- **Department of Safety**: Projects included an automated fuel tax system ($1.2 million) and upgrades to the State Police gun range training facility ($3.4 million). The latter project raised concerns about the current facility’s inadequacy for outdoor training scenarios.
- **Community College System**: Requests included $700,000 for relocating and expanding a welding program and $800,000 for IT infrastructure upgrades.
- **Fish and Game Department**: Funding requests included Hatchery Predator Control, replacement of a 50-foot trailer, and a backhoe, with discussions focusing on the department’s ability to handle additional debt service.

### **Medicaid and Health and Human Services (DHHS)**
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) presented several key projects:
- **Medicaid Enterprise Modular Strategy**: A 10-year, $33 million project to modernize Medicaid systems, improving efficiency, compliance, and service delivery.
- **Modernized Eligibility Services**: Enhancements to the self-service portal (New Hampshire Easy) for programs like SNAP, TANF, and Medicaid, aimed at streamlining applications and reducing errors.
- **Capital Projects**: Including security system upgrades at Glen Cliff Home ($1.3 million), elevator replacements at New Hampshire Hospital and Glen Cliff Home ($3.45 million), and a fuel system upgrade at Glen Cliff Home ($1.2 million).

### **Lapse Extensions and Financial Management**
The committee reviewed numerous requests for lapse extensions, where unspent funds from previous budgets were reallocated to other projects. For example, funds from completed projects were redirected to the Hillsboro County jail renovation, which is underfunded. The committee also discussed the health of the highway fund, which has led to the use of general funds for certain projects, raising concerns about long-term financial sustainability.

### **Energy Efficiency and Sustainability**
The state is incorporating energy-efficient technologies, such as heat pumps and solar panels, into capital projects where cost-effective. A renewable energy component is required for all large capital projects, reflecting the state’s commitment to sustainability.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the state’s ongoing challenges with infrastructure maintenance, cybersecurity, and budget constraints. Representatives emphasized the need for careful consideration of funding priorities, efficient use of state resources, and long-term planning to address critical needs. The committee agreed to follow up on unresolved questions and continue discussions in future work sessions and public hearings to finalize budget decisions. Overall, the state is focused on maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure, improving service delivery, and ensuring the security and sustainability of its operations.
