The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting covered a wide range of legislative topics, with a particular focus on **third-party litigation funding (TPLF) transparency**, **insurance-related legislation**, and **homeowner resilience programs**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Third-Party Litigation Funding (TPLF) Transparency**
The House discussed two bills aimed at regulating third-party litigation funding, which involves external financiers providing funds to plaintiffs in legal cases. The primary goals were to ensure transparency, protect consumers, and prevent undue influence over litigation outcomes.

1. **Purpose and Concerns**:
   - The bills sought to require disclosures about third-party funding agreements, ensuring that financiers do not control litigation decisions, such as settlements or strategies.
   - Concerns were raised about third-party financiers pressuring plaintiffs or attorneys to act against their best interests, with examples cited where financiers prevented plaintiffs from settling.

2. **Debate and Amendments**:
   - There was debate over whether the bills should explicitly prohibit third-party influence or rely on existing ethical rules for attorneys.
   - Some representatives argued for symmetry in disclosure, suggesting that insurance companies defending lawsuits should also disclose details like reserve amounts and litigation budgets.
   - An amendment (**Amendment 0631**) was proposed to remove specific prohibitions on commercial litigation funding while retaining safeguards against foreign entities (e.g., Chinese companies) from funding litigation.
   - The committee agreed to streamline the language of the bill, focusing on transparency and ensuring attorneys retain control over litigation decisions.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - A straw poll indicated general agreement with the proposed changes, and the committee planned to refine the bill further to balance transparency with avoiding overregulation of the attorney-client relationship.

### **Insurance-Related Legislation**
The committee reviewed several bills addressing healthcare and homeowners insurance, emphasizing affordability, coverage, and fiscal responsibility.

1. **Medicare and Healthcare Coverage**:
   - **House Bill 774** was discussed, focusing on Medicare coverage differences between Medicare Advantage and standard Medicare. Concerns were raised about the lack of coverage for Part B deductibles in standard plans, and the bill was retained for further review.
   - **House Bill 648**, which mandates insurance coverage for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for diabetes patients, was also debated. The committee retained the bill for refinement, focusing on eligibility criteria and cost implications ($22 per family member annually).

2. **Homeowners Insurance**:
   - A proposal to create a program making homeowners insurance more affordable, particularly for younger buyers, was discussed. Initial funding plans involved a $1 million state allocation, but budget constraints led to an alternative proposal to fund the program through assessments on insurance carriers.
   - The program was acknowledged for its potential to support housing affordability and economic development.

3. **Chiropractic Care**:
   - The committee briefly discussed chiropractic care coverage, emphasizing the need for ongoing access to such services.

### **Homeowner Resilience Program**
The House considered a bill to establish a grant program to help homeowners make their properties more resilient to natural disasters, such as windstorms and floods. The program would incentivize preventive measures like reinforcing roofs or removing hazardous trees, potentially lowering insurance costs.

1. **Program Overview**:
   - Inspired by similar initiatives in other states, the program aimed to provide grants for improvements aligned with underwriting factors, benefiting low-income homeowners and reducing insurance risks.

2. **Funding Debate**:
   - Initially, the bill proposed using insurance premium tax revenue, but this was rejected due to budget constraints. An alternative proposal suggested retaining up to $1 million from unspent departmental funds to seed the program, with the remainder credited back to insurance companies.
   - Insurance industry representatives expressed concerns about the funding mechanism, arguing it imposed a new tax or fee and could lead to retaliatory taxes from other states.

3. **Alternative Funding Proposal**:
   - In response, the commissioner suggested establishing the program without immediate funding, allowing for future federal grants or private donations. This approach was supported by industry representatives as a way to move forward without additional financial burdens.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - The committee considered moving forward with the program’s establishment while deferring the funding mechanism, allowing for further discussion and adjustments based on available resources.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Transparency and Consumer Protection**:
   - The discussions on third-party litigation funding and insurance-related bills emphasized the need for transparency and consumer protection, while avoiding overregulation.

2. **Affordability and Access**:
   - Efforts to make homeowners insurance and healthcare coverage more affordable were central to the discussions, with a focus on balancing benefits with fiscal responsibility.

3. **Funding Challenges**:
   - Funding mechanisms for new programs, such as the homeowner resilience initiative, were a recurring challenge, with debates over the best approach to ensure sustainability without imposing undue burdens on industries or taxpayers.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Several bills were retained for further refinement, with committees planning to address concerns about cost, eligibility, and implementation in future discussions.
