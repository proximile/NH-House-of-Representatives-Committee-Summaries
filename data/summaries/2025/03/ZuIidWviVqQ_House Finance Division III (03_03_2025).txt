The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened several sessions focused on the Division of Economic Stability, addressing critical issues related to child care, economic support programs, workforce challenges, and the efficiency of state systems. These discussions highlighted the division's reliance on federal and state funding, the impact of staffing shortages, and the need for strategic investments to support families and the workforce. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and outcomes from these sessions:

### **Child Care and Economic Stability**
1. **Child Care Subsidy Program**: Managed by the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start Collaboration, this program supports low and moderate-income families, enabling them to work or attend school. Utilization has increased by 45%, with the state spending $11 million annually to serve approximately 4,032 children as of January. The division emphasized improving child care quality through initiatives like Granite Steps for Quality and professional development opportunities, with over 1,200 professionals adding credentials last year.

2. **Federal Funding and Utilization**: The division heavily relies on federal funds, particularly the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). Concerns were raised about potential federal funding reductions and the need for state intervention to meet benchmarks, including the possible transfer of TANF funds to the CCDF.

3. **Child Care Scholarship Program**: Advocates from **New Futures** and **Early Learning New Hampshire** highlighted the economic importance of investing in child care, noting that shortages cost the state tens of millions annually. A $15 million investment in the Child Care Scholarship Program in 2023 was removed from the governorâ€™s proposed budget for the next biennium, prompting calls for its restoration.

### **Support Services and Workforce Challenges**
1. **Child Support Services**: The Bureau of Child Support collects $78 million annually from non-custodial parents, supporting 28,000 families and recovering $4.8 million for the state to offset TANF expenditures. Caseloads have declined since 2019, but collections remain stable.

2. **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)**: The TANF program promotes job preparation, work, and family stability. In 2023, 14% of recipients gained employment, while 39.4% of cases were closed due to non-compliance. The state is exploring new initiatives to support two-parent families and improve program effectiveness, potentially emulating successful models from other states.

3. **Employment and Training Programs**: The New Hampshire Employment Program and SNAP Employment and Training Program aim to help recipients gain self-sufficiency, with a 70% participation rate, the highest in many years.

### **State Systems and Operational Efficiency**
1. **New Hampshire Easy System**: This web-based portal allows users to apply for benefits, upload documents, and check application statuses. It handles about 1 million transactions daily and supports Medicaid providers and long-term care services. Efforts are underway to reduce the SNAP error rate and enhance user experience.

2. **New Heights System**: The integrated eligibility and enrollment system for the Bureau of Family Assistance manages over 133,000 active cases. Staffing shortages, with a 23% vacancy rate, have led to delays in processing applications and renewals. Training new staff takes 9 to 12 months, and high turnover exacerbates the issue.

3. **Staffing and Budget Challenges**: The department faces significant understaffing, with 394 unfunded positions and a hiring freeze affecting recruitment. The financial impact of these unfunded positions is estimated at $26 million over the biennium. Prioritized needs include establishing an eligibility call center to improve service delivery.

### **Future Considerations and Advocacy**
1. **Federal and State Funding**: Discussions emphasized the importance of leveraging federal matching funds and ensuring efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Advocates urged the committee to restore funding for critical programs like the Child Care Scholarship Program, highlighting its cost-effectiveness and economic returns.

2. **Legislative and Policy Discussions**: The committee reviewed **Senate Bill 404**, which expanded eligibility for child care professionals to receive scholarships, and discussed its impact on workforce retention. Detailed business cases for prioritized needs were called for to understand potential cost efficiencies and savings.

### **Conclusion**
The sessions underscored the critical role of the Division of Economic Stability in supporting families, child care, and workforce development. Key challenges include staffing shortages, reliance on federal funding, and the need for systemic improvements to enhance efficiency and service delivery. The committee emphasized the importance of strategic investments and policy adjustments to address these challenges and ensure the long-term sustainability of essential programs. Future work will focus on operational efficiencies, budget implications, and continued advocacy for programs that support economic stability and family well-being.
