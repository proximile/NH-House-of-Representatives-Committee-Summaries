The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on **House Bill 2 (HB 2)**, which encompasses a wide range of legislative and administrative changes. The discussions spanned topics such as **pension reform**, **licensing and inspections**, **sanitation regulations**, **fiscal adjustments**, and **administrative efficiency**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **1. Pension Reform (Group Two)**  
The committee addressed reforms to the **Group Two pension system**, particularly concerning the calculation of **extra and special duty pay** for pensions. The proposed changes aim to prevent **pension spiking** by extending the calculation period from **three to seven years**. Concerns were raised about the financial implications, especially for employees hired before 2011, and whether the pension system is adequately funded. The committee emphasized the need to balance fairness with the system’s sustainability.

### **2. Licensing and Inspections**  
#### **a. Barber Shops and Salons**  
The committee debated the necessity of **annual sanitary inspections** for barber shops and salons. Some representatives advocated for reducing the frequency to **biennial** or **complaint-based inspections**, while others stressed the importance of maintaining hygiene standards. The bill also introduces a **new definition of "shop"** to include facilities like barber shops, salons, and mobile units, streamlining licensing and inspection processes.  

#### **b. Mechanical Inspectors**  
The bill proposes transferring **mechanical inspectors** (plumbing, electrical, gas) from the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** to the **Department of Safety**, under the **Fire Marshal’s office**. This move aims to better align these roles with public safety functions. Discussions focused on ensuring proper funding for the transfer and clarifying inspection processes.

#### **c. Cosmetology Licensing**  
The committee discussed allowing the board to take **disciplinary actions** against cosmetologists rather than simply revoking licenses, providing more flexibility in enforcing compliance.

#### **d. Apprentice Registration**  
The bill proposes repealing the requirement for apprentices to provide a **Social Security number** for certification, as it conflicts with existing state law (RSA 310).

---

### **3. Sanitary and Health Inspections**  
The debate over **sanitary inspections** extended to the frequency and necessity of these checks. While some argued for reducing routine inspections to alleviate administrative burdens, others emphasized the importance of maintaining health and safety standards. The bill proposes focusing on **initial licensure inspections** and **complaint-based inspections** rather than annual checks.

---

### **4. Fiscal and Administrative Changes**  
#### **a. Department of Administrative Services (DAS)**  
The committee discussed increasing the spending threshold for grants and federal benefits from **$50,000 to $100,000** without prior fiscal committee approval. They also addressed the **Bridge’s House special account**, which handles funds for the care of the Bridge’s House, and clarified who is authorized to accept funds.

#### **b. Retirement System and IRS Fines**  
A new section allows the state to use funds to pay **penalties, fines, or interest** imposed by the retirement system or the IRS. Representatives questioned the need for this provision, as it suggests the state anticipates potential fines or audits.

#### **c. Surplus Distribution**  
The committee proposed reducing the **working capital reserve** for the Surplus Distribution Section from **six months to three months**, with funds being continually appropriated and non-lapsing.

---

### **5. Tax and Land Appeals**  
Changes were proposed to the **Board of Tax and Land Appeals**, including allowing hearings to be held **electronically or telephonically** and adjusting the staffing structure to provide more flexibility in hiring.

---

### **6. One-Time Certification Programs**  
The bill allows for **one-time certification programs** that meet or exceed 10 hours of training in fields like barbering and cosmetology. This is intended to provide flexibility in meeting licensure requirements.

---

### **7. Miscellaneous**  
The committee briefly discussed honoring the late **CJ Gerard**, a former Senate president. They also noted the overlap between **HB 2** and **House Bill 727**, emphasizing the need for consistency between the two bills.

---

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted a focus on **policy changes**, **financial impacts**, and **administrative adjustments** within HB 2. Key themes included ensuring **fairness**, **efficiency**, and **proper funding** for proposed reforms. The committee concluded with plans to address remaining bills in the next session and ensure all comments and questions are resolved before finalizing legislation.
