### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (March 4, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III convened on March 4, 2025, for a detailed work session focused on the Division of Public Health Services budget and related public health initiatives. The meeting, chaired by the Division III chair, featured presentations from key officials, including Deputy Commissioner Patricia Tilly and Chief Financial Officer Nathan White from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The session highlighted the division’s critical role in protecting and promoting the health of New Hampshire residents, while addressing challenges such as funding uncertainties, personnel vacancies, and evolving public health threats.

#### **Public Health Services Budget and Overview**
The Public Health Services budget, outlined in the governor’s operating budget, spans approximately 100 accounts and is primarily supported by federal funds and fees rather than state general funds. The division’s mission includes ensuring water and food safety, infectious disease surveillance, maternal and child health, and regulatory oversight of businesses, radiation safety, and lead testing. Despite its relatively small budget compared to other DHHS divisions, Public Health Services manages a broad range of programs, many of which rely on over 50 federal grants. Uncertainty around federal funding priorities was a recurring concern, particularly given the division’s reliance on these resources.

#### **Key Programs and Initiatives**
1. **Therapeutic Cannabis Program**:  
   - The program, consolidated under Public Health Services in 2016, is self-funded through registration fees and contributions from alternative treatment centers. With over 15,000 registered individuals, the program is more restrictive than in other states, focusing on safety and appropriate use. Anecdotal evidence suggests participants reduce their use of other medications, though clinical studies are limited due to federal restrictions on cannabis research.

2. **Public Health Data and Informatics**:  
   - The Bureau of Public Health Statistics and Informatics (BiPHy) manages health-related data, ensuring privacy and modernizing systems. Data from surveys like the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFS) and Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) informs policies addressing smoking, obesity, and substance use. The state has transitioned to electronic case reporting and maintains a comprehensive data portal for public access.

3. **Public Health Protection**:  
   - The Bureau of Public Health Protection (BPHP) oversees food safety, radiological health, and lead poisoning prevention. The lead poisoning prevention program focuses on reducing exposure in older homes and provides nurse case management for affected children. Partnerships with the Department of Environmental Services support remediation efforts in childcare facilities.

4. **Maternal and Child Health**:  
   - Programs like the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition program, newborn screening, and home visiting services aim to improve health outcomes for pregnant women, infants, and young children. Family planning services, funded by Title 10 and state funds, provide contraception and cancer screenings, though abortion services are not covered.

5. **Emergency Preparedness and Response**:  
   - The Bureau of Emergency Preparedness and Response manages public health crises, including infectious disease outbreaks and radiological events. Collaboration with state and federal agencies, such as the CDC, ensures readiness for emergencies.

6. **Chronic Disease Prevention**:  
   - The Bureau of Prevention and Wellness (BPAW) addresses chronic diseases, cancer, and opioid-related issues. Programs include tobacco and vaping prevention, cancer screening, and rural health support. Efforts to combat youth vaping utilize data from the YRBS.

7. **Laboratory Testing**:  
   - The state public health laboratory conducts disease prevention and control testing, including water quality, rabies, and respiratory viruses. A $2.4 million contract with UNH supports epidemiological efforts.

8. **Infectious Disease Control**:  
   - The Bureau of Infectious Disease Control (BIDIC) manages outbreaks of diseases like measles, Legionnaire’s disease, and tuberculosis. The New Hampshire Vaccine Association plays a key role in bulk purchasing vaccines to ensure universal access, particularly for childhood immunizations.

9. **Family Support Programs**:  
   - Programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and family resource centers aim to support families, prevent child welfare system involvement, and promote economic stability. Discussions highlighted the need to modernize TANF policies to better support non-traditional families, including divorced parents and same-sex couples.

#### **Challenges and Concerns**
- **Funding Uncertainty**: Reliance on federal grants and potential shifts in federal priorities pose significant challenges.
- **Personnel Vacancies**: A 15% vacancy rate across programs underscores difficulties in hiring and retaining staff.
- **Public Trust in Vaccines**: Rebuilding trust in vaccines, particularly post-COVID-19, remains a priority, with an emphasis on transparency and communication.
- **Emerging Health Threats**: Issues like vaping, lead poisoning, and infectious diseases require ongoing attention and resources.

#### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity and breadth of Public Health Services, its critical role in safeguarding public health, and the need for sustained funding and workforce development. Discussions highlighted the division’s efforts to modernize data systems, address chronic and infectious diseases, and support vulnerable populations, all while navigating challenges in funding, staffing, and evolving public health threats. The session emphasized the importance of maintaining robust public health infrastructure to protect and promote the health of all New Hampshire residents.
