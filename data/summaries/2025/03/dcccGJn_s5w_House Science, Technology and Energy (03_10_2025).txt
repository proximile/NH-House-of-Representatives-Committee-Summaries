The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on March 10th, 2024, focused on extensive discussions and decisions related to energy policy, utility regulations, and advanced metering infrastructure. The Science, Technology, and Energy Committee addressed several key bills, with debates centered on cost implications, regulatory clarity, and the roles of state agencies like the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Key Bills and Discussions:**

1. **HB 450 (Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy and Resiliency - C-PACER):**  
   The committee deemed this bill uncontroversial and straightforward, as a similar bill (Senate Bill 4) had already been signed into law. HB 450 was moved to be **indefinitely postponed (ITL)**.

2. **Residential Condominium Electric Rates and Meters:**  
   The committee reviewed three bills (HB 537, HB 539, and HB 680) addressing shared electric meters for residential condominiums, particularly for well and septic systems. A subcommittee recommended amending HB 537 to clarify that shared meters serving residential systems should be billed at residential rates, with costs distributed equally among units. Concerns were raised about potential cost shifts and the need for utilities to verify meter usage. Ultimately, the committee decided that these issues should be addressed through homeowners association rules rather than legislative action. HB 537, HB 539, and HB 680 were all moved to be **ITL** and placed on the consent calendar.

3. **HB 266 (Department of Energy and Public Utilities Commission Authority):**  
   This contentious bill sought to clarify the DOE’s role in PUC proceedings and its right to appeal decisions. The DOE emphasized its need for full-party status in PUC proceedings, while the PUC expressed concerns about procedural delays and complications. Proposed amendments aimed to balance these interests, but the committee decided to **retain the bill for further study** due to unresolved disagreements between the two agencies.

4. **HB 759 (Community Energy Generators):**  
   This bill aimed to expand the definition of "customer generator" to include community generators. However, concerns were raised about the potential impact on grid reliability and the need for clearer definitions and rate structures. The committee voted **10-8 to ITL** the bill, citing the need for further work and clearer statutory language.

5. **HB 692 (Advanced Metering Infrastructure - AMI):**  
   This bill addressed the adoption of advanced meters by utility companies to modernize the grid. Concerns were raised about the high costs and redundancy, as utilities already engage in long-range planning. The committee voted **10-8 to ITL** the bill, with some representatives advocating for voluntary reporting by utilities rather than legislative mandates.

6. **HB 760 and HB 761 (Competitive Markets and Battery Storage):**  
   - **HB 760** aimed to eliminate middleman costs to save ratepayers money, but the committee voted **10-8 to ITL**, citing an open PUC docket that needed resolution before legislative action.  
   - **HB 761** addressed battery storage but lacked guardrails to prevent charging batteries from the grid and reselling energy at higher rates. The committee voted **10-8 to ITL**, emphasizing the need for more specific direction.

7. **HB 755 (Energy Policy):**  
   This bill was seen as premature, with many issues still under consideration by the DOE and PUC. The committee voted **10-8 to ITL**, with plans to revisit the bill after further study.

### **Key Themes and Concerns:**

- **Resource Allocation:**  
   Representatives highlighted the need for additional resources for the PUC to handle the demands of proposed legislation, particularly in light of the DOE’s expanded role in PUC proceedings.

- **Cost and Complexity:**  
   Many bills, such as HB 692 and HB 759, were criticized for their high implementation costs and potential to complicate existing regulatory frameworks.

- **Interim Study and Further Work:**  
   Several bills were retained or ITL’d due to the need for further study, interim committee reviews, or clearer statutory language.

- **Non-Legislative Solutions:**  
   For issues like shared electric meters in condominiums, the committee emphasized non-legislative solutions, such as homeowners association rule changes.

- **Grid Modernization and Reliability:**  
   Discussions on advanced metering and community energy generators underscored the challenges of modernizing the grid while ensuring reliability and fostering competition in the energy market.

### **Conclusion:**

The meeting concluded with a focus on the need for detailed planning, stakeholder engagement, and clear statutory language to address the complexities of energy policy and utility regulations. The committee emphasized minimizing the retention of bills unless absolutely necessary and planned to reconvene in April to discuss Senate bills. Field trips or presentations were also proposed to further inform committee members on key issues before the next session.
