The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on discussing and amending **HB 694**, a bill concerning lease renewals between state agencies and political subdivisions. The key points of the discussion were:

1. **Fair Market Value in Lease Renewals**: The committee aimed to create a statute ensuring fairness in lease renewals by using **fair market rates**. This was in response to issues with leases involving state agencies and political subdivisions.

2. **Amendments Proposed**:  
   - **Representative Lon** drafted an amendment to incorporate fair market rates into lease renewals.  
   - **Kate Horan**, representing the New Hampshire Association of Counties, proposed an amendment to define **fair market value**. Her approach involved using building appraisals (conducted every 5 years or as needed), dividing the value by square footage, and accounting for depreciation (e.g., outdated infrastructure like non-functional electricity). She also suggested that additional expenses (e.g., utilities, custodial services) be negotiated separately.  

3. **Depreciation and Market Value**: The committee debated how to account for depreciation in fair market value calculations. Horan clarified that depreciation reflects the building's current deficiencies (e.g., lack of functioning utilities), ensuring fairness in valuation.

4. **Appraised vs. Market Value**: The discussion highlighted that **appraised value** and **market value** can differ significantly, especially in rapidly changing property markets. The committee agreed to focus on **fair market value** rather than appraised value to avoid discrepancies.

5. **Amendment Revisions**:  
   - The committee decided to remove a specific sentence from the amendment and simplify the language regarding additional expenses (e.g., utilities, custodial services).  
   - They also expanded the scope to include leases between **political subdivisions** and **the State of New Hampshire**, ensuring the bill applied to both directions (state-owned properties leased to subdivisions and vice versa).  

6. **Final Amendment Language**: The finalized amendment stated that lease renewals for land, buildings, or space between political subdivisions and the State of New Hampshire shall be at **fair market rates**, unless otherwise agreed upon. Additional expenses, including but not limited to utilities and custodial services, would be negotiated separately.

7. **Closing Remarks**: The subcommittee meeting on HB 694 concluded with appreciation for the collaborative efforts and the drafting of the final amendment. The bill aims to standardize lease renewals across New Hampshireâ€™s 10 counties, accounting for varying property values and costs.
