The New Hampshire House of Representatives, through multiple sessions and committee meetings, addressed a range of critical issues related to child welfare, family law, and parental rights. The discussions and votes on various bills highlighted the state’s commitment to protecting children, ensuring due process, and addressing systemic issues in the handling of abuse, neglect, and domestic violence cases. Below is a cohesive summary of the key legislative actions and debates:

---

### **Child Abuse and Neglect: Training for Healthcare Providers (House Bill 493)**  
House Bill 493 mandates continuing medical education (CME) for healthcare providers on recognizing and reporting child abuse and neglect. The bill, amended to reduce the required training from two hours to one hour, aims to ensure providers can better identify signs of abuse, particularly in cases involving minors.  

- **Supporters**, including the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate and medical professionals, argued that many cases of abuse go unnoticed due to insufficient training, leading to prolonged harm. They cited examples of infants with multiple broken bones being misdiagnosed, resulting in continued exposure to dangerous environments.  
- **Opponents**, such as the New Hampshire Medical Society and Hospital Association, contended that healthcare providers are already mandated reporters and receive training on child abuse. They argued that legislating specific training requirements could create inconsistencies and unnecessary administrative burdens.  
- **Outcome**: The bill, amended to expand the requirement to all physicians (not just those treating minors), passed unanimously.

### **Family Court and Domestic Violence (House Bill 543)**  
House Bill 543 proposed a study committee to examine how the Family Division of the court handles domestic violence cases, particularly regarding the denial of constitutional rights like due process and the right to testify.  

- **Supporters** emphasized the need to address systemic issues in family court, while the committee chair noted that a subcommittee had already been formed to address these concerns, rendering the bill redundant.  
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to deem the bill "Inexpedient to Legislator" (ITL).  

---

### **Retention of Unfounded Abuse Reports (House Bill 430)**  
House Bill 430 aimed to reduce the retention period for records of unfounded abuse and neglect reports.  

- **Opponents** argued that maintaining these records helps identify patterns of abuse or malicious reporting, even if initial reports are unfounded.  
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 16-0 to deem the bill "Inexpedient to Legislator" (ITL).  

---

### **Foster Care and Financial Rights (House Bill 661)**  
House Bill 661 addresses the management of Social Security payments, supplemental income, and veterans’ benefits for children in foster care. The bill ensures that these funds are returned to the child once they age out of foster care, rather than being retained by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  

- **Supporters** argued that this money could help foster youth with significant expenses like purchasing a car or renting an apartment.  
- **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (16-0).  

---

### **Family Court Reform (House Bill 652)**  
House Bill 652 proposed abolishing the Family Division of Circuit Court, creating an Office of Family Mediation, and reassigning family court jurisdiction.  

- **Supporters** of retention argued that the family court system has systemic issues that need thorough examination.  
- **Opponents** called the bill "hostile" to the family court system and warned it could harm cooperative efforts with the judiciary.  
- **Outcome**: The motion to retain the bill for further study passed 10-6.  

---

### **Parental Rights and Access to Information (House Bill 10)**  
House Bill 10 focuses on parental rights, including access to medical records and school materials.  

- **Amendment 0695**, introduced by Representative Deimon, clarified parental rights to access school and medical information. Concerns were raised about how the bill would handle emergency medical situations, which were clarified to be covered under existing laws.  
- **Outcome**: The amendment passed 9-7, and the bill, as amended, passed 9-7.  

---

### **Mental Health in Custody Decisions (House Bill 285)**  
House Bill 285 addressed mental health as a consideration in custody decisions.  

- **Debate** centered on whether the bill unfairly singled out mental health conditions and could lead to discrimination.  
- **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (14-0) after members agreed that existing laws and broader legislation could address the issue more effectively.  

---

### **Parental Access to Medical Records (House Bill 560)**  
House Bill 560 addressed parental access to a minor child's medical records.  

- **Amendment**: Representative Raymond proposed removing the "clear and convincing evidence" standard, aligning it with the "reasonable cause to suspect" standard used in child protection statutes.  
- **Outcome**: The amendment and the bill, as amended, passed unanimously (14-0).
