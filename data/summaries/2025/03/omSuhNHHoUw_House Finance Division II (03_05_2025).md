The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee held a series of meetings focusing on the state’s transportation and public safety budgets, addressing funding mechanisms, operational challenges, and strategic priorities. The discussions centered on the budgets for the Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Safety, State Police, and Motor Vehicles, with a particular emphasis on balancing state and federal funding, addressing staffing shortages, and maintaining critical infrastructure. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and topics covered across the segments:

---

### **Budget Overview and Funding Sources**
1. **Department of Transportation (DOT) Budget**:
   - The DOT’s FY 2026 budget is approximately $799.5 million, similar to the FY 2025 adjusted budget. Funding comes from Turnpike funds, Highway funds, federal programs (Federal Highway Program, FTA, FAA), and a small portion from General funds.
   - The budget is divided into Municipal Aid and Construction (54-55%) and Operating Budget (46%). Federal funds play a significant role, particularly for highways, transit, and aeronautics.
   - The DOT has implemented budget adjustments, including eliminating 16 full-time positions (7 permanent, 9 temporary) and reducing funding in areas like equipment, overtime, and supplies.

2. **Department of Safety and State Police Budget**:
   - The Department of Safety’s FY 2026 and FY 2027 budgets focus on salaries, benefits, and operational costs. Vacant positions, particularly in the State Police, remain a challenge, with ongoing efforts to recruit and retain personnel.
   - Federal grants support programs like Homeland Security, opioid abatement, and emergency management. Concerns were raised about using opioid abatement funds for law enforcement rather than patient care.

3. **Funding Challenges**:
   - Both departments face challenges with federal matching requirements. For example, a $1.7 million reduction in general fund matching for transit could result in a $3.7 million loss in federal FTA funds, potentially leading to service cuts.
   - Turnpike funds are restricted to the Turnpike system, but there are discussions about using them for broader State Police enforcement, raising concerns about sustainability.

### **Staffing and Vacancies**
1. **DOT Staffing**:
   - The DOT has maintained a consistent number of full-time positions since 2014 but faces increasing vacancy rates. A retention incentive program has been introduced to address staffing shortages, particularly in winter maintenance.
   - High vacancy rates in Highway Maintenance, Bridge Maintenance, and other areas have led to increased reliance on temporary hires and deferred maintenance.

2. **Department of Safety and State Police Staffing**:
   - The State Police struggles with vacancies in specialized units like detectives, major crime units, and hazardous materials response. Efforts to fill these roles include reclassifying positions and adjusting pay differentials to attract qualified candidates.

### **Infrastructure and Maintenance**
1. **Transportation Infrastructure**:
   - The DOT highlighted the need for continued investment in equipment replacement, winter maintenance, and deferred maintenance. Winter maintenance is underfunded, requiring additional funds for severe conditions.
   - Projects like the Portsmouth and Dover Transit Centers are managed through public-private partnerships (P3), generating revenue and improving parking availability.
   - Funds are allocated for critical repairs, such as patrol sheds, contaminated wells, and lift bridge operations.

2. **Highway and Turnpike Maintenance**:
   - The Turnpike system’s budget includes maintenance, operations, and toll collection, with a focus on transitioning to all-electronic tolling and maintaining the I-95 bridge.
   - Highway design and construction projects, including resurfacing, reconstruction, and bridge replacements, are funded by federal and Turnpike sources.

### **Public Safety and Law Enforcement**
1. **State Police Operations**:
   - Discussions focused on the distribution of State Police resources across troops, specialized units, and programs like the Northern Border Alliance and Granite Shield, which target drug enforcement and border security.
   - Challenges include managing overtime pay, coordinating with federal agencies, and addressing staffing shortages.

2. **Driver’s License and Records Sharing**:
   - Proposals to allow the sharing of driver records with federal entities raised privacy concerns, prompting suggestions for further policy review.
   - The Department of Motor Vehicles emphasized efforts to improve customer service and efficiency in handling licenses, registrations, and inspections.

### **Future Needs and Strategic Adjustments**
1. **Unfunded Priorities**:
   - The DOT identified unfunded needs, including the retention incentive program, equipment replacement, and deferred maintenance. They also highlighted restricted transit revenues related to P3 agreements.
   - The Department of Safety outlined future projects, including capital improvements and safety initiatives, emphasizing the need for ongoing investment in infrastructure and public safety.

2. **Budget Adjustments**:
   - Both departments have made strategic adjustments to meet budget targets, including reallocating funds, reducing non-essential expenses, and leveraging federal grants.
   - Efforts to improve efficiency include transferring personnel between departments, updating statutes, and removing redundant language.

### **Key Challenges and Concerns**
1. **Staffing and Retention**:
   - High vacancy rates and competition with private sector wages pose significant challenges for both the DOT and Department of Safety. Retention programs and reclassification efforts are underway but may not fully address the issue.

2. **Federal Funding Dependence**:
   - The reliance on federal funds, particularly for transit and highways, creates vulnerability. Losses in state matching funds can lead to significant reductions in federal support, impacting services and infrastructure projects.

3. **Infrastructure Maintenance**:
   - Deferred maintenance and underfunded areas, such as winter maintenance and equipment replacement, remain pressing concerns. Continued investment is needed to prevent further deterioration of critical assets.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the importance of balancing state and federal funding, addressing staffing shortages, and maintaining critical infrastructure within budget constraints. Strategic adjustments, such as public-private partnerships, retention incentives, and operational efficiencies, were highlighted as key approaches to meeting these challenges. However, the discussions also revealed ongoing concerns about the sustainability of funding mechanisms and the need for long-term investments in transportation and public safety. Further collaboration and policy adjustments will be essential to ensure the effective allocation of resources and the continued delivery of essential services.
