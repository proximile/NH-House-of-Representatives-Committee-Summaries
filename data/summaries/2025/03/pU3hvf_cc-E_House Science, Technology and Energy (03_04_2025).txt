The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings to discuss and vote on several energy-related bills and resolutions. The discussions centered on balancing regulatory oversight, innovation, and consumer protection in the state’s energy policies. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key bills and debates:

### **House Bill 535**  
This bill sought to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the **Public Utilities Commission (PUC)** and the **Department of Energy (DOE)** in adjudicative proceedings involving public utilities. Supporters argued it would streamline processes, particularly in uncontested cases where parties reach agreements. However, critics expressed concerns that the bill could allow utilities to bypass PUC oversight by settling agreements among themselves, potentially undermining accountability. The committee voted **9-8** to recommend the bill as **Inexpedient to Legislate (ITL)**, effectively halting its progress. A minority report will be submitted.

### **House Bill 599**  
This bill proposed establishing a committee to examine weatherization initiatives for homes in New Hampshire. Proponents highlighted its potential to address the state’s housing crisis and improve energy efficiency. Opponents, however, argued that existing programs like **New Hampshire Saves** already address these needs, making the bill redundant. The committee voted **9-8** to recommend ITL, with a minority report to follow.

### **House Bill 710**  
This bill, as amended, authorizes New Hampshire utilities to enter into **power purchase agreements (PPAs)** for advanced nuclear energy resources. Supporters emphasized its potential to position New Hampshire as a leader in nuclear energy and attract investment. Critics raised concerns about limiting the bill to nuclear energy and potential risks to ratepayers. The committee adopted the amendment **15-2** and then voted **14-3** to recommend the bill **Ought to Pass**.

### **House Bill 221**  
This bill assesses the cost-effectiveness of the **system benefits charge**, which funds energy efficiency programs. It passed with a motion of **Ought to Pass** without amendments. Representative Harrington noted that the bill allows the PUC to periodically review system benefits through an adjudicative process. The committee also discussed an amendment to provide the PUC with more flexibility in evaluating energy efficiency programs, though some members argued the existing **Granite State Test** framework is sufficient.

### **House Bill 672**  
This bill allows **off-grid electricity providers** in New Hampshire, exempting them from certain state regulations. The committee adopted an amendment clarifying that off-grid providers are not public utilities but must comply with municipal and state safety regulations. Concerns were raised about the lack of oversight and potential risks to consumers. The bill passed with a vote of **12-5**, though some representatives expressed worries about unintended consequences and the potential for unregulated power generation.

### **House Resolution 15**  
This resolution urges New Hampshire’s Congressional representatives to advocate for changes in the **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC)** policies, particularly its **presumption of prudence** policy, which allows transmission projects to bypass detailed cost reviews. The resolution was unanimously adopted. Representative Harrington highlighted the disparity between state and federal oversight of utility costs. An amendment introduced by Representative McGee added "whereas" clauses to clarify the resolution’s intent, addressing FERC’s practices and the need for consumer protection.

### **Key Themes and Debates**  
Throughout the meetings, several recurring themes emerged:  
1. **Regulatory Oversight vs. Innovation**: Representatives debated the balance between government oversight and free market principles, particularly in energy and housing initiatives.  
2. **Consumer Protection**: Concerns about potential risks to ratepayers and the need for accountability were central to discussions on bills like HB535, HB672, and HR15.  
3. **Energy Efficiency and Sustainability**: Bills like HB599 and HB221 highlighted the state’s focus on improving energy efficiency and addressing housing challenges, though opinions differed on the best approach.  
4. **Forward-Thinking Legislation**: There was a shared recognition of the need for innovative solutions, such as advanced nuclear energy (HB710) and off-grid power (HB672), but disagreements persisted on the level of regulation required.

### **Conclusion**  
The meetings underscored the complexity of energy policy in New Hampshire, with representatives grappling with competing priorities of oversight, innovation, and consumer protection. While some bills advanced, others were recommended for further study or rejected, reflecting the divided perspectives on how best to address the state’s energy and housing challenges. The sessions concluded with reminders about upcoming work and executive sessions to address pending legislation.
