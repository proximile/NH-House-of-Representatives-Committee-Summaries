The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee meeting focused on **House Bills 131 and 781**, which address student cell phone use in schools. The discussion highlighted a careful balance between addressing the distractions caused by cell phones, accommodating student needs, and providing schools with flexibility in policy implementation. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

### **Policy Development and Scope**
1. **Purpose of the Bills**: Both bills aim to require school boards or Boards of Trustees of Charter Public Schools to develop and adopt policies governing student cell phone use during school hours. **HB 781** includes a $250,000 appropriation for funding, while **HB 131** does not.
2. **Policy Scope**: Members debated whether to restrict cell phone use **during class instruction only** or **throughout the entire school day (bell-to-bell)**. Some members preferred **local control**, allowing school districts to decide the extent of restrictions beyond classroom use.
3. **Exceptions**: The discussion centered on allowing exceptions for students with **IEPs, 504 plans, medical needs (e.g., glucose monitors, insulin pumps)**, and **English language learners**. The committee considered removing language that encouraged exceptions for **educator-led lesson plans**, as it was seen as potentially problematic.
4. **Technology in Schools**: There was disagreement over whether schools need to provide one-to-one devices (like Chromebooks) for students, with some members suggesting shared devices could suffice.

### **Language and Implementation**
1. **Specificity in Language**: Members debated the exact wording to ensure clarity and specificity, such as replacing "governing bodies" with "school boards or Boards of Trustees" and whether to use terms like "governing" versus "restricting."
2. **Implementation Timeline**: **HB 131** would take effect 60 days after passage, while **HB 781** would take effect on **July 1, 2025**. The committee debated whether to set a specific deadline for school boards to adopt policies, with some suggesting **September 1, 2025**, to align with the start of the school year.
3. **Proposed Amendments**: The committee voted to **remove a sentence** that encouraged exceptions for cell phone use during educator-led lesson plans and discussed adopting language from the governor’s budget proposal, which would **prohibit** cell phone use during the **entire school day** rather than just during class instruction.

### **Funding and Appropriation**
1. **Funding Discussion**: **HB 781** includes a $250,000 appropriation, but the governor has proposed $1 million in the budget. Concerns were raised about whether the funding would be sufficient to cover all students, with calculations suggesting it might only cover around 33,000 students.
2. **Appropriation**: Members decided not to make a recommendation regarding funding for the bill, leaving it to the full committee to decide.

### **Concerns and Considerations**
1. **Negative Impact of Cell Phones**: Members expressed concerns about the **negative impact of cell phones** on students, including distractions, access to inappropriate content, and potential harm to eyesight and mental health.
2. **Local Control**: There was a desire to **balance state mandates with local control**, allowing districts flexibility in implementing policies.

### **Final Recommendations and Next Steps**
1. **Final Motion**: The subcommittee finalized the language for the policy and voted to send both bills to the full committee for further consideration.
2. **Retention of Bills**: The subcommittee voted to retain **HB 781** without making a specific recommendation, allowing the full committee to decide its fate.
3. **Next Steps**: The committee planned to finalize amendments and report their recommendations to the full committee, emphasizing the need for clear guidance to school boards while avoiding unfunded mandates.

Overall, the discussion reflected a meticulous approach to crafting enforceable and adaptable policies, balancing strict restrictions with necessary exceptions, and ensuring the policy aligns with both educational needs and technological advancements.
