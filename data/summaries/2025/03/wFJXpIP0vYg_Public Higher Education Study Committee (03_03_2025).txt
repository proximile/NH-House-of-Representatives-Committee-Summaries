The New Hampshire House of Representatives and the Public Higher Education Study Committee recently held meetings focused on enhancing collaboration between the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH) to improve student outcomes, address workforce needs, and ensure fiscal responsibility. The discussions highlighted progress, challenges, and future initiatives aimed at streamlining operations, increasing affordability, and aligning education with economic development goals. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key points:

### **Collaboration and Efficiency**
1. **Shared Resources and Streamlined Operations**: Efforts are underway to reduce duplication and improve efficiency by sharing resources such as e-procurement tools, risk management systems, and facilities. The USNH office is relocating to the New Hampshire Technical Institute (NHTI) campus, fostering closer collaboration with CCSNH and saving $250,000 annually in rent.
2. **Single Accreditation**: The possibility of a single accreditation for the community college system is being explored to reduce intra-system competition and improve student mobility.

### **Academic Coordination and Workforce Alignment**
3. **Academic Program Alignment**: Both systems are working to align academic programs to avoid duplication and ensure seamless access to courses across institutions, particularly in online education and shared curriculum.
4. **Engagement with Employers**: Partnerships with businesses and industries are emphasized to align educational programs with workforce needs. Internships, mentorships, and certificate programs are key tools for student success, though challenges such as unpaid internships and support for small businesses remain.
5. **High-Demand Fields**: Focus areas include healthcare, cybersecurity, and skilled trades to meet New Hampshire’s workforce needs. Three-year bachelor’s degree programs, such as those piloted by Plymouth State University, aim to improve affordability and address workforce gaps.

### **Affordability and Accessibility**
6. **Early College and Dual Enrollment**: These programs, which allow high school students to earn college credits, have seen significant growth. State-supported scholarships have helped reduce costs and debt burdens, with 83% of participants continuing to postsecondary education.
7. **Direct Admission**: A program automatically admits community college graduates meeting GPA requirements to USNH institutions. Efforts are underway to extend this to high school students, though data-sharing limitations with the Department of Education pose challenges.
8. **Granite Guarantee**: Affordability initiatives like the Granite Guarantee aim to encourage in-state students to stay in New Hampshire for higher education.

### **Physical Assets and Long-Term Planning**
9. **Capital Planning**: Both systems are evaluating physical assets to optimize space utilization, reduce deferred maintenance, and explore partnerships with state agencies or community organizations for better use of facilities.
10. **Strategic Planning**: A long-term strategic plan is being developed to prioritize needs, ensure fiscal responsibility, and address deferred maintenance and capital investments.

### **Challenges and Next Steps**
11. **Data-Sharing Limitations**: Statutory or contractual fixes may be needed to address data-sharing challenges with the Department of Education, which hinder outreach efforts for direct admission programs.
12. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Future discussions will involve high school principals and other stakeholders to improve student engagement in post-secondary education and workforce readiness.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the importance of collaboration between USNH and CCSNH to enhance educational opportunities, reduce costs, and align programs with workforce needs. While progress has been made, challenges such as data-sharing, unpaid internships, and outreach remain. The committee plans to reconvene in May to continue addressing these issues and advancing the strategic goals of public higher education in New Hampshire.
