### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

#### **Medicaid Expansion and Funding**
1. **Medicaid Trigger Law**: The state’s unique Medicaid trigger law, enacted in 2018, requires a wind-down period if federal funding drops below 90%. This could lead to significant financial challenges, including state funding shortfalls and the need for alternative revenue sources.
2. **Enrollment Trends**: Medicaid expansion enrollment decreased from a peak of 97,000 to just under 60,000, with an average tenure of less than a year. The program primarily serves individuals awaiting disability determinations or waivers.
3. **Medicaid Enhancement Tax (MET)**: The committee discussed the MET’s role in funding hospital payments and ensuring sustainable funding amid potential federal funding reductions.

#### **Medicaid Policy and Eligibility**
1. **Premiums and Copays**: The state faced challenges in implementing premiums during the public health emergency but is now introducing premiums for the Granite Advantage Health Care Program (projected $12 million savings) and CHIP (projected $3.3 million savings in the first year). Copays for prescription drugs, capped at $4, are expected to save $1.5 million annually.
2. **Continuous Coverage**: New Hampshire adopted a 12-month continuous coverage policy, aligning with 48 other states.
3. **Redeterminations**: The end of federal flexibilities will require the state to resume Medicaid eligibility redeterminations, significantly increasing the workload for the eligibility team. The state anticipates over 3,000 individuals needing redetermination in March 2025 alone.
4. **Income Verification**: The state will return to pre-public health emergency income verification standards, projected to save $17 million in general funds over the biennium.

#### **Healthcare Services and Programs**
1. **Provider Rate Increases**: Targeted increases were implemented, particularly for inpatient mental health services, with rates tripled to encourage participation in designated receiving facilities (DRFs).
2. **Adult Dental Benefits**: Implemented in 2023, this program provides dental services to Medicaid recipients, including dentures for nursing home residents.
3. **Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS)**: Efforts to expand HCBS, including caregiver support and personal care services, aim to keep individuals in their homes rather than institutionalizing them.
4. **Postpartum Coverage**: The state extended postpartum coverage to 12 months, benefiting hundreds of women.
5. **Mobile Crisis Services**: Enhanced funding was provided for mobile crisis teams to offer rapid mental health response across the state.
6. **EMS and Ambulance Services**: Rate increases were implemented to address labor shortages, particularly in rural areas, and reimbursement for non-transport services was introduced to reduce unnecessary emergency room visits.

#### **Legislative Proposals and Public Testimony**
1. **HB71**: The committee deliberated on HB71, which addresses emergency shelter operations and residency verification. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with federal housing guidelines and fiscal impacts. The committee voted 5-4 in favor of an "Ought to Pass" (OTP) recommendation, with a minority report requested for full Finance Committee review.
2. **Public Testimony**: Representatives from organizations like New Futures, NAMI New Hampshire, and New Hampshire Legal Assistance expressed concerns about proposed Medicaid changes, warning that cost-sharing and premiums could reduce coverage, worsen health outcomes, and increase uncompensated care costs.

#### **Budget and Fiscal Management**
1. **Budget Neutrality**: Many initiatives were designed to be budget-neutral, with cost savings expected from reduced institutionalization and emergency room use.
2. **Federal Public Health Emergency Impact**: The state leveraged enhanced federal funding during the pandemic but now faces the challenge of transitioning back to standard operations.

#### **Future Steps**
1. **Public Hearing**: A public hearing was scheduled for March 12 at 2 p.m. to gather input on proposed changes.
2. **Upcoming Meetings**: The committee planned to meet on March 10, 11, and 12 to continue its work, emphasizing the importance of timely submission of reports and amendments.

### Conclusion

The committee focused on ensuring sustainable funding, maintaining access to services, and addressing the fiscal and operational challenges of implementing new policies. Public testimony and legislative debates underscored the need for careful consideration of the potential impacts of cost-sharing and eligibility changes on vulnerable populations.
