for the record Jeb Bradley from
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
wolfboro um pleased to be the SP coner
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 129 it passed the Senate
 
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
on a bipartisan vote of
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
21-3 the background of the bill is as
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
follows there was a um court case in New
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that changed the way that
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain permits were
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
judged by both the Department of
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and uh fishing
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
game and a very rigid reading of the
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
statute ensued that basically has
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
created a log Jam a backlog uh whatever
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
you want to call it of alteration of
 
00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
terrain permits and alteration of
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
terrain um permits are for 100,000
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
square feet and larger projects um this
 
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
backlog of Permitting has um really had
 
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
a negative impact on contractors on home
 
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
build builders on projects throughout
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as um the very rigid
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of um Wildlife issues was
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
different from the way these permits
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
have been adjudicated in the past and so
 
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
I was approached by the contractors and
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
the homebuilders I worked with Dees and
 
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
fishing game uh to come up with the
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
language that is in the copath last
 
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
version of Senate Bill 129 and as I said
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
it had an overwhelming bipartisan vote
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
in the Senate so uh Mr chairman if I can
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
just briefly walk through what the bill
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
does um I would appreciate that and I
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
think the word appreciate is perhaps the
 
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
most important word in Senate Bill 129
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
and you see it first on line
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
seven the way the current statute reads
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
um with regard to um the way these
 
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
permits for conservation of endangered
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
or threatened species um reads right now
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
and was subsequently interpreted by the
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
court they do not
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
jeopardize and so by adding the word
 
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
appreciably it m it mirrors the way that
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
first of all the endangered spe Species
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
Act um has been written appreciably
 
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
jeopardized and it returns if you will
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
to the way that these permits have been
 
00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 align:start position:0%
judged um in the past before this court
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
case and then it goes on on lines 9
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
through 11 um requiring such action
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
designed to avoid and minimize harm and
 
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
again appreciably jeopardize the
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
continued existence of
 
00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
species and it calls for rules being
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
adopted by the executive director of
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
fishing game uh to implement this new
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
statute and through that Ru making
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
process then um all entities will be
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
able to participate I think this is a
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
balanced approach um to the need and
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the contractors and the
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
homebuilders and all of the jobs related
 
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
to those Industries have signed off on
 
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.670 align:start position:0%
to those Industries have signed off on
this

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
legislation um in conversations and if
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
you will negotiations with environmental
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
groups led by uh The Nature
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
Conservancy uh sections two and three in
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
the bill were added so that in the event
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
that there was a need for mitigation of
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
wildlife impacts similar in the way that
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
road projects and wetlands um can be
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
done a mitigation fund would be set up
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
um for unavoidable impacts to Wildlife
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
or wildlife habitat and so that's broken
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
down into um species that are
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
threatened um and
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
endangered uh versus those that are not
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
threatened and endangered and funding if
 
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
there are unavoidable impacts to go into
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know both of those funds in sections
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
two and three again signed off on by uh
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
the entities that would like contractors
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
Etc um have to you know
 
00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
potentially um pay funds into this Fund
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
in order for a project to go
 
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
forward uh the if you look on page two
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
there is legislative oversight uh with a
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
report by October
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
21 uh October 1 of 2022 and every year
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
after that so the legislature will have
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
a role to play in looking at how these
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
funds are utilized so in a nutshell um I
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
think that this is a um approach that
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
has gotten broad support it's absolutely
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
essential if we are going to protect the
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
jobs of hardworking men and women in the
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
construction industry of New Hampshire
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill go forward as
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible as those
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
permits are backed up in this Log Jam
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
created by the court case so with that
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I thank you and would be
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
stand up for question thank you Mr
 
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:28.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and Senator Bradley it's always
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
ni seeing you if only remotely um I I
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
have the first question I have is you
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned Senator that that word
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
appreciably uh came out of the uh
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
Endangered Species Act of
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
1973 was that word in the original act
 
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
or was that part of the us uh congress's
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
amendment of The Endangered Species Act
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the last Congress
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know the answer to that
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
question representative shirtliffe um it
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
I was told um as we work through the
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill by all sides that appreciably is
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
the um word that's used in The
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
Endangered Species Act so when um and
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
how it might have been placed there I
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
can't answer for you thank you followup
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman absolutely good thank you Mr
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Senator
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
um this bill will give sole authority to
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the fishing
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
game to determine what projects may
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
cause an unavoidable impact on wildlife
 
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.509 align:start position:0%
cause an unavoidable impact on wildlife
and

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
habitat so um under the legislation the
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
executive director would have to adopt
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
rules um and then as these permits are
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
adjudicated obviously Wildlife interests
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
are something that the fishing game
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
department looks at but this is a Dees
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
related permit so there's um
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
participation by both
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
agencies and one last followup Mr
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
chairman absolutely sir thank you uh Mr
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
chairman um not having a life I actually
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
read the Supreme Court's decision in
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
remanding warehous or uh V us Fish and
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
Wild life back to the fifth circuit and
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
their concern was on the definition of
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
habitat and critical habitat and uh that
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
the fif circuit failed to distinguish
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
between the two do you know if in New
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do have a defin definition
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
in law uh between what is a habitat and
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
what is a critical habitat uh that would
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
be a question I think best reserved for
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
um the fishing game folks that I'm
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
assuming ass uming are going to testify
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill or Dees um
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
again I would just
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
stress how important it is
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
for um you know all of the contractors
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
and the jobs that they represent and
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
they will be testifying I'm sure today
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
also that we have this balanced
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
approach um to these Wildlife issues as
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
part of alteration of Rin fit a um
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
approach that is uh what's happening
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
right now it is going to um
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
upend uh the ability of hardworking men
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
and women and their employers to be able
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
to do this kind of work um as the Log
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%

Harvey thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
you Senator Bradley so um I understand
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
that some of these definitions would be
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
um handled through rules and Ru making
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
of fish a game but is there in this bill
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
place uh if you look
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative online 10 11 and
 
00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
12 um shall be defined in rules adopted
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
by the executive director uh that
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
obviously means that the fishing game
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
director will have to bring rules to
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
Jael car
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
so that word shall is what you're
 
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.710 align:start position:0%
so that word shall is what you're
pointing

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
pointing
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
to the word shall I think is pretty
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
intent so does that also apply to a
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
appreciable um well if you look again on
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through um 12 it
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
it says for the purpose of this
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
statute then in quotes appreciably
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the continued existence of
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
such species end quote shall be defined
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
in rules adopted so that's exactly
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
what the intent of sener Bill 129 is is
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure that um you know the executive
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
director pursue rules take them to Jael
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
card through the normal rule approval
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
mcon your hand is right thank you Mr
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Senator Bradley nice to see
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
you they and thank you for bringing this
 
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
for forward because the word Log Jam is
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
is a kind word that's happening to
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
contractors up here and to the people
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
that are issuing those permits or trying
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
to um I'm always and I so I applaud what
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
you're doing here the uh my concern is
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
um rule making and I'm hoping we'll hear
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
from fishing game later that they're
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
ready to roll this out quick because I I
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
would use the word crippling at this
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
point uh to what's happening out there
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm I'm hoping we'll be able to
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
hear that if they if we can get this
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
past that uh this will be something that
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
can happen sooner than later and thank
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
you for your efforts
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
is there a question was there well I
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
would just chime in um obviously uh
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcon is very familiar
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
with the um alteration of terrain
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
permitting process he's exactly right I
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
was probably being kind when I said it
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
was uh Log Jam as opposed to crippling
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
and um it would be my hope that this
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be a top priority to get in front
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
of Jael car
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank thank you sir any questions from
 
00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:33.909 align:start position:0%
thank thank you sir any questions from
the

00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
room thank you Mr chairman morning Santa
 
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.149 align:start position:0%
room thank you Mr chairman morning Santa
Bradley

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
Bradley
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
um I understand by reading the bill that
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the executive director
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
of fishing gain to decide U what habitat
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
would be critical I'm questioning um
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
de's uh um role would Dees be
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for deciding what was
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
appreciable because they are the ones
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
who ultimately do the permit or am I
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
confused there so my understanding of
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
the way that the permitting process
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
works alteration of terrain is a Dees
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
permitting process but as part of that
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
process they consult with the fish and
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
game dep Department about critical
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
wildlife and wildlife habitat so um
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
there is a dual role if you will but the
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
way the statute is constructed it's the
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
executive director of fishing game that
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
has to promate and bring the rules
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
before Jael car on the habitat
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
issue thanks Senator I'm just going to
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
make a statement very because I did
 
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
speak with the executive director offici
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the number of permits I'm
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
pending um as of middle of March there
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
were a little over 85 permits I believe
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
that were pending fishing game taking
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
action they've since taken action on
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
over half of those um and and and dealt
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
with them um and they're move the rest
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to have done within the
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
next month or so and move those permits
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
ahead so just so and I'm sure we can ask
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
represent Mr serson about this from
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
fishing game but um just so you
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
understand what all that fog Jam looked
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
like they talking about was 90 building
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
permits throughout the state that were
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
held up that required an aot and as part
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
of that aot they needed fishing game
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
involvement and fishing game because of
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
that law was waiting to wasn't quite
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure so I you have a question for the
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
senator um so my question for the
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
senator is Senator if I understand this
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
bill right and what this bill is doing
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
is taking a process that um we've had in
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
the past that were that didn't have good
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
sides and good boundaries around it and
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we're doing we're
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
putting some rules some sides and
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
boundaries in this case of when we're
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with the money aspect of it um
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
we're actually creating a fund now that
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
will allow for this money to go into the
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
fund um to be able to offset and and use
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
for uh Rehabilitation of of habitat that
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
is that my understanding of the bill is
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah that I mean that is
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
correct and unfortunately due to the
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
court case
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
the process for adjudicating these
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
permits is I think
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know representative makoni said it
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
best it's it's crippling it's off the
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
rails and a lot of jobs are at stake so
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
by the process that's outlined in Senate
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 129 with you know the balance of
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
protecting habitat mitigation efforts
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
but also a much more um prompt
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
adjudication of aot permits um will
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
allow you know this Log Jam backlog
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it um to you
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
know get worked through the system and
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
not have this problem hopefully in the
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
future these permits um were adjudicated
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
in a much more timely fashion before the
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
court case now um these big projects I
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
mean you know when they're being
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
financed um jobs are at stake timing is
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
everything and um to have this kind of
 
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.510 align:start position:0%
everything and um to have this kind of
delay

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh with this many jobs at stake and you
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
know the economy of our state is so
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
dependent on construction to me is
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and I think Senate Bill 129
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
strikes the appropriate balance thank
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
you sen the representative
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
how thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley for taking my
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
question do you do you know by any
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
chance what
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
year that this perent process went into
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
effect originally I think the court case
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
2019 but
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
um it's fairly recent I believe it was
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
2019 but others can probably better
 
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.870 align:start position:0%
2019 but others can probably better
answer

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
that okay because I remember the
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
determining process from 20 years ago
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
and it seemed like it was a lot longer
 
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.070 align:start position:0%
and it seemed like it was a lot longer
before

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
that follow up for second question
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely followup thank you Mr um now
 
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.510 align:start position:0%
absolutely followup thank you Mr um now
this

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
this bill will actually increase fees
 
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:34.750 align:start position:0%
this bill will actually increase fees
for

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
applicants um if there
 
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:41.149 align:start position:0%
applicants um if there
are

00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
um if there if there are unavoidable
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
impacts there uh could be funds paid for
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
mitigation but remember um you know what
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
I have indicated all along the and
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
you'll hear this testimony from the home
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
builders and contractors that this is a
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
cost for them of doing business and the
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
the time that permits sit on people's
 
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.510 align:start position:0%
the time that permits sit on people's
desk

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
desk
 
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.230 align:start position:0%
desk
because

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
they take so much longer now to review
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
is so much more
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
costly and has so much more of an impact
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
on jobs than you know the uh mitigation
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
funds or the fee cost the this is a
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
acceptable cost of doing business so
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
don't take it from me um that that's the
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
case ask them that question because
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's the answer that um they
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
Senate one follow up to one still we
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
have eight
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
speakers we have eight speakers that are
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
still ping including the there is
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Hampshire Home my my
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
question is on will it be a sliding
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
scale for that fee or is a violation of
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
set fee no matter how
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
severe uh that would be a question
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
better asked of uh the
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
Departments okay thank
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
you any further questions
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
fortive representative love go ahead
 
00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:19.789 align:start position:0%
fortive representative love go ahead
thank

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
about all the paperwork and stuff I
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't see anything
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
forp I I apologize I only heard a little
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
bit of that question I'll rephrase so
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
the question is that um from
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative love is that there's
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
going to be a cost efficient game to go
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
out do inspections and stuff and there
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem there any way in this bill
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
for the suspicion game to recoup that
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
labor cost that'll be added to that is
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
that is there supposed to be a way of
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
doing that um again that would be a
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Mason any further
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%

legal coordinator of the fish and game
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
department I want to thank Senator
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
Bradley for his introduction of this
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
bill and his attempt to answer the vast
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
majority of questions that have been
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
posed uh I really don't have very much
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
to add other than my ability to answer
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that have been
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
asked by members of the committee to
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
this point uh and with the permission of
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
the chair I would attempt to do those
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
right now absolutely go ahead thank you
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh moving to representative shift's
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh one of the things I want to
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh point out to folks is that the
 
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
Federal in um Endangered Species Act is
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
the federal endangered Species Act and
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
that's administered by the US fish and
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
wildlife service we're talking here RSA
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
2112a which is the state equivalent
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
where the department a ficient game is
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
administering a state list of threatened
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
and endangered species it is somewhat
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
different uh so what we're trying to do
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
here is to move the standards under the
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
state act to become much closer to those
 
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
contained in the federal act they don't
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
have to be absolutely identical but what
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is move it closer so
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
that when these matters are adud udated
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
in our state courts there is an entire
 
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
body of federal law Around The
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
Endangered Species Act that our courts
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
can use for guidance as to the meanings
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
of these critical terms including
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
appreciably the meaning of habitat the
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
meaning of critical habitat which have
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
been extensively litigated at the
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
federal level and in fact are the
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
subject of federal regulations which I
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
cited to you in my testimony so that is
 
00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%
the reason why uh these words have been
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
proposed and why these words are
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
important uh as to representative
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
Harvey's question regarding rules I must
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
tell you that these particular rules are
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
in fact of the very highest priority
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
there is a working group between uh fish
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
and game department and the Department
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services that meets on
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
a weekly basis to propose changes to
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
rules to try to implement these new
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
standards uh in fact we have already
 
00:28:56.679 --> 00:28:57.990 align:start position:0%
standards uh in fact we have already
drafted

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh some proposed changes which went to a
 
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
an unusual joint pre- rulemaking hearing
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
process where we've already sought
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
comment not only from the regulated
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
Community but also from the
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
environmental Community uh that was
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
conducted and we've received that and
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
we're moving on towards our next draft
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
so that we can in fact uh propose rules
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
in the very near
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
future uh with respect to uh questions
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
that really been asked by representative
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
mccon and Howard and love regarding
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
resources at the Department of Fish and
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
Game um understand that there are no
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
fees that come to the Department of
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
fishing game for the conduct of wildlife
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
assessments and
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
reviews and so therefore uh we have been
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
performing these tasks with existing
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
staff using uh resources from our
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
non-game program and also from federal
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
grants we do not receive any portion of
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
any uh application fee that has been
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
filed by an applicant with any other
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
state permitting agency and so are
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
resources an issue yes however this is
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
not a secret and this is something that
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
has been extensively discussed not only
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office but also with
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
h and Senate budget writers and that
 
00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:21.789 align:start position:0%
h and Senate budget writers and that
process

00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
continues uh with respect to uh
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lam's question as to
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
whether Dees would be the agency that
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
would decide what is the meaning of
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
appreciably jeopardized the answer to
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
that is no that would not be conducted
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
in their rules it would be conducted in
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
the rules of the fish and game
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
department because these uh rules that
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
we would be proposing affect not only
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services but
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
all other state agencies uh that may
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
come before us with regard to requests
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
for permits or requests for changes in
 
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:55.519 align:start position:0%
land use on land that they own that
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
could include Department of trans
 
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation the Department of Natural
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources and
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
others uh I think uh that that answers
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
all of the questions which
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
representatives have posed to this point
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any other
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
questions that any other representative
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
pose uh Vice chairman Abul has a
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
question for you go ahead Vice thank you
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Senator taking
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
my question is there a big difference
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the list of federal
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
inventer species and the state is there
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
a very big difference between those two
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
list um thank you representative the
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
lists of uh Federal endangered species
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
and state
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
dangered I'll get it endangered species
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
they are different uh they are already
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
contained in rules that have been
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
promulgated by this department uh they
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
are different species they're not the
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
same and the two programs are not
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
administered in lockstep we certainly
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%

to my one question to Senator Bradley
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that was regarding the word applic
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
applicability um was that add was that
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
part of the original Endangered Species

question representative it was not in

thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
Sanderson for taking my question absence
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
the word appreciably on page one line
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
nine would you see the agency supporting
 
00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
nine would you see the agency supporting
this

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in other words your question
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
is if that word were not part of the
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill as as it reported out and
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately passed uh the answer to that
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
is the language that is ultimately
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
chosen by the legislature is the
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
language that we will implement and we
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
will go through the rulemaking process
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the uh that word in place or that
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
word not in place and we're going to be
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
accepting comment from uh not only uh
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
legislators but also the public as we
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
adopt our rules in an effort to try to
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
improve the
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
situation thank you followup Mr chair
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely go
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
ahead does
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
that word make the ru making process for
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
fishing game more difficult to make
 
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:59.950 align:start position:0%
fishing game more difficult to make
decisions

00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
clearly uh thank you representative in
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
that regard the word is important
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
because if you are in fact a proponent
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
of change on a particular piece of
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
landscape the word appreciably helps to
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
modify and understand the efforts that
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
you're trying to make as you alter that
 
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
landscape in the absence of the word
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
appreciably uh other people may argue
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
that any changes to the landscape in
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
fact are harmful to threaten an
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
endangered species who may be present on
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
that landscape what it does there is no
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
ultimate resolution here on each
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
particular parcel there is a balance
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
between the impact to threaten an
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
endangered species and the impact of
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
private property rights that is the very
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
difficult job that staff of our
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
department as well as staff of other
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
state have in reviewing every particular
 
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.869 align:start position:0%
state have in reviewing every particular
individual

00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:35:01.310 align:start position:0%
individual
project

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
represent no thank you Mr Sanderson as
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
always you are um well educating us on
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
the Comm fishing game committee thank
 
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.310 align:start position:0%
the Comm fishing game committee thank
you

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman um Mr
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
Sanderson um so the chair just told us
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
that um the number of cases that had
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
been backlogged and I um let's see I
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
wrote down 85 there were 85 permits that
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
have been backlogged
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
that action has been taken on over half
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
of them and the rest will be taken up
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
shortly so
 
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.270 align:start position:0%
shortly so
um

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
would what caused that backlog I I
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
understand the court case is an issue
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
but um I if if since there was a court
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
case would hiring more Personnel to take
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
care of these permits would that have
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
helped with that
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
backlog in lie of SD 129 I guess thank
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
um as a result of the court case that
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
has been referred to which uh came down
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Supreme Court in
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
November of 2019 Department of
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services enacted a rule in
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh the spring of 2020 which made a
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental change and that fundamental
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
change was that instead of past practice
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
which had been sending only those
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
particular projects that had uh a
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrated impact through the natural
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
Heritage database over to this
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
department for review all applications
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
to the aot program came over to us for
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
review so so that number and increase uh
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
in workload is what has caused timing
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
because no new resources were available
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
to be uh set to the problem so uh
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
changes that have occurred recently have
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
been a return to past practice saying
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
that we will review projects that have
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh a demonstrated contact through the
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
natural heritage database and not review
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
every single project that comes through
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
the aot program that has materially
 
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
assisted in reducing the amount of time
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh that it takes to handle the number of
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
received so with those changes in mind
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
then um and it seems like you're moving
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
forward through these uh backlogged
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
permits with those changes in mind
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
why do you foresee another backlog in
 
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.589 align:start position:0%
why do you foresee another backlog in
the

00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
future thank you representative we we
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
foresee another issue going forward
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
because there is simply more development
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is occurring throughout our state
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to refer you back to
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley's comments okay uh that
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
there are in fact many more
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh that the private sector
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
is using to attempt to develop uh
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
property they're doing so because there
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
is a housing shortage in our state
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
they're doing so uh because uh there are
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
tremendous needs throughout communities
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
for development of other types of space
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
and so as development increases more and
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
more Parcels are impacted more and more
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh will need review through the aot and
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
other programs and so we do expect that
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
the overall uh request for uh reviews
 
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
and input will increase because of the
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
general economic
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
environment thank
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
s seeing none we'll move on to the next
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
I want to thank uh Dees fishing game um
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
we've been working with them over the
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
course of the past year or so on um a
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
lot of what you just heard about the ru
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
making that's been ongoing um on this
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
issue and also thank Senator Bradley um
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
we worked with him and his colleagues in
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate on some of the language in
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that you have in front of you
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
um so in we we are here to provide some
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
testimony and support of Senate Bill
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
129 um we support um the concept of the
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill um and I think as Senator Bradley
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
spoke you know we um very supportive of
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
the the mitigation fund um and how it
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's established in the bill um in
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
section two um I do want to note I know
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
we've you you've talked and heard
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on on the term appreciably um
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
we do um I think as a an conservation
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
Community we don't we oppose I guess is
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
the right way to say it um the inclusion
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
of that word on page one uh line nine of
 
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.710 align:start position:0%
of that word on page one uh line nine of
the

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um we think that that
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
including the term in the statute only
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
confuses the issue and may lead to
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
increased litigation um over the course
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
of time for Department decisions um as
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Sanderson just said the department is
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
undergoing um a rul making process um
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
they had a hearing last month um where
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
these terms um like jeopardizing the
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
continued existence of species are being
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
defined we feel that that's a better
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
place um um with the wildlife biologists
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
and the experts um with the Department
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
of fishing game to be making um
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
qualifiers Around The Endangered Species
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
Act and and not leaving it up to the
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
legislature um to do that we we think
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking process is the proper
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
place um for those terms um to be
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
defined and to be um executed and I'll
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
just say on the rulemaking side we we
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
are very supportive um and and very
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
pleased that fishing game is moving
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
forward with with rules um on on
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement and decision-making Around
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
The Endangered Species Act um you know
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
currently there are no rules um and so
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
um while I know there's been a court
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
case you know fishing game doesn't have
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
any rules for for defining terms like
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
critical habitat um jeopardizing
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
continued existence of species or even
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
how they go about making decisions on
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
which impacts are so great that um you
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
know avoidance or minimization or um
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
payment into a mitigation fund would be
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate so we just feel that um the
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
rulle making charges both in section one
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
and section two of this bill are really
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
important um we understand that there is
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
movement on rul making but I think the
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislature um putting in this statute
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
that the expectation is that within a
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
year these rules will be executed and
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
moving forward we feel is the push that
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
the department needs um because we have
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
been working um not saying there's been
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
anything wrong but you know this this
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
permitting process has been in place now
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
for for years and the department still
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any rules that that show us
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
or the public what's guiding their
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
decisions on what's appropriate and
 
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.349 align:start position:0%
decisions on what's appropriate and
what's

00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
not um with that as I mentioned I did
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
send um our testimony so if if um for
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
more information you could read that I'm
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions from the
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
much any questions from Mr
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
Brien represent go ahead thank you Mr
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr O'Brien uh Mr
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
O'Brien I got your letter and I
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate um you and the other groups
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
sending that to us on the word
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
appreciable if the bill were amended to
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
remove that word would you and your
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues find the bill far more I mean
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
able and um I I feel the word
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
appreciable is like Beauty the
 
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
definitions in the eyes of the beholder
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
so would you think it removing that word
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
would improve the bill um thank you
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative for the question um I I
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
think the the short answer is yes um you
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
know when I when I leave when I think
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
about the the term that that that
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
appreciably is is um is qualifying I
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's jeopardizing the continued
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
existence of a species and so it's hard
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
to think of of putting a qualifier in
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
front of jeopardizing the continued
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
existence you either are doing it or
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're not um and and so to us anyway um
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
defining the term jeopardizing the
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
continued existence of a species makes
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
more sense than trying to qualify it
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
before you even get to a definition and
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
and the definition um in federal statute
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
for jeopardizing the continued existence
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
of a species as well as the Draft rules
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
that fishing game put out
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
um uh for comment a month ago includes
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
the words appreciably but it it it isn't
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
qualifying jeopardizing the continued
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
existence of a species and I could read
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
the paragraph um just I hope that it
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
clarifies a little bit so this is the
 
00:44:41.559 --> 00:44:42.630 align:start position:0%
clarifies a little bit so this is the
federal

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
definition um the federal definition is
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing the continued existence of
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
means to engage in an action that
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
reasonably would be expected directly or
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
indirectly to reduce appreciatively so
 
00:44:58.349 --> 00:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
there's a term to reduce appreciably the
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
likelihood of both the survival and
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
recovery of a listed species and so
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
anyway I this is that was a very long
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
rambling answer to your good question
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative but I I do think we would
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
um I think removing that term um we
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
would support that and our hope is that
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
through the ru making process the
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
fishing game has already said they're
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
undertaking um the concerns around that
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be would would have a public
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
process that could then be defined in a
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
more clear way
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%

mrri there being none thank you we move
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%

behalf of 7,000 plus realtor members in
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
the state in support of Senate Bill
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
129 the bill ultimately surrounds the
 
00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
state application the aot application
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
and each time a business owner homeowner
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
or developer disturbs about two acres
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
the permit
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
required as we know the current permit
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
requires the applicant to report on any
 
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
impact on endangered
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
species the legislation comes in Wake of
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court case placing
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
additional burdens on the applicant to
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
have fishing game validate what is
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
already reported by the
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
applicant prior to that case the process
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
was about 6 to 10 weeks and according to
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
conversations that time is almost
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
doubled the legislation and the
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
rulemaking should provide the balance
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we wish to weigh between private
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
property rights and Environmental
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
Protection without the bill new job
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
creation will be delayed whether whether
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
they are temporary construction jobs a
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
permanent jobs which are the result of
 
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.390 align:start position:0%
permanent jobs which are the result of
business

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
expansion and more important without
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
this bill there's a delay and a cost of
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
delay of the entitlement process will
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
exasperate the housing shortage so we do
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh in its Uh current
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
form thank you thank you any questions
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%

box so good morning yes Suzanne forer
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
I'm coordinator of a Grassroots group um
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
in Milford uh called Brocks
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
environmental citizens I'm here to ask
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
you to oppose s
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
sp229 because it would weaken
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
protections afforded to wild species of
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
animals who are already in Jeopardy the
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
most Jeopardy
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
the bill if you look at it begins with
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
this powerful directive and I quote all
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
other state departments and agencies to
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
the extent possible consistent with
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
their authorities and responsibilities
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
shall assist and cooperate with the
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
executive director in the furtherance of
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this chapter for the
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
conservation of endangered or threatened
 
00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:50.670 align:start position:0%
conservation of endangered or threatened
species

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
unquote and what is the statute's main
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
purpose it's found in section three of
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
the law and it reads quote species of
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
wildlife normally occurring within this
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
state which may be found to be in
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy should be accorded such
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
protection as is necessary to maintain
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
and enhance their numbers
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
unquote but this bill allows harm to the
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
species that are already in Jeopardy so
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
how can anyone expect that the species
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
will do okay being
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
harmed by by the way minimized harm is
 
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
just another way of saying that the harm
 
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.109 align:start position:0%
just another way of saying that the harm
is

00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:34.030 align:start position:0%
is
controlled

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
regulated the harm that would be
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
authorized under this bill would be
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
regulated and minimized but it would not
 
00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:44.309 align:start position:0%
regulated and minimized but it would not
be

00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
harmless so fishing game recently
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
defined harm in a definition that is
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
tailored to fit the types of harm that
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
are experienced by the endangered
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
species it's harm that happens to them
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
as a result of Permitting decisions made
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
by departments like the Department of
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services fishing game's
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
definition of harm is this and I
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
quote harm means any act which actually
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
kills or injures individuals of a
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
threatened or endangered species or
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
which acts to destroy degrade or
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
adversely modify the habitat supporting
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
the species by interfering with breeding
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
hibernation reproduction feeding
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
Sheltering migration or overwintering
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are a part of its normal
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
or traditional life cycle and that are
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
essential to its survival and
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
perpetuation unquote that's from fishing
 
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
game that's the definition of harm and
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
that is exactly the kind of harm that
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow to happen it would
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
be harm to the house habitat supporting
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
the species by interfering with the
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
animals behaviors that are essential to
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
their survival and very important
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
perpetuation of their own species
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
remember the purpose of the 2112a to
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
maintain and enhance their
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
populations a last important Point
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
although you didn't hear it uh mentioned
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
by um attorney Sanderson for fishing
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%

Commission of the department they voted
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
to support s sp229 but I want you to
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
keep something in mind that is the Fish
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
and Game Commission Fish and Game
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
Commission we're not talking about fish
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
and game um the commission is not known
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
as the fishing game and non-game and
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
endangered Wildlife Commission where is
 
00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.950 align:start position:0%
endangered Wildlife Commission where is
their

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
expertise it isn't there you should have
 
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
heard directly from the non-game and
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
endangered Wildlife program program on
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
what they think this bill does to
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
endangered Wildlife instead you heard
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
from attorney Sanderson and he said an
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
awful lot about development and balance
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
he did not say an awful lot about the
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of 2112a and protecting the
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
species so I hope you will continue to
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
support the act as it is it is a good
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
act it is strong okay and I hope you
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
will reject S

00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
while we
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
support this the concept of the bill we
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
believe vital changes are needed so that
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
the original intent of the legislation
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
is fulfilled if passed Senate Bill 129
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
would allow state agencies such as the
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
authorize development projects that
 
00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
could cause harm to Wildlife this is a
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
bill designed to speed up the
 
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
authorization process of development
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
permit applications that are backed up
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
for review by the New Hampshire Fish and
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
Game department but rather than choose
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
to allow possible destruction of
 
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.549 align:start position:0%
to allow possible destruction of
wildlife

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
habitat the uh Department should be
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
hiring more staff to carefully review
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
permit applications ultimately this bill
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
would legalize harm to threatened and
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
endangered Wildlife species that is
 
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited by existing
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
law as it stands there are no
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
administrative rules or other public
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
documents that establish a clear process
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
or criteria for the director of fishing
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
game to reach conclusions under RSA
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
2112a it also does not require the
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game department undertake a
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process to define the terms
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
the fishing game department must develop
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
rules to clearly show how they Define
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
critical habitat how they will decide if
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
projects avoid impacts to wildlife
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
habitats and how they will determine the
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
penalty when Wildlife harm is
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
done um that's our position on this bill
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to uh take any questions thank
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity my name is Gary Abbott I'm
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
the Executive Vice President of the
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today in full support
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
129 and I would like to fill in some
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
blanks I know uh Senator Bradley did an
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
excellent job answering questions but I
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh talk a little bit about the
 
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
reason for this statute
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
change we had been uh I'm talking from
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
an applicant's perspective I represent
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
General Contractors I represent sand and
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
gravel and developers who do large
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
projects the the the prior in
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
2019 uh we had a process in which uh you
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
would file for a alteration of terrain
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
permit you would go through the
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
dees if you would end up with a National
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
Heritage database hit you would be
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
referred to fishing game fishing game
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
would then do a review of that hit which
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
only meant a smaller percentage of those
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain permits went to
 
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.589 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain permits went to
fishing

00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
game now that doesn't mean in 2019 I
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't in director n noro's office
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
looking for rules and guidance because
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
some of those permits got held up but it
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
was a very small percentage so you have
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
to understand that process in that
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
process we use pretty much the
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
terminology that's in this proposed Bill
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
the fishing game department would ask
 
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
developers to minimize or um avoid
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
impacts to these wildlife habitats what
 
00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
is the language in this that avoid and
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
minimize just wasn't in this statute
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
this statute was written
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
more than 20 years ago the court case
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
highlighted that the statute needed to
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
come up to what we were doing prior to
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
2019 and the court
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
case the other language that you're been
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
talking about is this appreciably and I
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
want to talk about that if you remove
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
that word there will be more court cases
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion because it will say Do not
 
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
jeopardize it will not give the fishing
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
game the leniency that they currently
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
have and that they had in the past
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
regarding asking developers to uh
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
minimize the impacts uh that are
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
currently exist so it would have a very
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
bad impact that is why this bill fits
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
with the fishing game and Dees updating
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
their rules the other thing that seems
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
to be missing from the conversation from
 
00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:19.670 align:start position:0%
to be missing from the conversation from
a

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
developers we supported uh the temporary
 
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
rules proposed by Dees back in January
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
of last year we then even supported uh
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
the rules in June that really caused the
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
backlog of
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
permits part of those rules in June
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
asked the developer to hire a wildlife
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
biologist to do the work the
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
investigation on projects I never when I
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
agreed to supporting those rules thought
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
it would be every permanent I thought it
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
would only be those that had some kind
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
kind of impact or some kind of
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
recognition of a threatened and
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
endangered species on the project but
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
instead it became all the
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
projects the developer assumed the
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility to hire those
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
Wildlife biologists and still submitted
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
in which most permits by dees are a
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
90day turnaround turned into months and
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
months so you can understand my position
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
as the vice president of the assoc
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
General Contractors I started to receive
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh not only from those that have
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
applications in those contractors who
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
hope to start those projects this spring
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
saying what's going on so from our
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
perspective we need this legislation
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
pass to make it clearer to what we were
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
doing in
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
2019 to make sure that there's not a new
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of much
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
stricter and part two is rules and I
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
really want to I Really appreciate what
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
Dees and fishing game have done doing
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
the pre- rulemaking hearing I know there
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
was a lot of comments we wrote uh our
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
comments at what those rules should look
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
like and what changes in their draft
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
proposal we look forward to working with
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
them but I think what you have to
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
recognize is this statute is really so
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
fishing game the director has the
 
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
ability to do some judgment calls on
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
those projects that have wild uh
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
endangered and threatened species
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
I think representative schliff asked a
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
good question about habitat because I
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
think that's part of the new broad uh
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation if there is no uh
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
endangered species but the habitat could
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
be good there's some gray area hopefully
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
through the rul making process we can
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
clarify that I don't think it has to all
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
be in the statute so I asked that the
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
fishing game committee passed this bill
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
as it was passed by the Senate it has
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
been worked on by by a number of groups
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
as you already heard it's been worked on
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
with Dees uh fishing game and even the
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I wanted to
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
put that in we have been working on this
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
bill for the last six months in the
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
sense that something needs to be
 
01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
fixed this seems to do it I would not
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
remove any of the language or change it
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
trust me appreciably did not start out
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
as that word we had many other words
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
that were tried to be used and that was
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
the best word we could find so with that
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
I would end my testimony and answer any
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you thank you Mr are
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
there any questions for Mr ra
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey thank you Mr chair
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
um so did I hear you correctly when you
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
say not everything has to be in
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that some of it could be in
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
rules and if I heard you correctly then
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't this bill and its
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
definitions be in rules and not in
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.349 align:start position:0%
definitions be in rules and not in
legislation

01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
I I I actually answered the same
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
question before the Senate the fishing
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
game and Dees have to comply with
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the legislation says so this
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
being in the statute uh clearly gives
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
the directive of what the legislative
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
intent I don't think 20 years ago we
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
were talking about avoid and minimize
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
those have things that have progressed
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
over time so we really do need it in
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
statute but there 's a lot of
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
clarification appeals process a lot of
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
things that have to be done in rules
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
that don't end up in statute but I think
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
this is the guideline and it's clear to
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
me if you do not if you just have do not
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
jeopardize there'll be a lot more court
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
cases saying any little thing can't be
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh you you you can't minimize it or
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh avoid it so that's really the issue
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
that that we have but don't get confused
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
I think the statute does guide the
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
agencies in their Ru making so this is
 
01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:02.349 align:start position:0%
agencies in their Ru making so this is
very

01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
important any other questions from Mr
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%

Association includes uh residential uh
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
Builders and remodelers across the state
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and we support Senate
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 129 as was amended and passed by
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate the bill addresses a critical
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
permitting backlog that is threatening
 
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
Land Development and economic growth
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
longtime lobbyist for the New Hampshire
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
Home Builders I understand and
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate the need for balance in
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
environmental uh and development policy
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
and when that uh when matters swing too
 
01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
far towards protection uh projects that
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
are critical to housing jobs and the
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
economy suffer and vice versa when
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
matters swing too far away from
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
protection our natural environment
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
suffers and as I'm sure all of you on
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
this committee are aware neither extreme
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
is desirable and this bill addresses a
 
01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
real and Urgent situation where the
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
pendulum has swung too far to one
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
extreme um prior speakers have covered a
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
lot of the material I had intended to
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
address and so I'd like to move quickly
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
to some of the discussion points uh that
 
01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
were raised this morning the question
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
about whether or not it would be prudent
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
to remove the word appreciably before or
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
within do not jeopardize uh I think that
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
would be a tremendous mistake um do not
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
jeopardize led to litigation which led
 
01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
to an interim rule which led to a
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
critical backlog we know how that
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
language was interpreted we know what
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
that interpretation caused what this
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill does is provide a very important
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
legislative reset uh a rebalancing if
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
you will of how that pendulum swings
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
over time and puts it back in a place
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
where environmental concerns and
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
economic concerns can again move forward
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
together it restates the policy and
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully leads the next time the court
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
reinterprets legislative intent to an
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
intent to a more modified more balanced
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
more results oriented landscape as Mr
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
Abbott was just talking about the uh
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
Reliance on the natural Heritage Bureau
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
database used to perform this function
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
for us it used to either generate a
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
quote unquote hit for sensitive species
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
listed threatened endangered species or
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
not a hit and that was something of a
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
triage system for whether or not you
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
needed to have a discussion with the
 
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
professionals at fishing game if you had
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
a hit you had something to discuss if
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
you didn't have a hit you didn't have
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
anything to discuss and you proceeded
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
with your engineering discussion with
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
the professionals at the Department of
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services on your
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
engineering um the word
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
appreciably installs that triage into
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
the statute it's a legislative statement
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
of policy as to whether or not there is
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
something to discuss whereas The Fallout
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
from the litigation said everything has
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
to be discussed let's do a wildlife
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
study on every every case uh or every
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
permit application rather and let's send
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
every permit application to fishing game
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
with that study and let's wait for
 
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
everything to be reviewed and sent back
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
and of course the result was a
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous backlog way too much work to
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
process and way too much delay for
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
contractors who can't commit to projects
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
can't hire their Workforce uh and can't
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
of course uh deliver the projects that
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
our economy and our housing uh industry
 
01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%
needs uh and our Workforce needs so I
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
think it would be a big mistake uh to
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
remove the word appreciably it modifies
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
do not jeopardize in a way that is
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
responsible but also returns us to some
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
balance and uh the notion that uh policy
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
can be set in rulemaking policy is set
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
at the state house and all of you were
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
elected to make those determinations for
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
your constituency and for the state
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
rules uh must fit Within statutes and I
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
know you all appreciate that difference
 
01:07:59.069 --> 01:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
and distinction um it would be un
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if that word were removed um
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
there's already been one case and I
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
think it's quite likely there'll be more
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that word will be important if the
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
court is again asked to interpret the
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
language in this law um with that I'll
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
end my testimony uh and simply ask uh
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
for uh your support on this bill which
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
comes with a sense of urgency as as you
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
know the well notwithstanding last
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
week's snowstorm the weather is
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
improving and we are in the midst of the
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%

Sharbino um everybody keeps talking
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
about backlog and I just want to give
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
you the real version of what backlog
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
means to US contractors in a covid world
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
everything's backlogged but to us this
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
backlog is real so obviously um we're
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
Paving we do large heavy Highway um site
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
work but when fall comes or closer to
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
Christmas we lay off probably say 25% of
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
our people just due to Paving you know
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
the winter what we try and do is keep as
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
many people as possible shuffle them to
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
these type projects that we're talking
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
about um large sites what what happened
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
this year is we didn't know when these
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
approvals were going to come so the
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
ability to shuffle people keep them
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
working was mere impossible so something
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
we had three to four shovel what we
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
would call shovel ready projects that we
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
knew within 30 to 60 days normally we'd
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
be getting a permit for and everything
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
would be done you know that's 20 to 80
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
guys that now we can employ on large
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
jobs well now I can't Shuffle those good
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
employees that I have to those locations
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
I can't it could be six to nine months
 
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
till I get that permit so we ended up
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
having to lay off more people
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
than normal in the winter because of
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
this backlog so I just I want to really
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
put an exclamation point on what that
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
backlog truly means it's not just papers
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
on a desk it's employees working it's
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment it's all those things that
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire contractors are really
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
feeling because of this
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
backlog thank any questions for Miss
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%

minute

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%

wildlife in New
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh this bill I'm asking you to
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
oppose it and um it seems like this bill
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
has come about because of a backlog
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
and part of the backlog problem is
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
because of Co everybody's working from
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
home and everything was slowed down
 
01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
because of covid so that's part of the
 
01:11:35.239 --> 01:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
because of covid so that's part of the
problem

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
um um anyway this bill will weaken the
 
01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Endangered Species
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
Act this is no time to weaken our
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
endanged Species
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
Act we need uh nature nature um I'm
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
talk because of pandemics and covid
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the importance of Nature
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
and and we should not weaken our
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
endanger Species Act at this time
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
because of everything that's going on
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
with our
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
environment I would also like to say
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
developers maybe maybe they could donate
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
to the um non-game fund so that fishing
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
game could hire more people to take care
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
backlog there is that solution to hire
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
more people rather than we can our
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
Endangered Species Act and um that's all
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
I have sorry any
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none in the room seeing
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
none on Zoom thank you Miss appreciate
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
it I'm gonna ask Paul serson come back
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
online I follow question Paul are you
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
available for a question uh thank you Mr
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm here thank you I just want
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear as I'm reading the bill the
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
other thing is Bill do we've been
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
talking a lot about the word Fe but um
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
other thing I see I think if I
 
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
understand the bill properly I'm just
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
trying to uh make sure I'm clear is that
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
this also establishes a new fund for
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
fish game if I'm not mistaken that any
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
of these fees that may be assigned to um
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
to contractors or or or or developers
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that fund would go would then be a
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
non-aps and fund that would be funding
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
project to facilitate net conservation
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
benefit to threatened and endangered
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
species so not only do we have this
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
language about appreciable we also are
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
by Statute now creating a brand new fund
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
that would give you resources to be able
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
to mitigate um any you know for a net
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
conservation benefit overall um
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
endangered species is that correct uh
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes that is
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
correct those sections of the bill
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're really enabling legislation uh
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
that enabled the department to accept
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
funds that are offered as is part of
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
Permitting processes uh remember that
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
here at Department of ficient game we do
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
not have permitting Authority nor do we
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
have the authority to impose uh any sort
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
of exaction upon anyone as part of a
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
permit process however this would enable
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
us to receive funds that have been
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
offered voluntarily in other permitting
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
processes and put them to these very
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
targeted uses uh and as was noted by
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley with significant
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight uh as to how those
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
funds would be used for these particular
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you one followup question
 
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
one follow question for you I'm G to go
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
back to the word appreciably because
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's been the topic of conversation
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
the entire day um so on as I'm looking
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
at this it seems to be what what what
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
we're asking fishing game to do by this
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
bill is to do similar things we do with
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
when you're managing a her right the
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
deer her we don't tell you by Statute
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
how many permits they issue for hunting
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
licenses or how many boosts you can take
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
or any the other lottery type things
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
that that you do that as part of your
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
normal process to manage good herd
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
management and as I read this bill at
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
least the way I'm reading it and correct
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong is that we're asking to
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
do the same thing here is to manage
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on and have you put in the
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
rules what you're going to use to manage
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
that is that a a fair reading of this
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh it is um and understand too um
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
that this is a a bill that imposes a
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
standard not only for the Department of
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services not only for the
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain program but our uh
 
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
relationships with all other state
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
departments and all other types of
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
programs and so yes it is giving us a
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
set of discretion to work with all of
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
those other uh applicants all of those
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
other agencies in order to accomplish
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the statutory purpose
 
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
represent I'm glad you brought Mr
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
Sanderson back thank you because I had a
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
couple questions you know questions pop
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
up as we listen um so m Mr Sanderson so
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I I I did understand that there would
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
be um in section two and three there
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
would be ways uh to for funds to be
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
deposited with a various places in the
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
en ficient
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
game how those how those uh fees are
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
determined is that another thing that
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
would be taking place in this um very
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
inclusive rul making process like well
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
one person how how will you know that
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
one person gets charged $10 and another
 
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
person gets charged $10 million I
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
mean yes thank you for your question
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative um the actual uh
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
definitions and operation of a
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation program would not be
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
contained within fishing game rulemaking
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
because we're not the permanent
 
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
Authority we make recommendations based
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
upon reviews to permanent authorities
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
and so whether or not uh mitigation
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
payments are in fact required would be
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
part and parcel of rules that would be
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
adopted by other state agencies who are
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
administering those permit programs so
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
the consistency between the rules in the
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
various departments is something that is
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
the task of jel car uh so certainly as
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
individual departments go forward with
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
their permitting processes and as they
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
develop a mitigation program that deals
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
with these things that's where jel car
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
performs its
 
01:17:24.669 --> 01:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
function I have
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I think I just heard you
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
say that these um uh funds would be
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary voluntary and so I'm just
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
wondering would that could that possibly
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
lead to any expectation on the part of a
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
developer that if I voluntarily pay more
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'll get my
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
permit uh thank you for your question
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative again as as fishing game
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
makes its recommendations based upon
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
reviews of individual projects goes back
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
to permitting agencies those permitting
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
agencies have to be very careful as they
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
develop and administer mitigation
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
programs as and mitigation programs
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
already exist for example the armm fund
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
um The Aquatic resources mitigation fund
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
already exists so these questions have
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
been asked and answered in other types
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
of programs where mitigation is allowed
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
um you have you raise a good question
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
but it is something that jel car is
 
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
attuned to to make sure that that sort
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
of criteria is there and that it's not
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
pertain thank
 
01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.110 align:start position:0%
pertain thank

thank you Mr serson take one more
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
question uh currently many times the
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
state agencies and the D take a
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation or the advice from the
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
conservation town and cities
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission or uh Regional
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
planning commissions is it anything is
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
change thank you for your question
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative there's nothing in bill
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
that changes the local planning process
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
or takes away any sort of local control
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
over that particular planning process
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
that are contained in existing planning
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
statutes um as you go through local
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
planning process as you know local
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions local planning
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
boards local zoning boards of adjustment
 
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
all make their particular approvals
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
contingent upon receiv required state
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
permits so there is nothing here that
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
changes that local process or changes
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
the process of review in any particular
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
municipality nor does it impose
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%

good morning everyone I'm Denise rardy I
 
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
represent District nine I was asked to
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
introduce this legislation by the New
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
Association the Genesis of this bill was
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
a number of restaurants learning this
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
past summer that they needed a license
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
department if they sell lobster that has
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
been processed and packaged many of them
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
had been buying frozen lobster meat from
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
Food Distributors such as sis
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
US Food Service or Performance Food
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
Group and they never realized that they
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
needed a license from New Hampshire Fish
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
and Game so I took part in a meeting
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire lodging and
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association and the fish and
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
game department to learn more about why
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
are we requiring licenses for
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants that purchase processed and
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
packaged Lobster M the explanation is
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to license all those
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
involved with the harvesting processing
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
wholesale Distributing and eventual sale
 
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
of lobsters in order to protect the
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
fishery of the golf of M while I agree
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
with this I do not think it's necessary
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
an effective or efficient use of the
 
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
Department's resources to license and to
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
enforce the law on those restaurants
 
01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
that buy and sell processed and packaged
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
Lobster meat from Food Distributors it's
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
just Overkill we already licensed all of
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
those involved well before the processed
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
and packaged meat hits the restaurant we
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
license the Harvester we license the
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
processor we license the non-resident
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
wholesaler and we license the resident
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
wholesaler under this
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
legislation if you buy processed and
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
packaged Lobster meat from a licensed
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
wholesaler or processor you will not
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
have to obtain a license from the
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
Department if you are a rest
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
however that buys live lobsters you will
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
still have to get a license from the New
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant

Association and fortunately for you this
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
bill is a lot simpler than the bill you
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
just heard I uh I was on at 9:30 9:30
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh it was quite a complex
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill so this one is really simple I
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
affectionately refer to it as the
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
lobster roll bill um and it basically
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
addresses um the issue of uh processed
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
and pack packaged Lobster meat uh and
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
for restaurants that buy that meat um
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
right now they have to obtain a license
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
from fishing game and this bill uh says
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
and and I do want to thank Paul
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
Sanderson uh for um working with us on
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
the language uh I know the department
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
had uh some concerns with the original
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and the way the bill
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
was worded uh We've simplified it and it
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
basically says if you're a restaurant
 
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
you buy processed package meat from a
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
licensed wholesaler or processor so
 
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
we're already you know purchasing it
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
from someone that that's that the
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
department has some ability to regulate
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um the Fisheries are
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
protected um then you don't have to get
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
a license um and I want to thank Paul
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
for working with us on that it's a
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
simple Bill I'm happy to answer any
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions but it it passed unanimously
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and we're hoping for a
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
quick passage in the house too
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%

01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
Mr speak to see any comments Rel to this
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
for the Department Mr serson are you
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman I have
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
returned and I really have nothing to
 
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
add uh to what Senator richardi and Mr
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
Vu had indicated um the reason the
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
department had concerns is because the
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
entire set of regulations of lobster are
 
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire but we also
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
are part of an interstate compact called
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic state marine fisheries uh
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
commission which administers this type
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
of regulations up and down the Eastern
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
Seaboard and so our concerns were about
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
being as consistent as possible uh with
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
our obligations to
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
asmfc uh we believe with this very
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
simple language that we will be able to
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
make adjustments to our Lobster rules um
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
not only to protect these particular
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
vendors but also to make sure that we
 
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
have protected marine fisheries and uh
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
the lobstermen who are engaged uh in
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
this uh from any particular negative
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
impacts and so uh I would like to thank
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Vu and the senate for their hard work
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
on this making the adjustments that they
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
did and we will proceed and make this
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%

and see me we can thank you very much
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
the Wonder so we're talking about Senate
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 51 which was our least
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
controversial Bill the morning um and
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
we'll just open it up for discussion um
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
and see where the members TR to H is
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
there any concerns of this bill why we
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
point seeing nothing in the room
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
representative Howard go ahead I just I
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
just want to kind of clarify
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
um my reading of this it say you know
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
under 21 38 no person shall sell has not
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
been processed or sealed within
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
containers do not require
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
refrigeration so I'm assuming that this
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
license required for that process is
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
there also
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
license for selling r
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing so so again so
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
under current law if you sell any ler
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
you have to have a permit so if you sell
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
if you buy prepackaged from Cisco you
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
have to go get a license and and if it's
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
just prepackaged meet for lobster rules
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
um you have to go get a license if you
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
sell live lobster you also have to get a
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
license under this current bill because
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about um processed
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
and packaged Lobster meet would only
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
apply to um people who buy that Lobster
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
meat from Cisco you still have live
 
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
lobsters you still have to get a license
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
so restaurants that have live locks
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
still have to have an additional license
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
correct whoever they purchase those from
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
correct and my understanding in the
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
conversation is that was had to do with
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
establishing chain all over Lobster
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
there so you don't have somebody buying
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
Lobster from The Lobster off the boat
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
bypassing entire but doesn't that create
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
a more expensive competition
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
and because you're forcing the
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant to buy a license to buy from
 
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
him not major packaging NOP again even
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
if it's only if you're buying
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
nonprocessed lobster live lobster either
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
from from a large supplier or from a
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
lobster directly off the boat would have
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
to have a license either it doesn't
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
change it does change I will tell you
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
the price license is $50 that's what
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking I know it's just just more
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
government we trying to get the
 
01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:58.830 align:start position:0%
government we trying to get the
government

01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
out the license already exists we're
 
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get it out of the way for some
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
some any further
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
conversation you think we're ready to
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
go yeah all right so we're gonna briefly
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman um Mr chairman I'm
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
for all the testimony I'm still
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about the word
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable and um in the letter from
 
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
attorney uh Sanderson he
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the proposed new language
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
is designed to move state law closer to
 
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
the EST standage used by the federal
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
agencies and uh and they relied on the
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
endangered Species Act of
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
1973 as well as the implementation of
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
new regulations that were P part of the
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
combined Federal Regulations passed last
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
year by Congress and uh this is where
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
where the word acceptability came into
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
play in what one Congress can giveth
 
01:40:42.589 --> 01:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
another Congress can taketh away much
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
like the New Hampshire house
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I think and we heard from the uh
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
conservation groups and others that uh
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is a very good bill a much
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
needed Bill uh but that word of
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
acceptability does cause a lot of
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
concern and personally I'd like to see
 
01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
the bill amended to remove that one word
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then I would have no problem uh
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
supporting the passage of the
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I think the word appreciably
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
appreciably yeah that's ites easy for
 
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
you to say I'm sorry representative
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you chairman
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm going to support this
 
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
bill because it
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
does uh tend to give some constitutional
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
landowner right back to the people but
 
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
it comes at a cost and that's the thing
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with you know every
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
time we turn around passing legislation
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
house thank you uh repres CL thankk you
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I had the same conern
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
appreciably at first but um after
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony and listening
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
to the the explanation from B serson uh
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
from fishing
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
game I believe that where you have
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
appreciably used in line seven but then
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
the order for fishing game to Define
 
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
aebly jeopard
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
in line 11 all we're doing is saying F
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
game now you can Define what jeopardize
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
means it's no different than what we do
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned before giving them the ability
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
to manage hers they can now use their
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
rule making to make a firm decision of
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
what appreci jeopardized means they can
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
then promulgate that decision to all
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
other departments that they work with in
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
the state so that everybody's on the
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
same page
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
and they will have
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh the ability to Define that in rules
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
so that if in the future the the federal
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
endangered Wildlife act changes they can
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
still redefine in rules a lot faster
 
01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
than we can deal with in the legislature
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
what the definition of appr pre
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
jeopardized means it also gives them the
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
ability to quickly adjust their
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
definition it turns out that uh we have
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
impact to an endangered species that
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know about before so I think that
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
this is the best way to approach it it's
 
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
given flexibility fishing game to Define
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.589 --> 01:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
used um I
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
actually I disagree I I have a problem
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
with that word appreciably um I think um
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
I support the concept of the bill in
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
that it's pushing New Hampshire fishing
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
gang to make rules and regulations but
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
um um in a timely fashion but
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
considering that um permits the backlog
 
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
has is is being work through um at a at
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
least a reasonable Pace according to
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
your information then I think we need to
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh take our time with this and make sure
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
that we get it right and I think
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
appreciable is one of those words that's
 
01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
just um too wishy-washy so I could
 
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
support the bill without that word if it
 
01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
could be amended because I do like the
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
concept of asking fishing game to make
 
01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations the only other
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
issue I have uh with a bill but without
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
the word appreciable I would support it
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
but I do some have some issue with the
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
idea of um yes SE there were divisions
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
of fishing game that would be reimbursed
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
for um um unavoidable harm but those um
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursements are voluntary par so you
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
know it's it's up to the kindness of the
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
heart of a developer as to whether they
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
are going to um Supply the money for
 
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
that harm so that that bothers me a
 
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
little bit um but it's it's more the
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
word appreciable so I would like to see
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
it amended without that word we are the
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
fishing game committee not we Realtors
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
and developer committee and so um you
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
know harm to fishing game is harm to
 
01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.790 align:start position:0%
know harm to fishing game is harm to
fish

01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh I certainly
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
understand the concern of people who
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
think that appreciably is a little
 
01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.669 align:start position:0%
think that appreciably is a little
subjective

01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
01:45:37.229 --> 01:45:37.239 align:start position:0%
however most of the language is
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
objective what is jeopardize what is
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
harm what is
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
minimize uh what is critical uh so
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
everything about this requires good
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
faith and I have confidence that in our
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
department that they will exercise this
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
in good faith as it's intended to
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
minimize uh any potential harm to any
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
critical or threaten
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
species uh and I support it as written
 
01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.189 align:start position:0%
species uh and I support it as written
representative

01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
e thank you Mr chair I do concur with
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey and representative
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
shirtliff in my concern about
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
appreciably but moreover I have a
 
01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
concern that the demand that this will
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
put on fishing game and already
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed organization that is
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
underfunded by our state and if these
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
donations for financial
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
support for for services bothers me on
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game that they have and it's
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
another reason why I actually appreciate
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
being part of this committee is fishing
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
game does so much for the state yet we
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
minimize sorry about
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
that the internet is better on the road
 
01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
house um the the concern I have is that
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
we're putting all of these demands on
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
this agency and now they're going to be
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
working on behalf of Realtors and
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
contractors and while I uh am a
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
proponent of a solid and growing economy
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
we have to be smart about the way that
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to push this agency to do
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
things that they're not funded for so
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's my big concern with this bill is
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going while this backlog I
 
01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
think is some part by underfunded agency
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
and so I would like to look at some
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
other ways that
 
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
that donation is maybe more of a you
 
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
know suggested contribution or some type
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
of um you know if there's a bill that
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
the that the uh contra tractor has to
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
receive from fishing game to come out
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
and and do some of this work I know that
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh that happens sometimes with with
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
hunting you know the folks will fishing
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
game will come out and take care of of
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
animals for folks um and the farmer has
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
to um pay that fee so that's my concern
 
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
here is somewhat with the language that
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
gives it a vag vager and somewhat with
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
the financial concern that I'll put upon
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh the agency thank
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent I'm gonna go to
 
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
people who haven't spoken first and then
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to second second word um
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
do want to make one comment to that
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
question though either way ficient game
 
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
is doing this is that by the court order
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
they're obligated to review every aot
 
01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
permit um that goes to De because of the
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
court order the court case that went
 
01:48:37.709 --> 01:48:37.719 align:start position:0%
through so whether we pass this bill or
 
01:48:40.109 --> 01:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill they still have the
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
obligation so those 81 permits they had
 
01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
backlogged in March um we're still going
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
to they're still going to grow um I just
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
happened to take a big peek at our
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
revenues because because it driven by
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
the rep tax our real estate transfer tax
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
and we're up 32% so development is
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
happening and those permits and fishing
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
gain are going to continue and the
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
question is whether we give them the
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
authority of managing and how we make
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
the managing whether we give them a
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
funding source that's kind of what this
 
01:49:07.629 --> 01:49:07.639 align:start position:0%
bill is doing but just understand that
 
01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
while we can we can talk about the fact
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we're not the you know the housing
 
01:49:14.669 --> 01:49:14.679 align:start position:0%
and development program we also have to
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that they are in fact
 
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
have to do this already by the by the
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
court ORD so we have to manage how would
 
01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:24.679 align:start position:0%
best how best manage that process
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
because they have to um represent the
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%

01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
gives a like to stand on
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
judg could be looking at a a 10 acre
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
development uh that has a Acres around
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
affecting have to
 
01:51:02.669 --> 01:51:02.679 align:start position:0%
beated project to be delayed a cost
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
developers you know and I I do have
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
concern too represent mentioned about
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
the funding for this he's
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
take and I don't have the I don't have
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
how much man
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
power but without this
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
with us passing this wouldn't that um
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
you know I know in the state
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
constitution we can't uh do an unfunded
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
mandate would be mandating fishing game
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
to do this and therefore that be it
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
language so on the unfunded mandate that
 
01:51:43.069 --> 01:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
only relative to towns and cities we
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
can't pass down town C we think State
 
01:51:49.149 --> 01:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
agen whatever we want but relative to
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
28a is Rel pass cost by passing stat
 
01:51:59.709 --> 01:51:59.719 align:start position:0%
AG represent M you had your hand go
 
01:51:59.719 --> 01:52:01.109 align:start position:0%
AG represent M you had your hand go
ahead

01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
sir uh thank you Mr chairman pleasure to
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
be with you folks and I'll speak as a
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
practitioner the um the there was a lot
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
of talk on backlog and what that's
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
causing the business and so forth but
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
the problem really started with a rule
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
change in Department of Environmental
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
Services that caused all all of these
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
applications to go to fishing game when
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
it was only select that were causing or
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
would cause harm too so the problem
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
really started with Dees and uh we heard
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
some uh we heard some testimony that
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
some folks uh thought that the uh impact
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
the Fallout would not be what it was but
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
it turned out to be that um this this
 
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
appears from what I'm hearing from the
 
01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:50.950 align:start position:0%
appears from what I'm hearing from the
commissioner

01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh will correct that will allow them to
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
move forward um I stand in support of
 
01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:21.990 align:start position:0%
 
trouble

01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh while we're thinking about
 
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
loading work on somebody what about our
 
01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.149 align:start position:0%
loading work on somebody what about our
court

01:53:31.149 --> 01:53:31.159 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
system secondly uh thing called
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
paralysis by analysis at some point
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
human judgment has to come in I think we
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
are making a lot of good steps in this
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.350 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
anybody else who hasn't spoken
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
yet thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
follow up because some conversation came
 
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
up around the term voluntary that was
 
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
used by Mr Sanderson and I was wondering
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
if the chair would allow Mr Sanderson
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
come back on for a clarification
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
question I believe that one of the
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
parties here in the room whether be me
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
or one of the others is
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding voluntary I don't
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
believe that that was voluntary from a
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
land owner or a builder it was voluntary
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
from the permitting agency as in they
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
could pass along part of the permitting
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
prices and fees that they put on the
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
building site and so Dees could
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
voluntarily pass that along game or
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
whatever agency was working I'd like to
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
get clarification on that I also would
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
like to emphasize that I don't think
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
this is increasing workload on F game
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
they have to do it now what I heard from
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
Paul Sanderson it would actually
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
decrease their workload because they
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
have to do every permit now and this
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
would allow them to now go back to where
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have to handle every single
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
permit that that has potential
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
impact unless this objection in the
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee I will allow Mr sers come back
 
01:55:12.189 --> 01:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
and talk to the question that voluntary
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
payment to get clarification around what
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
that means Mr Sanders are you there yes
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
I am thank you Mr chairman
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
um if I could to correct any sort of
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding from my comments let me
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
make a couple of points once again uh
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
fish and game as we go through this
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
process we make recommendations to other
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
permitting agencies we have no authority
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
to impose any sort of exaction upon any
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
particular uh applicant or Pere however
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
as it moves over to the permitting
 
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
agency permitting agency through its
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
particular program may have the ability
 
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
to impose such a fee or such an exaction
 
01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
in accordance with rules or other
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
procedures that they may
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
adopt okay so it is also possible for uh
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
a particular applicant to make a
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary contribution to fishing game
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
that is the voluntary nature of what an
 
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
applicant may do so let me please just
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
make the distinction between these
 
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
fishing game cannot require an exaction
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
a permitting agency through the adoption
 
01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
of rules and other procedures could
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
require an exaction any applicant is
 
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
free to make a voluntary payment based
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
upon their own
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
determination if I can get those three
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
job thank you I think that made this
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
clear as much
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
um don't use the word volunt Paul I'm
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
gonna rephrase because I'm a simple guy
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
I like simple words so what it sounds
 
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
like to me what you said was because
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
you're not the permitting agency and
 
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
Dees is the permitting agencies of an
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
aot authorization of of dinin um that uh
 
01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
for the for the change of terrain the um
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
Dees could establish rules that would
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
create some some fee structure that
 
01:57:09.629 --> 01:57:09.639 align:start position:0%
would require fees for Mitigation Of of
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
habitat um however you can't require
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
that however that doesn't stop any um uh
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
contractor developer from from putting
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
funds in because having mitigation
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
issues is that correct all of those are
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%
correct statements Mr chair thank you
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for Paul while
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
goe thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
Sanderson I'm just trying to like keep
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
track of of of how this works so at the
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
current time after the Supreme Court
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
case all application per for permits
 
01:57:49.069 --> 01:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
have to go through fishing game what
 
01:57:49.079 --> 01:57:50.470 align:start position:0%
have to go through fishing game what
happened

01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
those how can I say this if so under
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
this bill the executive director
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
would use his rul making Authority or
 
01:58:08.669 --> 01:58:08.679 align:start position:0%
whatever to decide if a project
 
01:58:08.679 --> 01:58:10.340 align:start position:0%
whatever to decide if a project
appreciably

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:10.350 align:start position:0%
appreciably
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:11.910 align:start position:0%
appreciably
[Music]

01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
um causes problems to the wildlife
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
habitat um and I guess his
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation would then be fish and
 
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
games recommendation that would go to
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
the permitting agency is that do I have
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
that right so far yes you do um now I
 
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
just want to make one small correction
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
when you say that all particular uh
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
applicants for all particular permits
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
now have to come to fish and game that's
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
only true for the alteration of terrain
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
permits and that's only because of the
 
01:58:45.709 --> 01:58:45.719 align:start position:0%
rule that several Representatives have
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
referred to that was adopted by
 
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services in
 
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
response to the Supreme Court case that
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
affected that program there again we
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
deal with many different departments we
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
deal with other types of permits and so
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
it is the requirement for all right now
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
is limited to the alteration of terrain
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
program now moving on to your next point
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
which is when we do receive a review and
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
undertake a review that results and
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we make back to the
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
permitting agency they are
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations because we are not the
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
regul at Authority we're not the
 
01:59:20.639 --> 01:59:21.669 align:start position:0%
regul at Authority we're not the
permitting

01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
agency the regulatory agency the
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
permitting agency takes that information
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
in and in general will in incorporate
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
that into the permits that they do in
 
01:59:33.629 --> 01:59:33.639 align:start position:0%
fact issue to
 
01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
applicants have followup
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
follow in your esteemed opinion how
 
01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
would this bill reduce or prevent the
 
01:59:43.639 --> 01:59:44.709 align:start position:0%
would this bill reduce or prevent the
existing

01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
backlog okay I I don't know how esteemed
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
the opinion is but um in any event what
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
is actually happening in the dis between
 
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
our agencies is what has been reported
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
to you that we are going back to the
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
system where the information that is
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
being sent over to us is based upon uh
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
information from the natural heritage
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
database instead of having every single
 
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain permit come to our
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
agency for review it would be those that
 
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
do have positive information coming from
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
the nhb database the so-called nhb hits
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
you heard from several testimony several
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
people who gave you testimony this
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
morning that will
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
temporarily cause the uh reduction in
 
02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:31.719 align:start position:0%
the amount of reviews that we conduct
 
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
and will reduce the amount of time in
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
backlog however as we also reported to
 
02:00:39.149 --> 02:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
you and as you've heard the general
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
economic uh condition that is out there
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
is increasing the number of uh projects
 
02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
that are being proposed increasing the
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
number of permits that are likely to be
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
filed and that will increase again the
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
number of permits uh and other questions
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
that will come to us for review that's
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
why we're trying to send the information
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
to you that suggests the current efforts
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
that we're taking to manage are that
 
02:01:08.189 --> 02:01:08.199 align:start position:0%
current efforts temporary not the
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
solution thank you Mr chair so um I just
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
want to pick up and make sure that I
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
heard uh representative the flame
 
02:01:23.950 --> 02:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
statement correctly so in his rulemaking
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
authority the the executive director
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
would have sole authority to decide
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
which permits go forward to the
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
permitting or um agency um and that his
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
his decision
 
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
is then considered New Hampshire Fish
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
Games decision did did representative of
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
flame say that correctly or did
 
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
question not quite accurate okay and
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
again remember we work with many
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
different agencies on many different
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
programs and so therefore for example
 
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
working with the Department of
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation we enter into a
 
02:02:06.069 --> 02:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
memorandum of agreement or a memorandum
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
of understanding with the assistance of
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to control
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
the relationship between our two
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
departments okay on issues of that type
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it's not solely within
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking authority of the
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
executive director of the fish and game
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
department that would also be true for
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
02:02:27.390 --> 02:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
resources what we what we are talking
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
about here is working cooperatively with
 
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
and the alteration of terrain program
 
02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we conducted our request for
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
comment in advance of Ru making jointly
 
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
so that as we try to adjust these two
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of program the aot program and
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
our response to the aot program the two
 
02:02:51.790 --> 02:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
departments are working together such
 
02:02:54.030 --> 02:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
that both sets of rules will go to Jael
 
02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
car on a consistent schedule and that we
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
will work cooperatively to try to manage
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
our problem and try to manage our effort
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
to more quickly respond to these
 
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
requests for
 
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
information you know I think the more I
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
listen to
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm still confused I'm just
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
confused on a higher level so let me see
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
if I can clear one thing up for Paul
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe having served on job card now my
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
third term um if you don't understand
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
what the rule making it's not like the
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
commission just writes a rule and says
 
02:03:26.189 --> 02:03:26.199 align:start position:0%
okay this is the new rule go do it um
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
that has an entire process behind it
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
that has public hearings and public
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
input um and then when they're all done
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
doing their public hearings and public
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
input and they come out with an adjusted
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh rule that rule then goes in front of
 
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
jard joint legislative commit
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
administrative rules who then reviews
 
02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
the rule again and makes recommendations
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
and and considerations for adjustments
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
to that no I that's part I guess so so
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
understand well I'm not sure everybody
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
does I know as a freshman I had no idea
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
what they put me on I'm pretty sure
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
speaker I think it
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
was was Jas was eming me for something
 
02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
put but um just I just want to make sure
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
fresh understand what what that rule
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
process looks like it's not just one
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
person sitting in a room creating a new
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
rule and making it a refollow state so
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
there is a significant amount of public
 
02:04:17.069 --> 02:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
input public comment process as well as
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
a length of time because a period of
 
02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:19.350 align:start position:0%
a length of time because a period of
time

02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements of how long rules
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
have to be open the public comment and
 
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
all that so there's a pretty significant
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
process for that so I guess this is
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
where I go back to with you know again
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
with the only word we seem really
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
focusing on is the word appreciably here
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
well I moved past that yeah well for me
 
02:04:40.549 --> 02:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
so my question is um I I just want to
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
know who at New Hampshire fishing gang
 
02:04:46.189 --> 02:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
when there's been one of these requests
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
for permit one of these backlogged
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
requests who at fishing game reviews it
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
and decides that it is um it is harmful
 
02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
or not harmful and should move forward
 
02:05:02.589 --> 02:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
to whatever the next steps are who at
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
fishing game makes that
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
determination so Paul I know we heard
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
that question you want to answer so the
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
question comes down to is is there a
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
biologist or who's looking at these aot
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
um permits requests that are coming
 
02:05:17.709 --> 02:05:17.719 align:start position:0%
through right now in your agency and
 
02:05:21.069 --> 02:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
how's that determination made regarding
 
02:05:24.189 --> 02:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
the appreciably jeopardized standard
 
02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I did hear the question
 
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is this referral
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
comes over to our Wildlife division it
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
is then specifically delegated to the
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
non-game program the supervisor of the
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
non-game program works with one
 
02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
full-time wildlife
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
biologist and one uh halftime dedicated
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
to this particular program and those
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
three individuals work together to to
 
02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at the specifics of the
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
individual case and make a determination
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
of the level of review that is required
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
to provide recommendations in that
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
individual case so it is the wildlife
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
Division and non-game program with those
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
three specific employees who make the
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
determination and communicate back to
 
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
the permitting agency or the other state
 
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
agency so the executive director has
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with it well uh we all
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
work for the executive
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
any further
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
questions wanted
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
to further potential clarification on
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
this where the executive director comes
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
in is is in kicking off the rul making
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
process to define the definition of
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
appreci jeopardize the continued
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
existence of such species in the ru
 
02:06:42.750 --> 02:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
making which essentially is setting the
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
bar that fish game will measure against
 
02:06:49.629 --> 02:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
the biologists make the determin
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
of whether that bar has been reached or
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
roached or whether they're well within
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
bounds of that correct Paul uh yes all
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
all of our Authority within fishing game
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
flows through the uh executive director
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
um I am the person who actually drafts
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
these in cooperation with our other
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
staff but I don't actually attempt to
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
promulgate a rule without the permission
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
of the executive director um the exact
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
criteria that may be contained in there
 
02:07:21.149 --> 02:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
is reviewed by the executive director
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
before we file formal rulemaking and go
 
02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
through the process in Jael car the
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative Lang describe to you um
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
so again all of our authorities flow
 
02:07:33.870 --> 02:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
else thank you Paul so we're back to
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
General discussion on the bill as as it
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
stands um again you know my position is
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
that you know this is to a certain
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
extent build trust you know whether we
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
trust the wildlife group the three
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
employees we just spoke about as they
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
review this and and I'm sure they're
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to have input into what this word
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
appreciably jeopardize means um in that
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
phrase um in the development of rules
 
02:08:06.549 --> 02:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
and whether we trust that bill they'll
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
manage this process to do this process
 
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
or whether we think the legislative Au
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
put that in I'm not a fan of absolutes
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
personally you know when you take out
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
that word appreciable it becomes an
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
absolute statement which I think means
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
we have absolute LW um going forward um
 
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
and and the appreciable um gives gives
 
02:08:28.109 --> 02:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
the wiggle room that that will allow
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
fishing game to properly manage these
 
02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
this this aot process that they've been
 
02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:35.079 align:start position:0%
thrust into by rule for the and the
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
court order so um that's my take on I'm
 
02:08:40.109 --> 02:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
going to support the bill as it's
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
written I think that that I trust
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
fishing game to and the wildlife group
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
to properly Define only thing I don't
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
like about this bill is a chicken
 
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
problem we have we can't create the rule
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
until we pass the law can't create the
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
law until we pass the rule what do we do
 
02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:56.599 align:start position:0%
right and so I'm going to error on the
 
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
side of trust and Trust fishing game and
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
say that I I I I I having been involved
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
in the ja like I said for the last three
 
02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
terms I trust their process they take
 
02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
significant input from public um they
 
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
adjust their rules based on public input
 
02:09:12.549 --> 02:09:12.559 align:start position:0%
and I think that they can better Define
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
what appreciably jeopardized means that
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
weend in
 
02:09:19.950 --> 02:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
our so that
 
02:09:21.549 --> 02:09:21.559 align:start position:0%
so that being said what I think we're
 
02:09:23.229 --> 02:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
going to do is I'm going to take um
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're GNA go into recess for 20 minutes
 
02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
we'll come back at
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
11:30 um and we'll allow for some brief
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
caues so I'm gonna ask stop the the
 
02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
meeting and we'll ask the Republicans to
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
stay in the room um we step out for 10
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we'll step out of the
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
room do the room for 10 minutes um and
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
allow you to just have a conversation we
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
come back to 11:30 to decide what we
 
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
want to do whether want time to go get
 
02:09:54.270 --> 02:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment or not and then we
 
02:09:57.629 --> 02:09:57.639 align:start position:0%
de sound reasonable to everybody yes
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
great so we'll be in recess for um 20

02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
wow well after they adjusted the
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
microphones of the sound it was okay
 
02:30:07.389 --> 02:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and then it dropped back down some
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:39.870 --> 02:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
I sent a text to Katherine I don't know
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
if she got it so did
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:06.510 --> 02:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%

yellow can you hear stuff from L pretty
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
clear I can you're you're actually I
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
have to turn my audio down when you talk
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
because you're loud and everybody else
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
is low and I have to turn my audio up so
 
02:31:22.510 --> 02:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
I agree with you that it's a little low
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the room but you're probably having
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
more of a issue with it than me he's the
 
02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
death man shouting
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah more issue than I is the correct
 
02:31:36.030 --> 02:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
Engish I think
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
there thank you I I I failed to correct
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:31:55.389 align:start position:0%

um great uh talking about this afternoon
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
so we have two provisions and I meant to
 
02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
pull up C Bill 46 because I could
 
02:36:02.910 --> 02:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
remember the second provision we had um
 
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
so at one o'clock over in rrmg they have
 
02:36:07.469 --> 02:36:07.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
146 um Senate Bill 146 is omnus Bill
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
coming out of the Senate um that bill
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
has one provision that belongs
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
environment n two Provisions that belong
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
to fish of gain and two Provisions that
 
02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
belong actually to
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
rrd um and so what we're going to do is
 
02:36:26.429 --> 02:36:26.439 align:start position:0%
myself representative Spain
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Reed are going to go over
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
into the rrd room the committee chair
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
there is going to turn the meeting over
 
02:36:35.790 --> 02:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
to me when we talk about those two um uh
 
02:36:37.469 --> 02:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
issues those two items number three and
 
02:36:40.030 --> 02:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
number five um in the committee I'll
 
02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
manage the committee meeting while we
 
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
while that goes on we're going to we're
 
02:36:46.269 --> 02:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
going to hopefully change this into a
 
02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
zoom so you'll zoom into the meeting as
 
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
as a participant in the meeting um and
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
be able to ask questions when we get
 
02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
there so uh when we're done with that
 
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on those two Provisions um we
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
will uh come back to this room and
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
reopen our meeting and that work session
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
we'll take a vote on those two
 
02:37:08.269 --> 02:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
Provisions the straw pole vote it's
 
02:37:10.349 --> 02:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
non-binding to anybody but it's
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
basically our recommendation our R&amp;D on
 
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
those two Provisions do we think you
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
should keep it and pass it do you think
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
you should put it out of the bill
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
because it needs pull it out of the bill
 
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
because it needs more work um and then
 
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
r&amp; will make their the end ours is just
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
a recommendation has no binding effect
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
on them at all chess gives them a
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the fishing game
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
committee what we think of those two
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
positions if we think it needs more work
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
um they may choose to just strike it and
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
have somebody resit a bill next year um
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
we like the idea but we just think that
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
the bill is not ready for time for that
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
section um they can they'll put an
 
02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
amendment in strike it or they'll leave
 
02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
it into
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:50.309 align:start position:0%
it into

02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:52.680 align:start position:0%

order because you can't do an emergency
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
order unless you have a state of
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
emergency and yet I think the idea was
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
to allow the governor to act quickly on
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
something using executive order powers
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
and then later follow up with statute if
 
05:00:56.350 --> 05:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
we need to but because of the timing of
 
05:00:56.360 --> 05:00:58.110 align:start position:0%
we need to but because of the timing of
that

05:00:58.110 --> 05:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
process Sor no that process is already
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
Serv so 141c does have some sections in
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
there relative to human diseases but it
 
05:01:18.390 --> 05:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't stop the importation
 
05:01:22.030 --> 05:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
537 35 something under the
 
05:01:26.948 --> 05:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
DHS they can you know they can
 
05:01:30.910 --> 05:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
createorder right you know for emergency
 
05:01:32.110 --> 05:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
right they create a declaration of
 
05:01:33.390 --> 05:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
not a governorate emergency but this the
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
language in the bills particular talks
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
about the governor and emergency and ex
 
05:01:41.548 --> 05:01:41.558 align:start position:0%
it says emergency order but I think it
 
05:01:43.628 --> 05:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
should say executive order and it just
 
05:01:44.910 --> 05:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
allows the governor to write an
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
executive order saying you can't bring
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
in xyc fish because of this known
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic right and that stop the
 
05:01:53.788 --> 05:01:53.798 align:start position:0%
importation of that animal into the
 
05:01:56.830 --> 05:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
state so on section three that was only
 
05:01:58.830 --> 05:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
change I have that I would like to see
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
really seems to me this ought to be an
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
agriculture issue inad fish I made that
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
comment when I was in there yeah it's
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
one of those weird it's animals right so
 
05:02:11.948 --> 05:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
you you wild life and then you got
 
05:02:14.190 --> 05:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
domesticated animals and how you manage
 
05:02:16.948 --> 05:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
the to I I really want to know who's
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
selling monkeys and rats for and bats
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
for food exactly it does say
 
05:02:26.190 --> 05:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
specifically consp for
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
consumption I see like mention
 
05:02:32.190 --> 05:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
esgo I can see somebody selling that
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
live it's the best way to get it is
 
05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
fresh or um you know freshwater crawfish
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we do have in New Hampshire might
 
05:02:39.920 --> 05:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
that we do have in New Hampshire might
be

05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:02:46.830 --> 05:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
CAU don't C but he said
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
cover and did it specify food for human
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
consumption it says for human
 
05:02:52.680 --> 05:02:56.948 align:start position:0%
consumption it says for human
consumption

05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.150 --> 05:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
okay I don't
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
think I believe that the sale of wild
 
05:03:05.548 --> 05:03:05.558 align:start position:0%
animals is prohibited in New Hampshire
 
05:03:07.350 --> 05:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
you can't go out and catch rainbow trout
 
05:03:10.390 --> 05:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
and sell you you can't go and sell your
 
05:03:13.270 --> 05:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
deer no you can't sell your deer there's
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
a difference between an animal you've
 
05:03:18.190 --> 05:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
tagged like a deer or a bear or if
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
you're a restaurant I believe you can go
 
05:03:22.030 --> 05:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
out and catch fresh rainbow truck in
 
05:03:25.390 --> 05:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
your restaurant Old really yeah so okay
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
but you cannot go out Sho deer and then
 
05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
serve that deer in your restaurant and
 
05:03:30.548 --> 05:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
sell it you have to have a give it away
 
05:03:32.110 --> 05:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
you have to have a tag for the for the
 
05:03:34.548 --> 05:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
deer so it's different if it's if it's
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
tagged got it's controlled tagged animal
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
moose deer
 
05:03:44.788 --> 05:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
turkey so um I forget now represent
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
Love's comment about well you know's
 
05:03:56.070 --> 05:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
eating rats and monkeys right now it's
 
05:03:58.548 --> 05:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
my understanding that this is
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
also maybe a preventative bill for
 
05:04:03.310 --> 05:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
something that might
 
05:04:05.390 --> 05:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
down the road future I definitely think
 
05:04:08.190 --> 05:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
this a future looking not What's happen
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
that you know knows what people
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
in 20 to 30 years who would have thought
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
P what what Peng where the pic
 
05:04:29.280 --> 05:04:31.548 align:start position:0%
P what what Peng where the pic
came

05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
came
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
came
p

05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
p
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
asan anybody else on section three of
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
any changes think we should recommend or
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
not recommend and are we okay with the
 
05:04:42.830 --> 05:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill as it goes we STI a straw Point
 
05:04:44.510 --> 05:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
straw poll all those in favor of the
 
05:04:45.868 --> 05:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
bill with the one recommendation of
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
changing it from emergency to Executive
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
just signify by raising your
 
05:04:54.990 --> 05:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
hand there anybody
 
05:04:57.230 --> 05:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
oppose I don't see anyos so the
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation on section three to the
 
05:05:02.948 --> 05:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
R&amp;D Comm L where you need to type um is
 
05:05:05.548 --> 05:05:05.558 align:start position:0%
to recommend passage with one language
 
05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
change and that is the replacement of
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
executive three part just part three
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
we'll do them each separately and we'll
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
make recommendations on each part um so
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
having uh taking a straw poll and
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
everybody being the affirmative on 18 to
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
zero I'm not sure how many you actually
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
have but something to zero V
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
um with the quum present um we're going
 
05:05:37.590 --> 05:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
to recommend section three go forward
 
05:05:39.788 --> 05:05:39.798 align:start position:0%
with the one language change moving on
 
05:05:42.270 --> 05:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
to section five this is the one that
 
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
deals with derel cleanup fund der
 
05:05:46.990 --> 05:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
fishing equipment and gear cleanup fund
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the creation and the fees associated
 
05:05:53.150 --> 05:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
with that um again I I my only comment
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
is I want to get rid of the language
 
05:05:59.590 --> 05:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
that says um fishing for energy um which
 
05:06:01.548 --> 05:06:01.558 align:start position:0%
I just seems like a foolish line that's
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
in there and it's open for all kinds of
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation um I think the name of
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
the fund should be nothing more than um
 
05:06:10.590 --> 05:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
der yeah should be should be derc
 
05:06:12.868 --> 05:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
fishing gear and Coastal cleanup fun and
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's it there's nice and clean yes so
 
05:06:18.628 --> 05:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
if if we did that I mean he he explained
 
05:06:20.548 --> 05:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
that you put that word in there because
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
there was one
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
specific uh fund that has that name and
 
05:06:27.230 --> 05:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
possibly this money could go into that
 
05:06:29.548 --> 05:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
fund so if we took that name out and
 
05:06:34.310 --> 05:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
just Leed the Leed it Leed it left it um
 
05:06:37.708 --> 05:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
broader derel fishing funds could it
 
05:06:40.270 --> 05:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
still go into that one that is named so
 
05:06:41.830 --> 05:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
because we're not changed down below it
 
05:06:43.708 --> 05:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
talks about what the fund could be used
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
for and and this is where I would go to
 
05:06:48.150 --> 05:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
the fishing there is a fishing for
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
energy um program a I think it's always
 
05:06:52.350 --> 05:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
a bad idea to name a state program after
 
05:06:53.910 --> 05:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
a federal program so then you never no
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
idea which one you're really talking
 
05:06:58.548 --> 05:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
about the programs so it's an oia not
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
oia Nao
 
05:07:01.320 --> 05:07:03.868 align:start position:0%
oia Nao
whatever

05:07:03.868 --> 05:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:07:07.110 --> 05:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
yep um program that deals with they'll
 
05:07:09.470 --> 05:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
put out dumpsters basically allow
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
fishermen to put stuff in a federal
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
funded program at this point that's
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
named fishing so I'd rather not have
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
state fund and our name the same but in
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
the bill itself it says that the monies
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
for this fund shall be uh used and uh
 
05:07:28.230 --> 05:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
used establish shall be used establish
 
05:07:30.670 --> 05:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
and support new and existing programs to
 
05:07:33.270 --> 05:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
retrieve and dispose of der fishing gear
 
05:07:35.310 --> 05:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
to conduct periodic Coastal cleanup
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
programs for the removal of derc fishing
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
gear Marine trash and to support
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
recycling efforts for fishing year other
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
Marine trash so I think under that last
 
05:07:45.390 --> 05:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
section the recycling program which is
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
what this is this is it covers what they
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
want not hav't put the name in the fund
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
which is I think just confusing well and
 
05:07:54.628 --> 05:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
also you said it it says
 
05:07:57.070 --> 05:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
existing programs and so this is a
 
05:08:00.190 --> 05:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
program that is already existing so it
 
05:08:04.230 --> 05:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
could be um by and and and by keeping
 
05:08:07.470 --> 05:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
the name broad then possibly there may
 
05:08:11.948 --> 05:08:11.958 align:start position:0%
be other things that uh would right
 
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
again comment right so again I know that
 
05:08:19.230 --> 05:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
sebr and Hampton Beach have Beach clean
 
05:08:21.708 --> 05:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
right so they could in theory apply for
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
a rant from fishing game now to help
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
offset some of the cost
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
Town those beaches clean up beach
 
05:08:29.948 --> 05:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
cleanups and stuff that goes on same
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
with the great B right so Shore areas in
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
g day that have Beach that have th Stu
 
05:08:37.948 --> 05:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
washing up cleaning and rehabilitating
 
05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
beaches yeah sometimes when you get
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
specific like well this wasn't in the B
 
05:08:43.440 --> 05:08:44.310 align:start position:0%
specific like well this wasn't in the B
this

05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:08:46.510 --> 05:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't okay so that's all I just think
 
05:08:48.670 --> 05:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
that having the two names is confusing I
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
think we strike it makes the bill more
 
05:08:52.510 --> 05:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
clean very Define this is about for
 
05:08:55.230 --> 05:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
cleaning beaches up and collecting their
 
05:08:57.670 --> 05:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
here um when you add the word energy you
 
05:08:59.590 --> 05:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
start getting people go crazy sometimes
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
about energy so um I think just a clear
 
05:09:06.430 --> 05:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
language I just thank you Mr chairman I
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
just want to let all the members know
 
05:09:12.070 --> 05:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
that our town DPW cleans up the beach
 
05:09:15.150 --> 05:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
every time we have the beach storm lot
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
of those equipments and everything comes
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
to our beach and our C up also in order
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
just for everyone's knowledge that the Y
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
Fisher who the land they use thece
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayer donate their land I mean lease
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
that land for
 
05:09:36.910 --> 05:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
$1 so we doing our part funding this you
 
05:09:46.590 --> 05:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
tax just clarify something
 
05:09:54.670 --> 05:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
concept how much of this abandoned
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
tackle do to strong
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
Rel it's depending it's lot so this
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
isn't because guys
 
05:10:05.680 --> 05:10:08.350 align:start position:0%
isn't because guys
just

05:10:08.350 --> 05:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:10:12.030 --> 05:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.670 --> 05:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
right is there anything else in section
 
05:10:16.590 --> 05:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
five other than my recommendation of
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
striking that one language and renaming
 
05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
the fund and striking everywhere in the
 
05:10:22.670 --> 05:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
bill that says the name of that
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
fund that fishing BR represents yeah I
 
05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
still have a problem with the timing
 
05:10:31.470 --> 05:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
issue um just because I think for
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
existing fisherman saying okay we'll
 
05:10:34.948 --> 05:10:34.958 align:start position:0%
give you credit you helped with the
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
clean up last year was great but if
 
05:10:38.590 --> 05:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
you're a new fisherman you come into the
 
05:10:40.350 --> 05:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
program you buy your license there's
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
nothing here that says you can get the
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
discount you didn't participate so the
 
05:10:46.230 --> 05:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
first time fisherman that's joining it I
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
think it's going to end up paying for it
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
even if they want to participate so I
 
05:10:52.030 --> 05:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
would I would love to see them add in
 
05:10:53.830 --> 05:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
this section that's repeated everywhere
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
where it says any person who satis fact
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
really demonstrates to the executive
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
director that he or she is participating
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
in a coastal cleanup program shall not
 
05:11:03.628 --> 05:11:03.638 align:start position:0%
be required to pay the Ser charge I'd
 
05:11:06.590 --> 05:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
like to see it say or shall be offered a
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
credit on the subsequent sub subsequent
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
years fishing
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
license for their participation just so
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
that it says you know you'll get a
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
credit next year for what you did this
 
05:11:22.590 --> 05:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
year I I understand the timing issue is
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
is tricky although call was very Mr
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
serson was very adamant that that would
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
be ironed at through the rules and so
 
05:11:32.830 --> 05:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
forth which we gave them a lot of leway
 
05:11:35.230 --> 05:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
this morning on um
 
05:11:39.310 --> 05:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
but I think what you're saying is
 
05:11:39.320 --> 05:11:40.430 align:start position:0%
but I think what you're saying is
happens

05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
happens
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
automatically so you pay for your
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
license this year you don't get the
 
05:11:46.830 --> 05:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
credit because you're a first time issu
 
05:11:49.110 --> 05:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
then you participate in the program so
 
05:11:51.390 --> 05:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
you get that credit then the second year
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
on your license because you participated
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the program in between the two
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
licenses you're right maybe what I was
 
05:12:00.110 --> 05:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
thinking would have been rebated back to
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
you whatti so that you didn't you get
 
05:12:04.590 --> 05:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
back this year while you're on the
 
05:12:07.230 --> 05:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
license but um that I suppose would be
 
05:12:10.030 --> 05:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
an ongoing repeate exactly forget
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
it any other the cost of these licenses
 
05:12:15.310 --> 05:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
are a limited a limited commercial
 
05:12:17.310 --> 05:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
license is $400 a regular commercial
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
license $600 I'm pretty sure they're not
 
05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:29.470 --> 05:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
into word what if you have so a first
 
05:12:36.270 --> 05:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:37.628 --> 05:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to not pay the
 
05:12:38.990 --> 05:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
first year and then continue going
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
forward on on good faith and if they
 
05:12:43.350 --> 05:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate the first
 
05:12:46.390 --> 05:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
year that would probably clear up the
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
timing it's
 
05:12:52.590 --> 05:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
the but it's the same difference you're
 
05:12:56.788 --> 05:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
either getting your your your discount
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
the first year or you're getting it the
 
05:13:02.110 --> 05:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
second year no he's saying any first
 
05:13:04.510 --> 05:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
time you don't pay it the first year but
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
going forward if you didn't participate
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
that first year you don't get the
 
05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
discount the second year so um you know
 
05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
how we just talked about the fact that
 
05:13:13.628 --> 05:13:13.638 align:start position:0%
you might pay for it the first year but
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you did the clean up then your next
 
05:13:18.430 --> 05:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
year you get it free well this would say
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
now you've got the two years free you
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't pay it the first year if you
 
05:13:22.948 --> 05:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
participate you get the second year free
 
05:13:22.958 --> 05:13:25.708 align:start position:0%
participate you get the second year free
as

05:13:25.708 --> 05:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman um yeah I
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
agree with you about cleaning up the
 
05:13:33.590 --> 05:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
title of the bill because the blurb
 
05:13:35.788 --> 05:13:35.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the uh the part that
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like to excise I think that would
 
05:13:37.760 --> 05:13:38.708 align:start position:0%
you'd like to excise I think that would
be

05:13:38.708 --> 05:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
consistent secondly uh I was just
 
05:13:45.150 --> 05:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
curious I I well Cons considering the
 
05:13:48.070 --> 05:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
point that was just discussed the direct
 
05:13:50.590 --> 05:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
the director has has
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
discretion you know as to when it's
 
05:13:56.350 --> 05:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to be applied yeah you know I
 
05:13:58.030 --> 05:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
think we can trust the guy to use some
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
common sense I hope so but that's you
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
know uh and finally uh what is this
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
about scallop scallop divers so there's
 
05:14:09.868 --> 05:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
an amendment that was put in that we
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
have very few um scallop and urchin
 
05:14:21.230 --> 05:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
feed so I'm not sure but it was a deal
 
05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
that was worked out between fishing game
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
the commercial Fishman and and Senator
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
and everybody seems to be in agreement
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
that because I'm pretty sure you know
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
free driving scal doesn't have much in
 
05:14:36.510 --> 05:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
the way of gear that he doesn't wear and
 
05:14:36.520 --> 05:14:39.190 align:start position:0%
the way of gear that he doesn't wear and
bring

05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
home no I was just going to say that
 
05:14:44.470 --> 05:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
commercial scallop fishing you're
 
05:14:46.590 --> 05:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
dragging the water you're not actually
 
05:14:48.990 --> 05:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
out there trying to Pi them
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
up thank you I just want to make sure
 
05:14:56.350 --> 05:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
that when we say ler life you should
 
05:14:59.310 --> 05:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
always mention that commercial ler life
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's not going to go anywhere
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
people confused you know you know all
 
05:15:06.510 --> 05:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
the general public and they say that our
 
05:15:09.310 --> 05:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
Lobster I mean the license is going up
 
05:15:12.190 --> 05:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
when legat went up on lober license
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
should say commercial lober license and
 
05:15:18.070 --> 05:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
also just one
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
second also uh when a commercial
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
fisherman new fisherman applies for a

what is it called all right so rain
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
is on remote that has a question they'd
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
like to add
 
05:16:30.480 --> 05:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
like to add
processing

05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
processing
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add to representative
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
Spain's question there yeah I can tell
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
you that the supermarket has Lobster
 
05:16:43.230 --> 05:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
license but we can't go lobster right so
 
05:16:46.030 --> 05:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
license be fun all right so so right now
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
the recommendation would be to just to
 
05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
accept the bill as it's written with the
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
name change of the fund to strike that
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh fishing for energy out of the out of
 
05:17:02.708 --> 05:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the so it's just a
 
05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
der um the derel fishing gear and
 
05:17:09.868 --> 05:17:09.878 align:start position:0%

05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
fund does that sound good anybody want
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%

cheat um is we have three bills we
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
retained I'm going to form form three
 
05:17:35.788 --> 05:17:35.798 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um the to hear those three
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
