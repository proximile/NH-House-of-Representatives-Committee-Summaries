multiple drafts and things going on

behind the scenes and I actually had a
 
00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
discussion with one of the uh attorneys
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
that was involved with the Supreme Court
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
case that actually brought this on I had
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
a discussion yesterday so we we've got a
 
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
ways to go on that one the other one
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we will
 
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
be uh waiting on is
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
1124 that's a very extensive bill that
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor uh has been working
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
with uh n Grace with the nhma to get it
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
into a final disposition one that is uh
 
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
um 100% correct and complete so those
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
two we will not be doing today besides
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
proceed on so with that we'll open up
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
the executive committee hearing on hb1
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
1242 relative to the establishment of
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
countywide communications
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
District uh I see that represented
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
um do I have a motion on that Mr chair
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion if I may go
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
ahead uh I'd like to move ought to pass
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1242 and with your
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
permission to speak to the motion if
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's seconded do we have a second
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative stavis second it uh go
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman um uh HB
 
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
1242 which is about establishing
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
communication districts in counties uh
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
to the best of my research into the RSA
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
and as we uh learned in the public
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
hearing uh the RSA 53 oh I forgot the
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
number uh
 
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 align:start position:0%
53g um allows for municipalities to
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
create communication districts this bill
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
will extend that to uh counties uh that
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
will be able to create communication
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
District it's enabling legislation
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
obviously if uh if County then are
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
working uh similarly to
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh and have uh larger uh
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
buying groups uh there's an economy of
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
scale which then can hopefully uh enter
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
into contracts which benefit all the
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
residents of the County uh and extend
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
this kind of service uh which is much
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
needed uh which is needed all over the
 
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
place uh to the residents at hopefully
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
what would be a more affordable cost I
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
would hope that the committee would
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
agree with ought to pass motion and
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's all I have Mr chair men chairman
 
00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
you're not a chair you're a chairman
 
00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:07.670 align:start position:0%
you're not a chair you're a chairman
chairman

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
whatever do we have any further comments
 
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.710 align:start position:0%
whatever do we have any further comments
representative

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
voting against the recommendation of a
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
to pass I feel that this bill is not
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
needed countywide communication
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
districts can already be established
 
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.029 align:start position:0%
districts can already be established
under

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
RSA and for example Carol County has um
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
established a communication District um
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
under in back in
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
2023 I I I don't like the idea that this
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
is um being approached from the the
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
inverse Direction Where municipalities
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
would have to opt out I would prefer
 
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
that the legislation stays um the
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
statute stays as it as it currently is
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so I'd just like to um note
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
that straford County feels that this is
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
necessary and um if the
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
existing uh method of all municipalities
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
coming together to form a countywide one
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
were sufficient for them they wouldn't
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
have requested this but they did so I
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
think um that shows that is in fact
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
needed and I just like to thank the
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh Heath Howard for his
 
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
work on this um important issue and I'll
 
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
PR thank you Mr Speaker I will also be
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of this bill because I
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
think it's long overdue especially in
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
the rural uh communities of our state
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
and counties that are thly lacking in
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
communication um um
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure thank
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
comments seeing thatone I'll make a
 
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
couple um I I will Echo what chairman
 
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.870 align:start position:0%
couple um I I will Echo what chairman
power

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
said the uh biggest reason I I I can't
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
vote for this is it allows a single
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
County to basically declare their County
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
of communications District uh
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher brought up the
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
the uh issue of straford County um for
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
the same reason he thinks it should be
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's the exact reason why it shouldn't
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
be we everybody here is well aware of
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on in straford County um in
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
terms of districts
 
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.230 align:start position:0%
terms of districts
and

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
having right now until the next election
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
having the ability of straford County to
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
declare themselves a communication
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
District without any
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
checks and balances is just not
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
acceptable to me as uh chairman power
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
said also coming at it from the wrong
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
direction where you have to opt out
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
rather than opt in it's just not the way
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
to go so I will also be voting against
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
it further

Hampshire they they help
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
to um Safeguard and protect and preserve
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
valuable Assets in the states that in
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
the state that um
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have no other way
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
of protecting as a as a
 
00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
of protecting as a as a
community

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
um and our bodies of water are
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
particularly vulnerable to uh harm right
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
now from over fertilization and other
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
activities um I know where I live in
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
Lebanon we Face many many tens of
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of remediation every
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
year and cyanobacteria blooms and our
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
only source of drinking water which is
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
Lake Mascoma which spans
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities so to have uh the ability
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
to have a village District to protect a
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
body of water that is so vital to so
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
many people roughly 14,000 people um
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
would be a great asset to the state and
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
so I fully support this the passage of
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you further
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
supporting the motion of a to pass on
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
1250 um I would agree with my colleague
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
in her comments and I would also add
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
that there are numerous studies economic
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
studies that show that as water quality
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
decreases on a body that the property
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
owners AB buding that body of water
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
their their property values will in fact
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
decrease so it's in the interest of
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
people who live who have Shoreline
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
property to work together to prioritize
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
the the health of the body of water and
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
I feel that you know this enabling um
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
legislation is a tool in the toolbox for
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
people to come together um to address
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
the issues um surrounding bodies of
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
water representative Brown uh I will be
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill I recently sat
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
in as a substitute for the environment
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee uh and they've
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
move they're moving forward with a bill
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
to address the concerns in regard to
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
over Fertilization in The Lakes areas so
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why I'm going
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
to be voting against it and there's
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
other complications as far as I'm
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
concerned as well so thank you further
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
comments representative major thank you
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'll be voting in favor of
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
the aop pass motion as I've uh learned
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor in his area and
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
the communities in his area have uh
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
created have created a model which if
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
this bill passes other communities will
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
be able to mirror as a as a best
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
practice for how to implement this to
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
protect their their uh their their water
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
bodies and so not only do I think the
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill is a great idea I'm also confident
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
that we have a model which can be
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
mirrored uh to help all communities in
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
the State uh duplicate this so um I'll
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
be voting in favor thank
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
priest I will thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um I will also be uh supporting
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I think it's long overdue
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I think one thing that is very
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
crucial to all of our existence is water
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
and once that water is polluted um it's
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
gone and it's going to be very costly to
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
bring it back up and this is one tool to
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
to monitor it and to protect it thank
 
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
to monitor it and to protect it thank
you

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
comments represent Elward is your hand
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
another no others I will make uh couple
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
comments um I will also be voting um
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
against this for probably a little bit
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
different reasons um I am a actually a
 
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
property owner on the water in Maine um
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
for during the summer but I I have to
 
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.789 align:start position:0%
for during the summer but I I have to
say

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
particular I see this as particularly
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
um obnoxious uh for par for some from
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
some land owners and I I just want to
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
read from some of the testimony written
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given in first we got
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
to recognize what this
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
allows towns and municipalities to do is
 
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.350 align:start position:0%
allows towns and municipalities to do is
designate

00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
designate
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
specific properties to be part doesn't
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
have to be Waterfront it could be a
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
Mountaintop piece of land that maybe
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
drains into a lake or
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
stream and the problem with that is yes
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
it goes to the voters but you could have
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
51% of the
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
voters Within These
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
districts put their desires
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
over the 49% who vote against
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
it and this is a problem
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
because as I'm reading from one of these
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
testimonies districts for the enactment
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
of rules and
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
regulations uh which would not apply
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the community so you're
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
segregating out particular individuals
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
and this is what really kind of had the
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
hairs on the back of my neck going up
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
those rules and reg ation we would be
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
directed at and there's some other
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
things requiring remedial action only if
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
issues remain voluntarily uncorrected so
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have individuals Within
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
These districts who are going to you're
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to have the ability to require
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
some kind of remedial action on somebody
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
who probably wasn't even in favor at
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
this begin with and this is the really
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
lovely one imposing fines for
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
non-compliance I don't think in these
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
districts should be
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
have given the ability to impose fines
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
and also of course it's going to be a
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
tax taxes involved so the 51% let's just
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
say if it's only 51% who vote for this
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
um those those 51% are going to be
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
forcing the other 49% to pay taxes for
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
these districts that they may not want
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
so for for those reasons and quite a few
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
more um I just don't think this is the
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
way to go I understand the the water
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
quality issues like I say I spend time
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
on a lake in Maine and I get it but I I
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
think this is just one step too far
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative Elbert thank you Mr
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just a comment about your
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
51% imposing their will on 49% we've had
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
numerous votes this year uh
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
where uh bills were passed by a single
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
vote and we see that as an appropriate
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
way to legislate in the state so um
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
while I hear your concern I also say
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is how we work here
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative yella thank you uh Mr
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
chair um one of my main concerns with
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
this is Jerry mandering because the
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
people putting forward this proposed
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
area can choose the lots that they want
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be included and don't want to be
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
included and so you can easily
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
pull the residents and see if they're in
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
favor of it and see if they're not and
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
be able to find the ones that are and
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
include them and make sure to include
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
not enough of those people that oppose
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
it and so they can gerrymander this
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
thing however they like and there's no
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
rules against that and so I say that if
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
you're opposed to Jerry mandering then
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
you should be opposed to this Bill thank
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
appointed um by the select board this
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
bill is enabling legislation which
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
allows Conservation Commission members
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
to be elected by the
 
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.789 align:start position:0%
to be elected by the
voters

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
um it's similar to um current enabling
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
statute that allows voters to be able to
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
elect members of the planning board in
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board of adjustment and it's
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
notable that if this enabling
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
legislation were to be adopted by a a
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
town that they may also resend this if
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
they find that they don't like it or
 
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's not working out for them and the
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
once rescinded that the they could go
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
back to having the Selectmen appoint the
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
members and the last thing that I would
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
say is that conservation
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
commissions uh are playing an
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
increasingly important role in um towns
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
to protect and preserve our natural
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
resources and um watersheds and this
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
bill provides towns with the option to
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
be able to elect members to the
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission and I would ask
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
that the committee support this bill as
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
amended thank
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
you are there any other represent
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
Holland so so when this came forward to
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
us the the um the big issue was that
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
there was a volunteer or someone who
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
applied for the Conservation Commission
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
he was a volunteer he had on paper at
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
least really great
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
credentials and uh I mean the
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission is a you don't
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
even get a hundred bucks it's a it's a
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer uh position and it's also kind
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
of an entryway for a lot of people that
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
want to get into town government um it
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
lets you get involved it's really great
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
to work on your conservation lands but
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
this person felt like because of his
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
views the governing body would not kind
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
of black balled him would not allow him
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
to be uh be on the Conservation
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
Commission and I and so I understand why
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
he would want or why the ability to
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
elect officials would come up the thing
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
is I just don't think it would work so
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
in essence when the community said if
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
you have I've never actually seen
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
somebody apply for a voluntary
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
commission uh or Committee in town and
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
not be be uh brought on board it's a
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer position so I think when your
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
community that has this happened this
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
speaks to a deeper problem that you're
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
having occurring there's clearly a rift
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
occurring between your governing body
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
and your community and so while you the
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
community could say yes we want to have
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
our Conservation Commission people
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
elected and put them on but really what
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
you probably are looking at is you want
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
to change your governing body at the
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
election you would say you know what the
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
governing body is no longer
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
representative of our community they're
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
not allowing good people to come onto
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
our boards and so we don't think they're
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
best serving our community and so
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
therefore we're going to change who
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
represents us I just think if you if you
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
try to do an endr run around your
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
governing body and elect your um
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission and have them
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
sitting with your governing body that
 
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't want them it just won't work and
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
so I think the real recourse is really
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
to change your governing body and so I I
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
I just don't think this would work so
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's my two cents
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
so I I I will be supporting this
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislation because I I've seen in my
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
own town where people volunteered for
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
similar boards and we shot down just for
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
personal reasons because of the board
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
and and we we all got elected to office
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
and people should have the opportunity
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
if they're getting shut down because
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
their hair is blue or or for whatever
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
reason it it is that they're getting
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
shut down I mean there's millions of
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
a a uh I don't know what the word I'm
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
looking for is yeah so I I think this in
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
would put fairness back in the
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate and I think
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
we should allow for elections this
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
country is founded on
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
elections thank you represent kahill
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
represent stavis thank you Mr chair I I
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
cannot support this bill I did support
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment because I think it makes
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill a better Bill uh but
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
I can't support the bill because for a
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
number of reasons having been on this
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
commit me for six years now I have seen
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
so many of this similar kind of Bill
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
come before us where an
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
individual it's not working for him or
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
her and so they seek this committee to
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
to pass legislation that will make it
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
work for him or her and that's not what
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
we do here um we are about the
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the counties and not
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
about individuals that may be having
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
issues with the
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh I also feel that it's
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
not good policy to have members of a
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
body that is advisory only in elected
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
positions um it it kind of warps the
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
balance of power and sets up unrealistic
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
expectations for the people who are in
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
those positions that are advisory only
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
um that the PE people who elect them may
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
think that they should have more power
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
than they do but in point of fact they
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
don't and so I think it's not fair to
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
them and I don't think it's fair to the
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
people who would elect them if this bill
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
were to become law and if it were
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
adopted by a municipality thank you Mr
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
chair for the comments representative
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so uh I'd agree with
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
representative sais about being
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
skeptical about um the particular
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
motivating case for this
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
legislation but uh personally I think we
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
need to look Beyond just that one case
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
and towards the broader principles
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
involved of democracy and um you know I
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
think that the more positions that can
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
be elected positions rather than
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
appointed positions uh the better like
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's something I've
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
um you know that that that's something
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
that I've programmed to social media
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
about to just constantly come up with
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
new ideas for positions that should be
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
elected rather than appointed um so yeah
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
just based on the principle of uh
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
supporting democracy I'm going to
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
belill representative
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
major thank you Mr chairman um uh as
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
with my friend from Lebanon I I
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
supported the amendment because I think
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
it does make the bill better but I
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
cannot support the bill conservation
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
commissions um have a very specific role
 
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
to be stewards of the land they are part
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
of I mean they have that bias they have
 
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.670 align:start position:0%
of I mean they have that bias they have
that

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh that shouldn't be uh
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't fall to uh having to be
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
elected they need people to and I and I
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
understand what happened in that
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
Community was probably wrong but the the
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
statute for conservation commissions has
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
been in existence since before I was
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
born and I'm and I'm old and
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
so and
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh and this is the this is the first
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
time you know I'm hearing about this uh
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
I I I work very very closely with the
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission in my town as a
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
member of the select board and the and
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
ax officio of the planning board we work
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
very very closely together they have an
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
enormous responsibility uh and an
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
enormous task which I think is very
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
specific uh and and requires a skill set
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
and I would hope in that Community uh
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
that this problem could be rectified but
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard of this problem in any
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
other community I I recommend uh I
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
recommend that we uh reject the OTP uh
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
and and then go to itl on the bill thank
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman I will also be
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
opposing this for the reasons that have
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
been stated by uh representative stavis
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
and other members of this committee um I
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
have worked with numerous conservation
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
commissions and I feel very strongly
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
that our environment in New Hampshire is
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
very important and the conservation
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions as has been
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
noted are advisory and they seek out
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
people who have a dear deep interest and
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
love for the conservation areas our
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
forests our Weds and you don't find that
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
when you politicize this position so I
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
will be uh voting against this thank
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
you represent power thank you Mr
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I am deeply disappointed that
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
people on this committee are making this
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
about one particular case that is not
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
the point and I find that very
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
disappointing um I would also like to
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
point out that any position that that is
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
either appointed or elected
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
it it's volunteer it's not a requirement
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
that anybody runs for any office or
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers to be appointed to any
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
position it's all
 
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.190 align:start position:0%
position it's all
volunteer

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I would say is
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
we also have a bill House Bill 1124 that
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
that speaks to concerns with regards to
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
the concentration of power um by a
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
select board
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
and again I will repeat that this is
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it's not a mandate
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
if a if a municipal a town wants to
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
adopt this they can I I I I feel that
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
people are missing the point in
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
that instead of having a a select few a
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
handful of Selectmen
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
appointing people to a Conservation
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
Commission why not let the voters choose
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
who they want
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
and you know additionally this whole
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
notion that you're going to get better
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
um people appointed to the board if it's
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
if it's appointed versus elected well
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
again you know if you're not
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
interested or passionate or you know
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
about conservation you you're either way
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's appointed or elected you're
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
not going to raise your hand
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
so that that's my followup to the
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
comments thank you Mr chairman
 
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.309 align:start position:0%
comments thank you Mr chairman
representative

00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
Elward so I can attest to a
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
town that engages in
 
00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:38.710 align:start position:0%
town that engages in
nepotism

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
nepotism
 
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.710 align:start position:0%
nepotism
favoritism

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
favoritism
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
cronyism and a lot of other
 
00:39:44.359 --> 00:39:46.309 align:start position:0%
cronyism and a lot of other
isms

00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
isms
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
so they will arbitrarily form
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
committees they won't solicit for um
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
and this is a huge problem in this town
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
so it does exist I hear it from lots of
 
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.870 align:start position:0%
so it does exist I hear it from lots of
other

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
electing these
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
individuals by the voters is going to be
 
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.790 align:start position:0%
individuals by the voters is going to be
more

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
lales thank you Mr chairman um as we
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
have progressed I I find myself um
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
agreeing with all my
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues and it's it's uh uh somewhat
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
uh um disconcerting when I agree with
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
everybody when everybody's on different
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
sides of the fence I find myself
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
straddling that fence but as we go
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
forward here in New Hampshire we're a a
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
state with many small towns
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
and power within a community can be
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
concentrated in one group of people and
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
some of those people could be related or
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
whatever uh so in my mind I I agree with
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
my colleague representative Gallagher
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
that electing members of the
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission seems to me a a
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
much fairer way of getting input into
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
this increasingly important commission I
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
think that the thing that that uh puts
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
me on the side of this bill is the fact
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
that it is enabling so a town can get
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
into it or they can back
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
out uh they can stick their toes in the
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
water whatever so I will be uh I will be
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the OTP thank you
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um so this is a reason why we
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
have these discussions so I agree with
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
um representative lalis I came in with a
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
different thought but you have changed
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
my mind so I'll be supporting this
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
represent kill thank you for letting me
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
speak again Mr chair I I would like to
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
Echo our good colleague over here is
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
that I agree with a lot of the points
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
you guys have made some really really
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
good points but this literally is just
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
as the board this board in particular is
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board this is an enabling
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and we do have NEP
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
problems in this state I mean my town is
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
um notorious for this sort of thing um
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
and and I'd like to see that change I'd
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
like to see more people participate and
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
get an opportunity to use their voice um
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
so I while you guys have all made really
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
great points I do think that we should
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:19.829 align:start position:0%
support this
legislation

00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair um I walked into
 
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
this room this morning on the fence not
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
really knowing
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
which way I should go on it listening to
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
the debate um I'm tending to agree with
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative lales and others who are
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to support the bill I guess my
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
bottom line is I view this as a bill
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
that can do no harm because it is
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
enabling a town can vote to elect their
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission a town can vote
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
to unelect and go back to appointed so I
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
think giving various towns which may
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
have problems with concentration of
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
power the ability to change that is a
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
good idea thank
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair well they say
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
that people who can't change their minds
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
never change
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
anything and um I have been convinced by
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
the arguments of my colleagues that this
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation it can do no
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
harm it could do some good in certain
 
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
harm it could do some good in certain
towns

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:39.930 align:start position:0%

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.150 align:start position:0%

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
um I remain concerned about the original
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
impetus for the bill but that doesn't
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that it's a bad idea um
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
so I will be supporting this legislation
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.630 align:start position:0%

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
okay we go ahead and open up the
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
executive session HB 1359 relative to
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
the appeals of certain zoning Decisions
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
by Butters I understand representative
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
power you have an amendment thank you Mr
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to offer to this
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
section one and section two of the bill
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
as introduced and that provision is to
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
allow for a property owner within the M
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
municipality to be able to appeal and
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why I feel that this is
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
important is
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
um while I while I do agree that the
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
statute as it is right now is is very
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
broad um I feel that the bill is
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
introduced is too narrow and while a a a
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
property owner within the municipality
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
might not be in a butter per the
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
definition of a butter contained within
 
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.789 align:start position:0%
definition of a butter contained within
this

00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
bill there are instances where um a
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
property owner can be affected by a a
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
example with when you have the ma
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
majority of our um houses in the state
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are on private Wells so
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
an example would be where you would have
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
within a town a development that goes in
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
and you have an established neighborhood
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
and that those neighborhoods have that
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
the people in that neighborhood have
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
private Wells and they're all drawing
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
off of an aquafer that's shared now
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
while certain homes might not be Butters
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
by a by definition they are they would
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
be affected by say a street going in
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
with you know 15 20 what whatever our
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
house is and I had contacted the dees
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
with regards to um well permitting and
 
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and their
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
involvement is only to the degree with
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
regards to the sighting of
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
wells and the thing to consider is that
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
when um you know Wells are tested that
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
is in
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
isolation it's very different when all
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
the houses in uh development be come
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
online and they're all drawing water for
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
different uses through throughout
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the day so I I feel very
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
strongly that um like I said the bill is
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
introduced goes uh you know is too
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive and this is a a happy medium
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
to open up a bit more to address any
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
concerns um by Property Owners within
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
the municipality and I would also add
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
that with with regard to any development
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
that goes on it can in fact affect the
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
municipal Services the schools traffic
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and that does affect people in the
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
town in the area who may not be a
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
Butters thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
chairman repres representative Brown
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
could you turn off your mic
 
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.190 align:start position:0%
could you turn off your mic
representative

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Mr
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I am so happy to see this and I
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
think it should run across all boards
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
making um quasi
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
judicial decisions a prime
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
example uh would be an excavation
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
project obviously with the negative
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
noise impacts and other typ types of
 
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
impacts you you you could be thousands
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
of feet away and not in a
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
butter and I believe that this is vital
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
in fact I had worked
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
on something similar because of the
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
problem of um the excavation situation
 
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
so bravo bravo thank you for the
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
comments representative uh uh
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
praise thank you Mr uh uh Mr chairman um
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
I will be opposing this uh Amendment
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
because I think it's counterproductive
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
to the intent of the bill and the bill
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
was to really limit the property owners
 
00:53:17.549 --> 00:53:17.559 align:start position:0%
that are going to be affected by this
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
zoning decision so this opens it up to
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
anyone in the
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
town um to come up with a Friv
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
objection that could be made to stop a
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
project and it has happened and will
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
continue to happen with this amendment
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um I have I think that
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
this is just uh this amendment or the
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
the addition of any property owner in
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
the municipality is just um even as
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
stated by the people in support of it is
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
for uh nimbyism that does not want that
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
is not directly
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh or is not impacted the same way that
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh a butter would be and these anyone
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
that is concerned and impacted has the
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
right already to go to the municipality
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
or to go to the hearing and be heard
 
00:54:26.789 --> 00:54:26.799 align:start position:0%
they have a right to that already in the
 
00:54:26.799 --> 00:54:27.710 align:start position:0%
they have a right to that already in the
current

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
law um and this is just about appealing
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
and this does not just limit to the
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
people that are actually affected in the
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
in the current law it says a person
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
directly affected this is saying no no
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're scrapping that we're going to do
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
even people that aren't
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
affected congratulations now you can
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
appeal also I think that's actually take
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
trying to take one step forward and two
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
steps back and so so for that reason I
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
think that this is uh should not be
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
adopted thank you representative
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um I'd like to Echo uh the
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
comments by Representatives PRI and
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
Yokel um I think it's important to
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
consider this legislation in the context
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
of our larger um housing crisis in the
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
state where uh one of the main drivers
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
of that is um nimbyism and Neighbors
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
being able to say no to developments
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
when we really do need to be doing
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
developments um so yeah I I think this
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
um amendment is kind of going in the
 
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
opposite direction of the um that the
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill was originally supposed to do um so
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
I'll be opposing
 
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
it anybody who hasn't spoken yet I'll
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
get to one second representative Elward
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to make a comment kind of
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
based on what um
 
00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:59.270 align:start position:0%
based on what um
representative

00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
yiset and as written technically this
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
actually is almost the amendment's
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
almost worse than the original and
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
here's the
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
reason um looking at it it opens it up
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
to any individual in the municipality
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
now I when I introduced this bill
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
originally I said you know I live on the
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
Southeast side of
 
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
barington on the other side of North
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
west side of barington close to 10 miles
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
away this would give that
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
individual for no reason and as
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
representative yella pointed out it
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
originally said any person aggrieved now
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
we that that applied to anybody that
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
could be anybody worldwide and the whole
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
intent of this was to wrap it in now if
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
the intent here was any AG grieved
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
property owner in the municipality that
 
00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:57.069 align:start position:0%
property owner in the municipality that
might

00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
be okay I still would not support it but
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
this opens it up to any property owner
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the municipality without a reason so
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
for that for that reason I willon I
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
can't support um the amendment uh
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Elward go ahead thank you
 
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.870 align:start position:0%
representative Elward go ahead thank you
Mr

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
chairman making an appeal to the Zoning
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment is is not not like attending
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and standing up and
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
voicing your
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
opinion you have to
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
prepare your reasoning based on fact and
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
law it usually takes like an
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
attorney to do a successful
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
appeal so this is not something that I
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
think would be
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
by in a frivolous way
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
now I know of a town
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
currently where the planning board chair
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually attempted to insert the
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
planning board as a
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
party to the subdivision applicants
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
appeal to the
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
zba based on any person agree
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
grieved it is currently the case has
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
currently um going before the land use
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
board uh on
 
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.789 align:start position:0%
board uh on
appeal

00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:39.799 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
that this is necessary to help protect
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
the interest of anybody in the
 
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
municipality and I support this
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
repr major thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
will not be supporting the amendment I I
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely support your bill and um for
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that I've heard here and
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
I'm and I'm thinking the only thing I
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
will add is one of the submitted
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
questions for our candidate tonight asks
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh candidates for the planning board who
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
has the largest voice uh or who who
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
should be who should have the voice in
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
an application is it the abutter the
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
applicant the zoning administrator uh
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
the board who should have this voice and
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
we're all looking for that equality the
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
answer is we're all looking to have an
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
equal voice I'm not sure that I would
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
want as you say Mr chairman somebody who
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
is not even close to this property who
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
may not be affected in any way shape or
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
form to have that equal voice in this
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
conversation I think it should be as it
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
was originally drafted the abutter as
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
defined in statute so I cannot support
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment but we'll be supporting
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you representative kahill
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for uh
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
letting me address the board um so I'm
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
where a project was put in that was
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
detrimental not just to to my property
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
but everyone down river for me um where
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
I could not um voice my opinion because
 
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
I was not an a butter by about 15
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
ft and there was a a a project in
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
Raymond that was on a piece of land that
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
is a brown field where they they took
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
out some dams and flowed potentially
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
chemical poisoned water across my
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
property into a river that affects 17
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities down river for me but
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
because there was a piece of land in
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
between me that's about 15 ft long and
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
them I wasn't even giving in a butter
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
notice you know so I think there are
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
some problems where I'm I'm not 10 miles
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
away I'm 15 ft away and I didn't have a
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
voice in in that um project and and not
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
only that that when they did do the
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
blasting for that project they broke all
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
the windows in my
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
house so there are there are potential
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
problems where you could be 10 miles
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
away on the same ledge as a project
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
going on and it can do damage to your
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
foundation and your a house and I've
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
firsthand representative
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair this is really
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
a fascinating conversation I want to
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
thank my colleagues for for really
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
delving into this issue I I always say
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the housing crisis that afflicts
 
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.390 align:start position:0%
that the housing crisis that afflicts
New

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an 850 piece jigsaw puzzle
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
and that every time we consider a piece
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
of legislation we are looking at tiny
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
tiny little piece of a larger picture
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that this
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill in its original form as it came to
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
us as
 
01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:10.039 align:start position:0%
introduced solves one piece of that 850
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
piece jigsaw puzzle it doesn't work for
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
everyone but it really
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
helps the cause for people who want to
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
build housing for
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
example um for the reasons that my
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
colleague representative award stated so
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
correctly an appeal to a land use board
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
is not to be taken lightly it's
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
something that is expensive timec
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
consuming way more expensive than anyone
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
ever expected it to be and it kills
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
projects in their infancies
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
and it's simply in my view not fair that
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
these projects should be appealed to
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
death before they can even get a public
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
hearing and so I can't support the
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
amendment but I do support the
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill thank
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman I come
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
from the city of nashwa which I just
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
checked to make sure I had the numbers
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
right it includes 31.7 square miles it's
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
a big city uh I live in one end of it
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
not in the middle and
 
01:03:26.279 --> 01:03:27.710 align:start position:0%
not in the middle and
given

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
this uh Amendment if I had an objection
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
to something that was happening all the
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
way across town that really had no
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
impact on me it would be okay for me to
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
go and say I don't want it let's stop
 
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
it on the other
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
side as a resident and looking at the
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
original language of any person AG
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
grieved some of you may know that there
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
was a uh petition to put in an asphalt
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
plant in one of the most densely
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
populated areas of the city and while
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
the initial objections and push back
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
came from people within that
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and the plant by the way
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
was going to be half a mile away from an
 
01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:13.150 align:start position:0%
was going to be half a mile away from an
elementary

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
elementary
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
school uh the entire city got involved
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
in opposing it and looking at the
 
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
language of any person AG grieved we
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
still would be able to do that so I see
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
that the change in language is
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and we'll be voting against
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
it thank you represent power did you
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
have your
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chairman um I'd like
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
to point out two things that any person
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
AG grieved in the bill as introduced was
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
struck by the um Prime sponsor in when
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
this bill was filed and the second thing
 
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
that I would like to note is it is my
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that with regards to
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
making an appeal there is a 30-day time
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
period in which that appeal must be
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
filed and then 30 days in which that
 
01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
appeal must be heard locally that 60
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
days I don't see that as a big um time
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
killer for any project so I just wanted
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
to share
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
that representative gagar
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
um so one thing that was mentioned
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
previously that I'd kind of like to push
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
back on um so it says um said that um
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
this open Amendment opens it up to
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
anyone in the community and um i' just
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
like to refer back to the bill language
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
it says a property owner in the
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
municipality and I that I think that's
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
kind of um representative of a bad habit
 
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.150 align:start position:0%
kind of um representative of a bad habit
that

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
um sometimes this committee can get in
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
which is is only thinking of property
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
owners as people when really it's the
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:06:00.599 --> 01:06:02.870 align:start position:0%
people who
aren't

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
um what it it's the people who don't own
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
property who need are generally the ones
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
who need housing um so if I if I were
 
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.309 align:start position:0%
who need housing um so if I if I were
going

01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
to if I wanted to open up the language
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
to more people in the community I would
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
specifically say it should be the
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
non-property owners in the
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
municipality who should
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
um who it should be changed to but um
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
that's not what it says it just says
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
Property Owners so um yeah I I think
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
that's a bad aspect of the amendment and
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
reason to oppose
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
it forther comments representative did
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
you have one representative y Kell yeah
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
I just back with you
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
represent um I did want
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
to I mean I I do kind of agree with
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher that um
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
Property Owners is um it could could be
 
01:07:04.359 --> 01:07:06.589 align:start position:0%
Property Owners is um it could could be
anyone

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh within that area that that is even
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
not a property owner
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
um and so but uh there was a previous
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
discussion about um
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
testimony uh not being not being allowed
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
for people that are can demonst that
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
their land will be directly affected and
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
that's um stated on page two line 16 to
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
17 um that they should have the same
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
rights as a butter in that that
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearing um and I think
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
that that is I I forgot the other other
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh thing that I was going to say so I
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
think representative Hicks
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher could you turn
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
off your mic please thank you thank you
 
01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:58.109 align:start position:0%
off your mic please thank you thank you
yes

01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm thinking about this in property
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
um where my um my school is I'm thinking
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
about water pollution uh thinking about
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
the aquifer where we draw the water um
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
for the school thinking about air
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
pollution potentially and noise
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
pollution and not being in a direct
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
butter um concerns me and I think that I
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate representative power for
 
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
bringing that issue to light I I
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
originally liked the uh
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
initial bill because of nism um but now
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
I don't like either enough to support
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
either uh so I kind of wish that we
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
could make another motion um and fix
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
this in a way that supports everybody's
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a point of personal
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
privilege here and that is I I'm getting
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
the feeling that the amendment may not
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
work I'm getting a feeling that the
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
underlying bill May there will be other
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities for this to be amended
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
when it goes over to the other body I
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
will just leave it at that
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
maybe representative
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
priest uh thank you Mr chairman um I
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
again would just like to emphasize the
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
fact that when you are proposing a
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
development time is money and if and
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
there are people in our communities
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
that will do everything in their power
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
to oppose and to delay a project or to
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
kill a project if it's in competition
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
with it if they don't like it or it's
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
bringing in the wrong kind of people in
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
their Community they'll do everything
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
they can and so that's why I think it's
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
important to kind of focus on who is
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
really being affected and that is
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
defined in the original bill and I think
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
we should just go ahead and and vote
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
down this amendment and and and focus on
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
the the bill itself thank
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
oh see no more hands uh McDonald could
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%

but I do have um concerns that
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative power raised with the
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
represent power thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
will not be supporting the motion of
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
ought to pass there's there's concerns
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
in isues with this bill as written and I
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
agree with um representative Hicks his
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
previous comments from before and I feel
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
that this these issues that I've raised
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
does in fact need to be addressed and
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
this bill as written is
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
insufficient further
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I will ask the
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.239 --> 01:13:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
excuse yes representative lales if I may
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
um we've had a very interesting
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
discussion about this particular Bill
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that there's a lot of
 
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that there's a lot of
good

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps there we could uh rather than
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
passing a bill that we're hoping that
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
eventually will be
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
amended perhaps we could retain it in
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
the committee and do some more work on
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
it so that when we submit the bill to
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
the house that we have something that we
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
can be proud of
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm thinking interim study or
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
that from the Chairman's perspective no
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
first of all we can't do I mean we could
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
do uh interim study but that's basically
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
killing it all together so we don't I'm
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
not going to go with that I think since
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're already the motions have already
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
been made I think we need to take the
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
vote on it if we were to get a vote
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
something like that we also will have
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
the ability on the house floor for
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to debate it I would
 
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
also say that
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
I the previous vote we took on the
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I think if it had been written
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
slightly different it might
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
have maybe had a little more support um
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed that I've made
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
my points on that so I'm not going to
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
say it again but again we do have the
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity there's ability for floor
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
amendments there's ability in the Senate
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
I mean there's all kinds of other ways
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
but I would prefer that we move forward
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%

uh motion to itl the bill is poorly
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
written up up we need a first we have a
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
second representative Kelly second now
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative Brown I'm always too
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
anxious so the bill is poorly written
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
the prime didn't show when we uh uh had
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing on it and the content of the
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill is supposedly rolled into house
 
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.070 align:start position:0%
bill is supposedly rolled into house
bill

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%

representative

01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
Guthrie I just like
 
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
to personal
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
comments uh I always felt that any offic
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
that you could run for you and get
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
elected you you were able to do that and
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
then take that right away that uh you
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
could not serve on any board because you
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to run for it that's
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
offensive to me to begin with and the
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
second question uh comment I have is we
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
had in my town a a fellow who had the
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
time to do both selectman and school
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
committee and I think that's the key I
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
know a lot of was here on uh on the
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee of both the Selman and the
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
State Rep uh that's T kind of time
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
consuming for both jobs but uh those of
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
us who are are doing both feel that we
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
can uh can can do do the both jobs so I
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd make that as as a
 
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
comment I don't think you should uh uh
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
demand that anybody can cannot run for
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
an office and I think these two offices
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's to some advantages if somebody
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
has the time to do both jobs thank you
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you further
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
comments seeing representative Gallagher
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I'd just like to um point out
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
that uh no one showed up at the hearing
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
for it so we had to do basically one of
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
those proforma introductions for it um
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
so um I mean I might be open to the idea
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
if someone had bothered to explain why
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea or is necessary but
 
01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
since they didn't um then yeah I'm just
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%

just a second representative power point
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
point of inquiry Mr chairman so um if
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken representative Hicks
 
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
voted against the motion of itl so why
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
would he be writing the majority report
 
01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.709 align:start position:0%
would he be writing the majority report
for

01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
that I think it doesn't really matter um
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
but if you would like to write it in
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%

01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%

motion see how good I was that time yes
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um having uh recently uh
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
been to a school board meeting in my
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
town of Molen bro um there was a lot of
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh some issues that had
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
come up and during the meeting uh a lot
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
of the attendees had asked what the ABC
 
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
committee had said on it what the CIP
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
committee had said cipc committee and
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
what the uh school board members had
 
01:28:21.109 --> 01:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
voted on and a lot of the people were um
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
encouraged to ask questions as a result
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
of what what the indication of the votes
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
were 4:1 5:1 whatever it was and they
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
asked why some people had voted for and
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
why some people had voted against so my
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
opinion on this is that this allows
 
01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.350 align:start position:0%
opinion on this is that this allows
people

01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
to um to ask questions of their elected
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
officials that they may not otherwise
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
ask and if it wasn't allowed it would
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
deprive these people of that information
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh allowing them to uh to request
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
additional information that's the reason
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
why I uh feel that we should itl this
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you further
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative yela I just
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct a statement that
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
representative Brown just said I think
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
that this this bill does not actually
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
forbid them from putting it on there it
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
just removes the requirement that they
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
put it on there um and so they can
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
choose to or can not choose to and so I
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
think that the entire thrust of this
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill was to make it so that they can't
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
put it on there and so I think the bill
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
just doesn't do what it was intended to
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
do by the sponsor and so um I think that
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
he should go back to the drawing board
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
and and put a bill forward that actually
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
does what he wants it to do before we
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
should even consider passing it so for
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
that reason I'm going to uh uh vote to
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
itl this bill
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill because I think
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
we have elected elected boards advisory
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
boards and I'm going when I'm going into
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
The Ballot Box to vote on a particular
 
01:30:14.189 --> 01:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
item and we all know that we're all very
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
busy and we're all not up to speed with
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on with every warrant it's
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
always great to know how the various
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
boards voted and this would be taking
 
01:30:31.109 --> 01:30:31.119 align:start position:0%
away that
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
you represent kill thank you Mr chair um
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
because we had a lengthy discussion on
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
1302 with nepotism and things that that
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
that can happen in
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
town um and because I have seen on Town
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
election ballots on citizen sponsored
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
warrants where it says not recommended
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
by the select board and because the
 
01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:01.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill did a really good
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
job showing us that in in fact could be
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so I like just like to say
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm not necessarily opposed to um
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
the principle of General principle of
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
the bill um I do think that
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah if the information is also
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
available in other ways then it's not
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
really that necessary to also have it on
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
the ballot but I don't think we have
 
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
really quite ensured that the
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
information is in fact available in
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
other ways yet um for example that live
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
streaming Bill um like I think we should
 
01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
streaming Bill um like I think we should
um

01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
we that's currently an interim study um
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
if we do
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
eventually pass the um live streaming
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
Bill um then yeah I could be convinced
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
to come back and support a future
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
version of this legislation but until
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
that happens I don't think I can and um
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
one one additional point I'd make um is
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
on uh corporate um
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
proxy statements when you own a stock in
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
a company and um can vote on things for
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
their General meaning they also print
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
how their board of directors will vote
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
so it would seem kind of weird to me to
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
prevent our towns from doing something
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
that um corporations can also do um so
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that that just seems kind of weird
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
to be giving corporations more power
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
power than governments in that respect
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I have to say
 
01:32:57.119 --> 01:32:59.550 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I have to say
representative

01:32:59.550 --> 01:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman I I know
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
that in the discussion of the board of
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
the bill there was uh the election heing
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
came up and uh I think that was one of
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
the main concerns but I suggest to you
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with El election
 
01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
heing in fact in my town we have a
 
01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.590 align:start position:0%
heing in fact in my town we have a
voters

01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
guide uh and I guess that's ele you know
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
election and we
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
have uh our
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
candidates uh standing out at the at the
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
polls and that's election heing so I
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
would say suggest that uh that I
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be concerned with that word and
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
that I would say that any information
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
voter whatever it is is good information
 
01:33:56.109 --> 01:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
and uh it it goes along with a lot of
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
other things of the if the voter is
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
concerned and and and is involved so my
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that we of course we don't
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
vote uh we vote the itl this bill and
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
don't encourage the uh uh the bill
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
writer to correct it and try to make it
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
so that uh you can't put that
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.109 --> 01:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
bot representative
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chairman um I think it's
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
important for the voters to get as much
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
information as they can from whatever
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
Source in regards to the concern that a
 
01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.990 align:start position:0%
Source in regards to the concern that a
select

01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
select
 
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.830 align:start position:0%
select
board

01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
might recommend against a petitioned
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
warrant article which they have the
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
right to do the voters also have the
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
right to ask the select men or whatever
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
board has made that
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation why they made the
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation and the voters can then
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves whether the
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation for or
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
against is something that they agree
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
with or they don't agree with thank you
 
01:35:19.199 --> 01:35:20.990 align:start position:0%
with or they don't agree with thank you
representative

01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
lales yes in this case I I'm going to
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
rely on my personal experience and my
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
personal experience in our town is that
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
the the town's voters really rely on the
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
budget committee to be an
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
independent uh body that looks at things
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
maybe a little different than the
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
selectman or maybe a little different
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
than the school board but they have an
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
independent voice and and the voters
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
really rely on the budget
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
committee for guidance and so taking
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
that away I think would be a real
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
voters representative major thank you Mr
 
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I want to Echo my friend
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
from Londoner just said I I know on the
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
ballot in Northampton uh we include the
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
the thoughts of the C IP committee which
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
is certainly a bipartisan committee uh
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
we include the budget committee which is
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
an official budget committee but acts
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
independently we have the impact we've
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
had uh the impact of the tax rate um on
 
01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
there and of course we have the the the
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
opinion of the select board all of those
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
things have been approved by Dr and have
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
never been questioned in the 18 years
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
that I have sat on the select board once
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
we put out a a voter guide in the town
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
and we were nearly taken to court
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
they don't mind it on the ballot but we
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
we put out a voter guide just explaining
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
our position and we were almost taken to
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
court uh we've never done that again so
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
I I um I think the voters should have as
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
much information as as they need thank

01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
recommend the article the Selectmen do
 
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the voters are going
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
to rely because of the concent of power
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
in my town are going to really rely on
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
the budget committee's
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I I don't want to see
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
that taken
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
away now represent s thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
I just have a lot more faith in our
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
voters than I hear being voiced here um
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
if there are questions to be asked I
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
have faith that they will ask them if
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
there are decisions that they disagree
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
with with I have faith that they will
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
voice those disagreements and so I will
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
um representative lales me mentioned
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
straddling off fence on a previous bill
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
and I got I got to admit I find myself
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
going back and forth on this one I see
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
both sides of the argument uh it could
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
really go any way one of the issues that
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
I think many of us talk about all the
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
time is the lack of involvement by
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
citizens um and them not understanding
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
what really what's going on u in their
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
towns I I make the comment frequently I
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
could walk down the town of barington
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
and say hi to somebody and they wouldn't
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
probably know I'm even their
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative so I I I I talked with
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor this morning about I
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
told him I actually love the concept of
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do and because I
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
think we need more involvement and less
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
reliant on our citizens just going up
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
and going oh what they say what they say
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
but you can't lead a horse to water yeah
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
I mean you can lead the horse water you
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
can't make them drink so I go back and
 
01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.709 align:start position:0%
can't make them drink so I go back and
forth

01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:40.650 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what I'll
 
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:46.470 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what I'll
[Laughter]

01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
do representative Elberta thank you Mr
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
chairman having spent a long time
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
working in
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mental Health Services one of the
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
things that I heard frequently was that
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
the only thing that you really get from
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
sitting on a fence is a sore
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
behind uh and I am sort of my behind
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
here is getting sorer and sorer the more
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm uh
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
listening when we are
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
voting we get in our
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh record the house record
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
statements about why people are
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
supporting and why they're not and then
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
we are free to choose how we want to
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
vote I don't see that that would be a
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
bad idea to have voters get this is why
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
we think it's a good idea this is why we
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad idea if the budget
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
committee believes this they can write
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
that if the select board believes this
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
they can write that but making sure that
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
there are here's why
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
for either side make your decision I
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't see it's a bad idea to say who
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
made that decision because if voters
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
keep seeing the same people offering
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
opinions that you disagree with then you
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
know to vote against them not just to
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
feel like you have to vote the way they
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
chose because they happen to be the
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
community leaders so as I said I have no
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
idea how I'm going to vote on
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
this you're a member of the fence Club
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
yella so I I actually like the
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh just given about
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
essentially a voter's guide or whatever
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
like I I'm often the person voting no on
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
on budget committee things and I
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
generally don't
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
speak uh at the budget committee about
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
why because I'm just wasting everyone's
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
time because there's I'm the only one
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
voting no and so I wouldn't um waste
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
everyone's time with that but I might
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
put in uh a Minority Report or something
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
in some voters guide about why this is
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
not a great idea and those interested
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
might be able to do that now do I think
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
as the previous representative said that
 
01:42:14.589 --> 01:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
I should be able to go inside the the
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
polling place and be able to electioneer
 
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
inside the polling place no I don't
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
think that's the proper place for it to
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
be so maybe if we have some uh uh so
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
maybe there is some option as far as
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
like putting that in statute and saying
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
that it it could be available at the
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
town hall or something like that whereas
 
01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
not inside of the polling place um I
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
might be in favor of that but regard
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
going back to representative stav's
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
thing I trust the the voters to research
 
01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
and ask questions um and so for that
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
reason I'm going to change and vote Yes
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
that they can go and ask those questions
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the polling booth and not
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
inside of the polling booth and so uh
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
you've convinced me to vote Yes uh or
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass AKA uh the way that I
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
previously current motion is itl right
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
oppos the I was previously for now I'm
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
going to bees supporting thank you Mr
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
chairman very briefly um when this was
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
presented uh I was thinking just
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
definitions and I was thinking okay so
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
if I want to vote for representative
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
Gallagher when I go into the voting
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
booth and I have his platform listed for
 
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
me uh electioneering and I don't see I
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
think the bias of when we have votes we
 
01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
had votes in front of us we go in the
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
voting booth I think that's election are
 
01:43:43.709 --> 01:43:43.719 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against the
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
itl representative power thank you Mr
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um I would like to also point
 
01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.750 align:start position:0%
chairman um I would like to also point
out

01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire we have SP2 towns
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
and traditional Town
 
01:43:59.070 --> 01:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
meetings and if I'm not mistaken
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
majority of towns are traditional Town
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
meetings and there are
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
no voting booths the this information is
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
printed on the warrant and the warrant
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
articles are voted on at the town
 
01:44:16.589 --> 01:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
meeting so um I think we're losing focus
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
here with regards to this bill and
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
um just in general the ability to
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
provide a notation um with regards to
 
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.390 align:start position:0%
provide a notation um with regards to
Warrant

01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
Warrant
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
articles that's important um in my
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
opinion to be able to um provide
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
information from these boards that the
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know the residents are looking for
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
that information from the people that
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
they elected and um to remove that would
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
be depriving the voters of information
 
01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.430 align:start position:0%
be depriving the voters of information
thank

01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%

01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%

have seen approximately 350 voters show
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
up that's it so I can guarantee you
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
people are not reaching out for
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
information repres Mr chairman I I
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
apologize for interrupting but I was
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
being informed that there are members of
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
the committee who are carrying on
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
conversations while another member is
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
speaking and I just it was a reaction
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
for me to try to signal to those members
 
01:46:14.109 --> 01:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
please stop talking thank you very much
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
for that members who were talking please
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
stop representative
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
stavis I I think there's sufficient
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
questions about what's in this bill and
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
what the implications might be that it's
 
01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
just not ready for prime
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
time um again I'm going to say that I
 
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
support the
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
itl I just think the bill is vague and I
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
think that the notion behind it
 
01:46:40.599 --> 01:46:42.390 align:start position:0%
think that the notion behind it
is

01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
assumed and may or may not be true and I
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
just think it's just not ready I agree
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
that it's an important issue and perhaps
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
one that warrants further study
 
01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%

01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
seconds further discussion on OTP as
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
amended representative
 
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um we just got through
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
um a bill about allowing uh where people
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
asked their elected representative
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions about how they voted and
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
spurring discussion about that and then
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
in this bill it forbids the asking of
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
questions um and I think that just as um
 
01:54:41.159 --> 01:54:42.030 align:start position:0%
questions um and I think that just as um
you

01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
you
might

01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
ask I think it should not be against I
 
01:54:48.069 --> 01:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
should not be against the law to ask the
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
questions I think the the people have no
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to answer the questions
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
but I think that um that having the
 
01:55:00.669 --> 01:55:00.679 align:start position:0%
language in the law saying that no
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
person shall ask questions of any
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner or delegation member I feel
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
like that is kind of going down the
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
wrong road um and so especially in in in
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
placing that in the right to know
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
section of law in our uh I think that's
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
especially problematic and so so I don't
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
I don't support that um I don't think
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
that that there is any
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
punishments um if someone does answer
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
the qu ask the question so um I think
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's just the principle of the issue of
 
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
being transparent and not and and not
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
that you know this person's going to get
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
arrested or whatever for for asking a
 
01:55:49.390 --> 01:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
question that's unlawful to ask
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
so represent represent priest do you
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
have your hand up yes I do go ahead
 
01:55:58.069 --> 01:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um within the
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
three minutes um that they're allowed to
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
speak they can they can ask all the
 
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
questions they want to the commission
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
members in their comments and whether or
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
not the commission members or the
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
delegation choose to answer them that's
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
up to them but they do have the right to
 
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Elward
 
01:56:26.069 --> 01:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm confused um
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
being a newbie to being a delegation
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
member I go to the
 
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
meeting um they have the business
 
01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
portion then they have a public
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
comment um
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
portion and then they open the floor to
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
questions or or actually before the
 
01:56:46.679 --> 01:56:48.510 align:start position:0%
questions or or actually before the
public

01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
comment they have uh each member of the
 
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
department Department come up and
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
explain their position and at that point
 
01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
they open up
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
questions um so I'm I'm confused by
 
01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:06.709 align:start position:0%
questions um so I'm I'm confused by
forbidding

01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
questioning for the comments represent k
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
k Hill you had your hand up thank you Mr
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
chair I'm I'm just going to read the
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
line 13 for us it say no person shall
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
ask questions of any commission or
 
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
so it does actually say what
 
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.470 align:start position:0%
so it does actually say what
representative

01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
01:57:40.589 --> 01:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to support this amendment
 
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunate that there is that
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
sentence um specifying that no person
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
shall ask a question of any commissioner
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
or delegation member I would be able to
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
support this Amendment if that was not
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the amendment and like the
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative priest had mentioned that
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
the person um providing public input
 
01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
they should be able to say what they
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
want even if it's in the form of a
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
question there's no obligation for a a
 
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner or a delegation member to
 
01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
to respond and answer that question but
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that it should be
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited thank
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%

probably could do so this afternoon I
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%

01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
schedule Mr chair but I would be happy
 
01:58:56.109 --> 01:58:56.119 align:start position:0%

02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
consistent here um I would say if this
 
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
passes a floor amendment can be done I
 
02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to start retracting votes and
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
doing all this stuff I think we need to
 
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
be consistent we push forward with where
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
we are and if uh if it passes now then
 
02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.030 align:start position:0%
we are and if uh if it passes now then
representative

02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh stavis or whoever can do a floor
 
02:07:26.189 --> 02:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
amend very simple floor amendment to
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
make this
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
go representative
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
lus yes and I I am addressing
 
02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.149 align:start position:0%
lus yes and I I am addressing
representative

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
stavis do you know what the intent of
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment was it seems to me and and
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative priest and I had a short
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
discussion on this it seems to me that
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
we want people in the public comment
 
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
period to be able to ask
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
questions this sentence seems to throw
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
that out the window but perhaps the
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
intent was that a person could ask a
 
02:08:10.589 --> 02:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
question but of the body as a whole not
 
02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
toward a specific
 
02:08:17.549 --> 02:08:17.559 align:start position:0%
individual I think that's fairly correct
 
02:08:20.589 --> 02:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
I know at our committee uh delegation
 
02:08:20.599 --> 02:08:22.669 align:start position:0%
I know at our committee uh delegation
meetings

02:08:22.669 --> 02:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh we have public comment periods but we
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
do not and we make clear or the chairman
 
02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee makes clear at the
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
beginning this is for public comment on
 
02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
only this is not for asking questions
 
02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
that's how we operate it I think this is
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
attempting to get to that but I think it
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
could be probably a little bit clearer
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's why I'd just like to say we move
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
on uh and then this if it passes the uh
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative sais can put a floor and
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative stavis thank you Mr chair
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
I think representative lelis was asking
 
02:09:00.549 --> 02:09:00.559 align:start position:0%
me a question with that um and yes
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right the answer to
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
that question is yes the intent of that
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
language although inartfully drafted I
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
will admit it to prevent a kind of back
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
and forth tit fortat with individual
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
delegation or commission members uh and
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
in our planning board and on our city
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
council we make that very clear at the
 
02:09:26.549 --> 02:09:26.559 align:start position:0%
outset of the public comment section um
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to offer a floor amendment
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
should this bill go forward that would
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
strike this language or create better
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
language that we can all agree on but I
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
agree that we should be consistent and
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
go forward with the process we've
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
already we're already in the middle of
 
02:09:41.639 --> 02:09:42.990 align:start position:0%
already we're already in the middle of
this

02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:46.589 --> 02:09:46.599 align:start position:0%
bill repres uh represent power thank you
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1359 I offered a floor
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment it it failed then the motion
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
went forward ought to pass and then
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
after that was a vote was taken the
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
chairman said well if the amendment had
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
been written
 
02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:07.950 align:start position:0%
been written
differently

02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
differently
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
Etc we're this is this I see this as the
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
same this the same scenario that that's
 
02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
we're facing right now and I would say
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
that there absolutely is no guarantee
 
02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
that anybody's is going to file a floor
 
02:10:25.470 --> 02:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I would also
 
02:10:29.310 --> 02:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
um also State very firmly that this
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
committee we need to vote on what is in
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
front of us right here and now and not
 
02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
something that we think you know might
 
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
manifest you know in the future in
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
um I would really
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
um say that people need to think about
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
that so I don't recommend
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
um to cast a vote otherwise um based on
 
02:10:59.709 --> 02:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
anything else but what is in front of us
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
here right now thank
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so just since there seems
 
02:11:12.750 --> 02:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of um confusion about the no
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
person shall ask questions of any
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
commission or delegation member I'd just
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
like to note that that was in the
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
original bill as un amended to so um
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
that's not something that um that's not
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
something that the amendment introduced
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
so um withdrawing the amendment wouldn't
 
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
remove it or anything it would require
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
another amendment anyways um so okay
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
what what I'd like to do here can we
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
speak more uh if so we can get going on
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
it to the the bill itself and not the
 
02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
process the process we already decided
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
how how it's going to go forward we will
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
vote on what is here and that's it
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%

1371 but I'm here in my capacity uh as
 
03:33:32.910 --> 03:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
the chair of New Hampshire's um Solid
 
03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
Waste working group which I don't think
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
I've been here before I haven't really
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
discussed this with your committee but
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
it is a stakeholder committee that
 
03:33:45.389 --> 03:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
represents um many people from different
 
03:33:48.429 --> 03:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
parts of the state concerning um solid
 
03:33:51.469 --> 03:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
waste so we have landfill operator on
 
03:33:51.479 --> 03:33:52.590 align:start position:0%
waste so we have landfill operator on
there

03:33:52.590 --> 03:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:33:55.630 --> 03:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities um folks in charge of
 
03:33:57.990 --> 03:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
recycling um a representative of the
 
03:34:01.990 --> 03:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
governor it's a very broad group um and
 
03:34:05.189 --> 03:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
our primary charge under the statute is
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
to work with Dees in support of
 
03:34:12.309 --> 03:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
achievement of the newly issued as in um
 
03:34:16.030 --> 03:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
October of 2022 Solid Waste Management
 
03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
plan which outlines a lot of uh of the
 
03:34:21.389 --> 03:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
goals for the state on how to do better
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
on solid waste and I think you all know
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
that's been a pretty hot topic around
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
here lately um we do have as of uh a
 
03:34:33.150 --> 03:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
year or so ago new Solid Waste diversion
 
03:34:35.229 --> 03:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
goals meaning the amount of solid waste
 
03:34:37.630 --> 03:34:37.640 align:start position:0%
you're trying to keep out of landfills
 
03:34:41.070 --> 03:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
and incinerators our goal is to have a
 
03:34:45.790 --> 03:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
25% reduction in weight by 2030 and a 45
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
% reduction in weight by um
 
03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
2050 and uh obviously landfills and
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
their capacity is a big issue so one of
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
the goals is to try to keep as much as
 
03:35:00.670 --> 03:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
we can out of the landfills so that we
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
can uh retain it for New Hampshire solid
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
waste so in many ways municipalities are
 
03:35:10.349 --> 03:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
really in the front lines of this effort
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
and um it's a really important role that
 
03:35:14.239 --> 03:35:15.870 align:start position:0%
and um it's a really important role that
municipalities

03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:35:19.630 --> 03:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh have to fulfill on behalf of their uh
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
their constituency in fact uh there's a
 
03:35:24.110 --> 03:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
letter here from the New Hampshire
 
03:35:27.309 --> 03:35:27.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association in support of this
 
03:35:30.189 --> 03:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh Bill and they clar they put very
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
clearly in there that it is a statutory
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility of municipalities to um
 
03:35:39.309 --> 03:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
take care of the solid waste for their
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
for their folks in fact my first
 
03:35:44.349 --> 03:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
involvement and where a lot of this uh
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste interest rest has was
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
generated was uh several years ago when
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
China said they weren't going to take
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
our plastic and mixed paper anymore and
 
03:35:56.590 --> 03:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities were really floundering
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do with it
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
so they really are in the front lines
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uh it is a big expense for a lot of
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
them so many of the goals in the solid
 
03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
waste management plan involve
 
03:36:11.469 --> 03:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities we are encouraging them
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
and supporting their education efforts
 
03:36:17.590 --> 03:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
diversion work and um citizens really
 
03:36:19.469 --> 03:36:19.479 align:start position:0%
are paying attention to what's happening
 
03:36:22.990 --> 03:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
with their trash so that's um how the
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group actually came
 
03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
to uh suggest that we introduce House
 
03:36:29.439 --> 03:36:31.429 align:start position:0%
to uh suggest that we introduce House
Bill

03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:36:34.590 --> 03:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
1371 and it's a simple Bill and what it
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
would do it would
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
um amend the section of the statute that
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
currently outlines the optional portions
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
of the master plan so I'm sure you guys
 
03:36:50.309 --> 03:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
are all very familiar with it but
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's helpful to just have the
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
statute in front of you so I gave you um
 
03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
a copy of the statute so the statute is
 
03:37:00.269 --> 03:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
broken up into the things that are
 
03:37:02.429 --> 03:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
optional and the things that are
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
required and just myself and as a group
 
03:37:09.150 --> 03:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
we were really really surprised to see
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
such an important statutory
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility from for municipalities
 
03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
isn't even included Ed in the the topic
 
03:37:19.990 --> 03:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
of planning for solid waste isn't even
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
included in the optional portions of the
 
03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:24.429 align:start position:0%
included in the optional portions of the
master

03:37:24.429 --> 03:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
master
 
03:37:26.910 --> 03:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
plan so we thought that that was a
 
03:37:28.910 --> 03:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
really important thing given everything
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
else and their statutory
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that we do put it in
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
the master plan um I want to emphasize
 
03:37:38.830 --> 03:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
here that it's a well-known fact in the
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that towns only
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
have the powers that are granted to them
 
03:37:47.830 --> 03:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
by the State and we've seen that in in
 
03:37:50.309 --> 03:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
in many different contexts whether it's
 
03:37:53.710 --> 03:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
been guns speed limits uh you know just
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
about anything
 
03:37:59.550 --> 03:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that it would be very
 
03:38:03.150 --> 03:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
important for the towns do very
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
specifically have stated in the statute
 
03:38:10.349 --> 03:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
that they have the option of putting um
 
03:38:10.359 --> 03:38:11.389 align:start position:0%
that they have the option of putting um
waste

03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
waste
 
03:38:14.910 --> 03:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
reduction in their in their master plan
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I have a couple of other uh support
 
03:38:20.189 --> 03:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
letters here one is from the Northeast
 
03:38:23.070 --> 03:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
resource recovery Association those
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
folks talk about being on the front
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
lines they're working with
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities all the time in the
 
03:38:31.710 --> 03:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
development of their recycling plans and
 
03:38:34.750 --> 03:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh contracts they support this bill
 
03:38:36.429 --> 03:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
there's also something here from the
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
conservation law foundation and there's
 
03:38:42.990 --> 03:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
generally uniform uh recognition that
 
03:38:44.910 --> 03:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste is a big Topic in New
 
03:38:46.349 --> 03:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right right now and
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities should be encouraged to
 
03:38:51.070 --> 03:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
focus on it and also give the be given
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
the option to put it in their master
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
plan and with that um I'd be happy to
 
03:39:00.309 --> 03:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:02.189 --> 03:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for being well
 
03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
prepared especially by delivering the
 
03:39:10.189 --> 03:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
rsas that's very good uh representative
 
03:39:13.469 --> 03:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
gallager uh so hi uh thanks for
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
introducing um so so my first reaction
 
03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
is just this seems like a pretty obvious
 
03:39:24.750 --> 03:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
addition um do you know why it wasn't
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
already listed there was it just an
 
03:39:29.269 --> 03:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
oversight or was there a particular
 
03:39:31.510 --> 03:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
reason for leaving it out I mean I
 
03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
honestly had the same question I and
 
03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
because I was looking through just just
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
in thinking uh with the solid waste
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
working group about you know what we're
 
03:39:45.150 --> 03:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve here I actually was on
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
a planning board in my town for 20 years
 
03:39:52.110 --> 03:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
and so and I survived um but I it led me
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
to look at the master plan statute and I
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
honestly was rather shocked uh that
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
waste uh reduction and Solid Waste
 
03:40:04.510 --> 03:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
Management isn't in here and I just have
 
03:40:08.110 --> 03:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
to believe that that it's oversight
 
03:40:08.120 --> 03:40:10.309 align:start position:0%
to believe that that it's oversight
without

03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to say that there are
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
things in here that you know when you
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
compare them to Solid Waste Management I
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
would really like to have Solid Waste
 
03:40:21.269 --> 03:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
Management in here I think it's a
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.309 --> 03:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
absence representative
 
03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
um I you said you've been on a planning
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
board for a long time so I don't know
 
03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
what town it is and uh New London okay I
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
don't know what happens to your plan
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
your master plan after you do it some
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
some communities it it goes into a
 
03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:50.189 align:start position:0%
some communities it it goes into a
bottom

03:40:50.189 --> 03:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
03:40:54.990 --> 03:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
draw um I could you tell me why it
 
03:40:57.870 --> 03:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be better to keep the solid
 
03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
waste subject which is so important and
 
03:41:04.510 --> 03:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
cost the town so much money to keep it
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
as it is now separate and have a a
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
separate plan in each Community instead
 
03:41:13.750 --> 03:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
of lap overlapping it in into the master
 
03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
of lap overlapping it in into the master
plan

03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
well uh F let's see I would just start
 
03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
out by saying that if there's any
 
03:41:24.149 --> 03:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
community that wants to focus
 
03:41:26.110 --> 03:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
exclusively on their Solid Waste
 
03:41:28.149 --> 03:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
Management in a really big way that
 
03:41:31.710 --> 03:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
would be a fantastic idea but like many
 
03:41:36.429 --> 03:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
communities um you know they have so
 
03:41:38.590 --> 03:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
many other things that they're doing the
 
03:41:40.990 --> 03:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
master plan requirement is a requirement
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do it I realize they
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
don't all do it um but uh
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
I think that putting it in the plan
 
03:41:53.349 --> 03:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
gives um an opportunity to build on that
 
03:41:56.590 --> 03:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
for the future I I mean I guess I would
 
03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
say I was on the on the um planning
 
03:42:02.110 --> 03:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
board for 20 years and I chaired it for
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
the last 10 and we really any actions
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we took we they were very much
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
grounded in the master plan and I think
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
I mean that's really the way it's
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to be and any town that is
 
03:42:17.950 --> 03:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
going to all the effort of developing a
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
master plan certainly shouldn't be just
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
putting it in the bottom drawer um and
 
03:42:27.149 --> 03:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
so I I agree with you on that but I I
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would also say that if you
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
put something shorter in the master plan
 
03:42:34.149 --> 03:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
then that would be a really good vehicle
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
to build on to develop an independent
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
plan for your town thank you thank you
 
03:42:41.950 --> 03:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representa
 
03:42:44.269 --> 03:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:42:47.309 --> 03:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question do
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
you think it's fair to say that the
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
evolution of the master plan
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
statute evolves with time and that as
 
03:43:00.750 --> 03:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
issues come to the four they ought to be
 
03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
included because they weren't at the
 
03:43:05.910 --> 03:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
four in Prior
 
03:43:05.920 --> 03:43:07.630 align:start position:0%
four in Prior
eras

03:43:07.630 --> 03:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
eras
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
um electric vehicle charging stations
 
03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
for example um land use for alternative
 
03:43:17.070 --> 03:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
energy reduction for example waste
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
reduction all these issues are R
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
frequently recently developing issues
 
03:43:26.830 --> 03:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
and the master plan
 
03:43:29.550 --> 03:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
statute takes time for it to become
 
03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
complete and probably never will be
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
complete because issues continue to
 
03:43:35.790 --> 03:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
evolve would you say that that is true
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
of waste
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
reduction well just going back to the
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of your question yes I think
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
the master plan section has been
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
evolving I mean on the
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
handy dandy statute that I I passed out
 
03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
to you you can see all the different
 
03:43:53.469 --> 03:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
times that it's been amended um I would
 
03:43:55.950 --> 03:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
say just as a general matter waste
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
reduction and solid waste management is
 
03:44:02.590 --> 03:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
just a really basic uh function of a
 
03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
town and I mean even though time moves
 
03:44:10.269 --> 03:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
on to get back to representative
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
Gallagher's comment it really should
 
03:44:15.229 --> 03:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
have been here right from the beginning
 
03:44:17.790 --> 03:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
I think but that also shows you that in
 
03:44:20.429 --> 03:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
many cases it's like the poor stepchild
 
03:44:22.590 --> 03:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
or whatever of you know a lot of people
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
don't think so much about it but it's
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
really important and so by putting it in
 
03:44:30.429 --> 03:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
here it's a real statement from the
 
03:44:32.670 --> 03:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
state that says yes you should be
 
03:44:35.950 --> 03:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
focusing on this um and I would just go
 
03:44:38.229 --> 03:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
back again to the point that I mean I
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
just was in another committee uh working
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
on an issue that allowed municipalities
 
03:44:45.630 --> 03:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
to have a little a little bit more
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
control over their speed limits and
 
03:44:52.189 --> 03:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
clearly in that case as here they only
 
03:44:54.870 --> 03:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
have the authority that we grant them so
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's in some ways alarming that the
 
03:45:01.149 --> 03:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
authority to have the option to put
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
waste reduction um in your master plan
 
03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
isn't even in our statutes
 
03:45:09.149 --> 03:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
representative lales were you going to
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
speak yes Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you shouldn't you
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
should feel at home here we have a lot
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
of solid waste in this committee but uh
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
one I'll try to come back one of the
 
03:45:26.830 --> 03:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
questions that I have that approximately
 
03:45:31.189 --> 03:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
25% of solid waste is wet
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
garbage and if we were able for there
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
was a time in my life when I I used
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
Russian red worms to eat that solid
 
03:45:46.990 --> 03:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
garbage because I felt that it's great
 
03:45:49.469 --> 03:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
when you take a negative and make a
 
03:45:53.229 --> 03:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
positive out of it and if do you know in
 
03:45:56.790 --> 03:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
your travels working in this in this
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
area whether there's any sort of
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
um uh initiative toward recycling of wet
 
03:46:06.479 --> 03:46:07.870 align:start position:0%
um uh initiative toward recycling of wet
garbage

03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
garbage
 
03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
into uh on one of my favorite subjects
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative um we actually one of the
 
03:46:18.149 --> 03:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
big things that we've worked on in the
 
03:46:20.790 --> 03:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group is promotion
 
03:46:22.990 --> 03:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
of better handling of food waste which I
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
think is what you mean um and I mean
 
03:46:29.469 --> 03:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
again coming back to towns this is a way
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
that towns can start to get a handle on
 
03:46:34.750 --> 03:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
the Tipping fees and the and the
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
processing issues um because 25% you're
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
right of of in weight of what's going
 
03:46:46.469 --> 03:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
into our landfills is in fact food waste
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
and um we're really trying to do more
 
03:46:52.910 --> 03:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
education concerning food waste uh
 
03:46:55.030 --> 03:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
someone is here from Dees they can talk
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
to you about that but you know it starts
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
in many cases while while laying out a
 
03:47:03.910 --> 03:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
plan I mean in our town we're now doing
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
composting it's worked out great but we
 
03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
started out with a with a poll and we
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
tried to find out whether people were
 
03:47:12.630 --> 03:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
interested in it and then we also
 
03:47:14.910 --> 03:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
established a waste reduction committee
 
03:47:19.070 --> 03:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
which I'm not on but anyway um it's just
 
03:47:21.269 --> 03:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
really helpful to do more planning for
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
precisely that reason and we should be
 
03:47:29.149 --> 03:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
doing more composting it's a waste of um
 
03:47:31.830 --> 03:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
our landfill space and also of organic
 
03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
matter that could otherwise be used
 
03:47:34.120 --> 03:47:35.189 align:start position:0%
matter that could otherwise be used
representative

03:47:35.189 --> 03:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for and
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question what is
 
03:47:46.389 --> 03:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of solid w waste problem
 
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire now in our
 
03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
communities well that's a really big uh
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
question I would say there's too much of
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
it um I think that uh we really should
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
be doing more reuse we should be doing
 
03:48:01.040 --> 03:48:02.030 align:start position:0%
be doing more reuse we should be doing
more

03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
recycling um and you know
 
03:48:09.630 --> 03:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
that that will save communities money
 
03:48:13.870 --> 03:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
but it also um is a better use of
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
products rather than throwing them away
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we I don't know we could
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
talk about this for a really long time
 
03:48:23.950 --> 03:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
repres yes if we could I we could kind
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
of bring our Focus back to the subject
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
matter please and may I may can we do it
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
please go ahead regarding the master
 
03:48:31.600 --> 03:48:33.950 align:start position:0%
please go ahead regarding the master
plan

03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
um are there protocols that communities
 
03:48:37.800 --> 03:48:38.790 align:start position:0%
um are there protocols that communities
can

03:48:38.790 --> 03:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:48:44.189 --> 03:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
use to um address these various elements
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
of Sol waste like recycling wet
 
03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:49.429 align:start position:0%
of Sol waste like recycling wet
waste

03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
waste
 
03:48:53.070 --> 03:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
landfills uh you name it um thank you I
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
think education is a huge piece of what
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish at the state
 
03:49:01.149 --> 03:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
level Dees is developing protocols
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions have
 
03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
protocols the New Hampshire uh resource
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
recovery Association works very closely
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
with towns to develop protocols um but
 
03:49:16.349 --> 03:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
you know it does start with planning and
 
03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
it's really really um a key point and I
 
03:49:22.990 --> 03:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
just think it's incredibly important to
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
get this into the master plan statute
 
03:49:29.389 --> 03:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
are there any questions discussing about
 
03:49:32.189 --> 03:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
the putting this into the master plan y
 
03:49:35.990 --> 03:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
Mr uh representative
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
the question um
 
03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
so from your testimony it seems like
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
you ha your interpretation of the
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
statute um may be that
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
the that the Planning and Zoning people
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
can only do um only have sections in it
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
which are listed um and not that they
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
may have may have whatever they want as
 
03:50:13.469 --> 03:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
long as they do the
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
requirements um
 
03:50:19.309 --> 03:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
and it also seems like you are saying
 
03:50:22.349 --> 03:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
that it is extremely important that the
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
state encourage them to do this um so I
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.670 --> 03:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
is is the first part of
 
03:50:35.910 --> 03:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
my my belief that your interpretation of
 
03:50:37.630 --> 03:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
the statute is correct that you're not
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
able to currently have any language in
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
your your um master plan regarding this
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
and and if it is super important by by
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state then shouldn't it be in the
 
03:50:54.149 --> 03:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
required section and not in the optional
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
section so can you talk a little bit
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
about that um i' I'd be happy to I mean
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's just my opinion that
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
the optional part of this is basically
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
the framework that a community has to
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
deal with I mean this is a Dylan's rule
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
state and either you believe believe
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
that towns only have the ability to do
 
03:51:19.790 --> 03:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
what the state gives them allows them to
 
03:51:22.590 --> 03:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
do or you don't I mean you can't like
 
03:51:24.510 --> 03:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
pick and choose when that law applies
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
and when it doesn't so that's number one
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
number two you
 
03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
know as a legislator and and as a member
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
of this fine body sure I would like to
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
come in here and ask you to put it into
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
the required section I think it's really
 
03:51:45.950 --> 03:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
important but I just looking at what's
 
03:51:48.149 --> 03:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
in the required section now they're
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
really Global topics um it seemed to me
 
03:51:54.670 --> 03:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
that the best approach to start with is
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
to put it in the optional section but
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
you know I defer to the committee if you
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
want to make it required it's certainly
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
all right with
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
me S Holland so my question thank you
 
03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh so my question
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
really revolves right right now at least
 
03:52:12.269 --> 03:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
in my community uh and I was on our
 
03:52:15.630 --> 03:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste program for a long time
 
03:52:18.510 --> 03:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
it really resides in the budgetary uh
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
section so we've been reacting to the
 
03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in commodity prices and
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out how to get
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
rid of stuff out of the landfill and
 
03:52:30.990 --> 03:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
also make it economically viable so it
 
03:52:32.590 --> 03:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
so we're already working on it are we
 
03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
going to gain more by putting it in the
 
03:52:36.429 --> 03:52:36.439 align:start position:0%
master plan does that help us more with
 
03:52:38.670 --> 03:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
the strategic planning uh because we're
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
already in the you know when we're doing
 
03:52:42.229 --> 03:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
the budgeting it sits in our Capital
 
03:52:43.950 --> 03:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement and we talk about new trucks
 
03:52:45.870 --> 03:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
and all the equipment are we going to
 
03:52:47.429 --> 03:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
gain a lot more if we do put it in the
 
03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
master plan I guess is what I'm asking
 
03:52:51.269 --> 03:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
well I would say that's your town you
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
know I mean a lot of towns uh they're
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
not as focused on it as maybe you would
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
be but I mean if you look at the ex I
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
mean like in my town we're talking about
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
a new police station we're talking about
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
more different Zoning for you know
 
03:53:11.389 --> 03:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
housing a lot of the the continuing
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
conversations whether they're based on
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
whether it revolves funding or zoning or
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
whatever should be grounded in a plan
 
03:53:21.790 --> 03:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's been developed by a over time
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
with a lot of input and I realize the
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
budget uh process does have you know
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
people that get involved in the budget
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
process but how much better would it be
 
03:53:36.189 --> 03:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
to have what you're doing grounded in a
 
03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
in a forward-looking plan um for your
 
03:53:42.630 --> 03:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
town representative Elwood thank you Mr
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
03:53:46.990 --> 03:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question if putting this in
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
the required section would that create
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate on the
 
03:53:55.510 --> 03:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
towns education and Outreach and needs
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
analysis I mean no I would say no more
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
than what is already in here but I'm not
 
03:54:03.910 --> 03:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
sitting here asking you to put it in the
 
03:54:06.110 --> 03:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
required section oh I understand that
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I just you know anyway
 
03:54:09.880 --> 03:54:11.469 align:start position:0%
yeah I just you know anyway
representative

03:54:11.469 --> 03:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:16.110 --> 03:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so as one of the um
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
relatively newer members of the
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh without quite as much
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
experience in local government um so
 
03:54:29.070 --> 03:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
let's say we um we pass this bill as is
 
03:54:31.550 --> 03:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:54:36.990 --> 03:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
now municipalities can include such a um
 
03:54:39.149 --> 03:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
section in their Master plans how would
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
I as a member of my community go about
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
getting my
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
municipality to include it like how how
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
would um how would people who um what's
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
the process for
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
um what do you think the likelihood is
 
03:55:02.710 --> 03:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
that um municipalities will actually
 
03:55:07.149 --> 03:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
make use of this I me ability I in in my
 
03:55:09.389 --> 03:55:09.399 align:start position:0%
experience municipalities look at this
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
statute and they see the topics that
 
03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
they can be discussing I mean they
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
obviously also look at the Master plans
 
03:55:17.309 --> 03:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
that they did before but if I was
 
03:55:19.750 --> 03:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
someone that wanted to engage and get my
 
03:55:22.590 --> 03:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
town to do something I would go to the
 
03:55:25.469 --> 03:55:25.479 align:start position:0%
responsible uh governing body you can go
 
03:55:27.389 --> 03:55:27.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have yeah you have a
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
planning board in conquered you can go
 
03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
there you can go to the selectman um you
 
03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
know and make your voice known just like
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
topic representative FR thank you Mr
 
03:55:45.469 --> 03:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um would you say that
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
the optional sections of a master
 
03:55:57.870 --> 03:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
plan are more of a a
 
03:56:02.670 --> 03:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
hint as to what town should put into or
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
could put into rather than a a
 
03:56:10.349 --> 03:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
mandate um they're not mandates I think
 
03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're very strong suggestions uh that
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature thought strongly enough
 
03:56:19.269 --> 03:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
about this issue that uh the towns
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
really should be considering putting
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
them in and that's why again I come to
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
where I started it's just kind of
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
shocking and alarming shocking with a
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
lowercase s that you wouldn't have
 
03:56:35.710 --> 03:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
something about Solid Waste in your
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
master plan it's just seems so
 
03:56:42.349 --> 03:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
pivotal representative PRI thank you Mr
 
03:56:44.590 --> 03:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
chairman for allowing me to speak and
 
03:56:46.830 --> 03:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I have
 
03:56:50.110 --> 03:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
done numerous Master plans in the past
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
so many that I've lost count um as a
 
03:56:56.910 --> 03:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
planner um usually we we would put them
 
03:56:59.790 --> 03:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
in the community facilities
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
section um is there an advantage of
 
03:57:08.590 --> 03:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
having their own section as things to
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
look at I think absolutely I mean I it
 
03:57:14.910 --> 03:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
just takes I mean if you're looking at
 
03:57:16.510 --> 03:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
Community facilities you're probably
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
looking at police stations and fire
 
03:57:20.830 --> 03:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
stations schools and stuff like this and
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
that this can sort of be tucked to the
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
side um you know but the other thing is
 
03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
that I would say not everybody puts
 
03:57:34.510 --> 03:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
trash in the community facilities
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
section you know I mean they just may
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
not do it or they might just look at the
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
transfer station and whether it's big
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
enough I mean I can see that happening
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
but whether your transfer station is big
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
enough really isn't the same thing as um
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:54.910 --> 03:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
Management further questions seeing none
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I have
 
03:58:03.870 --> 03:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
Nor uh thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:58:08.149 --> 03:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:58:10.269 --> 03:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
Michael norc uh I'm with the New
 
03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees Solid Waste Management
 
03:58:15.030 --> 03:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau and I head up the section on
 
03:58:18.189 --> 03:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
planning uh education and materials
 
03:58:20.790 --> 03:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
management which is a blanket term for
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
recycling basically um New Hampshire
 
03:58:26.670 --> 03:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
Dees does support this effort uh we
 
03:58:29.790 --> 03:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
believe that planning at the local level
 
03:58:33.229 --> 03:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
for Waste reduction diversion recycling
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
all the all of the above is an important
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
aspect um as representative Eble
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned the state issued a solid waste
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
management plan in late 2022 which kind
 
03:58:45.790 --> 03:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
of outlines a a vision or a roadmap for
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
how Solid Waste should be managed
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide and um I think it's important
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
to just realize that that plan is is
 
03:58:55.030 --> 03:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
Dees will obviously have a central role
 
03:58:57.550 --> 03:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
in implementing that plan but support
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
from municipalities through local
 
03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
planning efforts um would definitely
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
help to uphold implementation and and
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're making progress
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
towards that plan um so de supports it
 
03:59:11.389 --> 03:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's really all I wanted to say if
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are any questions I'm happy to to
 
03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
address thank you are there any
 
03:59:16.710 --> 03:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions relating to
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
putting waste reduction section into the
 
03:59:23.110 --> 03:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
master plan representative
 
03:59:25.510 --> 03:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
03:59:28.990 --> 03:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
question um since the state has its own
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.189 --> 03:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
the what is the concern that um a
 
03:59:40.469 --> 03:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
municipality has the power to create
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
their own plan maybe in conflict with
 
03:59:48.030 --> 03:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
de's plan and trying to kind of work at
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
Cross purposes um and why wouldn't they
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
just why wouldn't you just be referring
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
to the state plan instead of H having a
 
04:00:01.149 --> 04:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
fractured approach with you know 250
 
04:00:03.990 --> 04:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
different solutions to the same problem
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question um I
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that it needs to be kind of
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
duplicative or cross purposes I think
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
one of the points I was trying to make
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
is that Dees is going to have a central
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
role in implementing the solid waste
 
04:00:18.229 --> 04:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
management plan which is kind of this
 
04:00:21.229 --> 04:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
overarching 10-year plan um but we're
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to need support we can't do it all
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
on our own and I think having
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities as key players in that
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
sphere to help support implementation of
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
the plan um so I think this could be an
 
04:00:34.110 --> 04:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for municipalities to think
 
04:00:37.229 --> 04:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
more about uh implementing aspects of
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
the plan in their
 
04:00:42.269 --> 04:00:42.279 align:start position:0%
own local master plan um so I guess
 
04:00:45.309 --> 04:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's just um that's just how we would
 
04:00:46.590 --> 04:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
it further
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%

04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
actually since most people are here and
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
we have about 10 minutes I just going to
 
04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
go over a quick note I have here on
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay as of right now the notice just
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
went out for March 6th which is a
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we will be doing
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
that um our last day to have everything
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
done including committee reports of the
 
04:03:55.510 --> 04:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
20th so what I'm trying to do is find an
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
additional two
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
days um in addition to the 6th prior to
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
the 20th that we can meet now there's
 
04:04:06.870 --> 04:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
some conflicts all kinds of things going
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
on um on the 20th what I'd like to do
 
04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
with that is hold that one open for us
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
just in case there's anything that's we
 
04:04:16.750 --> 04:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
have to finalize we could do in the
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
morning and get that out so as of now
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the 6th the next week
 
04:04:26.149 --> 04:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
um the normally we would do it on a
 
04:04:29.670 --> 04:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday or Wednesday um the Wednesday
 
04:04:32.030 --> 04:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately your chairman has his
 
04:04:35.189 --> 04:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
Federal jury duty commitment the 12th of
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
course is the election day so that week
 
04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
well let me back up if we do not have a
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
house session on the
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
7th I'm going to put that down as one of
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
our um days we will know that probably
 
04:04:54.910 --> 04:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or the next day whether or not
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's going to go and then we're going
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
to have to find another day in that that
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
next week other than the 12th and 13th
 
04:05:03.870 --> 04:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
the 14th will almost assuredly be a
 
04:05:08.550 --> 04:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
house session so in that week we would
 
04:05:11.710 --> 04:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
be looking at and I hate to do it but
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
either a Monday or a Friday or Poss
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
possibly the ne no we can't do it the
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
next week either because the we want to
 
04:05:19.469 --> 04:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
hold the 20th open just for the morning
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
so um think about which day is better or
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
worse for everybody on a Monday or a
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
Friday I know it sucks
 
04:05:32.349 --> 04:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
11th what's
 
04:05:34.560 --> 04:05:36.830 align:start position:0%
11th what's
that

04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:40.590 --> 04:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
okay why don't you kind of get a feel
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
for your committee see what they
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
your members and see what they think and
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
if we can get it done on the 7th uh if
 
04:05:53.309 --> 04:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
we can get the sth that would that would
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
really help just so you know on the six
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear the last four bills
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have or five and what other than
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
exing will be
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
done um and just so everybody's aware it
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't I don't think it's gone out yet
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
on the six we're going to be hearing a
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
non- gerain bill
 
04:06:17.950 --> 04:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be a bill on local
 
04:06:17.960 --> 04:06:19.590 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be a bill on local
options

04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
options
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
for casino and horse
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
racing okay so you need to be prepared
 
04:06:25.800 --> 04:06:26.630 align:start position:0%
racing okay so you need to be prepared
for

04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:06:26.640 --> 04:06:28.910 align:start position:0%
for
that

04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
um that's probably going to be a long
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
one just so everybody knows that'll be
 
04:06:35.070 --> 04:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon on the
 
04:06:39.309 --> 04:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
6th I've spoken to the um the bill that
 
04:06:41.229 --> 04:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to use was one of uh
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative Roy's that he's not
 
04:06:44.710 --> 04:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
pursuing because it's going to be
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
included in
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
11:24 and I've already got an approval
 
04:06:52.189 --> 04:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
from the speaker it it does touch on
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County um the existing
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
regs in there has the local option for
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
approving or disapproving a Kino so this
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
is nothing more than also having the
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
local option to approve or disapprove of
 
04:07:09.429 --> 04:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
those two two issues so just want
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
everybody be apprised of that that'll be
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
a kind of an interesting one so anyway
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the sixth hopefully the seventh and
 
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
then the following week one of those
 
04:07:22.149 --> 04:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
days and then we'll we'll use the 20th
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
for clean up in case we have anything
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
left that was pretty vague wasn't it
 
04:07:28.990 --> 04:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
other than the
 
04:07:29.000 --> 04:07:42.429 align:start position:0%
other than the
sixth

04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:42.439 --> 04:08:12.429 align:start position:0%

yella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
04:13:59.790 --> 04:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
the question um is there any officers in
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
the state that you oppose having a
 
04:14:06.030 --> 04:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
four-year term instead of a 2-year term
 
04:14:06.040 --> 04:14:09.189 align:start position:0%
four-year term instead of a 2-year term
like

04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I mean I can give examples but is
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
there is there any
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh office that you think should have the
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
um that addition like the the
 
04:14:23.070 --> 04:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the voters that it
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
does now and that we should not move
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
towards a four-year term for every
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
elected office in in the state well
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm just asking for Coos
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
County not the entire state but uh I
 
04:14:41.710 --> 04:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
think what happens for a two-year term
 
04:14:44.109 --> 04:14:44.119 align:start position:0%
you you get appointed you get elected to
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
your position you spend probably eight
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
months to a year trying to learn that
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
job next thing you know you're running
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
for election again and I think in some
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
cases these people may leave a a good
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
job to take this job and after two years
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
they're out if you know if it happened
 
04:15:04.229 --> 04:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
to go that
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
way follow up thank you couldn't
 
04:15:09.149 --> 04:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't you say that same statement
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
about all of the elected positions that
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
are 2-year terms in the state like the
 
04:15:16.109 --> 04:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
governor or the Secretary of State or
 
04:15:19.469 --> 04:15:19.479 align:start position:0%
state representatives or or Senators
 
04:15:22.750 --> 04:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
like can you give me an example of why
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
this the the the voters need less
 
04:15:30.030 --> 04:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
oversight over these people than than
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
the other people
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
interested thank
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
you yeah I'm not sure I think
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
that no no when you get up there you can
 
04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
talk about it I I'll let him if he's
 
04:15:46.510 --> 04:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
speaking after me I'll let him answer
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%

line um 15 I'm kind of confused by what
 
04:16:00.840 --> 04:16:01.590 align:start position:0%
line um 15 I'm kind of confused by what
it

04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:16:06.109 --> 04:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
says um and at each subsequent state
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
general election any such officer in
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County is this a mistake that
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be
 
04:16:17.109 --> 04:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
Co County CO yeah
 
04:16:17.119 --> 04:16:20.269 align:start position:0%
Co County CO yeah
okay

04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:22.830 --> 04:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
no representative priest that's existing
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
language oh yes that is exist yeah so
 
04:16:28.510 --> 04:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
that should be
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
changed that's not subject of the I see
 
04:16:35.309 --> 04:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
I I okay thank you for the
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you Mr J and thank
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
you for your your testimony I come from
 
04:16:43.229 --> 04:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County uh and uh could you
 
04:16:43.239 --> 04:16:43.950 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County uh and uh could you
tell

04:16:43.950 --> 04:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
tell
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
me uh these officers how long they have
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
been holding that term how how long is
 
04:16:54.189 --> 04:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
this their first they're in there all in
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
their first term their second term in
 
04:16:59.790 --> 04:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
other words do they have any seniority
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
or the experience seemed to be the thing
 
04:17:05.710 --> 04:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
that was hung on with Rockingham County
 
04:17:09.109 --> 04:17:09.119 align:start position:0%
the the comment you made that you know
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
they're there in there that takes them a
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
year to or so to get going
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
and then once they're they feel
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable because the difference
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
between these positions is it's a their
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
jobs right they're not and I hate to say
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
it like state representatives or
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
Selectmen or whatever that it's but the
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
point was made that this was a these
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
were jobs and I I ask you how long have
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
they been in their jobs and do you have
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
is that why you have the confidence in
 
04:17:44.309 --> 04:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
letting them stay there for 4 years
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
instead of two years in the future well
 
04:17:48.149 --> 04:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple of them here to speak
 
04:17:50.910 --> 04:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
today everybody's been in there at least
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
one term or two years I believe so yes
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be one of the strong
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
points that they had serve their term
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
they had the experience they just like
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
in any other job you look at your
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
employees say Okay gee they're doing a
 
04:18:11.790 --> 04:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
good job we'll keep them and that was uh
 
04:18:14.109 --> 04:18:14.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if that's the situation
 
04:18:17.710 --> 04:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
in your county it was in Rockingham
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
where every one of the those people that
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
were uh considered for to go to a longer
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
term was the cost was the cost of the
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
the running for office and the fact that
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
they were all in the office for
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time and they were
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
experienced in their
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
job I believe that is the case in Coos
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so one of the arguments
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
that was made in favor of doing this for
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County was that oh Rockingham
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
County has such a large population um
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
that it makes it harder to run campaigns
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
now kasos county is one of the
 
04:19:15.030 --> 04:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
smaller counties isn't it so would that
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
argument still make sense in your case
 
04:19:17.399 --> 04:19:19.910 align:start position:0%
argument still make sense in your case
as

04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
well I don't I don't know if that would
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
be an effect have an effect on
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
04:19:29.950 --> 04:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
my question is it your belief that that
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
um because Rockingham County has the
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
ability to do this that Coos County has
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to do this and that's what
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
you guys wish to do well I I was asked
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
by a lot of the uh these positions if
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
this would be possible and and we looked
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
into it and saw that there wasn't a
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
problem in
 
04:19:52.469 --> 04:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
Rockingham thought it may be feasible
 
04:19:52.479 --> 04:19:54.189 align:start position:0%
Rockingham thought it may be feasible
for

04:19:54.189 --> 04:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
Coos representative
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
lales yes uh thank you for taking my
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
question um and I look back at the
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
arguments that were made for Rockingham
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
County and one of the one of the reasons
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just asking if in your mind if
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
it applies to Coos also is that a lot of
 
04:20:20.830 --> 04:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
these officers have
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
staffs and the you know the the staff
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
is equally important as the elected
 
04:20:34.630 --> 04:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
officer so if the officer was to lose
 
04:20:37.550 --> 04:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
his job would then would then the staff
 
04:20:41.070 --> 04:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
be unsettled there is that your
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
impression you think that applies
 
04:20:46.830 --> 04:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%

04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%

04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh next person

robers hold on put on your
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%

04:21:12.070 --> 04:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
time sorry so I actually been with Coos
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
County since 1998 I've gone through four
 
04:21:19.389 --> 04:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
sheriffs you can be a sheriff for four
 
04:21:22.750 --> 04:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
years eight years sometimes Sheriff's
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
Office and police work Sheriff's Office
 
04:21:29.790 --> 04:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
and police work kind of it's a different
 
04:21:32.189 --> 04:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
thing Coos County has actually not as
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
many people but we have a big land mass
 
04:21:36.030 --> 04:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the same amount of
 
04:21:37.710 --> 04:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
people as Rockingham or anybody else so
 
04:21:40.269 --> 04:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find really good employees
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
um I think it's very important
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
I hate to see someone come in for a
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
two-year term and their first year
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
they're trying to learn a job the second
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
year they're trying to keep their job
 
04:21:53.309 --> 04:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
and and I've watched it because I've
 
04:21:58.030 --> 04:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
gone through numerous sheriffs um I just
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of important to get
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
somebody in there if you can't do the
 
04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
job in four years then hopefully someone
 
04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
else will run against them in my
 
04:22:06.590 --> 04:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
personal opinion and beat them out but
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
you need four years to actually get your
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
feet on the ground and actually
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
understand the position you can be a cop
 
04:22:15.309 --> 04:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
all day long and our Sheriff now with a
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
deputy chief great deputy chief he came
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
in here eye opener we do a ton of
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
different stuff I can seize your
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
property I can evict you I can do a
 
04:22:26.990 --> 04:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff that the police don't do
 
04:22:28.830 --> 04:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
so it's very important to get somebody
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
in there that actually can understand a
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
job and not have to worry about running
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
just like you guys have to run all the
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
time and I just think it's very
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
important for Coos County because we're
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of the northern border
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
you've seen a a lot of opposition
 
04:22:46.269 --> 04:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
against it you know like putting people
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
up there because we got a lot of
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
landmass and not a lot of cops and the
 
04:22:50.479 --> 04:22:51.349 align:start position:0%
landmass and not a lot of cops and the
keep

04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
keep
 
04:22:56.429 --> 04:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
cops it's been a great 26 years and I
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
just think it's very important to get a
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
sheriff that can stay for four years and
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
understand Coos County and actually make
 
04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's testimony
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
done very good represent power thank you
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
mic on thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I missed
 
04:23:22.109 --> 04:23:22.119 align:start position:0%
your your introduction are you with the
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department in Coos County are
 
04:23:26.750 --> 04:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
you the sheriff so I'm a captain of the
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office and like I said I've
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
been on since 1998 and I've gone through
 
04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
four different sheriffs and seen four
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
different administrations that does
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
stuff different
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of where I think four
 
04:23:43.389 --> 04:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
years make a big difference because you
 
04:23:45.870 --> 04:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
can't get it done in two years you you
 
04:23:48.149 --> 04:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
need to really understand our department
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
and how it works and and we're not any
 
04:23:55.950 --> 04:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
Coos further questions representative
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
yella do you have a question can you
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you can you restate what what you
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
were saying as far as the turnover in
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
the position um and can you elaborate on
 
04:24:16.830 --> 04:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
if any of those any of the people and
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
the positions that we're currently
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
talking about did not get reelected
 
04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
after their first term and therefore um
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
the voters would have would have been
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
deprived in that situation of making a
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
quick change where they thought that
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
there was something going wrong in in
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
that office thank
 
04:24:38.590 --> 04:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
you and Coos County doesn't have a big
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
turnover like if you're a sheriff and
 
04:24:43.870 --> 04:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing a good job and it's you a
 
04:24:45.670 --> 04:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
sheriff does a good job with the people
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
that he has under him and he has to rely
 
04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
on the guys that he's that are there a
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
new sheriff that would my personal
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
opinion new sheriff comes in and fires
 
04:24:56.149 --> 04:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
everybody well I think he's the dumbest
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
Sheriff that's out there because his
 
04:25:00.070 --> 04:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
guys actually know what's going on
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
unless they're not good and then you
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
kind of get rid of them but you don't
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
really have a big turnover in Coos just
 
04:25:07.870 --> 04:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
because you don't have a lot of people
 
04:25:10.109 --> 04:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
that run because we're not a big County
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
peoplewise but we're a big County
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
landwise wise and it's hard to keep good
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
people and we have good people so I
 
04:25:21.269 --> 04:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
think the deputies have done a great job
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
just helping the sheriff be
 
04:25:27.389 --> 04:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
successful if that answers your question
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
that kind
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
of go ahead represent thank you can you
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
specifically state it to your knowledge
 
04:25:38.550 --> 04:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
has there been anyone in Coos County
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
that has only served one term and then
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
got voted out by the by the voters thank
 
04:25:47.309 --> 04:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
you so you have Sheriff Lovin that
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
started Coos County full-time in
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
1998 he I think he did a term maybe two
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure at that point um Chief Al
 
04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
came in he did one term and he actually
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
said this isn't for me he didn't like
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
the politics of it didn't like the Civil
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
part of it he said this isn't being a
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
cop and he actually got elected sheriff
 
04:26:13.710 --> 04:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
and resigned and that's how Jerry maku
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
got in and Jerry maku is Sheriff who was
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
a State Trooper local PD went through
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
and he got to a point where he did I
 
04:26:25.149 --> 04:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
think eight years and said I've had it
 
04:26:27.109 --> 04:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
I'm done and then that's when the
 
04:26:28.910 --> 04:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
current Sheriff Brian valerino who the
 
04:26:31.870 --> 04:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
deputy chief stepped in ran and he's
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
been there since so I've watched him
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
come and go it's it's not for everybody
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a hard position um it's
 
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
F the question represent majori thank
 
04:26:48.750 --> 04:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
my question um and I and I think I heard
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
you corre correctly talking about the
 
04:26:55.469 --> 04:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
challenges that that uh that law
 
04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement has up at the border and and
 
04:27:00.109 --> 04:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering this bill we've had this
 
04:27:01.950 --> 04:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill many many times in Municipal and
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
County to about all of the same
 
04:27:07.309 --> 04:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
positions but am I hearing that that Co
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
am I hearing correctly the Coos County
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
has that much more pressure for the
 
04:27:15.429 --> 04:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
sheriff and the County Attorney possibly
 
04:27:17.469 --> 04:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
because of and I'm not and I'm not
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
saying the emergent border issue but the
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the just having to control the
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
border that make any sense it does I
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
don't think it has anything to do with
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
the border the border on the election
 
04:27:32.550 --> 04:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
part you know what the border is the
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
Border it's we have a lot of Woodland if
 
04:27:38.830 --> 04:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot with stone garden
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
everything else we're we're out there a
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
lot you can't cover that so I don't
 
04:27:43.389 --> 04:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
think it really has anything to do with
 
04:27:46.830 --> 04:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
the election part it just has to do with
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
getting someone in that can understand a
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
job and personally being here since 98 I
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
really believe it takes you four years
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
to actually understand this job and like
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
said not that I haven't been around and
 
04:28:03.189 --> 04:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
I've been in Coos County I haven't left
 
04:28:05.109 --> 04:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
I've had plenty of opportunities I love
 
04:28:08.189 --> 04:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
Coos County and but it takes you time
 
04:28:10.710 --> 04:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's a lot of work to be a
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
sheriff thank you forur the questions
 
04:28:12.880 --> 04:28:14.510 align:start position:0%

04:28:17.149 --> 04:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question in your in
 
04:28:19.920 --> 04:28:20.710 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question in your in
your

04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:28:23.229 --> 04:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
estimation and having been there as long
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
as you have what is the approximate cost
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
the of the learning curve of these
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
years learning
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
curve it's hard to describe
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
every every county is different
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County does Patrol they every
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
County we're a small County we don't
 
04:28:51.870 --> 04:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to say hey you're
 
04:28:53.790 --> 04:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
going to do Roar Patrol you're going to
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
do our guys do transports they do civil
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
rits we evict people we take kids from
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
their parents like we do it all and and
 
04:29:04.990 --> 04:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
it is taxing and it's but we're not like
 
04:29:07.630 --> 04:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
any other County and that personally
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
like I said four years you're going to
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
get a sheriff that will know this job in
 
04:29:12.870 --> 04:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
four years you're either going to get it
 
04:29:14.670 --> 04:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
or you're not and if you don't get it
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
then the people are going to vote you
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
out or you're going to run again and say
 
04:29:21.109 --> 04:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
I want this that's my personal opinion
 
04:29:21.119 --> 04:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
I want this that's my personal opinion
forther

04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
forther
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:29:28.349 --> 04:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
fra thank you Mr chair um if I
 
04:29:31.990 --> 04:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly you are an
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
employee rather than elected is that
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
correct correct follow
 
04:29:42.149 --> 04:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
up um as an employee
 
04:29:44.950 --> 04:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
when you get a new
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
sheriff how disruptive is that or is
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
that disruptive to your job as the new
 
04:29:58.269 --> 04:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
sheriff learns his
 
04:30:01.550 --> 04:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
job so I've been lucky because I've had
 
04:30:04.030 --> 04:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
good Sheriff that came in but it could
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
be very disruptive and I've seen other
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
counties that I'm not going to name that
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
sheriffs have come in and disrupted the
 
04:30:12.670 --> 04:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
whole County and we don't have that in
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
Coos it's worked very well in Coos but
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
our we've worked very well together and
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
the sheriffs that been elected have
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
lived in Coos County they've worked the
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
whole County they understand how the
 
04:30:29.469 --> 04:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
Coos further
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
testimony than we have uh Brian
 
04:30:38.479 --> 04:30:42.309 align:start position:0%
testimony than we have uh Brian
ballerino

04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.349 --> 04:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
when you introduce yourself could you
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
also say I'm assuming you're in favor
 
04:30:48.429 --> 04:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
but uh who you are specifically and what
 
04:30:51.070 --> 04:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
your title is yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
Brian valerino I'm currently the high
 
04:30:58.590 --> 04:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
Sheriff of coest County um I had a lot
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
of talking points but seems like my
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
captain covered pretty much all of them
 
04:31:06.670 --> 04:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
so I I appreciate that um I just just a
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of background I guess is is
 
04:31:13.469 --> 04:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
what I can uh offer you uh now um I did
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
my entire career with Berlin PD ended up
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
by being the deputy chief I did 26 years
 
04:31:21.790 --> 04:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
I went from the criminal world to when I
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
retired to the Civil World um so that
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
was a whole different learning process
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
for me uh when the captain pointed out
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
that um it takes a while to learn the
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
job it was an eye opener because I
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't used to that um luckily I had
 
04:31:43.469 --> 04:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
great staff uh that we accomplished a
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
lot of goals that I had um I didn't have
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
any disruptions I didn't lose anybody um
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
to another agency or anything like that
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
you know you got to go in there it's
 
04:31:54.670 --> 04:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
like any other job if you want to change
 
04:31:56.229 --> 04:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
things you got to make change a little
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
bit slow because if you don't it's going
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
to upset the whole apple cart so we were
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
able to do that but I am in favor of of
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
this bill it um doesn't affect me
 
04:32:08.429 --> 04:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
personally at this point because this is
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
my last term um and the captain is going
 
04:32:14.349 --> 04:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
to be running for uh for uh the high
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
Sheriff position but I fully support
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
that um especially when I got there as
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
Sheriff there were some training and
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
equipment needs that needed to be done
 
04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
um I had set some goals up and there's
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
no way I could have done that in in uh
 
04:32:33.630 --> 04:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
in two years I was fortunate that I
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have anybody run against me um so
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
with that respect that was uh that was
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
good but you're always thinking about
 
04:32:43.710 --> 04:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
about it every I just don't think that
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
two years is is enough but again it has
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
no impact on me personally but I think
 
04:32:49.279 --> 04:32:50.990 align:start position:0%
no impact on me personally but I think
that

04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
having a four-year term you can set
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
those goals realistically and not try
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
and cram everything in um within a
 
04:32:59.560 --> 04:33:02.030 align:start position:0%
and cram everything in um within a
two-year

04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
period questions representative
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
lales yes I thank you very much for your
 
04:33:12.510 --> 04:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and thanks for your service um
 
04:33:16.510 --> 04:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
I think Coos County is unique when you
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
look at the counties in New Hampshire I
 
04:33:22.230 --> 04:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
mean we have the border which has
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
already been touched upon but you also
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot of
 
04:33:31.230 --> 04:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
unincorporated uh areas you have towns
 
04:33:35.189 --> 04:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
without police departments so the the
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
job of the sheriff's
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
department in in Coos is unique
 
04:33:46.670 --> 04:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
and and in my way of thinking your
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
testimony and I I just like your
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it it does require the extra
 
04:33:58.510 --> 04:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh the extra time the four years uh and
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to comment on
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you Robert yes you're
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely right Coos is unique and
 
04:34:09.629 --> 04:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
we're unique as a law enforcement
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
Community as well I mean we get along
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
Ong great with State Police with the
 
04:34:17.070 --> 04:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
locals um with with Berlin PD we need to
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
be there for each other because it's not
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
like Southern New Hampshire where you're
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
going to have people coming all over the
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
place but you need to have that buyin
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
from from your citizens in Co County so
 
04:34:30.830 --> 04:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
you gotta you got to go out into the uh
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
unincorporated areas you got to meet
 
04:34:34.990 --> 04:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
these people and um as the captain said
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
I mean yes we are a small population up
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
there but the county is big and uh when
 
04:34:42.910 --> 04:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
when we don't have trans sports or civil
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
we try and send people out uh in the
 
04:34:48.029 --> 04:34:48.039 align:start position:0%
unincorporated areas and um I I think
 
04:34:50.590 --> 04:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
we've made great strides with that so I
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question thank
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%

for the officials um however I haven't
 
04:35:56.349 --> 04:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
heard anyone talk about the
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
um TFI the importance or the the lack of
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
importance of
 
04:36:07.709 --> 04:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
uh of the cutting in half of the the the
 
04:36:10.709 --> 04:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
power of the electorate to make a change
 
04:36:14.789 --> 04:36:14.799 align:start position:0%
in those offices is what do you see as
 
04:36:17.551 --> 04:36:17.561 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
drawbacks from the the power of the of
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
the voters to be able to make a change
 
04:36:25.750 --> 04:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
in that office if they see it's going
 
04:36:29.709 --> 04:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
arai especially let's say in the the
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
the the the sheriff's office that um
 
04:36:37.789 --> 04:36:37.799 align:start position:0%
could elect someone that has no uh law
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement experience at all and so if
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
they chose to elect that person and then
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
it was going arai that they want to
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
change course in two years and wouldn't
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
be able to for another two years if this
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
was to pass can you speak a little bit
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
to that and the risk it there is to the
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
the voting
 
04:36:57.429 --> 04:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
population I think this checks and
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
balances with with every position um as
 
04:37:03.789 --> 04:37:03.799 align:start position:0%
again I I'll say Co county is unique you
 
04:37:05.070 --> 04:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
have to get out there you have to know
 
04:37:06.429 --> 04:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
the people you have to answer the
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
people's complaints if there's any
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
complaints um and I think that that is
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
what is is
 
04:37:14.830 --> 04:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
really makes Coos successful and that's
 
04:37:16.629 --> 04:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
why I I believe that it should be a
 
04:37:18.910 --> 04:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
four-year term um I get out there as
 
04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
much as I can to the different
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
communities I believe I'm the only
 
04:37:24.109 --> 04:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
sheriff in in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:37:27.709 --> 04:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
that has a marked Cruiser that I like to
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
bring out to the
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
various towns in in the area but again
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
you need to have buying you need to have
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
the citizens trust you but there also
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be a uh a form where if there
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
is a complaint that it needs to be
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
investigated but I truly believe by
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
getting a four-year term you're going to
 
04:37:47.990 --> 04:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
have someone that's going to be vested
 
04:37:49.230 --> 04:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh in that position because they're
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
going to know that they're going to be
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
there for four years or they should be
 
04:37:58.029 --> 04:37:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
job further questions seeing none thank
 
04:38:03.390 --> 04:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you next up
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
out welcome former rep
 
04:38:11.680 --> 04:38:14.709 align:start position:0%
out welcome former rep
thank

04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
you uh Leon put on your mic thank you
 
04:38:21.390 --> 04:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
I'm Leon R out I live in Lancaster which
 
04:38:24.109 --> 04:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
is up in Coos County I did serve two
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
terms here in the New Hampshire house
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
very proud of and I currently serve as
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
the Coos County Register of
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
Deeds I ran for that position back in
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
2018 when the current register was going
 
04:38:38.039 --> 04:38:39.150 align:start position:0%
2018 when the current register was going
to

04:38:39.150 --> 04:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:38:41.709 --> 04:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
retire the employees that were in in the
 
04:38:43.869 --> 04:38:43.879 align:start position:0%
office which would normally probably
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
fill that
 
04:38:48.429 --> 04:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
position felt it was disadvantageous to
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
them to run for the elected position
 
04:38:54.269 --> 04:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
rather than stay as an employee of the
 
04:38:56.510 --> 04:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
county I was
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
approached and told that they thought i'
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
would be a good fit so I did some
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
research and figured I was willing to
 
04:39:04.830 --> 04:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
give it a
 
04:39:08.070 --> 04:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
try but there was definitely hesitation
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
in that because you're running for a
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
position that you don't really know and
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
you have a lot to learn and it's only
 
04:39:16.000 --> 04:39:17.070 align:start position:0%
you have a lot to learn and it's only
two

04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
years so I took the
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
position love the position actually a
 
04:39:25.470 --> 04:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
lot of history in the registry of deeds
 
04:39:28.750 --> 04:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
so it it's a great position I love
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
history the position though
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
takes probably two to three years to
 
04:39:35.359 --> 04:39:36.310 align:start position:0%
takes probably two to three years to
actually

04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
learn so about a year and a half into my
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
first term instead of concentrating on
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
the job at hand I needed to shift back
 
04:39:48.390 --> 04:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
into election
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
mode election mode in Coos County is
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
maybe a little different than most
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
places but not a lot other than you got
 
04:39:59.230 --> 04:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of territory to cover uh someone
 
04:40:02.430 --> 04:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
asked about some
 
04:40:06.350 --> 04:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
cost typically on an election in Coos
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
County I have spent $2 to
 
04:40:12.750 --> 04:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
$33,000 during the the
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
election so that's an expense out of my
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
pocket plus the candidate or the person
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
doing the job now has to focus on
 
04:40:25.070 --> 04:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
reelection rather than the job so that's
 
04:40:26.830 --> 04:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
why I support this bill because it will
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
give you four years of continuity and
 
04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.270 --> 04:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
position I will also say because there's
 
04:40:38.190 --> 04:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
been some concern on the voters being
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
able to make a change if it is needed in
 
04:40:44.310 --> 04:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
the office office I find one of the
 
04:40:48.510 --> 04:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
reasons why we have a problem maybe with
 
04:40:51.390 --> 04:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
less qualified candidates is you're
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
asking somebody to step outside of their
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
regular job I had to take a my business
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
down to just a small part-time to take
 
04:41:02.638 --> 04:41:03.910 align:start position:0%
down to just a small part-time to take
this

04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
position it's a big leap of faith to do
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
something like that or leave another
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
profession when you're own guaranteed a
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
job for 2 years there's absolutely no
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
job security and I believe we would get
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
better candidates to run for these
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
offices if they were looking at a
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
four-year commitment rather than just a
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
two-year and basically it's a two-ear
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
Sprint because the two years goes by
 
04:41:32.110 --> 04:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
quickly as you all know
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
here so I think we might get better
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
candidates person would be able to get
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
better acclimated to the job and learn
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
the position better in for you
 
04:41:45.310 --> 04:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
years and then make a decision a really
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
informed decision on whether it is a
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
good fit for
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
them I question was also asked of one of
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
the previous Witnesses about unopposed
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
candidates I did run unopposed last
 
04:42:04.590 --> 04:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
election the first two terms I did I was
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
opposed but I can say they they weren't
 
04:42:07.920 --> 04:42:09.750 align:start position:0%
opposed but I can say they they weren't
close

04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
close
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
elections on last time we'll see what
 
04:42:15.390 --> 04:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
happens this time but I'm looking
 
04:42:23.230 --> 04:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
it I would take any questions at this
 
04:42:28.430 --> 04:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
time because I don't want to belabor the
 
04:42:30.430 --> 04:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
point keep it short and sweet let's put
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
it that way thank you do I see have any
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:42:38.350 --> 04:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if you ran a post
 
04:42:44.910 --> 04:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
osed what were your campaign
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
costs I mean unopposed I'm sorry um you
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
if you're running for an office you
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
still got to get out there and meet the
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
people I still ran ads both in the
 
04:43:01.830 --> 04:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
newspapers on Facebook and did certain
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
campaign events just to let people know
 
04:43:06.670 --> 04:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
that I am still interested in the job
 
04:43:11.948 --> 04:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.948 --> 04:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for taking this
 
04:43:16.110 --> 04:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up question could
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
you estimate for for me and for us how
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
much time you think it took out of your
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
job uh to to do to run this campaign and
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.910 --> 04:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
re-election the unopposed time it was
 
04:43:42.270 --> 04:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
probably I spent about 20 hours a
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
week after work so that's working 40
 
04:43:47.910 --> 04:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
hours and then doing campaign events the
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
opposed elections I was probably doing
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
closer to 30 or 40
 
04:43:55.390 --> 04:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
hours because it's more intensitive you
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
actually have somebody that's running
 
04:44:00.590 --> 04:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
against you um I always take every
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
election serious whether I've got an
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
opponent or not and in the words of the
 
04:44:08.830 --> 04:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
late great Ray Burton you always run
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative o Kella
 
04:44:18.670 --> 04:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking the
 
04:44:22.590 --> 04:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
question it seems like the the a lot of
 
04:44:22.600 --> 04:44:23.470 align:start position:0%
question it seems like the the a lot of
the

04:44:23.470 --> 04:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
sentiments um being espoused here seem
 
04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
to be against the election process as a
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
whole and that that these would be
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
better served to not be elected
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
positions um can you talk about that and
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
with if you if you disagree with that
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
and and and and believe that it's
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
important that these El these positions
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
specifically be elected and and uh that
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
let's say a 8-year term would be
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
you yes I 100% disagree with that I the
 
04:45:06.030 --> 04:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
register of deeds position in my mind
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
needs to be elected because one of the
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
first things that I ran into when I
 
04:45:13.350 --> 04:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
became Register of Deeds was people that
 
04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
I had made unhappy because they was
 
04:45:16.990 --> 04:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
submitting documents that weren't
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
fitting the bill that they were going to
 
04:45:22.948 --> 04:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
complain to my County Commissioners and
 
04:45:25.628 --> 04:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
I plainly told them I don't work for the
 
04:45:27.150 --> 04:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners I work for the
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
voters of Coos County that's an
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
important distinction any of these
 
04:45:34.030 --> 04:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
elected offices have to make the
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
four-year term is a better fit for
 
04:45:40.350 --> 04:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
people to learn to have job security to
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
get better candidates to actually stand
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
up and say okay I know I can at least
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
have this office for four years where if
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
it's only for two years they're not
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to leave a job and take this on
 
04:45:56.910 --> 04:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
where it might only be two years in
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
8-year term would definitely be too long
 
04:46:03.948 --> 04:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
I think too long of a commitment for
 
04:46:06.430 --> 04:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
most people four years they can learn
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
the job figure out if they like the job
 
04:46:13.350 --> 04:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
and in then either step down or rerun
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
and again a lot of it is
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
for continuity where you learn the
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
position and there's not changes every
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
year or every two years to what the
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds in my case is doing
 
04:46:30.510 --> 04:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's very important people understand
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
what's an acceptable document what when
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
they come to the registry of deeds what
 
04:46:37.470 --> 04:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to be required to have and
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
if you're changing every two years it
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
becomes very confusing and kind of messy
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
office thank you forther questions I see
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%

none thank you rep former representative

04:47:05.310 --> 04:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
Horan thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horan I'm from
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
counties the association is in support
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill um just to provide a little
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
background to this committee uh in
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
2022 the this committee had actually
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 1397 to apply to all
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
counties that was amended on the house
 
04:47:29.708 --> 04:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
floor and it was stated on the house
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
floor that if a County wanted this for
 
04:47:34.510 --> 04:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
their County they should bring it
 
04:47:37.150 --> 04:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
individually I've included the link to
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
the discussion with the timestamp so you
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to watch the entire entire
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
session and you can quickly find that
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussion um this would bring Coos in
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
line with Rockingham County um these
 
04:47:52.470 --> 04:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
positions are primarily administrative
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
and ensuring continuity for the voters
 
04:47:56.910 --> 04:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
that they know what to expect out of
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
these positions that are making
 
04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
administrative decisions and not
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily policy decisions is an
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
important factor for uh these uh
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers um also uh uh
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
the association did want me to highlight
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
that asking these people to immediately
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
start running for office again takes
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
away from the services that these people
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be contributing to their
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
jobs that they've been elected to happy
 
04:48:27.868 --> 04:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
to take any questions um and I will
 
04:48:30.350 --> 04:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony thank you for the
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
questions or any questions for uh
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:43.310 --> 04:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh go
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
ahead in in Your Capacity with the
 
04:48:46.400 --> 04:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
ahead in in Your Capacity with the
County

04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
County
 
04:48:51.030 --> 04:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
Association Rockingham has made the
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
change based upon
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
your uh how do you feel they're doing uh
 
04:49:00.430 --> 04:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
they I've discussed this with Rockingham
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
County they believe this is going well
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
um it has created some stability for
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
those offices not only employees but
 
04:49:10.830 --> 04:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
voters as well um and so the association
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
has taken the position that if any other
 
04:49:14.510 --> 04:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
County wants to do this we will support
 
04:49:17.310 --> 04:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
them in that endeavor thank
 
04:49:22.590 --> 04:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
you represent yella thank you um you you
 
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
said that that it's been um positive um
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
and you seem to indicate that you had um
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
talked to not just the people who
 
04:49:37.628 --> 04:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
benefit from it but also the voters what
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:49:45.270 --> 04:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
polling or what is the scope of that
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
because obviously I wasn't pulled and
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not in FA favor of the
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham uh one so how many people uh
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
do you kind of like I understand the
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative yella
 
04:50:01.788 --> 04:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
I was speaking only into my scope as
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
working with uh the association of
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
counties and so the Commissioners your
 
04:50:10.030 --> 04:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
appointed officials um so isn't just
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
those four positions um we have not done
 
04:50:15.390 --> 04:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
any polling that is not within our
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
budget we run a very lean ship so that
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
is not something we are capable of doing
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
at this
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
point Thank you further questions seeing
 
04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony I just
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.750 --> 04:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
I as the Lan Democrat in our uh mids
 
04:50:41.470 --> 04:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
from cost County here I just want to
 
04:50:42.868 --> 04:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
present myself to the committee in case
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
I could make this a nonpartisan issue um
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
I agree with the the speakers um I don't
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
see any problem I think that that the
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
Coos County usually um operates pretty
 
04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
um apolitical in those offices um and uh
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
I I support this this motion I will I
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
will push back on M Mr R out's uh
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
testimony about uh close elections uh it
 
04:51:09.628 --> 04:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
was my mom who ran against him in four
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
years ago and I think she would take uh
 
04:51:13.708 --> 04:51:13.718 align:start position:0%
Umbridge with the fact of be saying it
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.040 --> 04:51:20.050 align:start position:0%
so that's a pretty nice
 
04:51:20.050 --> 04:51:22.270 align:start position:0%
so that's a pretty nice
[Laughter]

04:51:22.270 --> 04:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%

the uh County of Coos in favor so with
 
04:51:40.628 --> 04:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
that we'll go ahead and close the
 
04:51:42.548 --> 04:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
pairing on HB
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
1345 and give us about 2 minutes and
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%

this is a recommit bill so it has
 
04:52:47.470 --> 04:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
already been addressed or or introduced
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to go through that
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
again uh so what we will do now is look
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.190 --> 04:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
Youk in okay I have two pink cards

the committee my name is uh Mark Bodwin
 
04:53:34.548 --> 04:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
I am a uh retired police officer I did
 
04:53:38.030 --> 04:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
22 years in uh law enforcement uh both
 
04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
at the local level and at the state
 
04:53:40.040 --> 04:53:41.310 align:start position:0%
at the local level and at the state
level

04:53:41.310 --> 04:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:53:44.190 --> 04:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh currently I am an attorney um I
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
practice uh with the office of Milner
 
04:53:48.990 --> 04:53:49.000 align:start position:0%

04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh police and fire and some other uh
 
04:53:54.190 --> 04:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
different types of unions I'm here to uh
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
speak um in opposition to uh HB
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
526 uh for a number of reasons um I'm
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
going first go to uh touched on the
 
04:54:08.670 --> 04:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
point that nothing's broken and nothing
 
04:54:11.470 --> 04:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed so the way the things
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
are currently working in regards to
 
04:54:16.708 --> 04:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
police details uh there aren't any real
 
04:54:19.948 --> 04:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
issues out there uh this bill is just
 
04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know in search of a problem to fix
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
and there we don't seem to have that
 
04:54:25.948 --> 04:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
here so I want to First say that the
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
current uh system is working and so
 
04:54:30.590 --> 04:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
which leads me to my second point which
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that this bill if passed
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
would uh result in uh some unattended
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
consequences and some of that uh I think
 
04:54:41.230 --> 04:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
is just uh from the language itself
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
um even with the amended uh
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
version uh line four a city or town
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
shall only use local Law Enforcement
 
04:54:54.030 --> 04:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
Officers for temporary traffic control
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
when there are specific safety concerns
 
04:54:59.830 --> 04:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
about the project uh my concern here is
 
04:55:02.708 --> 04:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
in line four shall only well that
 
04:55:04.670 --> 04:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't give you any discretion uh it
 
04:55:06.150 --> 04:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
tells you what you have to do and you
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice there it's not a May
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
and in line five specific safety
 
04:55:15.750 --> 04:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
concerns is pretty vague I'm not I'm not
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
entirely sure what that means how you
 
04:55:21.030 --> 04:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
define that um I I think there'd be a
 
04:55:24.910 --> 04:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
lot of questions there so what and the
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
other thing that this looks like it it
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
probably does is kind of make some
 
04:55:31.708 --> 04:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
confusion as to okay who is going to
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
make these decision is it the city or
 
04:55:35.948 --> 04:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
town council is it the police chief
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's in that city or town so you get
 
04:55:40.910 --> 04:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
some confusion there uh this really
 
04:55:43.390 --> 04:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
limits your local control uh currently
 
04:55:45.948 --> 04:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
towns can uh decide what they choose to
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
do in in this current instance It's
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
usually the police chief that uh makes
 
04:55:50.320 --> 04:55:51.110 align:start position:0%
usually the police chief that uh makes
those

04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
decisions um so again with the language
 
04:55:57.788 --> 04:55:57.798 align:start position:0%
being vague um and uh you know the
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
limiting of local control uh the New
 
04:56:02.070 --> 04:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Association which I'm a
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
member of and am currently representing
 
04:56:06.868 --> 04:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
for on this particular instance uh would
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
ask that uh you know you uh defeat this
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh bill and with that I'm willing to
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions I didn't want to take
 
04:56:15.510 --> 04:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
up a lot of your time thank you
 
04:56:15.520 --> 04:56:16.830 align:start position:0%
up a lot of your time thank you
representative

04:56:16.830 --> 04:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned testifying to this bill
 
04:56:25.708 --> 04:56:25.718 align:start position:0%
as amended how so if I remember
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
correctly we had a previous amend
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the bill the last time um
 
04:56:36.628 --> 04:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
we exacted it and now there is a new
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us um 2024 r211 H
 
04:56:47.310 --> 04:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
so could you just clarify to us um which
 
04:56:49.990 --> 04:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
um which amendments language you're
 
04:56:52.230 --> 04:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
looking at um or you're basing your
 
04:56:52.240 --> 04:56:57.350 align:start position:0%
looking at um or you're basing your
testimony

04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
on can you just go read the amendment
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
again the number uh
 
04:57:05.230 --> 04:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
2024 uh
 
04:57:08.430 --> 04:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
0211 H is the new one that's in front of
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
us on the back table there's a bunch of
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah I see the other one but um
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
I had reviewed actually this one first
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then I had gotten this one second
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
and I thought that one was the revised
 
04:57:52.390 --> 04:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
one but even with this one
 
04:57:55.628 --> 04:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
um again it shall only be required when
 
04:57:57.390 --> 04:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
municipality has determined the traffic
 
04:58:00.110 --> 04:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
volume roadway Vis visibility again
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
who's determining that um so there is
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
some you know vagueness there as well
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
again the concerns here are it's not
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
broken why are we fixing it uh and with
 
04:58:18.510 --> 04:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences the other
 
04:58:21.230 --> 04:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
question I would have here too is I mean
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
let's take it a step further with uh
 
04:58:26.270 --> 04:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
private companies so if a private
 
04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
company wants to uh hire a police
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
officer instead of a flagger are they
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
now Limited in doing that um and it so
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
again what we see here is I think you're
 
04:58:38.830 --> 04:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
taking away local control when this is
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
not something that really needs needs to
 
04:58:44.310 --> 04:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
be addressed at this point uh is it this
 
04:58:48.868 --> 04:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
has been working for uh for years so
 
04:58:51.390 --> 04:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative yo Kella thank you thank
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question sure
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I don't remember if you I
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
don't remember you uh testifying last
 
04:59:03.788 --> 04:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
time um regarding this bill but it
 
04:59:06.868 --> 04:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
seemed like the the problem that it's
 
04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
fixing is
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities um essentially padding
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
their police budgets by requiring
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
flaggers in unnecessary or uh police
 
04:59:19.548 --> 04:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
Personnel to be used in unnecessary
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
situations so that they can uh give
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
their employees more pay um
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
so do with that scope in mind do you see
 
04:59:36.030 --> 04:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
that that that is an appropriate thing
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
that municipality should be able to do
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
or you think that the um um local
 
04:59:43.230 --> 04:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
tyranny has gone too far in that sense
 
04:59:44.830 --> 04:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
and that the municipality should be
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
reigned in by the state in that case
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
well I think you have a bunch of um
 
04:59:52.548 --> 04:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
different issues you have there you know
 
04:59:54.350 --> 04:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
again this is a local issue it goes down
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the uh local level and you do have
 
05:00:00.270 --> 05:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
some instances um and again I'm not in
 
05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
on the administrative side so I can't
 
05:00:04.590 --> 05:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
speak to what uh I can only tell you to
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
what I understand happens which is
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
normally you have the fee for whatever
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
the police officer is for their hourly
 
05:00:14.070 --> 05:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
rate uh and then the town will sometimes
 
05:00:15.788 --> 05:00:15.798 align:start position:0%
and I say sometimes because I'm not
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
entirely sure all towns do it uh will
 
05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
add in a um an administrative fee or
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
also maybe even a cruiser fee if the CW
 
05:00:26.430 --> 05:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
if the company is requesting that a
 
05:00:28.590 --> 05:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
cruiser uh accompany the detail as well
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
too and that's for the use of the
 
05:00:32.750 --> 05:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
cruiser the fuel the wear and tear on it
 
05:00:37.788 --> 05:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
and such um I'm not sure of what those
 
05:00:40.590 --> 05:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
different you know costs are it might be
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
different in for example in Nashville
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
than it is in Salem than it is in
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm not entirely sure um I
 
05:00:50.590 --> 05:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you uh that I do see a mix now
 
05:00:53.470 --> 05:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
of flaggers and police officers uh I'm
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing as many police officers
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
anymore so it it seems to the system
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
that is currently going on seems to be
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
working um I would say I would say this
 
05:01:04.948 --> 05:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
is probably more of a question for maybe
 
05:01:06.548 --> 05:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
a police chief or something that has
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
some insight into what exactly they are
 
05:01:08.958 --> 05:01:11.788 align:start position:0%
some insight into what exactly they are
billing

05:01:11.788 --> 05:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
billing
 
05:01:13.548 --> 05:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
if that I that answers your question
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
representa majori thank you Mr chairman
 
05:01:19.310 --> 05:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
um two-part question but I may need to
 
05:01:21.230 --> 05:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
throw a followup um are you familiar
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department of
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation Flagger and uniform
 
05:01:27.510 --> 05:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
officer use and work Zone
 
05:01:30.270 --> 05:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines I am familiar with it
 
05:01:33.270 --> 05:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
to I know it exists do I know verbatim
 
05:01:35.470 --> 05:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
no I do not may I ask a followup Mr
 
05:01:38.590 --> 05:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
chairman absolutely so my question is
 
05:01:40.510 --> 05:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
then in there and I don't expect you to
 
05:01:42.990 --> 05:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
know it verbatim but in there it spells
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
out the guidelines for when a
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
municipality should use a flagger versus
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
when they should use a uniformed officer
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
do I understand you correctly that you
 
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
believe that that these guidelines based
 
05:01:55.628 --> 05:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
on your experience are working well in
 
05:01:58.830 --> 05:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
communities yes and um my understanding
 
05:02:01.548 --> 05:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
also there too is uh and again the
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
latter half of my career was with uh
 
05:02:05.548 --> 05:02:05.558 align:start position:0%
State Police so we dealt mostly with the
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
highways but in that particular case
 
05:02:08.670 --> 05:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
that was the department of
 
05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
transportation that was man mandating
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not there was a a
 
05:02:13.868 --> 05:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
trooper that needed to be there or how
 
05:02:15.390 --> 05:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
many Troopers needed to be there for
 
05:02:17.868 --> 05:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
that particular uh package so there
 
05:02:19.470 --> 05:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
there were guidelines that they followed
 
05:02:21.548 --> 05:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
on that level and I know there are other
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
National guidelines that they follow
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
about with traffic vests and signage and
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
things of that nature that all follow
 
05:02:27.558 --> 05:02:29.070 align:start position:0%
things of that nature that all follow
along

05:02:29.070 --> 05:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
along
 
05:02:31.150 --> 05:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
too representative
 
05:02:33.548 --> 05:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
for taking the testimony uh are you
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
aware that uh there are many communities
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who have this issue if
 
05:02:45.310 --> 05:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
there is an issue this item at least in
 
05:02:45.320 --> 05:02:46.190 align:start position:0%
there is an issue this item at least in
their

05:02:46.190 --> 05:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
contract I do know that uh there are uh
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
several collective bargaining agreements
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
that speak to uh details and what I mean
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
by they speak to it um usually they
 
05:02:59.708 --> 05:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
speak to such things as it allows the
 
05:03:03.628 --> 05:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
police officer to uh put in for details
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh it may restrict the number of hours
 
05:03:07.948 --> 05:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
that they can work it may speak to what
 
05:03:10.830 --> 05:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
the actual detail rate is
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know for example in the Salem uh
 
05:03:16.270 --> 05:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
Police contract it speaks to what 2024
 
05:03:19.548 --> 05:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
what the 2024 rate is but it's the rate
 
05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
for what the police officer receives not
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily what the town of Salem
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
receives I don't know if they have a SE
 
05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
charge on top of that I know follow up
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I would go
 
05:03:35.230 --> 05:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
ahead in the real world this is
 
05:03:39.470 --> 05:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
lucrative uh money for the police uh
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
police police officer is it can we
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
justify the fact that we have an extra
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
police officer out at a site within the
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
town or city that you wouldn't normally
 
05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
have and at a place where there's a
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
potential of some difficulty uh an
 
05:04:00.548 --> 05:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
accident or whatever we have so thank
 
05:04:05.150 --> 05:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
and would you also talk about the uh the
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
fact that the police officer has an
 
05:04:12.788 --> 05:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make that extra
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
money makes it ends up having him at
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
least working in his his uh type of work
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
instead of going out and painting roofs
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
and that kind of stuff so is is there a
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
benefit to have that police officer and
 
05:04:30.310 --> 05:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
is it worthwhile to have him on the site
 
05:04:31.990 --> 05:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and thank you for the question um
 
05:04:34.670 --> 05:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right uh when you have
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
a an extra police officer there doing a
 
05:04:38.110 --> 05:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
detail not only are they directing
 
05:04:40.948 --> 05:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
traffic looking at traffic um they can
 
05:04:42.990 --> 05:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
handle situations that occur right there
 
05:04:44.548 --> 05:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
they can handle accidents that might
 
05:04:47.390 --> 05:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
occur in the construction zone uh so
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
that it keeps another police officer
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
free to continue to do Patrol or answer
 
05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
calls of that nature uh I know of
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
instances uh where uh they had uh bolos
 
05:04:59.708 --> 05:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
be on the lookout for uh because
 
05:05:01.628 --> 05:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
somebody had committed a crime and uh
 
05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
they were now looking for either a
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
violent felon or something and the car
 
05:05:08.270 --> 05:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
happens to travel into a construction
 
05:05:10.590 --> 05:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
zone and they were able to apprehend the
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
person at the construction zone um so
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
there are those instances it also gives
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
the impression that there are more
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
police out on the street so even that
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's a even their presence there is a
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
a deterrent factor and to uh address
 
05:05:27.788 --> 05:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
your last uh question it is it is a way
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
for police officers to make extra money
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
while they're still doing their same
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
function as a police officer instead of
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
having to you know paint roofs uh paint
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
houses do roofs or things of that nature
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
too thank you for your comments thank
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman represent stavis thank
 
05:05:46.110 --> 05:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
question what are the unintended
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
consequences of this
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislature passing into law something
 
05:05:57.868 --> 05:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
that could contradict or probably does
 
05:05:59.590 --> 05:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
contradict the Department of
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation guidelines and the
 
05:06:01.840 --> 05:06:03.030 align:start position:0%
Transportation guidelines and the
long-established

05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
long-established
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
practice of governing bodies of towns
 
05:06:08.910 --> 05:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
and cities working closely with do along
 
05:06:12.190 --> 05:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
those guidelines lines to make the
 
05:06:15.910 --> 05:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
decisions on whether to have uniformed
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
officers or commercial flaggers there
 
05:06:20.548 --> 05:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I hope I can
 
05:06:23.310 --> 05:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
answer your question um you know I think
 
05:06:24.910 --> 05:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
if you're you're going to pass the
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
statute you do have to make sure that it
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't conflict with any um any
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines that the dot might have or
 
05:06:33.788 --> 05:06:33.798 align:start position:0%
even federally uh although the federal
 
05:06:35.310 --> 05:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh tends to be more on the
 
05:06:37.628 --> 05:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
highway um so I think that's a concern
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
you have to look at um the the next
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
concern I I would have also with that
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
too is it may lead to
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
confusion uh and um there are instances
 
05:06:47.760 --> 05:06:48.830 align:start position:0%
confusion uh and um there are instances
too

05:06:48.830 --> 05:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
where you know let's face it there's
 
05:06:53.070 --> 05:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
road rage out there people get angry
 
05:06:54.590 --> 05:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
people get angry when they have to wait
 
05:06:56.910 --> 05:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
in traffic people are in a hurry these
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
days um and when you have somebody
 
05:07:00.590 --> 05:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's a flagger out there they don't
 
05:07:02.270 --> 05:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
have the same Authority as a police
 
05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
officer and what you may have in some of
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
these instances is some uh you know
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
chaos in these instances where a police
 
05:07:11.708 --> 05:07:11.718 align:start position:0%
officer would prevented that or if road
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
rage were to occur the police officer
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
could address it right then and there
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
and uh not continue on so I I think
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
there are some benefits to having a
 
05:07:21.910 --> 05:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
police officer doing doing construction
 
05:07:23.948 --> 05:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
do I think every little piece of
 
05:07:25.150 --> 05:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
construction needs to have a police
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
officer maybe maybe not I think it
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
depends on the situation and I think
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's why you leave it up to local
 
05:07:32.230 --> 05:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
Chiefs to make that
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
determination forur the questions
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr chair
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
question let's just move away from the
 
05:07:42.750 --> 05:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
money factor for a second do you think
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
that the workers and the people and the
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
guys doing these jobs are all safer when
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have law enforcement running these
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
details I thank you for the question and
 
05:07:54.590 --> 05:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
yes I do think they are um you know I
 
05:07:57.230 --> 05:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
think the uh and I know because I have
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
done some of these in the past when I
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
was younger um I can tell you right now
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to do it now um and the
 
05:08:04.990 --> 05:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
only reason I say that is because I'm
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
older and it's not a lot of fun standing
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
in the street for 48 hours uh that being
 
05:08:14.590 --> 05:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
said though when I did do it um the you
 
05:08:16.110 --> 05:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
had a good relationship with the
 
05:08:18.910 --> 05:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
companies that were there and um they
 
05:08:21.070 --> 05:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
trusted you uh you looked out for them
 
05:08:23.788 --> 05:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
you made sure that they were safe um and
 
05:08:25.150 --> 05:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
again I I think that you know the
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
motoring public just respects a police
 
05:08:29.230 --> 05:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
officer more than they do a flagger so
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're uh more willing to uh you know
 
05:08:37.470 --> 05:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
officer forther questions rep
 
05:08:39.680 --> 05:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
officer forther questions rep
representative

05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
Gallagher uh so you were mentioning
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
about um police being able to be on the
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
lookout for things while they're
 
05:08:55.470 --> 05:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
flaggers what sort of um Fourth
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
05:09:00.830 --> 05:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
protections um against search and
 
05:09:06.788 --> 05:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
seizure do uh people have when uh police
 
05:09:11.470 --> 05:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
are uh doing the these flagging details
 
05:09:13.590 --> 05:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
so these would be um no different than
 
05:09:15.310 --> 05:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
any other interaction that the police
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
would have with the with the motoring
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
public so if they're doing a detail here
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
all the still all the rules still apply
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
you need to have a you know articulable
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
suspicion and probable cause to make a
 
05:09:28.030 --> 05:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
stop or to investigate something any
 
05:09:31.030 --> 05:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
further um you know so it usually if
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
there's a bolo like for example that you
 
05:09:34.868 --> 05:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
use that's because other officers
 
05:09:37.150 --> 05:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere else have already done some
 
05:09:38.830 --> 05:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
investigations they've come out with
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
their problem will cause they say we've
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
identified this subject that was driving
 
05:09:44.910 --> 05:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
the vehicle uh this is the vehicle
 
05:09:46.350 --> 05:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
they're driving this is the plate
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
they're driving uh or other identifying
 
05:09:52.590 --> 05:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
factors uh and so if I see a car that's
 
05:09:55.270 --> 05:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
similar to that you know but is maybe
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have the plate number
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
but it it matches well I have
 
05:10:00.030 --> 05:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion to stop that
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
person maybe not arrest the person right
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
away but at least inquire as to whether
 
05:10:06.030 --> 05:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
or not a crime is being committed or
 
05:10:07.868 --> 05:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
they are the person that's being looked
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
after uh but but then from that point is
 
05:10:12.030 --> 05:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
where a police officer would again just
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
normally build their probable cause and
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
if probable cause is built to the point
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
that an arrest needs to be made then
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
then that's what happens so the short
 
05:10:22.150 --> 05:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
answer is they don't give up any any
 
05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
rights you they're not losing anything
 
05:10:28.110 --> 05:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.948 --> 05:10:31.958 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
 
05:10:37.150 --> 05:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
F thank you Mr chair um when a police
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
officer on traffic control duty is
 
05:10:44.830 --> 05:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
tending to his police function
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
abolo whatever what happens to the
 
05:10:52.628 --> 05:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
Traffic Control Function that he's there
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
for who does that yeah and that all
 
05:10:57.270 --> 05:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
depends on the situation on what's
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
Happening sometimes uh there might be
 
05:11:01.230 --> 05:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
multiple officers there where the one
 
05:11:03.190 --> 05:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
officer can now take over both and and
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
and handle what needs to be done uh
 
05:11:07.548 --> 05:11:07.558 align:start position:0%
there might be another instance where it
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
tempor temporarily has to be shut down
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes until another officer
 
05:11:13.868 --> 05:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
can show up take over this particular
 
05:11:15.788 --> 05:11:15.798 align:start position:0%
situ that that situation they were
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with so that they can get back
 
05:11:21.628 --> 05:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
to um uh doing traffic control duties as
 
05:11:24.190 --> 05:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
well too and and recently there's also
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
been instances where there are police
 
05:11:28.948 --> 05:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
and traffic control flaggers working
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
together on these sites as well too so
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh the answer is is it wouldn't go
 
05:11:36.030 --> 05:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
unattended it would be dealt with in a
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
in a way but it would all depend on you
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
know what are the facts in front of you
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with at that
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
point yep representative Elward thank
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:11:52.270 --> 05:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
question um absent the word shall in
 
05:11:52.280 --> 05:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
question um absent the word shall in
this

05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is it not enabling legislation
 
05:12:01.830 --> 05:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
I mean is not the choices
 
05:12:04.230 --> 05:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
optional well I guess now you know
 
05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the proper Amendment it says
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
May so it does give you the option so
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
the shall is no longer there uh except
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
for a line uh nine which says the use of
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
uniformed officers shall only be
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
required no me yeah but that's a line
 
05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
six if you go down to
 
05:12:20.680 --> 05:12:23.390 align:start position:0%
six if you go down to
line

05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:12:28.150 --> 05:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:31.548 --> 05:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
there11 yeah I got it right
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
here okay so that was changeed to may as
 
05:12:51.948 --> 05:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
and again I I think some of the concerns
 
05:12:58.150 --> 05:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
I would still have is one um who makes
 
05:12:59.708 --> 05:12:59.718 align:start position:0%
that decision is it the police chief is
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
a town counsel um you know where does
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
that uh decision made and two um again I
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any issues that we're
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
having now that we need to have a bill
 
05:13:14.070 --> 05:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's put into into place and maybe I'm
 
05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
just the wrong person to answer the
 
05:13:17.910 --> 05:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure but okay thank you
 
05:13:21.190 --> 05:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have a single
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
question for you sir sure um you
 
05:13:28.990 --> 05:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh about officers having to
 
05:13:31.150 --> 05:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
stand out in the street for 4 to eight
 
05:13:34.708 --> 05:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
hours do all police details require the
 
05:13:36.750 --> 05:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
officer to stand in the street or along
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
the street or can they be in their
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles it all depends on the situation
 
05:13:43.948 --> 05:13:43.958 align:start position:0%
um if you're in a local town or a
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
specific sit uh you know where the
 
05:13:49.230 --> 05:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
traffic is not on the highway so to
 
05:13:52.510 --> 05:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
speak um you know there may be instances
 
05:13:53.708 --> 05:13:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh most of the time where you're out
 
05:13:55.150 --> 05:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
there and you're directing traffic and
 
05:13:56.590 --> 05:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
you need to be physically out of your
 
05:13:58.830 --> 05:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
car so I've had details where I've
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
actually been the traffic light where
 
05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
I've stood in the middle of the the road
 
05:14:03.990 --> 05:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I've had to stand there and it was
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
an 8 Hour detail and sure enough yeah
 
05:14:07.990 --> 05:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
you switch off you have a break here and
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
there and you or you have lunch break
 
05:14:10.868 --> 05:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
here and there and you work it out with
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
the other police officers that are there
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh so you have those instances I've also
 
05:14:17.430 --> 05:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
had instances where I'm just in a lane
 
05:14:20.030 --> 05:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
closure on a highway at which point it's
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
it's safe for everybody if I'm sitting
 
05:14:23.590 --> 05:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
in the cruiser and just monitoring
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
traffic from there um so it all depends
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
I guess on what the specific
 
05:14:32.070 --> 05:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
construction zone looks

eloquently spoke of I can tell you
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
personally in my career I have witnessed
 
05:15:41.708 --> 05:15:41.718 align:start position:0%
the arrests of members of the public who
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
were motoring through a detail for one
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
reason or another um or from a bolo we
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
have had arrests of uh people of a d DUI
 
05:15:53.190 --> 05:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
we've had arrests for people of theft
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
we've solved fraud cases from this uh a
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
few years ago we solved an armed bank
 
05:15:59.830 --> 05:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
robbery because we had a detail officer
 
05:16:01.948 --> 05:16:01.958 align:start position:0%
who heard the uh call go out over his
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
radio because they're all wearing a
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
radio he actually immediately moved
 
05:16:07.470 --> 05:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
right to the bank cuz he was right in
 
05:16:09.628 --> 05:16:09.638 align:start position:0%
front of it U I should say he was within
 
05:16:11.070 --> 05:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
a quarter mile of it he went right to
 
05:16:13.788 --> 05:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
the bank he stopped the um suspect from
 
05:16:15.788 --> 05:16:15.798 align:start position:0%
getting into his getaway car and we
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
eventually located the subject and
 
05:16:18.670 --> 05:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
arrested him for an nonbank robbery at
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
St Mary's bank but I'll take any
 
05:16:23.470 --> 05:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
questions you might
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%

I cannot personally think of the time
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
when we actually stopped in Amber Alert
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
in Hudson New Hampshire um but certainly
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
we've we've stopped vehicles that were
 
05:16:53.070 --> 05:16:53.080 align:start position:0%

stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:17:00.670 --> 05:17:00.680 align:start position:0%

05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
any does a commercial Flagger have to
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
stop or apprehend someone who's driving
 
05:17:09.708 --> 05:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
erratically exhibiting road rage
 
05:17:12.548 --> 05:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
committing a crime I know by Authority
 
05:17:14.910 --> 05:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
they have uh or by Statute they have
 
05:17:17.590 --> 05:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
authority to uh direct traffic they
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
don't have any other authority that I'm
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
aware of other than calling the
 
05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
police um and actually having the police
 
05:17:26.070 --> 05:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
investigate to do
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
that for the
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one um so
 
05:17:36.510 --> 05:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
far um similar to the last time we heard
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh testimony on this I've heard that
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%

Kella thank you thank you for uh taking
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
the question um can
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
you have you when you were talking about
 
05:18:13.590 --> 05:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
um this or if your experiences in Hudson
 
05:18:18.270 --> 05:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
um is there a significant concern about
 
05:18:18.280 --> 05:18:20.070 align:start position:0%
um is there a significant concern about
the

05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
wages um is that a major topic of
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
conversation for municipalities uh or
 
05:18:28.990 --> 05:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
the police officers in regard to
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
flagging um or is that um in your
 
05:18:38.910 --> 05:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
experience a tangential issue um
 
05:18:41.150 --> 05:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh good question I
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
could tell you the the wages that are
 
05:18:46.270 --> 05:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
set in Hudson are set by a collective
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement which includes
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
details um as far as administratively
 
05:18:53.830 --> 05:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
obviously with the police officers we we
 
05:18:55.030 --> 05:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
tell them how they're going to address
 
05:18:56.230 --> 05:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
how they're going to work if you have a
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
complaint against police officer detail
 
05:19:00.270 --> 05:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
you call it into us we'll handle it um
 
05:19:02.350 --> 05:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
with regards to wages and pay I would
 
05:19:04.868 --> 05:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
say I could tell you this we probably
 
05:19:06.270 --> 05:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
there's a Highway Safety Committee in
 
05:19:07.990 --> 05:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hudson that's how we handle it right
 
05:19:09.548 --> 05:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
it's made up of the chief of police fire
 
05:19:12.510 --> 05:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
chief Public Works director the engineer
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
from the town and planning and we
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
average probably 12 details a year where
 
05:19:21.990 --> 05:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
we mandate a police detail we do we have
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
a lot more than 12 details a year um a
 
05:19:27.788 --> 05:19:27.798 align:start position:0%
lot more so we're not we're not seeing
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we're you know we we have some
 
05:19:31.230 --> 05:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
obviously that are uh not traffic
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
related right so those those are
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
different but um but just we we have so
 
05:19:38.070 --> 05:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
many more details a year uh and they're
 
05:19:40.110 --> 05:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
not they're not being mandated so the
 
05:19:41.910 --> 05:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
vendor the contractor is actually
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:47.430 --> 05:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
officer further
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing uh represent
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair um I assume that
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is some sort of a training and
 
05:20:02.590 --> 05:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
certification program for commercial
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
flaggers and if that is the
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
case do they have any advantage or
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
their ability or skill set to control
 
05:20:19.868 --> 05:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
traffic as compared to a certified
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
police officer that's a great question I
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
don't know I know they have a
 
05:20:25.708 --> 05:20:25.718 align:start position:0%
certification I don't know what
 
05:20:28.030 --> 05:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
encompasses I know our police officers
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh take the same training for the dot
 
05:20:31.230 --> 05:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
the guidelines training that we were
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier that I think uh
 
05:20:36.430 --> 05:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned representative um I
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
also know that our police officers are
 
05:20:39.868 --> 05:20:39.878 align:start position:0%
trained at the Academy at basic traffic
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
control they're trained uh at our own
 
05:20:42.830 --> 05:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
Police Department we do our field
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
training they're trained as well as that
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's any advantage
 
05:20:48.628 --> 05:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I know the advantage the
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
police officers have is we have the
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
authority to stop a car that's acting
 
05:20:54.910 --> 05:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
Reckless and we have the authority to
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
radio something in um and for for me
 
05:21:01.350 --> 05:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
personally it is an extra resource it's
 
05:21:03.150 --> 05:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
an extraordinarily extra resource to
 
05:21:05.708 --> 05:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
have extra additional eyes and ears
 
05:21:07.948 --> 05:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
presence that enhanced presence that
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
security that there because you have
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
extra officers that they're not within
 
05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
your budget so to speak but they're
 
05:21:15.310 --> 05:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
there because they're doing a road job
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
and they're in uniform and people know
 
05:21:21.628 --> 05:21:21.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.868 --> 05:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
officers okay representative
 
05:21:26.590 --> 05:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
Chief do PE police officers get heard on
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
these details at all I'm sorry do police
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
officers ever get heard on details
 
05:21:36.030 --> 05:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
working details do they get hurt injured
 
05:21:40.350 --> 05:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
get hurt they uh they may I'm support uh
 
05:21:42.070 --> 05:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of whether or not
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
we've had an officer we've had officers
 
05:21:45.070 --> 05:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
get hurt directing traffic but I'm not
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
sure if it was out of detail it might
 
05:21:48.190 --> 05:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
have been out an accident um so
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%

Manion thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
committee for the record representative
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
Dennis Manion I represent Salem Rock 25
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in opposition of this
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill um the part I want to speak about
 
05:23:02.110 --> 05:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
is line 10 which I I think we've some
 
05:23:04.750 --> 05:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
people have discussed already
 
05:23:06.670 --> 05:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
municipality it's not clear who's going
 
05:23:08.110 --> 05:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions whether it's the
 
05:23:08.120 --> 05:23:09.190 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions whether it's the
select

05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
select
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
the Town Council the mayor or the police
 
05:23:15.470 --> 05:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
chief or whatnot so I can tell you that
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
most details 90% of the details that are
 
05:23:21.310 --> 05:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
filled are for like power companies or
 
05:23:22.750 --> 05:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
tree companies and they usually filled
 
05:23:24.030 --> 05:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
the night before so they'll call in and
 
05:23:25.708 --> 05:23:25.718 align:start position:0%
say we need two offices for tomorrow and
 
05:23:27.628 --> 05:23:27.638 align:start position:0%
that could be done there could be three
 
05:23:30.070 --> 05:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
or four of those requests a night to be
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
filled for the next day they could start
 
05:23:35.070 --> 05:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
at 67 or 8 in the morning so if we need
 
05:23:37.708 --> 05:23:37.718 align:start position:0%
to convene the board of Selectmen every
 
05:23:37.718 --> 05:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
to convene the board of Selectmen every
evening

05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
evening
 
05:23:41.750 --> 05:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
when someone calls in for a detail to
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
have them vote whether or not it's going
 
05:23:46.110 --> 05:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
to be uh for a flagger or for police
 
05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
offices that's going to take a lot of
 
05:23:50.430 --> 05:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
time so I'm I'm talking and sometimes
 
05:23:52.030 --> 05:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
like now cities like Nashua they could
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
have 20 or 30 of these details being
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
called in a night do we convene the
 
05:23:58.590 --> 05:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen every single time so
 
05:24:00.510 --> 05:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
that they can vote as to whether or not
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
a police officer is required on this
 
05:24:03.868 --> 05:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
thing I just I just think we should
 
05:24:05.670 --> 05:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the police chief where
 
05:24:09.070 --> 05:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
his authority uh lies in statute to
 
05:24:11.430 --> 05:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
dictate the public safety of the town
 
05:24:12.910 --> 05:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
and and leave it at
 
05:24:17.548 --> 05:24:17.558 align:start position:0%
that thank you questions representative
 
05:24:19.628 --> 05:24:19.638 align:start position:0%

for representative for taking my
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
question do you know of any
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
other area of New Hampshire law that
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
requires a select board vote on whether
 
05:24:34.990 --> 05:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
to employ uniformed officers in a
 
05:24:36.990 --> 05:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
particular situation or not I'm not
 
05:24:38.670 --> 05:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
aware of any law and statute that do
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:48.470 --> 05:24:48.480 align:start position:0%

representative Manion for coming to our
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee do you do you think that um
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of police know better safety
 
05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
issues than the board of Selectmen when
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to stuff like this 100%
 
05:25:07.990 --> 05:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's why they're appointed is they the
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of Public Safety in
 
05:25:09.440 --> 05:25:11.990 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of Public Safety in
the

05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:14.510 --> 05:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
town further
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Guthry thank
 
05:25:20.670 --> 05:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and I'll very quickly uh
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure the I know the answer
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
but do you I asked it earlier I think
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
that Salem has a contract their Union
 
05:25:29.548 --> 05:25:29.558 align:start position:0%
they have a union for their police
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
officers you know how many uh cities and
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
towns have a
 
05:25:37.590 --> 05:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
relationship uh union relationship with
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
a contract that covers this matter and
 
05:25:44.670 --> 05:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
has been work working in in always been
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
never been a really a problem yeah as
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
far as the the union and the contract uh
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
writing which would be the board of
 
05:25:55.788 --> 05:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
Select yes so I would say most towns do
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
I know uh in my experience I worked in
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement for many years and every
 
05:26:01.948 --> 05:26:01.958 align:start position:0%
town that I worked for had a contract um
 
05:26:03.910 --> 05:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
that governed
 
05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
questions rep I'm sorry that's all right
 
05:26:15.868 --> 05:26:15.878 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald I don't know if you
 
05:26:17.510 --> 05:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
can answer this for me not but as I
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
recall there there's an hours say that
 
05:26:21.788 --> 05:26:21.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow the selectman to tell the
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
chief how to run his Department would
 
05:26:26.310 --> 05:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
this conflict with that it would the
 
05:26:27.990 --> 05:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
police the police there is a statute
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
that says the police chief has authority
 
05:26:32.910 --> 05:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
over Public Safety in any town or city
 
05:26:36.868 --> 05:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
any representative FR thank you uh
 
05:26:39.390 --> 05:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know if you know
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
the answer to this or not but um can you
 
05:26:47.990 --> 05:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
inform us the relative difference in
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
cost to say a tree contractor or a
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
Paving Company to hire a uniformed
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
officer versus a certified and trained
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
Flagger I do not know the cost um
 
05:27:05.548 --> 05:27:05.558 align:start position:0%
difference however I could say on times
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
I have worked with flaggers I've seen
 
05:27:09.788 --> 05:27:09.798 align:start position:0%
them throw signs on on hoods of cars
 
05:27:11.230 --> 05:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
I've heard them talking about women
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
driving by on their radios and I've seen
 
05:27:15.868 --> 05:27:15.878 align:start position:0%
some of them had that have had a
 
05:27:17.470 --> 05:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
warrants and they've been arrested on
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
experience for the questions
 
05:27:25.990 --> 05:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative Elward you look like you
 
05:27:27.628 --> 05:27:27.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I just want to clarify
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're saying that um flaggers are not
 
05:27:33.628 --> 05:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
required to pass a criminal background
 
05:27:35.910 --> 05:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
check I'm not aware of that if they are
 
05:27:37.708 --> 05:27:37.718 align:start position:0%
or not but whether they have a criminal
 
05:27:41.230 --> 05:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
background Checker not doesn't they can
 
05:27:42.868 --> 05:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
have a warrant for something but not
 
05:27:45.030 --> 05:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
have a criminal history so it wouldn't
 
05:27:49.708 --> 05:27:49.718 align:start position:0%
come up I understand thank you further
 
05:27:52.270 --> 05:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have a single
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
question for your representative uh you
 
05:27:56.910 --> 05:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
seem to imply
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
that each time
 
05:28:02.150 --> 05:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
flaggers or uniform police officers
 
05:28:03.868 --> 05:28:03.878 align:start position:0%
would need to be used that they would
 
05:28:07.230 --> 05:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
require a vote of the Selectmen where
 
05:28:10.270 --> 05:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
that was a scenario because in line 10
 
05:28:13.110 --> 05:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
municipality is not defined does that
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
mean the board of Selectmen and if a
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
detail comes in at 10:00 at night for
 
05:28:19.150 --> 05:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
the next day for Liberty Utilities do
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
they have to decide whether a police
 
05:28:23.230 --> 05:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
officer is used or not or does the
 
05:28:26.110 --> 05:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor on duty to decide that that
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
was my
 
05:28:31.230 --> 05:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
scenario correct but is it your belief
 
05:28:34.510 --> 05:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
that a vote would be required for each
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
time a police detail is required
 
05:28:40.350 --> 05:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
it certainly could be interpreted that
 
05:28:42.868 --> 05:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
way thank
 
05:28:46.310 --> 05:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony I don't believe
 
05:28:52.590 --> 05:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
we have any more pin cards or do we we
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
done with this one I have no more than
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go ahead and close the hearing
 
05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
on oh did you still want to acknowledge
 
05:29:01.470 --> 05:29:01.480 align:start position:0%

9 um so the bill before you today is uh
 
05:30:33.390 --> 05:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1053 and I've also passed
 
05:30:35.230 --> 05:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
around an amendment that just makes a
 
05:30:37.390 --> 05:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
couple um edits to the language but
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't change
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
um any major content in the bill uh this
 
05:30:43.350 --> 05:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to address our current
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
housing crisis by allowing for the
 
05:30:47.030 --> 05:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
creation of residential and mixed
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
residential units within any commercial
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
lot whether that be new construction or
 
05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation of existing structures so
 
05:30:56.350 --> 05:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
this bill ensures that these units would
 
05:30:58.670 --> 05:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
be restricted by exist existing local
 
05:31:00.590 --> 05:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines for commercial structures
 
05:31:02.350 --> 05:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
regarding lot Dimension and coverage as
 
05:31:04.548 --> 05:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
well as building high standards and
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
while in this legislature we often defer
 
05:31:09.430 --> 05:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
to local control our housing crisis has
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
reached a level where we cannot wait for
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
changes to be made incrementally on the
 
05:31:16.390 --> 05:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
local level we need broad sweeping
 
05:31:18.150 --> 05:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
zoning reforms that can start to solve
 
05:31:19.510 --> 05:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
this crisis
 
05:31:22.350 --> 05:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
now according to the 2023 annual
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness assessment report from the
 
05:31:25.470 --> 05:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
US Department of Housing and Urban
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
Development homelessness Rose in New
 
05:31:30.430 --> 05:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by 52% which was in the last
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
year which was the highest increase in
 
05:31:34.510 --> 05:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
the nation surpassing New Mexico New
 
05:31:35.590 --> 05:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
York and
 
05:31:37.548 --> 05:31:37.558 align:start position:0%
Colorado according to the New Hampshire
 
05:31:39.868 --> 05:31:39.878 align:start position:0%
real Association the median cost for
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
home purchases has increased every
 
05:31:44.470 --> 05:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
single year since 1998 and the median
 
05:31:46.750 --> 05:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
cost in New Hampshire is now at 470,000
 
05:31:49.750 --> 05:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
which is a 7% increase in cost from just
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
a year ago according to Redfin a
 
05:31:55.470 --> 05:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
national real estate uh brokerage nearly
 
05:31:57.310 --> 05:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
a third of all home purchases in the
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire in 2022 were cash
 
05:32:02.190 --> 05:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
only indicating a clear wealth Gap and
 
05:32:03.788 --> 05:32:03.798 align:start position:0%
who can actually afford to purchase a
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
home at this time then meanwhile
 
05:32:07.510 --> 05:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
according to New Hampshire housing rent
 
05:32:09.990 --> 05:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
in the State increased by 11% in just
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
the last year from my own experience I
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
can tell you that when my husband and I
 
05:32:15.390 --> 05:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
rented our first apartment together it
 
05:32:18.230 --> 05:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
was a 2 half bedroom for $900 a month
 
05:32:20.708 --> 05:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
and when we left 5 years later it was
 
05:32:23.868 --> 05:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
$1,600 without any Inc uh Renovations or
 
05:32:26.430 --> 05:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
improvements being done on the property
 
05:32:28.350 --> 05:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
so the data here is clear the housing
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
crisis is not showing any signs of
 
05:32:31.868 --> 05:32:31.878 align:start position:0%
slowing down and especially not New
 
05:32:33.868 --> 05:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and granite Staters are
 
05:32:36.190 --> 05:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
suffering for it we need to take radical
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
action now to stop this problem getting
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
even worse zoning reforms such as those
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill are an integral
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
part of solving the housing crisis and
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
encouraging new construction which
 
05:32:48.390 --> 05:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
according to the US Commerce department
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
has significantly slowed in New
 
05:32:52.070 --> 05:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and bringing residential units
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
into commercial zones is not only a way
 
05:32:56.750 --> 05:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
to expand the area for potential
 
05:32:59.190 --> 05:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
building but also encourages the kind of
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
building that young people especially
 
05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
want to live in if we mix commercial and
 
05:33:04.990 --> 05:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
residential zones we lower the need for
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
parking minimums encourage walkability
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
and create the kind of communities our
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
state need to thrive um so I'd be happy
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions on the bill but
 
05:33:14.910 --> 05:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple just allowing for
 
05:33:16.670 --> 05:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
residential building within commercial
 
05:33:19.270 --> 05:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
Lots across the state um and I did work
 
05:33:20.948 --> 05:33:20.958 align:start position:0%
with um Folks at New Hampshire Housing
 
05:33:22.910 --> 05:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
and a couple other organizations to um
 
05:33:25.948 --> 05:33:25.958 align:start position:0%
draft this bill but
 
05:33:28.830 --> 05:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh representative
 
05:33:31.030 --> 05:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
major thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:33:33.788 --> 05:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
you for testifying so I'm just curious
 
05:33:36.510 --> 05:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
it says that um in any City town or
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
county in which there are located
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or unincorporated
 
05:33:44.070 --> 05:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
places so it's only in those areas that
 
05:33:44.080 --> 05:33:45.270 align:start position:0%
places so it's only in those areas that
have

05:33:45.270 --> 05:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:33:47.788 --> 05:33:47.798 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places do do I understand
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
that correctly I believe so yeah okay
 
05:33:51.040 --> 05:33:53.670 align:start position:0%
that correctly I believe so yeah okay
thank

05:33:53.670 --> 05:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:33:59.548 --> 05:33:59.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:33:59.558 --> 05:34:01.150 align:start position:0%
questions representative
Gallagher

05:34:01.150 --> 05:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
05:34:05.948 --> 05:34:05.958 align:start position:0%
um was so I'm um looking at the
 
05:34:10.190 --> 05:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and um the original Bill side
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
by side here and um I'm not really quite
 
05:34:16.030 --> 05:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
sure I'm spotting the differences
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
between the two properly so you could
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
you go into a bit more detail about um
 
05:34:23.590 --> 05:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
what exactly the how exactly the
 
05:34:26.510 --> 05:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
amendment differs from the original bill
 
05:34:30.670 --> 05:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
um and why um it honestly is mainly just
 
05:34:32.350 --> 05:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
an effort to make the language a little
 
05:34:34.430 --> 05:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
bit um clearer and it didn't really
 
05:34:36.070 --> 05:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
change too much in terms of like the
 
05:34:38.110 --> 05:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
actual content of the bill but just
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that um the statute
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
was written in as um detailed way as
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
possible while also leaving what we
 
05:34:50.310 --> 05:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.830 --> 05:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances representative
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:34:57.750 --> 05:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um and and thank
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
you for answering the previous question
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
but I didn't really feel like I got an
 
05:35:06.190 --> 05:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
answer sure um if if you could kindly
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
just go through the amendment
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
and show us exactly what is different
 
05:35:12.750 --> 05:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
there than the original that would be
 
05:35:17.070 --> 05:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
really helpful sure um I think um the
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
biggest differences are I included shall
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
allow residential and mixed residential
 
05:35:24.150 --> 05:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
uses instead of I believe the original
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
build had just
 
05:35:28.270 --> 05:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
residential um and included the line
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
around lot coverage and height standards
 
05:35:32.788 --> 05:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
being no more restrictive than those
 
05:35:34.670 --> 05:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
required for commercial
 
05:35:38.788 --> 05:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
structures um added the line
 
05:35:42.868 --> 05:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
um and 10 that shall not require or
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
um uh well there was a line added around
 
05:35:54.510 --> 05:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
shall not require more than one space
 
05:35:56.390 --> 05:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
per dwelling unit when it comes to the
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh parking requirements so that's line
 
05:36:02.510 --> 05:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
seven actually um and then uh the last
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:08.638 --> 05:36:10.230 align:start position:0%

05:36:15.868 --> 05:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
for your testimony representative
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it's a great idea I'm hope
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
I'm quite sure it probably came out of
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
housing but the housing committee
 
05:36:24.430 --> 05:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
somehow or other uh but I have a real
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
problem with matter of
 
05:36:26.520 --> 05:36:28.470 align:start position:0%
problem with matter of
right

05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a selectman in the town and I
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
have a hard time going back to my
 
05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
constituents and say the head of my
 
05:36:38.470 --> 05:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
planning board and said hey he
 
05:36:40.990 --> 05:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
this was a good idea but not only is it
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
a good idea you got to do it so could
 
05:36:47.708 --> 05:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
you talk a little bit why you the board
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
I mean the the bill says matter of right
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
instead of just leaving it out as a
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
May well I mean it says it because OS
 
05:36:59.548 --> 05:36:59.558 align:start position:0%
wrote it that way um I didn't ask for
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
you know the matter of right to be put
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
in there but I think the reason why that
 
05:37:05.270 --> 05:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
language is there is to clarify that
 
05:37:09.548 --> 05:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
this is an intention to change zoning um
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
ordinances like in a Statewide manner
 
05:37:13.628 --> 05:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
instead of District by district and so I
 
05:37:15.548 --> 05:37:15.558 align:start position:0%
think that might be why the language is
 
05:37:17.548 --> 05:37:17.558 align:start position:0%
put that way um which I think is
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
necessary at this stage because of how
 
05:37:22.548 --> 05:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
bad the housing crisis has gotten here
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
in particular that um doing incremental
 
05:37:27.310 --> 05:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
change Community by Community is just
 
05:37:29.470 --> 05:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
not happening in a way that's fast
 
05:37:31.350 --> 05:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
enough to address the
 
05:37:33.910 --> 05:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
issue thank you for your answer thank
 
05:37:36.990 --> 05:37:37.000 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman for and thank you
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um in your
 
05:37:46.830 --> 05:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment you talk about the
 
05:37:49.750 --> 05:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns and unorganized
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
places how many are
 
05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
there do you know that this bill would
 
05:38:00.470 --> 05:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
apply to and has an inventory of the
 
05:38:04.390 --> 05:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
vacant commercial space that meets these
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
parameters have also been identified
 
05:38:09.788 --> 05:38:09.798 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question um to the
 
05:38:12.310 --> 05:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
first part I would say that was um
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
something suggested uh to me that I add
 
05:38:17.390 --> 05:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
by um someone who works in housing and
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
is uh well aware of like the zoning
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
ordinances across the state um so I
 
05:38:25.788 --> 05:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
myself do not know very much about um
 
05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know unincorporated towns or
 
05:38:30.510 --> 05:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
unorganized places and I'm not sure if
 
05:38:32.670 --> 05:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
there has been an assessment done um in
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of vacant commercial
 
05:38:38.350 --> 05:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
lots that would be um
 
05:38:41.070 --> 05:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
you know covered by this bill although I
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
would be happy to look into that and
 
05:38:45.948 --> 05:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:49.030 --> 05:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:38:51.150 --> 05:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
kill thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question and good to see you
 
05:38:56.868 --> 05:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
again um so you know I I I'm thinking in
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
terms of like my commercial District in
 
05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
my town and you know I know where
 
05:39:02.910 --> 05:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
there's some some Lots but I they're
 
05:39:06.190 --> 05:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
next to a rock quy that does blasting
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
and I if if you give a matter of right
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
that some someone can build residential
 
05:39:14.948 --> 05:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
use in that kind of a commercial
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
District do you see that as something
 
05:39:20.468 --> 05:39:20.478 align:start position:0%
that we should do like in that
 
05:39:23.548 --> 05:39:23.558 align:start position:0%
example I mean I personally would argue
 
05:39:26.230 --> 05:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
that in this kind of Market we need
 
05:39:29.070 --> 05:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
housing of all kinds and people can make
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
the choice for themselves whether they
 
05:39:37.948 --> 05:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:37.958 --> 05:39:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:39:40.150 --> 05:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:39:42.910 --> 05:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
fra thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
I have a concern on the density
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
requirement um I can conceive of a
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
situation where the land will not
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
support the prescribed density
 
05:40:03.270 --> 05:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
requirement because of say Wetland or
 
05:40:06.788 --> 05:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
ledge and the density would have to be
 
05:40:06.798 --> 05:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
ledge and the density would have to be
VAR

05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
VAR
 
05:40:11.070 --> 05:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
from your requirement I'm wondering if
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps some different language um might
 
05:40:16.230 --> 05:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
be more
 
05:40:18.230 --> 05:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate you're talking about that
 
05:40:18.240 --> 05:40:19.670 align:start position:0%
appropriate you're talking about that
last

05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:40:23.788 --> 05:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
line I'm referring to the last four
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
lines um starting with the the
 
05:40:29.788 --> 05:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction shall not require a lower
 
05:40:32.390 --> 05:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
density than one unit per two
 
05:40:38.030 --> 05:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
acres uh with on-site well or sewage Etc
 
05:40:40.270 --> 05:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
um you know if the committee I think you
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
all probably know a lot more on this
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
subject than I do and if you found it
 
05:40:44.990 --> 05:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to make an amendment you
 
05:40:46.590 --> 05:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
know I would be supportive of that but I
 
05:40:48.990 --> 05:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
do think that like I said I talked with
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
some experts in the field on this
 
05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
language and this was what they
 
05:40:51.840 --> 05:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
language and this was what they
suggested

05:40:54.150 --> 05:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
05:40:58.750 --> 05:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:00.990 --> 05:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
yella hi thank you thank you for taking
 
05:41:04.270 --> 05:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
the question um are you wedded to this
 
05:41:09.548 --> 05:41:09.558 align:start position:0%
um language uh online for that says in
 
05:41:12.670 --> 05:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
which there are located unincorporated
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
towns and un Incorporated P places if
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
that language was not there um would you
 
05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
still be in favor
 
05:41:26.670 --> 05:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
of this yes thank
 
05:41:29.110 --> 05:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
you representative hi thank you Mr
 
05:41:30.430 --> 05:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
05:41:32.230 --> 05:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate the work you've
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
done to be creative um to solve the
 
05:41:36.910 --> 05:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
housing crisis I I question the experts
 
05:41:39.390 --> 05:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
who talk talk to um were they all
 
05:41:41.910 --> 05:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
housing um Advocates looking to increase
 
05:41:43.030 --> 05:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
the housing
 
05:41:45.910 --> 05:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
Supply um and did that include
 
05:41:48.270 --> 05:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
developers in those
 
05:41:51.270 --> 05:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
experts um I didn't speak to any
 
05:41:52.990 --> 05:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
developers although I will say my mom is
 
05:41:54.670 --> 05:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
a real estate agent and I've picked up a
 
05:41:57.390 --> 05:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
lot of information from her and her work
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
um I generally spoke with people who are
 
05:42:05.070 --> 05:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
examining uh the zoning in the state and
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
how much that is impacting our current
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and like I said the um US
 
05:42:11.788 --> 05:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Commerce has noted that
 
05:42:13.270 --> 05:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
construction new construction in the
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
state has gone down significantly so um
 
05:42:17.070 --> 05:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
I worked with people who are interested
 
05:42:19.990 --> 05:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
in removing barriers to new construction
 
05:42:21.150 --> 05:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
and like you said coming up with
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
Creative Solutions because I I'm in
 
05:42:25.110 --> 05:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester you know there's not a lot of
 
05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
undeveloped land so what else can we do
 
05:42:30.910 --> 05:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:33.788 --> 05:42:33.798 align:start position:0%

mentioned
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester do the current zoning
 
05:42:48.670 --> 05:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
regulations in
 
05:42:50.708 --> 05:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh
 
05:42:54.430 --> 05:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
allow at least in some places the
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
residential to be on a commercial lot
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%

Mr chair thank you for taking yet
 
05:43:08.350 --> 05:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
another question so
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm in Lebanon which is a fairly
 
05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
good-sized City there are a lot of
 
05:43:17.230 --> 05:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
residential units on top of or amongst
 
05:43:17.240 --> 05:43:18.350 align:start position:0%
residential units on top of or amongst
commercial

05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
05:43:21.270 --> 05:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
properties um that is
 
05:43:25.270 --> 05:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
wondering why isn't that happening now
 
05:43:30.788 --> 05:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
why is this bill necessary is it the by
 
05:43:33.110 --> 05:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
right part of the bill that you believe
 
05:43:37.390 --> 05:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
is the necessary part or is is there
 
05:43:39.910 --> 05:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
something else because this is already
 
05:43:42.750 --> 05:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
happening in many of our communities
 
05:43:44.670 --> 05:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that that is the intention
 
05:43:46.868 --> 05:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
you know that it can happen but it is
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
not always happening in every situation
 
05:43:51.390 --> 05:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
that it can happen you I guess I know
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't um the most popular bill
 
05:43:57.270 --> 05:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
but hb44 from last year the way like
 
05:44:00.350 --> 05:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
that was attempting to address zoning in
 
05:44:02.390 --> 05:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
a Statewide manner instead of community
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
by Community is kind of how this bill is
 
05:44:08.548 --> 05:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
functioning as well follow up thank you
 
05:44:10.830 --> 05:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you again do you know of
 
05:44:14.070 --> 05:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
any communities where um residential and
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
Commercial are
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
banned um not off the top of my head now
 
05:44:19.320 --> 05:44:21.150 align:start position:0%
banned um not off the top of my head now
thank

05:44:21.150 --> 05:44:21.160 align:start position:0%

afternoon um thank you for hearing my
 
05:44:50.750 --> 05:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Ben Kramer I live
 
05:44:53.628 --> 05:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
in New Market um I'm supporting HB
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
1053 um I represent New Hampshire youth
 
05:44:57.788 --> 05:44:57.798 align:start position:0%
movement I'm organizing director at New
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth movement um that is an
 
05:45:02.070 --> 05:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
organization with a base of over 100
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated members and more than 5,000
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
supporters ages 15 to 30 across the
 
05:45:09.230 --> 05:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um I'm here to
 
05:45:11.750 --> 05:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of young Granite Staters
 
05:45:13.868 --> 05:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
and as a young renter myself um as I
 
05:45:16.750 --> 05:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
testify in support of this bill um I I
 
05:45:19.230 --> 05:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
think the main thing with this bill is
 
05:45:20.830 --> 05:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
there there's this
 
05:45:23.230 --> 05:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
striking statistic that we need to build
 
05:45:25.468 --> 05:45:25.478 align:start position:0%
20,000 units in two years to keep up
 
05:45:27.190 --> 05:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
with demand in the state we have a major
 
05:45:30.270 --> 05:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
housing shortage and that is a very very
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
large number and this bill takes an
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
important step towards meeting that goal
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
and making this a state wherever one has
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
a home and where people can stay um the
 
05:45:42.510 --> 05:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
housing shortage is is a major issue for
 
05:45:44.350 --> 05:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
all Granite Staters but young people in
 
05:45:46.830 --> 05:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
particular um this is there's a direct
 
05:45:48.750 --> 05:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
correlation between how many young
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
people stay in the States and how easy
 
05:45:52.468 --> 05:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
it is to find suitable affordable
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
housing young people like myself and my
 
05:45:57.230 --> 05:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
members we want to stay in New Hampshire
 
05:45:59.030 --> 05:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
but we simply cannot if we cannot find a
 
05:46:01.948 --> 05:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
suitable place to live um I I think the
 
05:46:03.948 --> 05:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
strength of this bill is fundamentally
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's about cutting red tape and opening
 
05:46:08.430 --> 05:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
the door to the development of Housing
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
close to where people work and where
 
05:46:12.510 --> 05:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
people recreate um especially in New
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's major cities commercial
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
areas are where people want to be it's
 
05:46:18.030 --> 05:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
where their jobs are it's where they
 
05:46:19.548 --> 05:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
grocery shop it's where they grab dinner
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
with friends um and especially recently
 
05:46:23.468 --> 05:46:23.478 align:start position:0%
we've seen major parts of these
 
05:46:25.350 --> 05:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
commercial zones become underutilized
 
05:46:26.990 --> 05:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
due to shifts and you know how we work
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
and do business um and that leaves
 
05:46:31.468 --> 05:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
office spaces industrial parks with a
 
05:46:33.390 --> 05:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
lot of usable space that might be
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
sitting empty in places across the state
 
05:46:38.510 --> 05:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that we need to
 
05:46:40.190 --> 05:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a perfect match
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
here and an opportunity here um and cut
 
05:46:45.270 --> 05:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
the red tape to allow these disused but
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
desirable spaces to be turned into the
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
housing we desperately need um it's a
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
big gap that we have to close I like I I
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
cannot emphasize that enough and I think
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative Murray did a good job of
 
05:46:57.150 --> 05:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
emphasizing that as well um this is a
 
05:46:58.670 --> 05:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
creative solution I think we need all
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
the Creative Solutions at our disposal
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
um to meet the scale of this problem uh
 
05:47:04.948 --> 05:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I would urge the community to
 
05:47:06.468 --> 05:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
support this bill um and takes a step
 
05:47:08.310 --> 05:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
towards New Hampshire a place where
 
05:47:09.868 --> 05:47:09.878 align:start position:0%
everyone has a home they deserve and
 
05:47:12.670 --> 05:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
where young people can make a future for
 
05:47:14.468 --> 05:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
themselves it's important I'm happy to
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
take any questions representative
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:47:22.548 --> 05:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um my
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
question is with regards to the
 
05:47:26.350 --> 05:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
application of this if it were to become
 
05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
law does would this look like um a
 
05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
development where would be live work
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
play or recreate type of developments
 
05:47:38.910 --> 05:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
that we see would or or
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
is or would it be just like a
 
05:47:46.788 --> 05:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
one unit that somebody might choose to
 
05:47:48.990 --> 05:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
construct within a commercial
 
05:47:51.030 --> 05:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
Zone what would that what would this
 
05:47:53.708 --> 05:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
look like yeah I I mean I'm I'm not a
 
05:47:55.948 --> 05:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
developer I'm not a someone who would be
 
05:47:57.390 --> 05:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
you know going out and building units
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
because of this bill um I'm here to you
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
know support the the opportunity I see I
 
05:48:05.430 --> 05:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
think that that's like a a decisions
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
that are ultimately going to be made by
 
05:48:09.468 --> 05:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
the people who are envisioning the pro
 
05:48:10.590 --> 05:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
the projects that would be possible
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill um I think in general
 
05:48:17.070 --> 05:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
you know opening the door for Living
 
05:48:19.510 --> 05:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions like that is is what we need
 
05:48:22.390 --> 05:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
um with the problem that we face now
 
05:48:24.510 --> 05:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
05:48:26.430 --> 05:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here taking
 
05:48:28.510 --> 05:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
the question could when you respond
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
could you remind me of your
 
05:48:33.750 --> 05:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
organization um my question is and I was
 
05:48:35.390 --> 05:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to ask a representative this but I
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
saved it for you um
 
05:48:42.628 --> 05:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
do you think that this legislation
 
05:48:46.110 --> 05:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
will take the burden off of larger
 
05:48:50.628 --> 05:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities cities um and share it
 
05:48:52.110 --> 05:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
more with the other municipalities
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
around the state in smaller
 
05:48:57.030 --> 05:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
towns I see what you're saying um the
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
the organization is New Hampshire youth
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
movement um to the first part of your
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
question um and I I think if I
 
05:49:07.510 --> 05:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
understand your question correctly
 
05:49:08.948 --> 05:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
I would say yes and I think that's part
 
05:49:13.468 --> 05:49:13.478 align:start position:0%
of the appeal here is this opens the
 
05:49:13.478 --> 05:49:15.390 align:start position:0%
of the appeal here is this opens the
door

05:49:15.390 --> 05:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
door
 
05:49:18.150 --> 05:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
to to to not have you know every person
 
05:49:19.830 --> 05:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
just looking for where is rent on
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
average the cheapest we're going to
 
05:49:24.310 --> 05:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
flock there and to be able to to build
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
in more cities to be able to build up
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
more desirable communities that people
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
want to move to to to lower rent in
 
05:49:32.070 --> 05:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
other places and and have more options
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
than other places I I think that is if I
 
05:49:35.310 --> 05:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
understand what you mean by like
 
05:49:37.468 --> 05:49:37.478 align:start position:0%
spreading the burden out um I think that
 
05:49:40.548 --> 05:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
is a part of the appeal of this bill um
 
05:49:43.628 --> 05:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
yeah representative kill thank you Mr
 
05:49:45.190 --> 05:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:49:48.110 --> 05:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
do you so do you see this as a tool to
 
05:49:51.190 --> 05:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
um take like say an abandoned commercial
 
05:49:52.910 --> 05:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
project or something that's been bacon
 
05:49:55.390 --> 05:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
for a long time and but as a matter of
 
05:49:57.110 --> 05:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
right then maybe turned it into
 
05:49:59.190 --> 05:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
Apartments is that is that what the goal
 
05:50:02.150 --> 05:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
of this type yeah I I mean again I'm not
 
05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
a I'm not a housing expert or policy
 
05:50:06.468 --> 05:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
zoning expert but I think that would be
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
a a part of the the vision of the things
 
05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to do in the state
 
05:50:13.390 --> 05:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
to meet the the level of the this huge
 
05:50:15.628 --> 05:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
gap that we have to fill is what exactly
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
what you just described looking at
 
05:50:19.868 --> 05:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
disused and underutilized spaces and and
 
05:50:21.230 --> 05:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
how can we make those places where
 
05:50:23.590 --> 05:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
people can live and have a decent home
 
05:50:23.600 --> 05:50:26.590 align:start position:0%
people can live and have a decent home
um

05:50:26.590 --> 05:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:30.110 --> 05:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah representative uh
 
05:50:35.390 --> 05:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
F thank you Mr chair um in my town of
 
05:50:40.510 --> 05:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
Enfield we we had a case where a
 
05:50:44.830 --> 05:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
apartment well where a uh building owner
 
05:50:46.070 --> 05:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
who had
 
05:50:50.468 --> 05:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
commercial uh retail or office space
 
05:50:53.270 --> 05:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
found it more attractive from a
 
05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
financial point of view to break that up
 
05:50:58.390 --> 05:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
and rent it out as
 
05:51:03.230 --> 05:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
Apartments is um shall I call it
 
05:51:07.310 --> 05:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
deterioration of a commercial District a
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
possible unintended consequence of this
 
05:51:15.670 --> 05:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill um could could you repeat the last
 
05:51:16.830 --> 05:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
part of that question I'm not sure I
 
05:51:23.070 --> 05:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
understand okay um my question is um if
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
a the owner of a commercial property
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
decided that it was
 
05:51:33.708 --> 05:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
more economically attractive to him or
 
05:51:37.830 --> 05:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
her to discont continue the commercial
 
05:51:43.310 --> 05:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
use of the building and convert it into
 
05:51:46.990 --> 05:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
housing that would eliminate some
 
05:51:49.150 --> 05:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
commercial space in town which might
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
have been the hardware store or a
 
05:51:53.590 --> 05:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant or whatever I see what you're
 
05:51:56.830 --> 05:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
saying do you see do you see this bill
 
05:52:00.990 --> 05:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
as possibly opening up a Pandora's box
 
05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
of unintended
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
consequences well I I think what I would
 
05:52:07.468 --> 05:52:07.478 align:start position:0%
say in that scenario is that the the
 
05:52:09.948 --> 05:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
incentives are the incentives and the
 
05:52:10.990 --> 05:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
you know what is going to be the most
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
profitable for the owner of that space
 
05:52:15.310 --> 05:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
is is going to remain unchanged um
 
05:52:17.788 --> 05:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know they there
 
05:52:19.270 --> 05:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
exists a bunch of red tape for them
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
changing it or or not um and I
 
05:52:27.750 --> 05:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
think the you know those are decisions
 
05:52:29.548 --> 05:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
that ultimately property owners are
 
05:52:32.468 --> 05:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
going to make whether or not regardless
 
05:52:34.110 --> 05:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
of the the specifics of the zoning in
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
the state um or in their particular
 
05:52:39.548 --> 05:52:39.558 align:start position:0%
and I think um you know
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
prioritizing the the obvious need that
 
05:52:44.190 --> 05:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
we have in the state is for houses for
 
05:52:48.190 --> 05:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
people um I think that problem exists
 
05:52:50.590 --> 05:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
regardless that problem exists no matter
 
05:52:53.788 --> 05:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
what we do um and I think that is a is a
 
05:52:55.270 --> 05:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
very strong incentive and it's something
 
05:52:56.788 --> 05:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
that worth prioritizing you know people
 
05:52:59.628 --> 05:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
need houses in the states yeah thank you
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
05:53:04.990 --> 05:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
we thank you thank you for taking the
 
05:53:09.030 --> 05:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:13.708 --> 05:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
in the past there has been a sentiment
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
that commercial activities should be
 
05:53:19.230 --> 05:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
over on this part of town and
 
05:53:21.310 --> 05:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
residential should be over here and it
 
05:53:23.708 --> 05:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
should be segregated and you and this
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
has led to like you know you you stay in
 
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
one part of town and you have to drive
 
05:53:30.390 --> 05:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
all the way across town to go to work
 
05:53:32.948 --> 05:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
and then drive to go get your groceries
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that um since you
 
05:53:36.788 --> 05:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
represent a lot of young people do you
 
05:53:39.270 --> 05:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
think that that sentiment of like it
 
05:53:41.990 --> 05:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be in different parts of the town
 
05:53:44.868 --> 05:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
or the city or the state um has is kind
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
of antiquated and now um actually the
 
05:53:50.708 --> 05:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
the people young people like you
 
05:53:53.390 --> 05:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
represent actually would prefer their
 
05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
prop their location their habitation to
 
05:54:00.030 --> 05:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
be in very short uh you know proximity
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
to where they work and where they uh
 
05:54:05.310 --> 05:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
shop yeah I I think that is desirable
 
05:54:07.670 --> 05:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people um and especially
 
05:54:10.390 --> 05:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know folks myself and young people
 
05:54:13.150 --> 05:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
um I think the you I don't think anyone
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
likes you know a long commute to work um
 
05:54:20.468 --> 05:54:20.478 align:start position:0%
I I would say too that the the need to
 
05:54:23.708 --> 05:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
have anywhere suitable to live is
 
05:54:26.910 --> 05:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
overriding you know is is immense um for
 
05:54:28.910 --> 05:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
people in the states and I think that is
 
05:54:31.868 --> 05:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
like an extra it is it is a bonus of
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
like this creates particularly desirable
 
05:54:36.590 --> 05:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
housing and it creates like young people
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
cannot find houses in general you know
 
05:54:41.310 --> 05:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
within hours of their work um so I think
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is a deep need as well yeah
 
05:54:46.750 --> 05:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
represent priest sorry uh thank you for
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
05:54:52.030 --> 05:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
being here do you really believe that
 
05:54:56.110 --> 05:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
young people are going to live in
 
05:54:58.830 --> 05:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
abandoned commercial areas in
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns and unorganized
 
05:55:04.590 --> 05:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
places and drive hours to their places
 
05:55:08.510 --> 05:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
of work in Manchester the Sea Coast and
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
and other
 
05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
environments yeah well I I think under
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill the whole point is that those
 
05:55:15.150 --> 05:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
those places would no longer be
 
05:55:16.910 --> 05:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
abandoned they would be able to be
 
05:55:18.788 --> 05:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
revitalized and turned into suitable
 
05:55:21.070 --> 05:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
homes for people um and I think that's a
 
05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's a vision worth supporting is is
 
05:55:25.750 --> 05:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
using underutilize and disuse space like
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
you described as um bringing breathing
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
new life into it um and I think that
 
05:55:34.830 --> 05:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
that that is the the opportunity I see
 
05:55:36.910 --> 05:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill and I think that that is a
 
05:55:39.750 --> 05:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
a vision that I know my membership young
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
people in the state certainly support
 
05:55:46.750 --> 05:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
yeah representative St uh go ahead
 
05:55:46.760 --> 05:55:47.868 align:start position:0%
yeah representative St uh go ahead
representative

05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:55:50.230 --> 05:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:55:53.350 --> 05:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
for taking another question so I'm
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
sitting here feeling a little
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
embarrassed because I'm searching my
 
05:56:00.270 --> 05:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
memory banks and I'm Googling and I'm
 
05:56:02.910 --> 05:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
looking and looking looking to see where
 
05:56:05.910 --> 05:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law actually prevents this
 
05:56:05.920 --> 05:56:06.750 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law actually prevents this
from

05:56:06.750 --> 05:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
happening and I'm wanting to ask you can
 
05:56:13.788 --> 05:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
you cite chapter in verse of where this
 
05:56:16.510 --> 05:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
is actually forbidden to happen because
 
05:56:19.350 --> 05:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's certainly happening in my city all
 
05:56:23.468 --> 05:56:23.478 align:start position:0%
over the place um there's tons and tons
 
05:56:26.468 --> 05:56:26.478 align:start position:0%
of Residential Properties going up over
 
05:56:28.910 --> 05:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
retail establishments so I'm just trying
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
to find
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
out you know what what is the what is
 
05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
the need here because because
 
05:56:40.350 --> 05:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
that activity is not being allowed and
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm coming up short on and
 
05:56:44.110 --> 05:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
as I say I'm embarrassed that I can't
 
05:56:46.510 --> 05:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
find that I I do not know off the top of
 
05:56:47.910 --> 05:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
my head like I said I'm not a I'm not a
 
05:56:50.070 --> 05:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
zoning policy expert um I know there's
 
05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
other experts in the room and and
 
05:56:52.990 --> 05:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps they might be able to speak to
 
05:56:57.868 --> 05:56:57.878 align:start position:0%
that um I think that this this
 
05:57:02.548 --> 05:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
bill ensures that that is not the case
 
05:57:04.230 --> 05:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that is part of the
 
05:57:04.240 --> 05:57:07.310 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that is part of the
appeal

05:57:07.310 --> 05:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:09.548 --> 05:57:09.558 align:start position:0%
th this bill ensures that that is not
 
05:57:12.670 --> 05:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
the case um I I think that is a that's
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
assurance that we need with a scale of
 
05:57:16.468 --> 05:57:16.478 align:start position:0%
of the problem that we have we need to
 
05:57:18.628 --> 05:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
build 20,000 units in in two years you
 
05:57:21.310 --> 05:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
know I think we need to um to have all
 
05:57:22.708 --> 05:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
the assurance that we can that is
 
05:57:24.590 --> 05:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
possible throughout this state
 
05:57:24.600 --> 05:57:26.350 align:start position:0%
possible throughout this state

05:57:29.230 --> 05:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
lales yes thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:57:31.948 --> 05:57:31.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question as I read
 
05:57:37.230 --> 05:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure what this bill applies
 
05:57:37.240 --> 05:57:38.868 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure what this bill applies
to

05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:57:40.750 --> 05:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
because it
 
05:57:40.760 --> 05:57:42.350 align:start position:0%
because it
says

05:57:42.350 --> 05:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:57:47.548 --> 05:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
um of any City town or county in which
 
05:57:49.590 --> 05:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:57:53.548 --> 05:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or un organized
 
05:57:56.430 --> 05:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
places now I don't
 
05:57:59.868 --> 05:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
know what areas of the State of New
 
05:58:02.750 --> 05:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have those because that's the
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
only ones that it seems that they
 
05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
applies to but more specifically I I've
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
got a A for
 
05:58:12.958 --> 05:58:14.628 align:start position:0%
got a A for
instance

05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
instance
 
05:58:17.948 --> 05:58:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh I know a lot of us know where Brown
 
05:58:20.070 --> 05:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
Avenue is in
 
05:58:23.270 --> 05:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester if as you come off
 
05:58:26.150 --> 05:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
293 and you're going toward the airport
 
05:58:30.230 --> 05:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
down Brown Avenue what do you find it's
 
05:58:35.390 --> 05:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
mainly a a commercial area but you have
 
05:58:38.670 --> 05:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
gas station that have been abandoned for
 
05:58:42.030 --> 05:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
decades that are on that street you have
 
05:58:45.190 --> 05:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
other commercial areas that are
 
05:58:48.350 --> 05:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
abandoned on that you have boarded up
 
05:58:50.230 --> 05:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
houses this
 
05:58:54.670 --> 05:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
is and I don't know why this is maybe
 
05:58:56.590 --> 05:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
there's something there that I don't
 
05:59:01.070 --> 05:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
understand but as you're reading this
 
05:59:03.628 --> 05:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
would that be an area that would be
 
05:59:07.150 --> 05:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
applicable for this do you know the area
 
05:59:10.468 --> 05:59:10.478 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about Brown Avenue no I I
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
don't personally I think I'm if I'm
 
05:59:13.788 --> 05:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
understanding your question right you
 
05:59:15.788 --> 05:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
have a question about the the language
 
05:59:17.548 --> 05:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
is the is the first thing and then the
 
05:59:19.230 --> 05:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
the the specific scenario is the second
 
05:59:21.590 --> 05:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
thing I think to to the language as I
 
05:59:24.868 --> 05:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
read this I I interpret this as City
 
05:59:26.190 --> 05:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
town or county in which there's
 
05:59:28.468 --> 05:59:28.478 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or unorganized
 
05:59:31.390 --> 05:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
places as three distinct and separate
 
05:59:34.510 --> 05:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
categories um I don't know what the
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
grammar term would would would be for
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
that but as three I don't know if
 
05:59:39.948 --> 05:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
Clauses is the right term but you know
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
three distinct um situations in which
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
this would apply
 
05:59:46.948 --> 05:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
um okay and and I would I would leave
 
05:59:49.230 --> 05:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
that to to to perhaps the bill sponsor
 
05:59:50.910 --> 05:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
to to clarify that language if that's
 
05:59:54.150 --> 05:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
necessary I'd like to ask representative
 
05:59:57.110 --> 05:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
priest to go offline with me and explain
 
06:00:02.110 --> 06:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
that to me on Brown no no no no we don't
 
06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:11.628 --> 06:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative question thank you um
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps to clarify the
 
06:00:18.628 --> 06:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
language if you remove the comma after
 
06:00:23.190 --> 06:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
City on line four and inserted the word
 
06:00:27.788 --> 06:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
or so it reads legislative body of a
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
city or town or County or perhaps or a
 
06:00:35.510 --> 06:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
county in which there are located un
 
06:00:38.868 --> 06:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
incorp at towns would that help clarify
 
06:00:38.878 --> 06:00:43.628 align:start position:0%
incorp at towns would that help clarify
the

06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:46.910 --> 06:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
language okay we'll
 
06:00:49.750 --> 06:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
get let's not get
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
into edits
 
06:00:54.868 --> 06:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
or I I believe the intent of this bill
 
06:00:56.830 --> 06:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
is to have those three things as
 
06:00:59.628 --> 06:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
distinct categories not to strictly
 
06:01:02.830 --> 06:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
apply to just unincorporated towns and
 
06:01:04.030 --> 06:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
unorganized places so I think it's a
 
06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
language change it should be addressed
 
06:01:06.670 --> 06:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
if it needs to
 
06:01:06.680 --> 06:01:08.350 align:start position:0%
if it needs to
further

06:01:08.350 --> 06:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative lales could you
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
flick off that mic for me please
 
06:01:19.468 --> 06:01:19.478 align:start position:0%
oh uh seeing none um I I just have one
 
06:01:23.230 --> 06:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
you said you from New Market yes does do
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
the zoning
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh regulations in New Market already
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
allow residential units on a commercial
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
lot I'm not sure um yeah like I said not
 
06:01:37.788 --> 06:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
not a policy expert I think if they if
 
06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
they don't already they ought to um as
 
06:01:42.390 --> 06:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
is the case with uh communities across
 
06:01:42.400 --> 06:01:44.070 align:start position:0%
is the case with uh communities across
the

06:01:44.070 --> 06:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
state thank you further
 
06:01:51.110 --> 06:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:02:01.628 --> 06:02:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:04.030 --> 06:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman good afternoon
 
06:02:06.468 --> 06:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
committee members uh Ben Frost deputy
 
06:02:08.150 --> 06:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
director and chief legal officer for New
 
06:02:10.270 --> 06:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing uh here to speak in
 
06:02:13.430 --> 06:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
support of uh House Bill
 
06:02:18.868 --> 06:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
1053 um I before I talk about um the
 
06:02:20.670 --> 06:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
comments I had in mind I do want to
 
06:02:24.390 --> 06:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
address the some confusion over this uh
 
06:02:27.030 --> 06:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
text bridging lines three and four where
 
06:02:28.430 --> 06:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
it says
 
06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
um legislative body of a city town or
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
county in which there are located
 
06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or unorganized
 
06:02:35.600 --> 06:02:37.350 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or unorganized
places

06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
places
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
um this is if if you
 
06:02:43.070 --> 06:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
change um nothing in this this this
 
06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
amendment let that be it because this is
 
06:02:48.910 --> 06:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
a turn of phrase that occurs innumerable
 
06:02:50.628 --> 06:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
times in the Planning and Zoning
 
06:02:53.230 --> 06:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
statutes and I think you would have a um
 
06:02:56.350 --> 06:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
knockdown drag out with u the um
 
06:02:59.390 --> 06:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
drafting Attorneys at OLS because that
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
is a phrase and prior speaker is correct
 
06:03:05.070 --> 06:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
in in noting that this is um three
 
06:03:06.468 --> 06:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
distinct things
 
06:03:10.628 --> 06:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
cities towns and a county in which there
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
are these unincorporated places
 
06:03:14.830 --> 06:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
specifically that's referring to Kos
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
County uh which uh has a County planning
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
board that has a planning Administration
 
06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
over the unincorporated places in Coos
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
County uh so that's what is intended by
 
06:03:31.590 --> 06:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh that phrase to the uh the substance
 
06:03:34.628 --> 06:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
of the legislation um representative
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
yella earlier talked about the the
 
06:03:40.750 --> 06:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
separation of uses and this really goes
 
06:03:44.190 --> 06:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
back to the origins of zoning um in the
 
06:03:44.200 --> 06:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
back to the origins of zoning um in the
1920s

06:03:45.750 --> 06:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
1920s
 
06:03:48.350 --> 06:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
really uh when the US Department of
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
Commerce promulgated a standard State
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
zoning enabling act uh and that became
 
06:03:57.350 --> 06:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
the model for uh Most states to
 
06:03:59.868 --> 06:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
establish uh their zoning enabling acts
 
06:04:02.390 --> 06:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire included uh the the final
 
06:04:04.628 --> 06:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
model was uh put out by the Department
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
of Commerce in 1926 New Hampshire
 
06:04:08.548 --> 06:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
actually adop based its zoning enabling
 
06:04:11.868 --> 06:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
act on a slightly earlier version 1925
 
06:04:14.750 --> 06:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
but the the differences are not Material
 
06:04:17.910 --> 06:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
here uh so since that time New Hampshire
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
has enabled its municipalities to adopt
 
06:04:25.070 --> 06:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
zoning and included in that idea is the
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
separation of incompatible uses this is
 
06:04:31.990 --> 06:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
what we know as ukian zoning uh ukian
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
being a reference to a US Supreme Court
 
06:04:39.510 --> 06:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
case uclid uh Amer realy versus uid Ohio
 
06:04:41.590 --> 06:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh which upheld a
 
06:04:44.750 --> 06:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
municipality's uh police Power Authority
 
06:04:47.788 --> 06:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
to engage in zoning the separation of
 
06:04:49.868 --> 06:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
so-called incompatible uses so this is
 
06:04:52.390 --> 06:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
something we've acknowledged uh for a
 
06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
long time almost 100 years now uh as uh
 
06:04:59.190 --> 06:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
being within a municipal capacity or in
 
06:05:01.948 --> 06:05:01.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as we a Dyan rule state
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
not a home rule state a state power that
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
is delegated to municipalities
 
06:05:10.030 --> 06:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
um but the issue of of separation of
 
06:05:13.590 --> 06:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
uses is something that you might say uh
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
just because you can do it doesn't
 
06:05:17.430 --> 06:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean it is in all instances
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
a good idea uh and this is something
 
06:05:23.670 --> 06:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
that over the years especially recently
 
06:05:27.230 --> 06:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh we have begun to discover that uh the
 
06:05:30.590 --> 06:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh holding hard and fast to separation
 
06:05:34.510 --> 06:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
of uses is not necessarily a good thing
 
06:05:36.150 --> 06:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh and we discovered this
 
06:05:38.750 --> 06:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh here in New Hampshire well one of the
 
06:05:40.948 --> 06:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
discoveries was with Municipal
 
06:05:42.670 --> 06:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
implementation of the workforce housing
 
06:05:44.510 --> 06:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
law which was adopted by the legislature
 
06:05:48.830 --> 06:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
in 2008 and some communities said okay
 
06:05:50.190 --> 06:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
we'll do what we have to but we're going
 
06:05:52.788 --> 06:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
to relegate the workforce housing to
 
06:05:57.150 --> 06:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
these commercial zones over there and to
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh their surprise perhaps not to
 
06:06:01.430 --> 06:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
everyone's surprise it actually worked
 
06:06:03.910 --> 06:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
so you have these residential uses being
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
built in commercial zones and uh they
 
06:06:10.270 --> 06:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
are not in fact incompatible uh they do
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
in fact uh mutually support each other
 
06:06:16.910 --> 06:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
so having people living in commercial
 
06:06:18.270 --> 06:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
commercial areas I won't call them
 
06:06:20.628 --> 06:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
commercial zones but commercial areas
 
06:06:23.350 --> 06:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
provides eyes on the street security at
 
06:06:27.150 --> 06:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
night people being there around uh what
 
06:06:30.990 --> 06:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be um unsecured uh
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
commercial spaces having activity of
 
06:06:37.670 --> 06:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
people living approximate to commercial
 
06:06:40.030 --> 06:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
uses actually supports the commercial
 
06:06:42.830 --> 06:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
uses uh people who are living closer to
 
06:06:45.270 --> 06:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
those commercial entities are more
 
06:06:47.468 --> 06:06:47.478 align:start position:0%
likely to frequent them because they're
 
06:06:49.830 --> 06:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
there uh so this is something that we
 
06:06:52.390 --> 06:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
have come to realize that we took this
 
06:06:54.788 --> 06:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
idea of separation of uses uh way too
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
far and this legislation seeks to make a
 
06:07:00.430 --> 06:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
partial correction to that I'll note
 
06:07:04.548 --> 06:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
just in closing um I I won't name the
 
06:07:05.868 --> 06:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
town but I'll recount account and
 
06:07:09.390 --> 06:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
experience I had with u a planning board
 
06:07:12.510 --> 06:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
that I was on at the time and there was
 
06:07:15.750 --> 06:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
a proposal for a residential use it was
 
06:07:18.468 --> 06:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
tow houses right up next to a state
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
highway a busy State Highway a lot of
 
06:07:25.548 --> 06:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
Highway noise yes um and another board
 
06:07:28.910 --> 06:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
member asked the question well well who
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
would want to live
 
06:07:34.270 --> 06:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
there and I felt like answering probably
 
06:07:36.070 --> 06:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
someone who could not afford for your
 
06:07:40.270 --> 06:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
big house but for whom this would be
 
06:07:42.628 --> 06:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
affordable and we can deal with the
 
06:07:45.070 --> 06:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
sound uh these are places that are
 
06:07:48.190 --> 06:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
suitable for residential use uh and by
 
06:07:50.590 --> 06:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
the way also generate tax revenue for
 
06:07:52.510 --> 06:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities I'd be happy to take any
 
06:07:54.548 --> 06:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:07:56.750 --> 06:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'll I'll ask
 
06:08:00.590 --> 06:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
you the same question and I think you
 
06:08:02.590 --> 06:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
know perhaps people might be having
 
06:08:04.430 --> 06:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty imagining what the
 
06:08:06.750 --> 06:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
application of this this bill might look
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
like can you point to anything that any
 
06:08:12.590 --> 06:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
type of a such development that that
 
06:08:16.190 --> 06:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
would help us to um imagine or picture
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
what this um what this would look like
 
06:08:20.990 --> 06:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
could it be like an abandoned mall where
 
06:08:24.910 --> 06:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
some apartments might be um put in with
 
06:08:28.030 --> 06:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
a grocery store a movie theater a
 
06:08:31.190 --> 06:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
dentist a hair salon Etc I know that
 
06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
I've traveled to Connecticut and I've
 
06:08:37.468 --> 06:08:37.478 align:start position:0%
seen these these new like developments I
 
06:08:40.390 --> 06:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
think that they might be called um live
 
06:08:45.390 --> 06:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
work play they're like old um fashion
 
06:08:48.510 --> 06:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
like downtown centers where you know
 
06:08:51.310 --> 06:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
there's businesses and and there's um
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know apartments and um Services
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
could you comment on that I'd be happy
 
06:08:59.628 --> 06:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
to and thank you for that question
 
06:09:02.150 --> 06:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative power um a couple of
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
examples um here in New Hampshire uh one
 
06:09:07.510 --> 06:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
is Woodmont Commons and London Dairy the
 
06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
the extraordinarily large development uh
 
06:09:13.628 --> 06:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
probably the largest development um in
 
06:09:15.548 --> 06:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
well at the time it was it was being
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
built uh in in New Hampshire I'd say
 
06:09:21.350 --> 06:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
Tuscan Village is probably larger now um
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
but that's a a mix of uses so that
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's new development uh that is a mix
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
of uses and it's built upon yes live
 
06:09:32.390 --> 06:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
work play or lifestyle uh centers or
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
things like that these are these are
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
sorts of developments that are going up
 
06:09:38.190 --> 06:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
all over the place uh here in conquered
 
06:09:41.430 --> 06:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh plans for the um partial Demolition
 
06:09:43.230 --> 06:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
and reconstruction of the area of the
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
the Steeplegate Mall is going to be both
 
06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial um and and
 
06:09:50.868 --> 06:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
those are those are fairly those are
 
06:09:53.910 --> 06:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
large scale examples but I think if you
 
06:09:57.190 --> 06:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
walk through uh any of your
 
06:10:00.270 --> 06:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
downtowns and just stop and look at the
 
06:10:01.868 --> 06:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
buildings in in the center of the
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
village or the center of the city uh and
 
06:10:06.510 --> 06:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
look at at the building on the street
 
06:10:08.990 --> 06:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
level commercial and then turn your gaze
 
06:10:11.390 --> 06:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
upward and you'll see offices and
 
06:10:14.548 --> 06:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
residential uses too mixes of uses uh
 
06:10:16.990 --> 06:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
certainly appropriate for conversions of
 
06:10:19.430 --> 06:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
abandoned or derel structures as well
 
06:10:22.270 --> 06:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
representative sa thank you Mr chair and
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so this
 
06:10:28.548 --> 06:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
is happening in New Hampshire the kind
 
06:10:32.468 --> 06:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
of development this bill
 
06:10:35.708 --> 06:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
envisions where is the RSA that prevents
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
it from happening that this attempts to
 
06:10:41.070 --> 06:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
solve that is an excellent question
 
06:10:42.830 --> 06:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative stavis and there is no
 
06:10:46.390 --> 06:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
RSA that prevents it from happening uh
 
06:10:52.350 --> 06:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:54.628 --> 06:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
happen representative
 
06:10:57.390 --> 06:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for uh taking
 
06:10:59.948 --> 06:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
the question um I keep on hearing this
 
06:11:03.110 --> 06:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
refrain about where is where uh is this
 
06:11:06.110 --> 06:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to happen can you um kind of put
 
06:11:08.548 --> 06:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
on a different hat and maybe uh talk a
 
06:11:10.990 --> 06:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about the housing map and if
 
06:11:14.310 --> 06:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
this might be uh or the zoning map that
 
06:11:17.708 --> 06:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
you worked on uh and if or zoning Atlas
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
sorry um and if this type
 
06:11:24.468 --> 06:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
of um barring by
 
06:11:29.150 --> 06:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities um might be able to be uh
 
06:11:33.150 --> 06:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh assessed in that zoning
 
06:11:35.390 --> 06:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
Atlas that's a great question
 
06:11:37.590 --> 06:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative yella and just as a point
 
06:11:40.350 --> 06:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
of reference um uh representative is
 
06:11:41.868 --> 06:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
referring to the New Hampshire zoning
 
06:11:43.990 --> 06:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
Atlas you can Google that and check it
 
06:11:46.070 --> 06:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
out yourselves it is a tremendously
 
06:11:49.708 --> 06:11:49.718 align:start position:0%
powerful resource for anyone to use um
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
in the in building the the data behind
 
06:11:57.230 --> 06:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
the zoning Atlas uh which
 
06:11:59.948 --> 06:11:59.958 align:start position:0%
includes something on the order of
 
06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
400,000 data entries um we had to make
 
06:12:07.190 --> 06:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
certain assumptions and certain
 
06:12:09.548 --> 06:12:09.558 align:start position:0%
generalizations so we did look at zones
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
that are primarily residential zones
 
06:12:14.390 --> 06:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
that are primarily commercial I think it
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
is it it is possible to do that sort of
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
analysis but it would would require
 
06:12:21.910 --> 06:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
someone to go into the data pretty deep
 
06:12:24.468 --> 06:12:24.478 align:start position:0%
uh and and parse things out but I think
 
06:12:27.670 --> 06:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's possible but uh it would require a
 
06:12:30.190 --> 06:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
lot of interns
 
06:12:32.110 --> 06:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
probably for the questions
 
06:12:32.120 --> 06:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
probably for the questions
representative

06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
so in online planning circles um there's
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
this meme where people will um put a
 
06:12:49.270 --> 06:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
caption saying um this sort this kind of
 
06:12:51.548 --> 06:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
smart walkable mixed use urbanism is
 
06:12:54.310 --> 06:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
illegal to build in most American cities
 
06:12:56.990 --> 06:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so this kind of um jumping off of rep
 
06:13:01.390 --> 06:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
power's question so would you agree that
 
06:13:05.708 --> 06:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
basically um any image that and um
 
06:13:08.910 --> 06:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
urbanist has bothered to apply that
 
06:13:13.070 --> 06:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
caption 2 online would be an example of
 
06:13:19.270 --> 06:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
um what uh this is this is trying to
 
06:13:22.990 --> 06:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
um or require to be allowed by
 
06:13:25.510 --> 06:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
right yes representative gallager I I
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
think that's a great way of putting it
 
06:13:31.390 --> 06:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
um and and this is consistent
 
06:13:35.670 --> 06:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
with um past observations
 
06:13:39.270 --> 06:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
of our our love for our
 
06:13:42.390 --> 06:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
Villages uh our historic V Villages and
 
06:13:46.590 --> 06:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
our acknowledgement that uh the the
 
06:13:48.990 --> 06:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
zoning in which those Villages are
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
situated would not allow those villages
 
06:13:54.830 --> 06:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
to be built today uh and that includes
 
06:13:57.510 --> 06:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
the mix of commercial and residential
 
06:14:01.430 --> 06:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
uses which is historically appropriate
 
06:14:04.590 --> 06:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh so in in many communities you can't
 
06:14:08.670 --> 06:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:12.190 --> 06:14:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:14.830 --> 06:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing N I have one for you Mr
 
06:14:16.990 --> 06:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
Frost this is going to be further known
 
06:14:19.468 --> 06:14:19.478 align:start position:0%
as representative turkot question a that
 
06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
way I don't have to repeat it time and
 
06:14:21.920 --> 06:14:22.830 align:start position:0%
way I don't have to repeat it time and
time

06:14:22.830 --> 06:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:14:26.030 --> 06:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
again can municipalities already
 
06:14:28.070 --> 06:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish what this bill is attempting
 
06:14:31.030 --> 06:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
to force or compel as you use the word
 
06:14:36.510 --> 06:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:42.628 --> 06:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:45.310 --> 06:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
nhma thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
municipal Association uh we oppose this
 
06:14:50.070 --> 06:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
legislation we we do oppose all
 
06:14:51.750 --> 06:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide land use
 
06:14:54.548 --> 06:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
mandates um I did write a letter um that
 
06:14:56.868 --> 06:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
I uploaded to the website um so you have
 
06:14:59.510 --> 06:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
that um I'm looking at the amendment
 
06:15:02.830 --> 06:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
right now and it is is quite broad
 
06:15:06.350 --> 06:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
um it seems the applic a would be to
 
06:15:08.030 --> 06:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to require things that
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities already do which you can
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
see if you look out the window behind
 
06:15:13.750 --> 06:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
you um because we of course are in
 
06:15:15.910 --> 06:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
downtown conquered where we have mixed
 
06:15:19.230 --> 06:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
residential and commercial use um and we
 
06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
have developments that we've listed tus
 
06:15:23.868 --> 06:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
and Village Etc that that they're doing
 
06:15:29.070 --> 06:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
this already um in the interest of
 
06:15:30.708 --> 06:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
hopefully improving the situation with
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
housing um in my letter I did suggest a
 
06:15:36.990 --> 06:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
potential place all Amendment which was
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
to look at Senate Bill 538 take a couple
 
06:15:44.350 --> 06:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
of sections from there um relative to
 
06:15:47.628 --> 06:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
79e um the community community
 
06:15:51.270 --> 06:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax um relief incentive
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
this is uh a program or a policy put in
 
06:15:57.910 --> 06:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
place by the legislature back in 2006
 
06:16:01.270 --> 06:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's been expanded several times um and
 
06:16:04.350 --> 06:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
what it does is it helps municipalities
 
06:16:06.468 --> 06:16:06.478 align:start position:0%
that are in interested in dealing with
 
06:16:08.868 --> 06:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
some of the abandoned properties that
 
06:16:12.788 --> 06:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
they see uh figure out how to make that
 
06:16:14.708 --> 06:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
economically viable for
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
developers um so what the sections I
 
06:16:20.670 --> 06:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
suggested that you might consider taking
 
06:16:23.948 --> 06:16:23.958 align:start position:0%
from Senate Bill 538 are is that it
 
06:16:27.230 --> 06:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
would expand that option um to include
 
06:16:29.510 --> 06:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
commercial properties you could also
 
06:16:31.788 --> 06:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
include industrial properties um as well
 
06:16:35.350 --> 06:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
as others and the way this may work is
 
06:16:35.360 --> 06:16:36.310 align:start position:0%
as others and the way this may work is
we've

06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
we've
 
06:16:38.990 --> 06:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
seen not so much in New Hampshire
 
06:16:41.030 --> 06:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we're we're the state where they
 
06:16:44.110 --> 06:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
all come but we've seen in larger cities
 
06:16:46.510 --> 06:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
um some of the commercial uses uh
 
06:16:48.590 --> 06:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
decrease as people have been working
 
06:16:52.390 --> 06:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
more from home um or changing uses so
 
06:16:53.670 --> 06:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
one of the questions is well what do we
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
do with those properties if they're no
 
06:16:58.350 --> 06:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
longer viable as commercial uses are
 
06:17:00.030 --> 06:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
there incentives we could put in place
 
06:17:02.788 --> 06:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
to help developers redevelop those um
 
06:17:04.390 --> 06:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's really the Genesis behind that
 
06:17:07.628 --> 06:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
section of that legislation um that may
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
assist because it would provide a local
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
option to provide local incentives to
 
06:17:15.070 --> 06:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
help development occur in already
 
06:17:17.468 --> 06:17:17.478 align:start position:0%
existing buildings um and I think that's
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
a very targeted approach that may be
 
06:17:20.468 --> 06:17:20.478 align:start position:0%
helpful I'm certainly happy to take any
 
06:17:23.150 --> 06:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
questions the Comm may
 
06:17:28.510 --> 06:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
have representative y Kell thank you I I
 
06:17:32.110 --> 06:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh applaud your trying to to to switch
 
06:17:36.868 --> 06:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
this um stick into a carrot uh for
 
06:17:39.270 --> 06:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities however
 
06:17:44.510 --> 06:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um for those um are you aware of
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities um that that the
 
06:17:50.990 --> 06:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
representatives continually ask are bar
 
06:17:54.670 --> 06:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
like you you give examples of of of
 
06:17:58.190 --> 06:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
conquer and Salem and you know do and
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
those places H allow this type of of
 
06:18:06.670 --> 06:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
um uh building and so they would not
 
06:18:10.510 --> 06:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
actually be um negatively impacted by
 
06:18:13.310 --> 06:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation only municipalities
 
06:18:17.990 --> 06:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
like mine that choose to Bar um uh
 
06:18:22.510 --> 06:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
residential from those those uh
 
06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
commercial spaces so are you aware of
 
06:18:31.030 --> 06:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
those and and did you specifically um uh
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
reach out to those those uh
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that already do allow
 
06:18:43.110 --> 06:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
this and were they in opposition to
 
06:18:45.590 --> 06:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
other municipalities taking on that
 
06:18:48.750 --> 06:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
burden also and and not just having to
 
06:18:51.230 --> 06:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
shoulder them themselves or did you not
 
06:18:54.310 --> 06:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
did you just base your comments on the
 
06:18:58.030 --> 06:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:00.510 --> 06:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
principles I believe your question is
 
06:19:03.510 --> 06:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
whether I surveyed members as to their
 
06:19:06.990 --> 06:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:08.548 --> 06:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
on on this
 
06:19:11.468 --> 06:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
specific thing that they some some
 
06:19:13.868 --> 06:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities already allow this and
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is requiring the other
 
06:19:17.468 --> 06:19:17.478 align:start position:0%
municipalities that don't already allow
 
06:19:20.430 --> 06:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
this and if they are in favor of those
 
06:19:22.030 --> 06:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
other municipalities doing the same
 
06:19:24.270 --> 06:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
thing that they are doing or if they are
 
06:19:27.270 --> 06:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
are intended to shoulder that entire
 
06:19:30.750 --> 06:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
burden themselves or if you based your
 
06:19:35.670 --> 06:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
opposition on the actual n nhma um
 
06:19:37.788 --> 06:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
zoning Statewide
 
06:19:41.150 --> 06:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
zoning uh principle instead of actually
 
06:19:44.070 --> 06:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
talking with the with the um members
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
individually well thank you for the
 
06:19:50.310 --> 06:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
question representative yella um uh back
 
06:19:52.910 --> 06:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh a couple years ago uh we did have a
 
06:19:55.230 --> 06:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
policy setting conference that I believe
 
06:19:56.830 --> 06:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
certain members of this committee served
 
06:20:00.070 --> 06:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
on and one of the Committees was uh
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
talked about housing extensively and one
 
06:20:06.110 --> 06:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
of the topics that came up was
 
06:20:08.590 --> 06:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
um what if anything should we do in
 
06:20:10.310 --> 06:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
response to some of the some of the
 
06:20:12.350 --> 06:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
information coming forward about housing
 
06:20:14.628 --> 06:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
shortages um and there was a pretty
 
06:20:17.670 --> 06:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
in-depth conversation about um housing
 
06:20:20.590 --> 06:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
and the role of of municipalities um in
 
06:20:24.510 --> 06:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
that um and after a robust debate U by
 
06:20:26.708 --> 06:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
the members representing their
 
06:20:29.670 --> 06:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities there um that committee
 
06:20:33.190 --> 06:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
recommended some changes um to our
 
06:20:35.150 --> 06:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
policies which then went to our our full
 
06:20:37.750 --> 06:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
body that voted on them so the vast
 
06:20:39.548 --> 06:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
majority of our members present in
 
06:20:42.468 --> 06:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
voting are in support of our existing
 
06:20:45.910 --> 06:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
policy to oppose Statewide land use
 
06:20:47.468 --> 06:20:47.478 align:start position:0%
mandates although I believe there were a
 
06:20:49.650 --> 06:20:49.660 align:start position:0%
few denters among
 
06:20:49.660 --> 06:20:53.708 align:start position:0%
few denters among
[Music]

06:20:53.708 --> 06:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:57.150 --> 06:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
those representative PRI thank you for
 
06:20:59.468 --> 06:20:59.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question and and thank you for
 
06:21:02.750 --> 06:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
being here
 
06:21:06.270 --> 06:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
um with this propos Al I mean I I come
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
from the city of Manchester who has been
 
06:21:10.430 --> 06:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
06:21:14.948 --> 06:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
practice for over 20 years and I know
 
06:21:17.868 --> 06:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
that other cities are doing the same
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
thing the issue that I have a concern
 
06:21:26.110 --> 06:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
about is those commercial areas that are
 
06:21:31.270 --> 06:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:35.510 --> 06:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
uses and with this legislation you're
 
06:21:39.310 --> 06:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
mandating communities to put residential
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
in these areas that may not be
 
06:21:45.390 --> 06:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate for Human
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:52.670 --> 06:21:52.680 align:start position:0%

06:22:48.070 --> 06:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
that a lot of young people face in our
 
06:22:50.310 --> 06:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
state there's just not enough housing
 
06:22:52.350 --> 06:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
for all of us in fact I think as
 
06:22:55.948 --> 06:22:55.958 align:start position:0%
previously uh previously mentioned um a
 
06:22:57.628 --> 06:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
report from NH housing shows that we
 
06:23:00.030 --> 06:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
need 20,000 more uh units in the next
 
06:23:03.190 --> 06:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
two years to accommodate our growth on
 
06:23:04.948 --> 06:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
top of that thousands of grite State ERS
 
06:23:06.510 --> 06:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
are struggling to pay their property
 
06:23:08.510 --> 06:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
taxes buy a home pay their rent or find
 
06:23:09.868 --> 06:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
a place to live at
 
06:23:12.110 --> 06:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
all allowing housing to be built in
 
06:23:14.310 --> 06:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
commercial areas is just one important
 
06:23:16.548 --> 06:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
step toward addressing this crisis
 
06:23:18.910 --> 06:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
passing HB 1053 would make it easier for
 
06:23:20.788 --> 06:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
developers to build housing and it
 
06:23:22.750 --> 06:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
promotes efficient land use and
 
06:23:25.150 --> 06:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure these are things that we
 
06:23:27.310 --> 06:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
need this bill doesn't just affect the
 
06:23:29.430 --> 06:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
amount of housing available though it
 
06:23:31.430 --> 06:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
would also have a a positive impact in
 
06:23:33.910 --> 06:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
the municipalities themselves mixed use
 
06:23:35.230 --> 06:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
housing andc encourages investment in
 
06:23:37.110 --> 06:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
local businesses reduces traffic
 
06:23:39.750 --> 06:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
congestion um and it builds a sense of
 
06:23:41.548 --> 06:23:41.558 align:start position:0%
community another Pro with this
 
06:23:43.270 --> 06:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
legislation is people could be closer to
 
06:23:45.468 --> 06:23:45.478 align:start position:0%
their jobs many young people struggle
 
06:23:47.628 --> 06:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
with finding reliable transportation and
 
06:23:49.468 --> 06:23:49.478 align:start position:0%
that is a huge barrier to finding
 
06:23:51.628 --> 06:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
employment this bill also addresses this
 
06:23:53.468 --> 06:23:53.478 align:start position:0%
issue transportation is no longer an
 
06:23:55.030 --> 06:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
issue if your job is within walking
 
06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
distance of your
 
06:23:58.590 --> 06:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
home also to address some questions that
 
06:24:00.670 --> 06:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
have come up um I don't think the point
 
06:24:02.070 --> 06:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill is that it's currently
 
06:24:03.868 --> 06:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
against law but rather it removes the
 
06:24:05.830 --> 06:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
red tape on the municipal level that
 
06:24:08.708 --> 06:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
hinders uh new construction by requiring
 
06:24:10.868 --> 06:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
multiple layers of
 
06:24:13.190 --> 06:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
approval to summarize this bill tackles
 
06:24:14.948 --> 06:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
a myriad of issues Granite Staters are
 
06:24:16.990 --> 06:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
are facing simply by allowing developers
 
06:24:19.270 --> 06:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
to build housing and empty buildings and
 
06:24:21.270 --> 06:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
land the housing crisis in New Hampshire
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
is dire I urge you to take a step
 
06:24:25.310 --> 06:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
forward to a step towards fixing this
 
06:24:27.230 --> 06:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
crisis and support HB
 
06:24:28.990 --> 06:24:29.000 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro County District 36 to begin
 
06:26:27.990 --> 06:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was filed upon the request of
 
06:26:28.000 --> 06:26:30.030 align:start position:0%
this bill was filed upon the request of
numerous

06:26:30.030 --> 06:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
06:26:33.230 --> 06:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
constituents as well as Citizens this is
 
06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
a simple straight forward Bill the
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to amend the
 
06:26:39.830 --> 06:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
method to adopt the official ballot
 
06:26:42.788 --> 06:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
referendum form of town meeting commonly
 
06:26:44.948 --> 06:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
known and referred to
 
06:26:49.548 --> 06:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
asb2 in 1995 when SP2 became law almost
 
06:26:52.430 --> 06:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
30 years ago the legislature in its
 
06:26:56.110 --> 06:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
wisdom placed the question to adopt sb2
 
06:26:58.948 --> 06:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
on the official ballot this meant that
 
06:27:02.070 --> 06:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
voters were able to vote on the question
 
06:27:06.510 --> 06:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
to adopt sb2 at the poll on Election Day
 
06:27:08.510 --> 06:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
additionally according to information
 
06:27:12.070 --> 06:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
that I obtained from the Dr website as
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
of December 2019 152 political
 
06:27:19.590 --> 06:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
subdivisions have adopted theb2 form of
 
06:27:23.590 --> 06:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
meeting that is 71 towns and 81 school
 
06:27:27.670 --> 06:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
districts now in 2019 a bill was signed
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
into law which removed the question to
 
06:27:34.590 --> 06:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
adopt sb2 from the official ballot and
 
06:27:38.110 --> 06:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
instead required that the question to
 
06:27:41.190 --> 06:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
adopt was to be voted on at the
 
06:27:43.190 --> 06:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting or School
 
06:27:45.990 --> 06:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
District meeting since the law was
 
06:27:49.030 --> 06:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
changed beginning in 2020 there have
 
06:27:52.070 --> 06:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
been a total of 32 Warren articles
 
06:27:54.948 --> 06:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
proposed to adopt
 
06:27:58.990 --> 06:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
sb2 31 of those proposals have failed
 
06:28:01.708 --> 06:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
and only one proposal resulted in the
 
06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
adoption of SP2 and that was Nottingham
 
06:28:04.798 --> 06:28:05.948 align:start position:0%
adoption of SP2 and that was Nottingham
in

06:28:05.948 --> 06:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:28:09.070 --> 06:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
2020 additionally to date I have found
 
06:28:12.510 --> 06:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
12 municipalities and Counting because
 
06:28:15.310 --> 06:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
not all warrants have been posted to the
 
06:28:15.320 --> 06:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
not all warrants have been posted to the
um

06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:20.390 --> 06:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
internet so I found 12 municipalities
 
06:28:24.030 --> 06:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
that have SP2 adoptions on their 2024
 
06:28:26.590 --> 06:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
warrants which will be voted upon at the
 
06:28:29.468 --> 06:28:29.478 align:start position:0%
upcoming um annual meetings typically
 
06:28:32.548 --> 06:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
held in March Mr chairman it is clear to
 
06:28:35.468 --> 06:28:35.478 align:start position:0%
me that SP2 has been handcuffed by the
 
06:28:38.310 --> 06:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary change in statute that was
 
06:28:39.350 --> 06:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
made in
 
06:28:42.350 --> 06:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
2019 I find this to be a serious problem
 
06:28:43.670 --> 06:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
that must be addressed by the
 
06:28:45.868 --> 06:28:45.878 align:start position:0%
legislature and that's why I filed this
 
06:28:49.750 --> 06:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill before you House Bill 1175 simply
 
06:28:53.030 --> 06:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
places the question to adopt s SP2 back
 
06:28:55.948 --> 06:28:55.958 align:start position:0%
onto the official ballot enabling voters
 
06:28:59.390 --> 06:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
to vote on the question to adopt sb2 at
 
06:29:01.830 --> 06:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
the polls instead of the traditional
 
06:29:04.750 --> 06:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
town meeting as the legislature deemed
 
06:29:06.510 --> 06:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate 30 years
 
06:29:09.868 --> 06:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
ago moreover this bill undoes
 
06:29:13.510 --> 06:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
inequitable standards caused by the 2019
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
um bill and the subsequent change in the
 
06:29:21.628 --> 06:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
law inexplicably the 2019 Bill kept the
 
06:29:25.070 --> 06:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
question to resend SP SP2 on the
 
06:29:27.350 --> 06:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
official ballot while moving the
 
06:29:28.990 --> 06:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
question to
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
adopt SP2 to the traditional town
 
06:29:34.590 --> 06:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
meeting that's where it voted upon
 
06:29:37.310 --> 06:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make any sense by placing
 
06:29:39.990 --> 06:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
the question to adopt SP2 back onto the
 
06:29:43.548 --> 06:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
official ballot the method to adopt SP2
 
06:29:46.430 --> 06:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
is the same as the method to resend
 
06:29:49.310 --> 06:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
finally a few important things to note
 
06:29:51.230 --> 06:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
first it's important to understand that
 
06:29:54.628 --> 06:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
per RSA a public hearing is
 
06:29:57.708 --> 06:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
required whenever SP2 appears on a
 
06:29:59.670 --> 06:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
warrant in fact in multi- toown
 
06:30:01.548 --> 06:30:01.558 align:start position:0%
districts such as a Cooperative School
 
06:30:01.558 --> 06:30:02.948 align:start position:0%
districts such as a Cooperative School
District

06:30:02.948 --> 06:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
District
 
06:30:05.830 --> 06:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
hearings need to be held
 
06:30:08.150 --> 06:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
in in each
 
06:30:11.030 --> 06:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
town in that Cooperative School District
 
06:30:13.030 --> 06:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
on different days and the hearings are
 
06:30:15.628 --> 06:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
typically held 15 to 30 days ahead of
 
06:30:18.390 --> 06:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
the vote second it's also important to
 
06:30:21.150 --> 06:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that many voters cannot
 
06:30:23.590 --> 06:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
attend a meeting
 
06:30:28.910 --> 06:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
practically to um vote to adopt SP2
 
06:30:30.830 --> 06:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
these meetings are typically held during
 
06:30:34.190 --> 06:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
the week in the evenings in March of
 
06:30:37.350 --> 06:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
Times March has inclement weather it's a
 
06:30:40.388 --> 06:30:40.398 align:start position:0%
s significant challenge for many voters
 
06:30:43.070 --> 06:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
um that are elderly or disabled to be
 
06:30:45.070 --> 06:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
able to get to the meeting location and
 
06:30:48.830 --> 06:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
participate in an often lengthy meeting
 
06:30:51.230 --> 06:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
that sometimes runs late into the night
 
06:30:54.230 --> 06:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
and in some cases they they occur over
 
06:30:57.430 --> 06:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
many days some voters also have health
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
concerns and they cannot risk being in a
 
06:31:02.628 --> 06:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
large gathering at a traditional town
 
06:31:05.628 --> 06:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
meeting other voters have second shift
 
06:31:07.990 --> 06:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
overtime and even weekend work
 
06:31:10.110 --> 06:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
commitments if these um traditional
 
06:31:12.910 --> 06:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
meetings are held on the weekend and
 
06:31:15.110 --> 06:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
that this conflicts with their um
 
06:31:17.190 --> 06:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
ability to attend these the traditional
 
06:31:19.670 --> 06:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
meeting still others are out of town on
 
06:31:22.190 --> 06:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
travel for work military service away
 
06:31:24.948 --> 06:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
from home or they might be snowbirds who
 
06:31:27.628 --> 06:31:27.638 align:start position:0%
reside out of state all of these voters
 
06:31:31.388 --> 06:31:31.398 align:start position:0%
are disenfranchised and they want SP2
 
06:31:34.468 --> 06:31:34.478 align:start position:0%
because it enables their voices to heard
 
06:31:37.708 --> 06:31:37.718 align:start position:0%
at The Ballot Box I find it ironic that
 
06:31:39.868 --> 06:31:39.878 align:start position:0%
these citizens cannot make it to the tra
 
06:31:43.030 --> 06:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting to vote to adopt SP2
 
06:31:45.030 --> 06:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
which is exactly the meeting system that
 
06:31:46.750 --> 06:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
would eliminate their
 
06:31:49.310 --> 06:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement third adopting s SP2
 
06:31:50.788 --> 06:31:50.798 align:start position:0%
is a serious
 
06:31:53.510 --> 06:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
proposition many more voters cast
 
06:31:56.350 --> 06:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
ballots on Election Day than are able to
 
06:31:59.628 --> 06:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
attend a traditional meeting I contend
 
06:32:02.190 --> 06:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
that by placing the question to adopt
 
06:32:05.150 --> 06:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
SP2 back on to the official ballot this
 
06:32:07.310 --> 06:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
provides better representation of the
 
06:32:09.948 --> 06:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
will of the people in the town or the
 
06:32:13.388 --> 06:32:13.398 align:start position:0%
school district and fourth with at least
 
06:32:16.868 --> 06:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
44 warrant articles to adopt sb2 since
 
06:32:20.388 --> 06:32:20.398 align:start position:0%
the 2019 change there is significant
 
06:32:23.708 --> 06:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
interest by voters to adopt sb2 it's
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
clear that the current method of sb2 SP2
 
06:32:29.350 --> 06:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
adoption at the traditional meeting is
 
06:32:32.990 --> 06:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
truly not fair to disenfranchise voters
 
06:32:34.670 --> 06:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
therefore I feel that it's just common
 
06:32:37.750 --> 06:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
sense to return the original method to
 
06:32:40.708 --> 06:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
adopt SP2 that had been in place for
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
nearly 25 years before the change in
 
06:32:46.830 --> 06:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
2019 in conclusion by restoring the
 
06:32:49.510 --> 06:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
question to adopt SP2 back onto the
 
06:32:52.468 --> 06:32:52.478 align:start position:0%
official ballot this bill eliminates
 
06:32:55.510 --> 06:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
voter disenfranchisement and adopting
 
06:32:58.948 --> 06:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
sb2 this bill enables greater vot of
 
06:33:01.190 --> 06:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
participation which better represents
 
06:33:03.830 --> 06:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
the will of the people and this bill
 
06:33:06.910 --> 06:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
restores Equitable standards to adopt
 
06:33:09.590 --> 06:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
SP2 as well as to resend it I
 
06:33:11.830 --> 06:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that this committee
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
please recommend a to pass on HB 1175 to
 
06:33:19.948 --> 06:33:19.958 align:start position:0%
restore the method to adopt SP2 as it
 
06:33:23.150 --> 06:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
was for nearly a quarter of a century
 
06:33:25.388 --> 06:33:25.398 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'll answer
 
06:33:25.398 --> 06:33:26.230 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'll answer
any

06:33:26.230 --> 06:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:33:28.030 --> 06:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
06:33:28.040 --> 06:33:29.350 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
representative

06:33:29.350 --> 06:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:33:32.830 --> 06:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:33:36.548 --> 06:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
for bringing is forward representative
 
06:33:40.230 --> 06:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the first sentence it says
 
06:33:43.110 --> 06:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
shall sub Vision shall place the
 
06:33:45.868 --> 06:33:45.878 align:start position:0%
question on the warrant that means
 
06:33:48.750 --> 06:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they Senate Bill two
 
06:33:52.468 --> 06:33:52.478 align:start position:0%
communities presently they still have to
 
06:33:56.110 --> 06:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
put it on the warrant and won't that be
 
06:34:00.150 --> 06:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
confusing thank you um representative so
 
06:34:02.430 --> 06:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
the language that you're referring to on
 
06:34:05.468 --> 06:34:05.478 align:start position:0%
line three that is is current um
 
06:34:08.150 --> 06:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
currently in law that's not what this
 
06:34:10.830 --> 06:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
bill is doing that's the bill is not
 
06:34:14.990 --> 06:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
changing that so if uh follow up Mr so
 
06:34:18.590 --> 06:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
if I'm a Senate bill to community I
 
06:34:20.270 --> 06:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything is that
 
06:34:20.280 --> 06:34:22.990 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything is that
correct

06:34:22.990 --> 06:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:34:25.070 --> 06:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
06:34:27.990 --> 06:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you for taking my question and
 
06:34:31.350 --> 06:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here uh what was the
 
06:34:34.388 --> 06:34:34.398 align:start position:0%
reasoning back in 2019
 
06:34:38.190 --> 06:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
to revert back to the town meetings for
 
06:34:40.670 --> 06:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh those communities that were wishing
 
06:34:40.680 --> 06:34:41.590 align:start position:0%
uh those communities that were wishing
to

06:34:41.590 --> 06:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:34:41.600 --> 06:34:43.190 align:start position:0%
to
become

06:34:43.190 --> 06:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
become
 
06:34:45.150 --> 06:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
SP2 thank you for the question
 
06:34:48.548 --> 06:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
representative um you would have to
 
06:34:53.150 --> 06:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
pull um the the people um as to what the
 
06:34:53.160 --> 06:34:54.350 align:start position:0%
pull um the the people um as to what the
rationale

06:34:54.350 --> 06:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
06:34:59.030 --> 06:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
was um a possible explanation would be
 
06:35:01.590 --> 06:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
that people may have been concerned that
 
06:35:04.788 --> 06:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
people didn't know what were voting on
 
06:35:06.788 --> 06:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
when it appeared on the official ballot
 
06:35:10.150 --> 06:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
and as I pointed out per RSA hearings
 
06:35:10.160 --> 06:35:11.468 align:start position:0%
and as I pointed out per RSA hearings
are

06:35:11.468 --> 06:35:11.478 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:35:14.510 --> 06:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
required whenever SP2 appears on the
 
06:35:16.910 --> 06:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
warrant and in the case of a like for
 
06:35:18.510 --> 06:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
example a school district where there's
 
06:35:21.990 --> 06:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
more than one town that's part of that
 
06:35:24.070 --> 06:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
school district hearings must be held in
 
06:35:27.590 --> 06:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
each town and I would further say that
 
06:35:31.110 --> 06:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
um that there are public hear
 
06:35:34.548 --> 06:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
well there are other opportunities for
 
06:35:36.468 --> 06:35:36.478 align:start position:0%
people to get information with regards
 
06:35:39.708 --> 06:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
to SP2 there's you know a town meeting
 
06:35:40.628 --> 06:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
like a
 
06:35:43.430 --> 06:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
regular town meeting of the select board
 
06:35:45.750 --> 06:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
that issue might come up as I said there
 
06:35:47.990 --> 06:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
was there's required
 
06:35:50.830 --> 06:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
hearings there's
 
06:35:53.548 --> 06:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
um also you know people there's
 
06:35:56.590 --> 06:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
information that different information
 
06:35:58.388 --> 06:35:58.398 align:start position:0%
sessions that that I know are held in
 
06:36:01.230 --> 06:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
different towns there's voters guides um
 
06:36:03.868 --> 06:36:03.878 align:start position:0%
there's there's many opportunities to
 
06:36:06.468 --> 06:36:06.478 align:start position:0%
understand what sb2 is and I would
 
06:36:09.548 --> 06:36:09.558 align:start position:0%
further say that we have um zoning
 
06:36:13.230 --> 06:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances that appear on warrants
 
06:36:15.830 --> 06:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
and people
 
06:36:18.750 --> 06:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
vote I meant they're on the warrants and
 
06:36:22.270 --> 06:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
they are voted on the official ballot so
 
06:36:25.750 --> 06:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:28.310 --> 06:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
different representative yella
 
06:36:30.310 --> 06:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative Guri could you flick off
 
06:36:33.750 --> 06:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
your mic there thank you
 
06:36:37.150 --> 06:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for
 
06:36:42.910 --> 06:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh your bringing this bill forward um
 
06:36:47.270 --> 06:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
have you reached out to any of the
 
06:36:50.310 --> 06:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
groups like the veterans that have been
 
06:36:55.270 --> 06:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised by this law change and
 
06:37:01.230 --> 06:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
um and see if there is an appetite for a
 
06:37:04.310 --> 06:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against the the
 
06:37:08.590 --> 06:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
uh the state for disenfranchising them
 
06:37:10.430 --> 06:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
as far as like they used to be able to
 
06:37:13.150 --> 06:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
vote on this and now they're not able to
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
vote on it um that are dep deployed have
 
06:37:19.030 --> 06:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
you have you reached out to them
 
06:37:22.510 --> 06:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
regarding the that issue thank you for
 
06:37:24.190 --> 06:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
the question Representative no I have
 
06:37:27.310 --> 06:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
not reached out to um veterans groups in
 
06:37:29.788 --> 06:37:29.798 align:start position:0%
the state with regards to this law
 
06:37:32.750 --> 06:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
change however as I said the reason why
 
06:37:35.070 --> 06:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
I filed this bill is because I there's a
 
06:37:38.230 --> 06:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
number of constituents that
 
06:37:41.590 --> 06:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
that have asked me to to file this
 
06:37:44.190 --> 06:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
because of the change that occurred in
 
06:37:48.110 --> 06:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
2019 and I gave this the data as to when
 
06:37:51.350 --> 06:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
this change was made since it's been
 
06:37:54.468 --> 06:37:54.478 align:start position:0%
made only one
 
06:37:58.868 --> 06:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
um warrant to adopt s SP2 has
 
06:38:02.788 --> 06:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
succeeded and uh additionally I am part
 
06:38:07.070 --> 06:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
of a CO op school district and there
 
06:38:09.388 --> 06:38:09.398 align:start position:0%

06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
district and there is the prime the the
 
06:38:20.868 --> 06:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner is a disabled
 
06:38:23.548 --> 06:38:23.558 align:start position:0%
veteran and unfortunately he will be
 
06:38:26.830 --> 06:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
unable to attend the the meeting the
 
06:38:29.430 --> 06:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
traditional annual meeting of the school
 
06:38:32.388 --> 06:38:32.398 align:start position:0%
district to vote on this because of his
 
06:38:35.310 --> 06:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
disability and and the the prescriptions
 
06:38:39.230 --> 06:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
that he's on will prohibit him from even
 
06:38:45.230 --> 06:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:50.030 --> 06:38:50.040 align:start position:0%

06:38:57.638 --> 06:38:59.708 align:start position:0%
questions
um

06:38:59.708 --> 06:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
as as moderator of an SP2 town
 
06:39:06.070 --> 06:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
and have been for over 10
 
06:39:06.080 --> 06:39:07.788 align:start position:0%
and have been for over 10
years

06:39:07.788 --> 06:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:39:14.670 --> 06:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
and the the town voted to adopt the SP2
 
06:39:16.350 --> 06:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
form of
 
06:39:19.910 --> 06:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
government long before I was right after
 
06:39:22.990 --> 06:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
it came out you said 19 was it that it
 
06:39:23.000 --> 06:39:23.868 align:start position:0%
it came out you said 19 was it that it
was

06:39:23.868 --> 06:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:39:28.788 --> 06:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
started um several years we've had it's
 
06:39:30.590 --> 06:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
been on the I don't know there's a
 
06:39:35.230 --> 06:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
question here somewhere um
 
06:39:38.110 --> 06:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
we've had petition articles put on to do
 
06:39:39.788 --> 06:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
away with
 
06:39:42.910 --> 06:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
it they finally gave up because they got
 
06:39:45.430 --> 06:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere absolutely
 
06:39:48.430 --> 06:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere uh my question
 
06:39:52.830 --> 06:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
is what's your experience with
 
06:39:55.708 --> 06:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
06:39:58.070 --> 06:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
SP2 form of
 
06:40:01.948 --> 06:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
government and
 
06:40:05.788 --> 06:40:05.798 align:start position:0%
um who pushing to to have it
 
06:40:07.750 --> 06:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
changed thank you for the question
 
06:40:10.750 --> 06:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative um this bill does not
 
06:40:13.350 --> 06:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
address the SP SP2 form of government
 
06:40:17.430 --> 06:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
per se um I'm not here to speak for or
 
06:40:18.670 --> 06:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
against SP
 
06:40:22.270 --> 06:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
SP2 what this bill does is it changes um
 
06:40:25.070 --> 06:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
the method to adopt
 
06:40:30.190 --> 06:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
sb2 like I said when when in 1995
 
06:40:35.750 --> 06:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:39.830 --> 06:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
to enable SP2 T form of of
 
06:40:43.230 --> 06:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
meeting that the question to adopt the
 
06:40:45.510 --> 06:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislature like I said in its in its
 
06:40:48.468 --> 06:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
wisdom place the question to adopt on
 
06:40:50.430 --> 06:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
the official
 
06:40:53.190 --> 06:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
ballot and then in
 
06:41:01.230 --> 06:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:04.830 --> 06:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
that forther questions
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
I see none thank representative Guth Ju
 
06:41:11.548 --> 06:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
Just to follow up I'm I'm still confused
 
06:41:14.628 --> 06:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
because as I said I'm a sen I'm I'm on a
 
06:41:17.030 --> 06:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
Senate bill to
 
06:41:20.070 --> 06:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
town and I think when you I asked you
 
06:41:22.350 --> 06:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
said I didn't have to do anything and I
 
06:41:25.750 --> 06:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
would continue as a Senate bill to
 
06:41:28.030 --> 06:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
town isn't that great thank you for the
 
06:41:30.590 --> 06:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
question representative SP SP2 is
 
06:41:33.270 --> 06:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation this is this is SP
 
06:41:36.350 --> 06:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
2 is not a mandate it's it's optional if
 
06:41:40.110 --> 06:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
if towns want to put this on towns or
 
06:41:42.030 --> 06:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
school districts want to put this on
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
their warrant they can and
 
06:41:46.948 --> 06:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
furthermore the
 
06:41:46.958 --> 06:41:48.590 align:start position:0%
furthermore the
legislature

06:41:48.590 --> 06:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
06:41:48.600 --> 06:41:50.670 align:start position:0%
legislature
has

06:41:50.670 --> 06:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:41:54.750 --> 06:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
passed a law that allows citizens to
 
06:41:58.430 --> 06:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
also by petition warrant article put SP
 
06:42:01.948 --> 06:42:01.958 align:start position:0%
SP2 onto the warrant so the governing
 
06:42:04.270 --> 06:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
body could choose to do that or
 
06:42:07.708 --> 06:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
petitioners can so I know my qu my
 
06:42:10.948 --> 06:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
question isn't my question isn't clear
 
06:42:13.350 --> 06:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
and I I understand I I'm a Senate Bill
 
06:42:16.830 --> 06:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
too so if this bill passes I don't have
 
06:42:19.830 --> 06:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
to do anything that is correct if I'm a
 
06:42:25.510 --> 06:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill two and I choose to put this
 
06:42:29.310 --> 06:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
article forward in a warrant
 
06:42:31.310 --> 06:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
article and
 
06:42:34.230 --> 06:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
it passes
 
06:42:36.830 --> 06:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't pass where am
 
06:42:40.430 --> 06:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
I if if if a town or School District
 
06:42:43.788 --> 06:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
currently has sb2 if they've adopted it
 
06:42:46.270 --> 06:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
they have SP2 there's no need
 
06:42:49.150 --> 06:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
to ad it again say somebody wants to
 
06:42:52.190 --> 06:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
based on this bill I'm I'm confused if
 
06:42:55.070 --> 06:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
you want to resend it nothing I want to
 
06:42:56.750 --> 06:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
put it on a ballot so if you already
 
06:42:59.150 --> 06:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:43:02.230 --> 06:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
so it's probably better when we EXA this
 
06:43:04.510 --> 06:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chairman sorry that would be
 
06:43:07.230 --> 06:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
good we try not to have uh conversations
 
06:43:10.110 --> 06:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
here the represent I can talk about it
 
06:43:12.430 --> 06:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
at that time thank you thank you all
 
06:43:13.750 --> 06:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
right further
 
06:43:16.548 --> 06:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
questions I
 
06:43:19.590 --> 06:43:19.600 align:start position:0%

passed by an overwhelming
[Music]

06:43:40.670 --> 06:43:40.680 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
06:44:05.388 --> 06:44:05.398 align:start position:0%
thank you for representative power I
 
06:44:07.468 --> 06:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
have one more pin card Katherine Heck
 
06:44:07.478 --> 06:44:20.230 align:start position:0%
have one more pin card Katherine Heck
from

06:44:20.230 --> 06:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:22.190 --> 06:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
nhma good afternoon members of the
 
06:44:23.788 --> 06:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chairman for the record my
 
06:44:25.388 --> 06:44:25.398 align:start position:0%
name is Katherine heck and I represent
 
06:44:27.388 --> 06:44:27.398 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
06:44:30.270 --> 06:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
and we are here to oppose um House Bill
 
06:44:33.190 --> 06:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
1175 so for the record or opposition has
 
06:44:35.110 --> 06:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the sb2 form of
 
06:44:37.350 --> 06:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
government um just as a sponsored said
 
06:44:39.548 --> 06:44:39.558 align:start position:0%
but rather the procedure a town would
 
06:44:42.388 --> 06:44:42.398 align:start position:0%
follow to adopt this significant change
 
06:44:44.990 --> 06:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
in how a government would operate so
 
06:44:46.868 --> 06:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
while the prior law which this bill
 
06:44:49.110 --> 06:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
seeks to restore did require a public
 
06:44:51.750 --> 06:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on the question to be held 15 to
 
06:44:54.510 --> 06:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
30 days before the vote we restore that
 
06:44:56.708 --> 06:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
experience has shown that very few
 
06:44:59.030 --> 06:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
people generally attend these hearings
 
06:45:01.110 --> 06:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's also important which was brought up
 
06:45:04.468 --> 06:45:04.478 align:start position:0%
that sb2 can be IED by 25 registered
 
06:45:06.110 --> 06:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
voters so it would show up on the
 
06:45:09.910 --> 06:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
petition so I want to go back prior to 2
 
06:45:13.910 --> 06:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
to law change so prior to 2018 for
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
example um persistent efforts by some
 
06:45:19.150 --> 06:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
Pro ballot supporters for example to
 
06:45:22.350 --> 06:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
pass sb2 in B they rejected it six times
 
06:45:25.670 --> 06:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
in BO prior to the law change so nothing
 
06:45:28.150 --> 06:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
to do with it Hinsdale also six
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful votes nine in sandton and
 
06:45:34.628 --> 06:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
15 in the town of Temple so prior to the
 
06:45:37.670 --> 06:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
law change um some of what precipitated
 
06:45:40.070 --> 06:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
the law change was that uh and there's
 
06:45:42.070 --> 06:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
testimony in the former record for
 
06:45:44.510 --> 06:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
example from the town of Temple to say
 
06:45:48.830 --> 06:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
that it would not allow the form of
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
government to be changed using the
 
06:45:52.270 --> 06:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
current form of government that they're
 
06:45:55.628 --> 06:45:55.638 align:start position:0%
experiencing so to change to sb2 in the
 
06:45:57.948 --> 06:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
prior law it would be put on the ballot
 
06:45:59.830 --> 06:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
so there would be you would still go to
 
06:46:01.150 --> 06:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
your town meeting but you would have
 
06:46:03.750 --> 06:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
already voted on that question um like
 
06:46:05.868 --> 06:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
you would do for your zoning ordinance
 
06:46:09.430 --> 06:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
and it was failing significantly because
 
06:46:11.310 --> 06:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
many people believe that maybe some
 
06:46:14.270 --> 06:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
attentive voters were able to um discern
 
06:46:16.548 --> 06:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
what a yes vote would mean but perhaps
 
06:46:18.310 --> 06:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
others did not feel that they had the
 
06:46:20.708 --> 06:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
time or the understanding to debate the
 
06:46:22.230 --> 06:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
question because they were used to the
 
06:46:24.030 --> 06:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
annual town meeting form of government
 
06:46:25.628 --> 06:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
where they would gain and Gardner a lot
 
06:46:29.708 --> 06:46:29.718 align:start position:0%
of their information from so essentially
 
06:46:31.628 --> 06:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
um without the ability to debate and
 
06:46:33.388 --> 06:46:33.398 align:start position:0%
deliberate the question the reason was
 
06:46:36.788 --> 06:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
that um the what what does a yes ballot
 
06:46:38.788 --> 06:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
vote mean and they were nervous so let's
 
06:46:40.948 --> 06:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
just talk about sb2 form of government
 
06:46:43.868 --> 06:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
for a moment to talk about voters and
 
06:46:45.590 --> 06:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
making sure no one feels
 
06:46:48.070 --> 06:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised SP2 form of government
 
06:46:50.510 --> 06:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
does require that you have public
 
06:46:52.388 --> 06:46:52.398 align:start position:0%
hearings that you have a deliberative
 
06:46:54.430 --> 06:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
session prior to your March vote so if
 
06:46:55.788 --> 06:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
you're worried about the weather for
 
06:46:57.430 --> 06:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
example you have to have a deliberative
 
06:46:59.708 --> 06:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
session in February at the deliberative
 
06:47:01.430 --> 06:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
session it's structured much like an
 
06:47:03.350 --> 06:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
annual town meeting we have a moderator
 
06:47:06.430 --> 06:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
here that can can speak to that so that
 
06:47:08.430 --> 06:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
is when the voters get to come out take
 
06:47:10.030 --> 06:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
the warrant that's developed by the
 
06:47:11.670 --> 06:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
governing body and or the budget
 
06:47:14.868 --> 06:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
committee and change line items zero
 
06:47:17.230 --> 06:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
them out amend warrant articles or do
 
06:47:18.628 --> 06:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
anything they would like to do so just
 
06:47:20.910 --> 06:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
because their sb2 form of government
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
they they really do still have this
 
06:47:24.468 --> 06:47:24.478 align:start position:0%
version of town meeting and what happens
 
06:47:26.590 --> 06:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
at the deliberative session then gets
 
06:47:30.468 --> 06:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
carried on to the ballot in March
 
06:47:33.230 --> 06:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
so I personally would not give give up
 
06:47:35.310 --> 06:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
my right to attend the deliberative
 
06:47:37.388 --> 06:47:37.398 align:start position:0%
session if I was concerned and wanted to
 
06:47:39.788 --> 06:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
debate and deliberate the budget so SP2
 
06:47:42.830 --> 06:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
does not only have a on shot bite at the
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
Apple in fact it has three bites at the
 
06:47:46.590 --> 06:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
Apple from the public hearing to the
 
06:47:50.670 --> 06:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
deliber session to the ballot vote so
 
06:47:54.070 --> 06:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
when we talk about important questions
 
06:47:56.510 --> 06:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
um most matters that have a
 
06:47:59.190 --> 06:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the town go before
 
06:48:01.910 --> 06:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
a traditional town meeting so again the
 
06:48:04.868 --> 06:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
change in 20 19 was precipitated by
 
06:48:07.350 --> 06:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
concerned towns and cities and voters
 
06:48:10.070 --> 06:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
who felt like being placed on the ballot
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
they did not have the information they
 
06:48:14.868 --> 06:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
needed in a new voting in a new form of
 
06:48:16.830 --> 06:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
government on an old form of government
 
06:48:18.910 --> 06:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
when we talk about resending the vote it
 
06:48:22.388 --> 06:48:22.398 align:start position:0%
would be impossible if adopted to resend
 
06:48:24.670 --> 06:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
um SP2 any other way besides a ballot
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
vote because they don't have a town
 
06:48:28.628 --> 06:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
meeting anymore to resend it so that
 
06:48:30.990 --> 06:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
that probably is not um something to be
 
06:48:33.350 --> 06:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
concerned um with
 
06:48:35.110 --> 06:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
um and we always hear from cities and
 
06:48:37.070 --> 06:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
towns and officials they're always
 
06:48:39.230 --> 06:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
looking for new tools and ways to
 
06:48:41.548 --> 06:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
further engage voters and and voter
 
06:48:44.830 --> 06:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
education so the adoption of sb2 is a
 
06:48:47.628 --> 06:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
huge decision um placing it on the
 
06:48:50.548 --> 06:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
ballot basically the language is shall
 
06:48:53.468 --> 06:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
we adopt the provisions of RSA 403 known
 
06:48:55.990 --> 06:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
as sb2 to allow official ballot voting
 
06:48:57.868 --> 06:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
on all issues before the town on the
 
06:49:00.110 --> 06:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
second Tuesday of March that is the
 
06:49:02.030 --> 06:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
question you're voting on this does not
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
describe or communicate to the voters
 
06:49:06.070 --> 06:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
the nuances of a deliberative session
 
06:49:07.468 --> 06:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
that doesn't answer questions what the
 
06:49:09.070 --> 06:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
default budget is which we hear a lot
 
06:49:11.030 --> 06:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
about how the default budget Works how
 
06:49:13.628 --> 06:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
it's calculated so or what happens if
 
06:49:16.468 --> 06:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
the vote the budget is voted down so by
 
06:49:18.030 --> 06:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
going back to the traditional town
 
06:49:19.830 --> 06:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
meeting bringing this information
 
06:49:21.670 --> 06:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
forward and letting the current form of
 
06:49:24.150 --> 06:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
government decide if it wants to change
 
06:49:26.590 --> 06:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
the form of government um actually has
 
06:49:29.590 --> 06:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
resulted in in several communities
 
06:49:31.670 --> 06:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
adopting the sb2 form of government
 
06:49:34.350 --> 06:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
since the 20 9 law change but as you can
 
06:49:36.468 --> 06:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
see from just several towns there was
 
06:49:38.948 --> 06:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
significant towns rejecting it prior to
 
06:49:41.230 --> 06:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
the law change as well so I'm not sure
 
06:49:44.030 --> 06:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
that that is signific you know will make
 
06:49:46.350 --> 06:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
a significant difference I do also want
 
06:49:49.070 --> 06:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
to point out in 2019 the house Municipal
 
06:49:50.070 --> 06:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
and County government committee
 
06:49:53.230 --> 06:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
recommended the bill 18 to1 to pass the
 
06:49:56.670 --> 06:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
house voted on division 235 to 1222 to
 
06:50:00.030 --> 06:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
pass and it was unanimously um approved
 
06:50:02.190 --> 06:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
by the senate committee and approved by
 
06:50:04.190 --> 06:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
the Senate on a Voice vote so it had
 
06:50:06.868 --> 06:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support so that basically
 
06:50:09.670 --> 06:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
this is really about the voters having
 
06:50:11.990 --> 06:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to decide in their current
 
06:50:13.670 --> 06:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
form of government if they want to
 
06:50:16.510 --> 06:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
change to another form of government um
 
06:50:19.070 --> 06:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
in essence so I will leave it with that
 
06:50:22.230 --> 06:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
I certainly have the record um from 2019
 
06:50:25.150 --> 06:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
um so we just would like the town
 
06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
meeting to remain the same and if they
 
06:50:29.270 --> 06:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
choose to change they do it that the
 
06:50:30.830 --> 06:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
decision is made in the same manner in
 
06:50:32.310 --> 06:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
which they're currently operating in
 
06:50:32.320 --> 06:50:33.510 align:start position:0%
which they're currently operating in
government

06:50:33.510 --> 06:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:50:36.670 --> 06:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's critical for the voter
 
06:50:38.548 --> 06:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
essentially so I'll take any questions
 
06:50:40.230 --> 06:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
if you have any and I know it's very
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
late representative
 
06:50:49.388 --> 06:50:49.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:53.548 --> 06:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
question the in my my
 
06:50:56.948 --> 06:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
municipality um our
 
06:51:01.388 --> 06:51:01.398 align:start position:0%
sb2 was adopted after multiple
 
06:51:06.030 --> 06:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
votes um in multiple years of of voting
 
06:51:11.948 --> 06:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
on the subject and um so I'm a little
 
06:51:15.868 --> 06:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
bit confused as far as your and and you
 
06:51:17.350 --> 06:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
and in your testimony you said that
 
06:51:19.548 --> 06:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
happened in multiple municipalities and
 
06:51:23.708 --> 06:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little confused as to how
 
06:51:26.628 --> 06:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
you are squaring the circle that the
 
06:51:28.830 --> 06:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
municip those people that are voting on
 
06:51:31.110 --> 06:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
it maybe the verse first time they vote
 
06:51:33.430 --> 06:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
on it they might be
 
06:51:39.270 --> 06:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
wary of it and vote no but as they hear
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
more about it year after year more
 
06:51:45.030 --> 06:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
people are are convinced and think that
 
06:51:47.868 --> 06:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea and adopt it and so
 
06:51:51.310 --> 06:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
I don't you seem to be implying that
 
06:51:53.510 --> 06:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
those those people that are voting on it
 
06:51:57.910 --> 06:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
are uneducated but then often it's
 
06:51:59.670 --> 06:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
actually takes multiple years for it to
 
06:52:01.388 --> 06:52:01.398 align:start position:0%
pass and so those people that are voting
 
06:52:05.230 --> 06:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
on it are very educ ated on what that
 
06:52:08.830 --> 06:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
that uh Pro that question on the ballot
 
06:52:14.388 --> 06:52:14.398 align:start position:0%
is and so is that really uh the the
 
06:52:16.990 --> 06:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
education of the voters really the main
 
06:52:21.510 --> 06:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
concern um as far as the opposition or
 
06:52:25.628 --> 06:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
is it just um the the town meetings want
 
06:52:27.868 --> 06:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
to they you know want to be able to peer
 
06:52:30.190 --> 06:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
pressure those people voting against it
 
06:52:32.910 --> 06:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
in in by seeing their face and see who's
 
06:52:35.430 --> 06:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
opposing it and who's is so thank thank
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
you for your question I think I was just
 
06:52:39.070 --> 06:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
trying to provide some examples to
 
06:52:41.910 --> 06:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
counter um the examples in support of
 
06:52:43.750 --> 06:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that were saying that towns
 
06:52:45.708 --> 06:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't pass it under the law change my
 
06:52:48.030 --> 06:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
point was towns couldn't pass it prior
 
06:52:50.110 --> 06:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
to the law change if that's the will of
 
06:52:52.270 --> 06:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
the voter I would never insinuate voters
 
06:52:54.030 --> 06:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
are uneducated or don't want to become
 
06:52:56.150 --> 06:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
educated or that when they come back
 
06:52:58.708 --> 06:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
year over-year um you know they they're
 
06:53:01.388 --> 06:53:01.398 align:start position:0%
not more familiar with the topic um
 
06:53:03.948 --> 06:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
however when you go to the polls it's
 
06:53:05.830 --> 06:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
really just one sentence that you're
 
06:53:07.910 --> 06:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're voting on um and we do you know
 
06:53:09.468 --> 06:53:09.478 align:start position:0%
know that new people move in and out of
 
06:53:11.548 --> 06:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
town and and that changes but certainly
 
06:53:14.310 --> 06:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's really about the town I did want to
 
06:53:18.948 --> 06:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
bring up that under the current law they
 
06:53:22.788 --> 06:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
have to the 2019 law change it has to be
 
06:53:24.590 --> 06:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
done at secret ballot at the town
 
06:53:27.150 --> 06:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
meeting so your neighbors cannot
 
06:53:28.590 --> 06:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
pressure you if this is a form of
 
06:53:29.830 --> 06:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
government that you would like the
 
06:53:32.590 --> 06:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
current law allows everybody to have the
 
06:53:34.990 --> 06:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
right to vote privately much like the
 
06:53:36.910 --> 06:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
old ballot version where you go in the
 
06:53:39.030 --> 06:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
booth you'd have you go up to The Ballot
 
06:53:40.868 --> 06:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
Box and you place your card in so you
 
06:53:42.868 --> 06:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
would not receive that pressure at your
 
06:53:44.910 --> 06:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
your town meeting with your neighbors
 
06:53:46.230 --> 06:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
because certainly that would be a
 
06:53:48.070 --> 06:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
concern with a form of government change
 
06:53:51.750 --> 06:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
so that's already in the current the
 
06:53:56.110 --> 06:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
law you have a followup yeah um one of
 
06:53:59.708 --> 06:53:59.718 align:start position:0%
those towns that just recently um tried
 
06:54:01.910 --> 06:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
to do this was a town in my district
 
06:54:04.590 --> 06:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
where they had essentially a
 
06:54:04.600 --> 06:54:06.350 align:start position:0%
where they had essentially a
9-hour

06:54:06.350 --> 06:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
9-hour
 
06:54:12.548 --> 06:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
uh um town meeting um and the
 
06:54:15.948 --> 06:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
people advocating for and saying that
 
06:54:18.468 --> 06:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea or why it's a good
 
06:54:22.590 --> 06:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
idea or why it's not actually they have
 
06:54:24.628 --> 06:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
to get up in front of everyone and speak
 
06:54:29.190 --> 06:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
about it and so that is the opportunity
 
06:54:31.990 --> 06:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
they do know who is who is opposing it
 
06:54:35.468 --> 06:54:35.478 align:start position:0%
and who is is is supporting it and
 
06:54:37.310 --> 06:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually it was a selectman in this case
 
06:54:39.910 --> 06:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
that that put it on the ballot um and so
 
06:54:41.708 --> 06:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of hostility because of
 
06:54:43.628 --> 06:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
the people that are on currently
 
06:54:45.070 --> 06:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
controlling the
 
06:54:49.070 --> 06:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
selectman being uh trying to like there
 
06:54:51.910 --> 06:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
was some skepticism just because of that
 
06:54:54.468 --> 06:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
and so representative could you get to a
 
06:54:58.510 --> 06:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
question those those there was a lot
 
06:55:01.990 --> 06:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
would you uh would you be surprised to
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
find out that the the people that were
 
06:55:06.868 --> 06:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
putting it Forward were actually created
 
06:55:09.670 --> 06:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
more hostility towards the the thing
 
06:55:13.910 --> 06:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
than the actual language of SP2 I would
 
06:55:15.670 --> 06:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
imagine the same scenario would occur at
 
06:55:19.590 --> 06:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
a public hearing which is required in
 
06:55:21.270 --> 06:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
both versions of this bill whichever one
 
06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
you're considering both require a public
 
06:55:25.230 --> 06:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
Hearing in that same scenario of
 
06:55:26.990 --> 06:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
everyone having to speak publicly
 
06:55:28.830 --> 06:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
Express their
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
concerns show their positions whichever
 
06:55:34.110 --> 06:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
they might be would be occurring at at
 
06:55:36.910 --> 06:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing as well of course if
 
06:55:39.468 --> 06:55:39.478 align:start position:0%
it's petitioned the 25 voter signatures
 
06:55:41.750 --> 06:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
are available for anyone to consider and
 
06:55:43.270 --> 06:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
if it's brought forward by the governing
 
06:55:45.948 --> 06:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
body it's very clear who who would like
 
06:55:47.750 --> 06:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
to see that that move forward so I think
 
06:55:49.948 --> 06:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and the town meeting
 
06:55:52.830 --> 06:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
would be as far as how the public views
 
06:55:54.788 --> 06:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
it or the debate that occurs would be
 
06:55:57.708 --> 06:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
very similar okay thank you thank you
 
06:55:57.718 --> 06:56:00.510 align:start position:0%
very similar okay thank you thank you
further

06:56:00.510 --> 06:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:02.468 --> 06:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
 
06:56:04.150 --> 06:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
hanging around till the very end we
 
06:56:07.190 --> 06:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony seeing no more
 
06:56:09.190 --> 06:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
questions I will go ahead and close the
 
06:56:11.788 --> 06:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 1175 I'd also like to
 
06:56:13.388 --> 06:56:13.398 align:start position:0%
thank all the members of the committee
 
06:56:16.190 --> 06:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
who stuck around to the end very good so
 
06:56:31.230 --> 06:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
